Autoubiquitination of the Hrd1 Ligase Triggers Protein Retrotranslocation in ERAD.,"Misfolded proteins of the ER are retrotranslocated to the cytosol, where they are polyubiquitinated, extracted from the membrane, and degraded by the proteasome. To investigate how the ER-associated Degradation (ERAD) machinery can accomplish retrotranslocation of a misfolded luminal protein domain across a lipid bilayer, we have reconstituted retrotranslocation with purified S. cerevisiae proteins, using proteoliposomes containing the multi-spanning ubiquitin ligase Hrd1. Retrotranslocation of the luminal domain of a membrane-spanning substrate is triggered by autoubiquitination of Hrd1. Substrate ubiquitination is a subsequent event, and the Cdc48 ATPase that completes substrate extraction from the membrane is not required for retrotranslocation. Ubiquitination of lysines in Hrd1's RING-finger domain is required for substrate retrotranslocation in vitro and for ERAD in vivo. Our results suggest that Hrd1 forms a ubiquitin-gated protein-conducting channel.",1
Origins of Allostery and Evolvability in Proteins: A Case Study.,"Proteins display the capacity for adaptation to new functions, a property critical for evolvability. But what structural principles underlie the capacity for adaptation? Here, we show that adaptation to a physiologically distinct class of ligand specificity in a PSD95, DLG1, ZO-1 (PDZ) domain preferentially occurs through class-bridging intermediate mutations located distant from the ligand-binding site. These mutations provide a functional link between ligand classes and demonstrate the principle of ""conditional neutrality"" in mediating evolutionary adaptation. Structures show that class-bridging mutations work allosterically to open up conformational plasticity at the active site, permitting novel functions while retaining existing function. More generally, the class-bridging phenotype arises from mutations in an evolutionarily conserved network of coevolving amino acids in the PDZ family (the sector) that connects the active site to distant surface sites. These findings introduce the concept that allostery in proteins could have its origins not in protein function but in the capacity to adapt.",1
SnapShot: Mechanosensing Matrix.,"Cells sense and respond to properties of their microenvironment that can affect cell morphology, protein levels and localization, gene expression, and even nuclear integrity. Tissue micro-stiffness, largely influenced by extracellular matrix, varies dramatically within an organism and can be a useful parameter to both clarify and organize a wide range of cell and molecular processes, such as genomic changes in cancer.",1
Microbial Reconstitution Reverses Maternal Diet-Induced Social and Synaptic Deficits in Offspring.,"Maternal obesity during pregnancy has been associated with increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), in offspring. Here, we report that maternal high-fat diet (MHFD) induces a shift in microbial ecology that negatively impacts offspring social behavior. Social deficits and gut microbiota dysbiosis in MHFD offspring are prevented by co-housing with offspring of mothers on a regular diet (MRD) and transferable to germ-free mice. In addition, social interaction induces synaptic potentiation (LTP) in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of MRD, but not MHFD offspring. Moreover, MHFD offspring had fewer oxytocin immunoreactive neurons in the hypothalamus. Using metagenomics and precision microbiota reconstitution, we identified a single commensal strain that corrects oxytocin levels, LTP, and social deficits in MHFD offspring. Our findings causally link maternal diet, gut microbial imbalance, VTA plasticity, and behavior and suggest that probiotic treatment may relieve specific behavioral abnormalities associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",1
Near-Perfect Synaptic Integration by Nav1.7 in Hypothalamic Neurons Regulates Body Weight.,"Neurons are well suited for computations on millisecond timescales, but some neuronal circuits set behavioral states over long time periods, such as those involved in energy homeostasis. We found that multiple types of hypothalamic neurons, including those that oppositely regulate body weight, are specialized as near-perfect synaptic integrators that summate inputs over extended timescales. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) are greatly prolonged, outlasting the neuronal membrane time-constant up to 10-fold. This is due to the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7 (Scn9a), previously associated with pain-sensation but not synaptic integration. Scn9a deletion in AGRP, POMC, or paraventricular hypothalamic neurons reduced EPSP duration, synaptic integration, and altered body weight in mice. In vivo whole-cell recordings in the hypothalamus confirmed near-perfect synaptic integration. These experiments show that integration of synaptic inputs over time by Nav1.7 is critical for body weight regulation and reveal a mechanism for synaptic control of circuits regulating long term homeostatic functions.",1
A Long Noncoding RNA lincRNA-EPS Acts as a Transcriptional Brake to Restrain Inflammation.,"Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression. Although lincRNAs are expressed in immune cells, their functions in immunity are largely unexplored. Here, we identify an immunoregulatory lincRNA, lincRNA-EPS, that is precisely regulated in macrophages to control the expression of immune response genes (IRGs). Transcriptome analysis of macrophages from lincRNA-EPS-deficient mice, combined with gain-of-function and rescue experiments, revealed a specific role for this lincRNA in restraining IRG expression. Consistently, lincRNA-EPS-deficient mice manifest enhanced inflammation and lethality following endotoxin challenge in vivo. lincRNA-EPS localizes at regulatory regions of IRGs to control nucleosome positioning and repress transcription. Further, lincRNA-EPS mediates these effects by interacting with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L via a CANACA motif located in its 3' end. Together, these findings identify lincRNA-EPS as a repressor of inflammatory responses, highlighting the importance of lincRNAs in the immune system.",1
The Extracellular Surface of the GLP-1 Receptor Is a Molecular Trigger for Biased Agonism.,"Ligand-directed signal bias offers opportunities for sculpting molecular events, with the promise of better, safer therapeutics. Critical to the exploitation of signal bias is an understanding of the molecular events coupling ligand binding to intracellular signaling. Activation of class B G protein-coupled receptors is driven by interaction of the peptide N terminus with the receptor core. To understand how this drives signaling, we have used advanced analytical methods that enable separation of effects on pathway-specific signaling from those that modify agonist affinity and mapped the functional consequence of receptor modification onto three-dimensional models of a receptor-ligand complex. This yields molecular insights into the initiation of receptor activation and the mechanistic basis for biased agonism. Our data reveal that peptide agonists can engage different elements of the receptor extracellular face to achieve effector coupling and biased signaling providing a foundation for rational design of biased agonists.",1
Engineered Bispecific Antibodies with Exquisite HIV-1-Neutralizing Activity.,"While the search for an efficacious HIV-1 vaccine remains elusive, emergence of a new generation of virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has re-ignited the field of passive immunization for HIV-1 prevention. However, the plasticity of HIV-1 demands additional improvements to these mAbs to better ensure their clinical utility. Here, we report engineered bispecific antibodies that are the most potent and broad HIV-neutralizing antibodies to date. One bispecific antibody, 10E8V2.0/iMab, neutralized 118 HIV-1 pseudotyped viruses tested with a mean 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.002 mug/mL. 10E8V2.0/iMab also potently neutralized 99% of viruses in a second panel of 200 HIV-1 isolates belonging to clade C, the dominant subtype accounting for approximately 50% of new infections worldwide. Importantly, 10E8V2.0/iMab reduced virus load substantially in HIV-1-infected humanized mice and also provided complete protection when administered prior to virus challenge. These bispecific antibodies hold promise as novel prophylactic and/or therapeutic agents in the fight against HIV-1.",1
Bispecific Anti-HIV-1 Antibodies with Enhanced Breadth and Potency.,"Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) suppress viremia in animal models of HIV-1 and humans. To achieve potent activity without the emergence of viral escape mutants, co-administration of different bNAbs is necessary to target distinct epitopes essential for viral fitness. Here, we report the development of bispecific anti-Env neutralizing antibodies (biNAbs) with potent activity. Synergistic activity of biNAbs was achieved by combining an engineered hinge domain of IgG3 to increase Fab domain flexibility necessary for hetero-bivalent binding to the Env trimer while retaining the functional properties of the IgG1-Fc. Compared to unmodified biNAbs, hinge domain variants exhibited substantially improved neutralization activity, with particular combinations showing evidence of synergistic neutralization potency in vitro and enhanced in vivo therapeutic activity in HIV-1-infected humanized mice. These findings suggest innovative strategies for generating biNAbs with enhanced neutralization breadth and potency, representing ideal candidate molecules for the control of HIV-1 infection.",1
The Molecular and Cellular Choreography of Appendage Regeneration.,"Recent advances in limb regeneration are revealing the molecular events that integrate growth control, cell fate programming, and positional information to yield the exquisite replacement of the amputated limb. Parallel progress in several invertebrate and vertebrate models has provided a broader context for understanding the mechanisms and the evolution of regeneration. Together, these discoveries provide a foundation for describing the principles underlying regeneration of complex, multi-tissue structures. As such these findings should provide a wealth of ideas for engineers seeking to reconstitute regeneration from constituent parts or to elicit full regeneration from partial regeneration events.",1
Modeling Development and Disease with Organoids.,"Recent advances in 3D culture technology allow embryonic and adult mammalian stem cells to exhibit their remarkable self-organizing properties, and the resulting organoids reflect key structural and functional properties of organs such as kidney, lung, gut, brain and retina. Organoid technology can therefore be used to model human organ development and various human pathologies 'in a dish."" Additionally, patient-derived organoids hold promise to predict drug response in a personalized fashion. Organoids open up new avenues for regenerative medicine and, in combination with editing technology, for gene therapy. The many potential applications of this technology are only beginning to be explored.",1
Stem Cells: A Renaissance in Human Biology Research.,"The understanding of human biology and how it relates to that of other species represents an ancient quest. Limited access to human material, particularly during early development, has restricted researchers to only scratching the surface of this inherently challenging subject. Recent technological innovations, such as single cell ""omics"" and human stem cell derivation, have now greatly accelerated our ability to gain insights into uniquely human biology. The opportunities afforded to delve molecularly into scarce material and to model human embryogenesis and pathophysiological processes are leading to new insights of human development and are changing our understanding of disease and choice of therapy options.",1
Catching the Brain in the Act.,"Understanding how genes within cells, and cells within circuits, function together to produce the extraordinary repertoire of animal behaviors is arguably one of the most challenging undertakings in neuroscience. Two papers in this issue move toward this goal via 3D imaging of active neurons across the entire mouse brain.",1
Slowly Building Excitement.,"While some neurons are tuned to integrate fast and precisely timed inputs, others set behavioral states on much slower timescales. In this issue of Cell, Branco et al. demonstrate that body weight is regulated by hypothalamic neurons using a highly effective form of slow synaptic integration, which is mediated by the voltage gated sodium channel Nav1.7.",1
Think You Know How Smell Works? Sniff Again.,"The sense of smell is mediated by GPCRs in the odorant receptor (OR) family. Greer et al. report a new family of odor detectors, MS4As, that have similar cellular localization and chemodetection ability as ORs but are not GPCRs and follow a strikingly different logic of odor coding at the periphery.",1
Colonic Crypts: Safe Haven from Microbial Products.,"The notion that the colon's deep crypt pockets provide a protected location that shields stem cells from potentially toxic substances is widely accepted. In this issue of Cell, Kaiko et al. reveal how a metabolite abundantly produced by the gut microbiota can inhibit stem cell proliferation but is blocked from doing so by crypt architecture.",1

Targeting Disease through Metabolism.,"The links between cellular and systemic metabolism and different pathologies, including cancer, are on the rise. Cell editor Lara Szewczak asked Doug Green, Ralph DeBerardinis, and Mark Febbraio about what the prospects are for being able to target metabolism therapeutically. An annotated excerpt of the conversation appears below, and the full conversation is available with the article online.",1
A BH3 Mimetic for Killing Cancer Cells.,"Venetoclax is a BH3 mimetic approved for treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Cancer cells are resistant to apoptosis but ""primed for death"" by elevated BCL-2, which binds to pro-apoptotic proteins and holds them in check. Venetoclax releases this antagonism and is the first approved drug to target a protein-protein interaction.",1
Breaking Out of the Academic Pipeline.,"For many graduate students, the academic path may not be the best fit, and with limited faculty positions available, many students are now looking to other career possibilities. University programs are helping students to explore and pursue alternative careers.",1
Discovery of an Active RAG Transposon Illuminates the Origins of V(D)J Recombination.,"Co-option of RAG1 and RAG2 for antigen receptor gene assembly by V(D)J recombination was a crucial event in the evolution of jawed vertebrate adaptive immunity. RAG1/2 are proposed to have arisen from a transposable element, but definitive evidence for this is lacking. Here, we report the discovery of ProtoRAG, a DNA transposon family from lancelets, the most basal extant chordates. A typical ProtoRAG is flanked by 5-bp target site duplications and a pair of terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) resembling V(D)J recombination signal sequences. Between the TIRs reside tail-to-tail-oriented, intron-containing RAG1-like and RAG2-like genes. We demonstrate that ProtoRAG was recently active in the lancelet germline and that the lancelet RAG1/2-like proteins can mediate TIR-dependent transposon excision, host DNA recombination, transposition, and low-efficiency TIR rejoining using reaction mechanisms similar to those used by vertebrate RAGs. We propose that ProtoRAG represents a molecular ""living fossil"" of the long-sought RAG transposon.",1
Enhancer Control of Transcriptional Bursting.,"Transcription is episodic, consisting of a series of discontinuous bursts. Using live-imaging methods and quantitative analysis, we examine transcriptional bursting in living Drosophila embryos. Different developmental enhancers positioned downstream of synthetic reporter genes produce transcriptional bursts with similar amplitudes and duration but generate very different bursting frequencies, with strong enhancers producing more bursts than weak enhancers. Insertion of an insulator reduces the number of bursts and the corresponding level of gene expression, suggesting that enhancer regulation of bursting frequency is a key parameter of gene control in development. We also show that linked reporter genes exhibit coordinated bursting profiles when regulated by a shared enhancer, challenging conventional models of enhancer-promoter looping.",1
Digestion of Chromatin in Apoptotic Cell Microparticles Prevents Autoimmunity.,"Antibodies to DNA and chromatin drive autoimmunity in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Null mutations and hypomorphic variants of the secreted deoxyribonuclease DNASE1L3 are linked to familial and sporadic SLE, respectively. We report that DNASE1L3-deficient mice rapidly develop autoantibodies to DNA and chromatin, followed by an SLE-like disease. Circulating DNASE1L3 is produced by dendritic cells and macrophages, and its levels inversely correlate with anti-DNA antibody response. DNASE1L3 is uniquely capable of digesting chromatin in microparticles released from apoptotic cells. Accordingly, DNASE1L3-deficient mice and human patients have elevated DNA levels in plasma, particularly in circulating microparticles. Murine and human autoantibody clones and serum antibodies from human SLE patients bind to DNASE1L3-sensitive chromatin on the surface of microparticles. Thus, extracellular microparticle-associated chromatin is a potential self-antigen normally digested by circulating DNASE1L3. The loss of this tolerance mechanism can contribute to SLE, and its restoration may represent a therapeutic opportunity in the disease.",1
Restricted Location of PSEN2/gamma-Secretase Determines Substrate Specificity and Generates an Intracellular Abeta Pool.,"gamma-Secretases are a family of intramembrane-cleaving proteases involved in various signaling pathways and diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cells co-express differing gamma-secretase complexes, including two homologous presenilins (PSENs). We examined the significance of this heterogeneity and identified a unique motif in PSEN2 that directs this gamma-secretase to late endosomes/lysosomes via a phosphorylation-dependent interaction with the AP-1 adaptor complex. Accordingly, PSEN2 selectively cleaves late endosomal/lysosomal localized substrates and generates the prominent pool of intracellular Abeta that contains longer Abeta; familial AD (FAD)-associated mutations in PSEN2 increased the levels of longer Abeta further. Moreover, a subset of FAD mutants in PSEN1, normally more broadly distributed in the cell, phenocopies PSEN2 and shifts its localization to late endosomes/lysosomes. Thus, localization of gamma-secretases determines substrate specificity, while FAD-causing mutations strongly enhance accumulation of aggregation-prone Abeta42 in intracellular acidic compartments. The findings reveal potentially important roles for specific intracellular, localized reactions contributing to AD pathogenesis.",1
Forces Driving Chaperone Action.,"It is still unclear what molecular forces drive chaperone-mediated protein folding. Here, we obtain a detailed mechanistic understanding of the forces that dictate the four key steps of chaperone-client interaction: initial binding, complex stabilization, folding, and release. Contrary to the common belief that chaperones recognize unfolding intermediates by their hydrophobic nature, we discover that the model chaperone Spy uses long-range electrostatic interactions to rapidly bind to its unfolded client protein Im7. Short-range hydrophobic interactions follow, which serve to stabilize the complex. Hydrophobic collapse of the client protein then drives its folding. By burying hydrophobic residues in its core, the client's affinity to Spy decreases, which causes client release. By allowing the client to fold itself, Spy circumvents the need for client-specific folding instructions. This mechanism might help explain how chaperones can facilitate the folding of various unrelated proteins.",1
Peripheral Mechanosensory Neuron Dysfunction Underlies Tactile and Behavioral Deficits in Mouse Models of ASDs.,"Patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) commonly experience aberrant tactile sensitivity, yet the neural alterations underlying somatosensory dysfunction and the extent to which tactile deficits contribute to ASD characteristics are unknown. We report that mice harboring mutations in Mecp2, Gabrb3, Shank3, and Fmr1 genes associated with ASDs in humans exhibit altered tactile discrimination and hypersensitivity to gentle touch. Deletion of Mecp2 or Gabrb3 in peripheral somatosensory neurons causes mechanosensory dysfunction through loss of GABAA receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition of inputs to the CNS. Remarkably, tactile defects resulting from Mecp2 or Gabrb3 deletion in somatosensory neurons during development, but not in adulthood, cause social interaction deficits and anxiety-like behavior. Restoring Mecp2 expression exclusively in the somatosensory neurons of Mecp2-null mice rescues tactile sensitivity, anxiety-like behavior, and social interaction deficits, but not lethality, memory, or motor deficits. Thus, mechanosensory processing defects contribute to anxiety-like behavior and social interaction deficits in ASD mouse models. PAPERCLIP.",1
"1,135 Genomes Reveal the Global Pattern of Polymorphism in Arabidopsis thaliana.","Arabidopsis thaliana serves as a model organism for the study of fundamental physiological, cellular, and molecular processes. It has also greatly advanced our understanding of intraspecific genome variation. We present a detailed map of variation in 1,135 high-quality re-sequenced natural inbred lines representing the native Eurasian and North African range and recently colonized North America. We identify relict populations that continue to inhabit ancestral habitats, primarily in the Iberian Peninsula. They have mixed with a lineage that has spread to northern latitudes from an unknown glacial refugium and is now found in a much broader spectrum of habitats. Insights into the history of the species and the fine-scale distribution of genetic diversity provide the basis for full exploitation of A. thaliana natural variation through integration of genomes and epigenomes with molecular and non-molecular phenotypes.",1
Mitochondrial Dynamics Controls T Cell Fate through Metabolic Programming.,"Activated effector T (TE) cells augment anabolic pathways of metabolism, such as aerobic glycolysis, while memory T (TM) cells engage catabolic pathways, like fatty acid oxidation (FAO). However, signals that drive these differences remain unclear. Mitochondria are metabolic organelles that actively transform their ultrastructure. Therefore, we questioned whether mitochondrial dynamics controls T cell metabolism. We show that TE cells have punctate mitochondria, while TM cells maintain fused networks. The fusion protein Opa1 is required for TM, but not TE cells after infection, and enforcing fusion in TE cells imposes TM cell characteristics and enhances antitumor function. Our data suggest that, by altering cristae morphology, fusion in TM cells configures electron transport chain (ETC) complex associations favoring oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and FAO, while fission in TE cells leads to cristae expansion, reducing ETC efficiency and promoting aerobic glycolysis. Thus, mitochondrial remodeling is a signaling mechanism that instructs T cell metabolic programming.",1
Subcellular Imaging of Voltage and Calcium Signals Reveals Neural Processing In Vivo.,"A mechanistic understanding of neural computation requires determining how information is processed as it passes through neurons and across synapses. However, it has been challenging to measure membrane potential changes in axons and dendrites in vivo. We use in vivo, two-photon imaging of novel genetically encoded voltage indicators, as well as calcium imaging, to measure sensory stimulus-evoked signals in the Drosophila visual system with subcellular resolution. Across synapses, we find major transformations in the kinetics, amplitude, and sign of voltage responses to light. We also describe distinct relationships between voltage and calcium signals in different neuronal compartments, a substrate for local computation. Finally, we demonstrate that ON and OFF selectivity, a key feature of visual processing across species, emerges through the transformation of membrane potential into intracellular calcium concentration. By imaging voltage and calcium signals to map information flow with subcellular resolution, we illuminate where and how critical computations arise.",1
Lifespan Control by Redox-Dependent Recruitment of Chaperones to Misfolded Proteins.,"Caloric restriction (CR) extends the lifespan of flies, worms, and yeast by counteracting age-related oxidation of H2O2-scavenging peroxiredoxins (Prxs). Here, we show that increased dosage of the major cytosolic Prx in yeast, Tsa1, extends lifespan in an Hsp70 chaperone-dependent and CR-independent manner without increasing H2O2 scavenging or genome stability. We found that Tsa1 and Hsp70 physically interact and that hyperoxidation of Tsa1 by H2O2 is required for the recruitment of the Hsp70 chaperones and the Hsp104 disaggregase to misfolded and aggregated proteins during aging, but not heat stress. Tsa1 counteracted the accumulation of ubiquitinated aggregates during aging and the reduction of hyperoxidized Tsa1 by sulfiredoxin facilitated clearance of H2O2-generated aggregates. The data reveal a conceptually new role for H2O2 signaling in proteostasis and lifespan control and shed new light on the selective benefits endowed to eukaryotic peroxiredoxins by their reversible hyperoxidation.",1
Morphomechanical Innovation Drives Explosive Seed Dispersal.,"How mechanical and biological processes are coordinated across cells, tissues, and organs to produce complex traits is a key question in biology. Cardamine hirsuta, a relative of Arabidopsis thaliana, uses an explosive mechanism to disperse its seeds. We show that this trait evolved through morphomechanical innovations at different spatial scales. At the organ scale, tension within the fruit wall generates the elastic energy required for explosion. This tension is produced by differential contraction of fruit wall tissues through an active mechanism involving turgor pressure, cell geometry, and wall properties of the epidermis. Explosive release of this tension is controlled at the cellular scale by asymmetric lignin deposition within endocarp b cells-a striking pattern that is strictly associated with explosive pod shatter across the Brassicaceae plant family. By bridging these different scales, we present an integrated mechanism for explosive seed dispersal that links evolutionary novelty with complex trait innovation. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",1
The Colonic Crypt Protects Stem Cells from Microbiota-Derived Metabolites.,"In the mammalian intestine, crypts of Leiberkuhn house intestinal epithelial stem/progenitor cells at their base. The mammalian intestine also harbors a diverse array of microbial metabolite compounds that potentially modulate stem/progenitor cell activity. Unbiased screening identified butyrate, a prominent bacterial metabolite, as a potent inhibitor of intestinal stem/progenitor proliferation at physiologic concentrations. During homeostasis, differentiated colonocytes metabolized butyrate likely preventing it from reaching proliferating epithelial stem/progenitor cells within the crypt. Exposure of stem/progenitor cells in vivo to butyrate through either mucosal injury or application to a naturally crypt-less host organism led to inhibition of proliferation and delayed wound repair. The mechanism of butyrate action depended on the transcription factor Foxo3. Our findings indicate that mammalian crypt architecture protects stem/progenitor cell proliferation in part through a metabolic barrier formed by differentiated colonocytes that consume butyrate and stimulate future studies on the interplay of host anatomy and microbiome metabolism.",1
Systematic Functional Dissection of Common Genetic Variation Affecting Red Blood Cell Traits.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified thousands of associations between common genetic variants and human disease phenotypes, but the majority of these variants are non-coding, often requiring genetic fine-mapping, epigenomic profiling, and individual reporter assays to delineate potential causal variants. We employ a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to simultaneously screen 2,756 variants in strong linkage disequilibrium with 75 sentinel variants associated with red blood cell traits. We show that this assay identifies elements with endogenous erythroid regulatory activity. Across 23 sentinel variants, we conservatively identified 32 MPRA functional variants (MFVs). We used targeted genome editing to demonstrate endogenous enhancer activity across 3 MFVs that predominantly affect the transcription of SMIM1, RBM38, and CD164. Functional follow-up of RBM38 delineates a key role for this gene in the alternative splicing program occurring during terminal erythropoiesis. Finally, we provide evidence for how common GWAS-nominated variants can disrupt cell-type-specific transcriptional regulatory pathways.",1
Direct Identification of Hundreds of Expression-Modulating Variants using a Multiplexed Reporter Assay.,"Although studies have identified hundreds of loci associated with human traits and diseases, pinpointing causal alleles remains difficult, particularly for non-coding variants. To address this challenge, we adapted the massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to identify variants that directly modulate gene expression. We applied it to 32,373 variants from 3,642 cis-expression quantitative trait loci and control regions. Detection by MPRA was strongly correlated with measures of regulatory function. We demonstrate MPRA's capabilities for pinpointing causal alleles, using it to identify 842 variants showing differential expression between alleles, including 53 well-annotated variants associated with diseases and traits. We investigated one in detail, a risk allele for ankylosing spondylitis, and provide direct evidence of a non-coding variant that alters expression of the prostaglandin EP4 receptor. These results create a resource of concrete leads and illustrate the promise of this approach for comprehensively interrogating how non-coding polymorphism shapes human biology.",1
Relative Rates of Surface and Volume Synthesis Set Bacterial Cell Size.,"Many studies have focused on the mechanisms underlying length and width determination in rod-shaped bacteria. Here, we focus instead on cell surface area to volume ratio (SA/V) and demonstrate that SA/V homeostasis underlies size determination. We propose a model whereby the instantaneous rates of surface and volume synthesis both scale with volume. This model predicts that these relative rates dictate SA/V and that cells approach a new steady-state SA/V exponentially, with a decay constant equal to the volume growth rate. To test this, we exposed diverse bacterial species to sublethal concentrations of a cell wall biosynthesis inhibitor and observed dose-dependent decreases in SA/V. Furthermore, this decrease was exponential and had the expected decay constant. The model also quantitatively describes SA/V alterations induced by other chemical, nutritional, and genetic perturbations. We additionally present evidence for a surface material accumulation threshold underlying division, sensitizing cell length to changes in SA/V requirements.",1
Dual RING E3 Architectures Regulate Multiubiquitination and Ubiquitin Chain Elongation by APC/C.,"Protein ubiquitination involves E1, E2, and E3 trienzyme cascades. E2 and RING E3 enzymes often collaborate to first prime a substrate with a single ubiquitin (UB) and then achieve different forms of polyubiquitination: multiubiquitination of several sites and elongation of linkage-specific UB chains. Here, cryo-EM and biochemistry show that the human E3 anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) and its two partner E2s, UBE2C (aka UBCH10) and UBE2S, adopt specialized catalytic architectures for these two distinct forms of polyubiquitination. The APC/C RING constrains UBE2C proximal to a substrate and simultaneously binds a substrate-linked UB to drive processive multiubiquitination. Alternatively, during UB chain elongation, the RING does not bind UBE2S but rather lures an evolving substrate-linked UB to UBE2S positioned through a cullin interaction to generate a Lys11-linked chain. Our findings define mechanisms of APC/C regulation, and establish principles by which specialized E3-E2-substrate-UB architectures control different forms of polyubiquitination.",1
Modulated Expression of Specific tRNAs Drives Gene Expression and Cancer Progression.,"Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are primarily viewed as static contributors to gene expression. By developing a high-throughput tRNA profiling method, we find that specific tRNAs are upregulated in human breast cancer cells as they gain metastatic activity. Through loss-of-function, gain-of-function, and clinical-association studies, we implicate tRNAGluUUC and tRNAArgCCG as promoters of breast cancer metastasis. Upregulation of these tRNAs enhances stability and ribosome occupancy of transcripts enriched for their cognate codons. Specifically, tRNAGluUUC promotes metastatic progression by directly enhancing EXOSC2 expression and enhancing GRIPAP1-constituting an ""inducible"" pathway driven by a tRNA. The cellular proteomic shift toward a pro-metastatic state mirrors global tRNA shifts, allowing for cell-state and cell-type transgene expression optimization through codon content quantification. TRNA modulation represents a mechanism by which cells achieve altered expression of specific transcripts and proteins. TRNAs are thus dynamic regulators of gene expression and the tRNA codon landscape can causally and specifically impact disease progression.",1
Establishing Chromatin Regulatory Landscape during Mouse Preimplantation Development.,"How the chromatin regulatory landscape in the inner cell mass cells is established from differentially packaged sperm and egg genomes during preimplantation development is unknown. Here, we develop a low-input DNase I sequencing (liDNase-seq) method that allows us to generate maps of DNase I-hypersensitive site (DHS) of mouse preimplantation embryos from 1-cell to morula stage. The DHS landscape is progressively established with a drastic increase at the 8-cell stage. Paternal chromatin accessibility is quickly reprogrammed after fertilization to the level similar to maternal chromatin, while imprinted genes exhibit allelic accessibility bias. We demonstrate that transcription factor Nfya contributes to zygotic genome activation and DHS formation at the 2-cell stage and that Oct4 contributes to the DHSs gained at the 8-cell stage. Our study reveals the dynamic chromatin regulatory landscape during early development and identifies key transcription factors important for DHS establishment in mammalian embryos.",1
Repression of the Antioxidant NRF2 Pathway in Premature Aging.,"Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare, invariably fatal premature aging disorder. The disease is caused by constitutive production of progerin, a mutant form of the nuclear architectural protein lamin A, leading, through unknown mechanisms, to diverse morphological, epigenetic, and genomic damage and to mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) attrition in vivo. Using a high-throughput siRNA screen, we identify the NRF2 antioxidant pathway as a driver mechanism in HGPS. Progerin sequesters NRF2 and thereby causes its subnuclear mislocalization, resulting in impaired NRF2 transcriptional activity and consequently increased chronic oxidative stress. Suppressed NRF2 activity or increased oxidative stress is sufficient to recapitulate HGPS aging defects, whereas reactivation of NRF2 activity in HGPS patient cells reverses progerin-associated nuclear aging defects and restores in vivo viability of MSCs in an animal model. These findings identify repression of the NRF2-mediated antioxidative response as a key contributor to the premature aging phenotype.",1
From Dietary Fiber to Host Physiology: Short-Chain Fatty Acids as Key Bacterial Metabolites.,"A compelling set of links between the composition of the gut microbiota, the host diet, and host physiology has emerged. Do these links reflect cause-and-effect relationships, and what might be their mechanistic basis? A growing body of work implicates microbially produced metabolites as crucial executors of diet-based microbial influence on the host. Here, we will review data supporting the diverse functional roles carried out by a major class of bacterial metabolites, the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). SCFAs can directly activate G-coupled-receptors, inhibit histone deacetylases, and serve as energy substrates. They thus affect various physiological processes and may contribute to health and disease.",1
Cooperative Microbial Tolerance Behaviors in Host-Microbiota Mutualism.,"Animal defense strategies against microbes are most often thought of as a function of the immune system, the primary function of which is to sense and kill microbes through the execution of resistance mechanisms. However, this antagonistic view creates complications for our understanding of beneficial host-microbe interactions. Pathogenic microbes are described as employing a few common behaviors that promote their fitness at the expense of host health and fitness. Here, a complementary framework is proposed to suggest that, in addition to pathogens, beneficial microbes have evolved behaviors to manipulate host processes in order to promote their own fitness and do so through the promotion of host health and fitness. In this Perspective, I explore the idea that patterns or behaviors traditionally ascribed to pathogenic microbes are also employed by beneficial microbes to promote host tolerance defense strategies. Such strategies would promote host health without having a negative impact on microbial fitness and would thereby yield cooperative evolutionary dynamics that are likely required to drive mutualistic co-evolution of hosts and microbes.",1
Leveraging Rules of Nonsense-Mediated mRNA Decay for Genome Engineering and Personalized Medicine.,"Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a eukaryotic mRNA quality control and regulatory process that plays direct roles in human health and disease. In this Minireview, we discuss how understanding the molecular events that trigger NMD can facilitate strategic targeting of genes via CRISPR/Cas9 technologies and also inform disease diagnostics and treatments.",1
A TOGgle for Tension at Kinetochores.,Differential stability of kinetochore-microtubule attachments at low versus high tension is critical for accurate chromosome segregation. Miller et al. find that a TOG domain microtubule-binding protein imparts intrinsic tension selectivity to kinetochore-microtubule attachments.,1
A Pro-metastatic tRNA Pathway.,"tRNAs are best known as basic modules for global regulation of protein synthesis. Goodarzi et al. now show that two tRNAs upregulated in metastatic breast cancer cells enhance stability and translation of transcripts enriched with these codons, leading to specific increase in production of pro-metastatic proteins.",1
Dangerous Entrapment for NRF2.,"Progerin, a mutated lamin A, causes the severe premature-aging syndrome Hutchinson-Gilford progeria (HGPS). Kubben et al. present a driving mechanism for HGPS involving trapping of NRF2 at the nuclear periphery by progerin. This local restriction results in impaired NRF2 signaling and chronic oxidative stress.",1
Do Flies Count Sheep or NMDA Receptors to Go to Sleep?,"The drive to sleep increases the longer that we stay awake, but this process is poorly understood at the cellular level. Now, Liu et al. show that the plasticity of a small group of neurons in the Drosophila central brain is a key component of the sleep homeostat.",1

A Family of non-GPCR Chemosensors Defines an Alternative Logic for Mammalian Olfaction.,"Odor perception in mammals is mediated by parallel sensory pathways that convey distinct information about the olfactory world. Multiple olfactory subsystems express characteristic seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in a one-receptor-per-neuron pattern that facilitates odor discrimination. Sensory neurons of the ""necklace"" subsystem are nestled within the recesses of the olfactory epithelium and detect diverse odorants; however, they do not express known GPCR odor receptors. Here, we report that members of the four-pass transmembrane MS4A protein family are chemosensors expressed within necklace sensory neurons. These receptors localize to sensory endings and confer responses to ethologically relevant ligands, including pheromones and fatty acids, in vitro and in vivo. Individual necklace neurons co-express many MS4A proteins and are activated by multiple MS4A ligands; this pooling of information suggests that the necklace is organized more like subsystems for taste than for smell. The MS4As therefore define a distinct mechanism and functional logic for mammalian olfaction.",1
"A Comprehensive, CRISPR-based Functional Analysis of Essential Genes in Bacteria.","Essential gene functions underpin the core reactions required for cell viability, but their contributions and relationships are poorly studied in vivo. Using CRISPR interference, we created knockdowns of every essential gene in Bacillus subtilis and probed their phenotypes. Our high-confidence essential gene network, established using chemical genomics, showed extensive interconnections among distantly related processes and identified modes of action for uncharacterized antibiotics. Importantly, mild knockdown of essential gene functions significantly reduced stationary-phase survival without affecting maximal growth rate, suggesting that essential protein levels are set to maximize outgrowth from stationary phase. Finally, high-throughput microscopy indicated that cell morphology is relatively insensitive to mild knockdown but profoundly affected by depletion of gene function, revealing intimate connections between cell growth and shape. Our results provide a framework for systematic investigation of essential gene functions in vivo broadly applicable to diverse microorganisms and amenable to comparative analysis.",1
Wiring and Molecular Features of Prefrontal Ensembles Representing Distinct Experiences.,"A major challenge in understanding the cellular diversity of the brain has been linking activity during behavior with standard cellular typology. For example, it has not been possible to determine whether principal neurons in prefrontal cortex active during distinct experiences represent separable cell types, and it is not known whether these differentially active cells exert distinct causal influences on behavior. Here, we develop quantitative hydrogel-based technologies to connect activity in cells reporting on behavioral experience with measures for both brain-wide wiring and molecular phenotype. We find that positive and negative-valence experiences in prefrontal cortex are represented by cell populations that differ in their causal impact on behavior, long-range wiring, and gene expression profiles, with the major discriminant being expression of the adaptation-linked gene NPAS4. These findings illuminate cellular logic of prefrontal cortex information processing and natural adaptive behavior and may point the way to cell-type-specific understanding and treatment of disease-associated states.",1
Mapping of Brain Activity by Automated Volume Analysis of Immediate Early Genes.,"Understanding how neural information is processed in physiological and pathological states would benefit from precise detection, localization, and quantification of the activity of all neurons across the entire brain, which has not, to date, been achieved in the mammalian brain. We introduce a pipeline for high-speed acquisition of brain activity at cellular resolution through profiling immediate early gene expression using immunostaining and light-sheet fluorescence imaging, followed by automated mapping and analysis of activity by an open-source software program we term ClearMap. We validate the pipeline first by analysis of brain regions activated in response to haloperidol. Next, we report new cortical regions downstream of whisker-evoked sensory processing during active exploration. Last, we combine activity mapping with axon tracing to uncover new brain regions differentially activated during parenting behavior. This pipeline is widely applicable to different experimental paradigms, including animal species for which transgenic activity reporters are not readily available.",1
Sensory Neurons that Detect Stretch and Nutrients in the Digestive System.,"Neural inputs from internal organs are essential for normal autonomic function. The vagus nerve is a key body-brain connection that monitors the digestive, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems. Within the gastrointestinal tract, vagal sensory neurons detect gut hormones and organ distension. Here, we investigate the molecular diversity of vagal sensory neurons and their roles in sensing gastrointestinal inputs. Genetic approaches allowed targeted investigation of gut-to-brain afferents involved in homeostatic responses to ingested nutrients (GPR65 neurons) and mechanical distension of the stomach and intestine (GLP1R neurons). Optogenetics, in vivo ganglion imaging, and genetically guided anatomical mapping provide direct links between neuron identity, peripheral anatomy, central anatomy, conduction velocity, response properties in vitro and in vivo, and physiological function. These studies clarify the roles of vagal afferents in mediating particular gut hormone responses. Moreover, genetic control over gut-to-brain neurons provides a molecular framework for understanding neural control of gastrointestinal physiology.",1
Breaking Cryo-EM Resolution Barriers to Facilitate Drug Discovery.,"Recent advances in single-particle cryoelecton microscopy (cryo-EM) are enabling generation of numerous near-atomic resolution structures for well-ordered protein complexes with sizes >/= approximately 200 kDa. Whether cryo-EM methods are equally useful for high-resolution structural analysis of smaller, dynamic protein complexes such as those involved in cellular metabolism remains an important question. Here, we present 3.8 A resolution cryo-EM structures of the cancer target isocitrate dehydrogenase (93 kDa) and identify the nature of conformational changes induced by binding of the allosteric small-molecule inhibitor ML309. We also report 2.8-A- and 1.8-A-resolution structures of lactate dehydrogenase (145 kDa) and glutamate dehydrogenase (334 kDa), respectively. With these results, two perceived barriers in single-particle cryo-EM are overcome: (1) crossing 2 A resolution and (2) obtaining structures of proteins with sizes < 100 kDa, demonstrating that cryo-EM can be used to investigate a broad spectrum of drug-target interactions and dynamic conformational states.",1
Circadian Amplitude Regulation via FBXW7-Targeted REV-ERBalpha Degradation.,"Defects in circadian rhythm influence physiology and behavior with implications for the treatment of sleep disorders, metabolic disease, and cancer. Although core regulatory components of clock rhythmicity have been defined, insight into the mechanisms underpinning amplitude is limited. Here, we show that REV-ERBalpha, a core inhibitory component of clock transcription, is targeted for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the F-box protein FBXW7. By relieving REV-ERBalpha-dependent repression, FBXW7 provides an unrecognized mechanism for enhancing the amplitude of clock gene transcription. Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1)-mediated phosphorylation of REV-ERBalpha is necessary for FBXW7 recognition. Moreover, targeted hepatic disruption of FBXW7 alters circadian expression of core clock genes and perturbs whole-body lipid and glucose levels. This CDK1-FBXW7 pathway controlling REV-ERBalpha repression defines an unexpected molecular mechanism for re-engaging the positive transcriptional arm of the clock, as well as a potential route to manipulate clock amplitude via small molecule CDK1 inhibition.",1
Structural Insights into the Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1)-Mediated Cholesterol Transfer and Ebola Infection.,"Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is associated with mutations in NPC1 and NPC2, whose gene products are key players in the endosomal/lysosomal egress of low-density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol. NPC1 is also the intracellular receptor for Ebola virus (EBOV). Here, we present a 4.4 A structure of full-length human NPC1 and a low-resolution reconstruction of NPC1 in complex with the cleaved glycoprotein (GPcl) of EBOV, both determined by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy. NPC1 contains 13 transmembrane segments (TMs) and three distinct lumenal domains A (also designated NTD), C, and I. TMs 2-13 exhibit a typical resistance-nodulation-cell division fold, among which TMs 3-7 constitute the sterol-sensing domain conserved in several proteins involved in cholesterol metabolism and signaling. A trimeric EBOV-GPcl binds to one NPC1 monomer through the domain C. Our structural and biochemical characterizations provide an important framework for mechanistic understanding of NPC1-mediated intracellular cholesterol trafficking and Ebola virus infection.",1
TMCO1 Is an ER Ca(2+) Load-Activated Ca(2+) Channel.,"Maintaining homeostasis of Ca(2+) stores in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is crucial for proper Ca(2+) signaling and key cellular functions. The Ca(2+)-release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channel is responsible for Ca(2+) influx and refilling after store depletion, but how cells cope with excess Ca(2+) when ER stores are overloaded is unclear. We show that TMCO1 is an ER transmembrane protein that actively prevents Ca(2+) stores from overfilling, acting as what we term a ""Ca(2+) load-activated Ca(2+) channel"" or ""CLAC"" channel. TMCO1 undergoes reversible homotetramerization in response to ER Ca(2+) overloading and disassembly upon Ca(2+) depletion and forms a Ca(2+)-selective ion channel on giant liposomes. TMCO1 knockout mice reproduce the main clinical features of human cerebrofaciothoracic (CFT) dysplasia spectrum, a developmental disorder linked to TMCO1 dysfunction, and exhibit severe mishandling of ER Ca(2+) in cells. Our findings indicate that TMCO1 provides a protective mechanism to prevent overfilling of ER stores with Ca(2+) ions.",1
Corpse Engulfment Generates a Molecular Memory that Primes the Macrophage Inflammatory Response.,"Macrophages are multifunctional cells that perform diverse roles in health and disease. Emerging evidence has suggested that these innate immune cells might also be capable of developing immunological memory, a trait previously associated with the adaptive system alone. While recent studies have focused on the dramatic macrophage reprogramming that follows infection and protects against secondary microbial attack, can macrophages also develop memory in response to other cues? Here, we show that apoptotic corpse engulfment by Drosophila macrophages is an essential primer for their inflammatory response to tissue damage and infection in vivo. Priming is triggered via calcium-induced JNK signaling, which leads to upregulation of the damage receptor Draper, thus providing a molecular memory that allows the cell to rapidly respond to subsequent injury or infection. This remarkable plasticity and capacity for memory places macrophages as key therapeutic targets for treatment of inflammatory disorders.",1
Sleep Drive Is Encoded by Neural Plastic Changes in a Dedicated Circuit.,"Prolonged wakefulness leads to an increased pressure for sleep, but how this homeostatic drive is generated and subsequently persists is unclear. Here, from a neural circuit screen in Drosophila, we identify a subset of ellipsoid body (EB) neurons whose activation generates sleep drive. Patch-clamp analysis indicates these EB neurons are highly sensitive to sleep loss, switching from spiking to burst-firing modes. Functional imaging and translational profiling experiments reveal that elevated sleep need triggers reversible increases in cytosolic Ca(2+) levels, NMDA receptor expression, and structural markers of synaptic strength, suggesting these EB neurons undergo ""sleep-need""-dependent plasticity. Strikingly, the synaptic plasticity of these EB neurons is both necessary and sufficient for generating sleep drive, indicating that sleep pressure is encoded by plastic changes within this circuit. These studies define an integrator circuit for sleep homeostasis and provide a mechanism explaining the generation and persistence of sleep drive.",1
Coexisting Liquid Phases Underlie Nucleolar Subcompartments.,"The nucleolus and other ribonucleoprotein (RNP) bodies are membrane-less organelles that appear to assemble through phase separation of their molecular components. However, many such RNP bodies contain internal subcompartments, and the mechanism of their formation remains unclear. Here, we combine in vivo and in vitro studies, together with computational modeling, to show that subcompartments within the nucleolus represent distinct, coexisting liquid phases. Consistent with their in vivo immiscibility, purified nucleolar proteins phase separate into droplets containing distinct non-coalescing phases that are remarkably similar to nucleoli in vivo. This layered droplet organization is caused by differences in the biophysical properties of the phases-particularly droplet surface tension-which arises from sequence-encoded features of their macromolecular components. These results suggest that phase separation can give rise to multilayered liquids that may facilitate sequential RNA processing reactions in a variety of RNP bodies. PAPERCLIP.",1
Acquired Tissue-Specific Promoter Bivalency Is a Basis for PRC2 Necessity in Adult Cells.,"Bivalent promoters in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) carry methylation marks on two lysine residues, K4 and K27, in histone3 (H3). K4me2/3 is generally considered to promote transcription, and Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) places K27me3, which is erased at lineage-restricted genes when ESCs differentiate in culture. Molecular defects in various PRC2 null adult tissues lack a unifying explanation. We found that epigenomes in adult mouse intestine and other self-renewing tissues show fewer and distinct bivalent promoters compared to ESCs. Groups of tissue-specific genes that carry bivalent marks are repressed, despite the presence of promoter H3K4me2/3. These are the predominant genes de-repressed in PRC2-deficient adult cells, where aberrant expression is proportional to the H3K4me2/3 levels observed at their promoters in wild-type cells. Thus, in adult animals, PRC2 specifically represses genes with acquired, tissue-restricted promoter bivalency. These findings provide new insights into specificity in chromatin-based gene regulation.",1
Root Regeneration Triggers an Embryo-like Sequence Guided by Hormonal Interactions.,"Plant roots can regenerate after excision of their tip, including the stem cell niche. To determine which developmental program mediates such repair, we applied a combination of lineage tracing, single-cell RNA sequencing, and marker analysis to test different models of tissue reassembly. We show that multiple cell types can reconstitute stem cells, demonstrating the latent potential of untreated plant cells. The transcriptome of regenerating cells prior to stem cell activation resembles that of an embryonic root progenitor. Regeneration defects are more severe in embryonic than in adult root mutants. Furthermore, the signaling domains of the hormones auxin and cytokinin mirror their embryonic dynamics and manipulation of both hormones alters the position of new tissues and stem cell niche markers. Our findings suggest that plant root regeneration follows, on a larger scale, the developmental stages of embryonic patterning and is guided by spatial information provided by complementary hormone domains.",1
SnapShot: Microglia in Disease.,"The development and maintenance of the central nervous system is dependent upon regulated, homeostatic actions of microglia, which sculpt and refine neuronal circuitry. By contrast, dysregulation of microglia contributes to the pathology of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders; neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease; and schizophrenia and chronic neuropathic pain.",1
Cistrome and Epicistrome Features Shape the Regulatory DNA Landscape.,"The cistrome is the complete set of transcription factor (TF) binding sites (cis-elements) in an organism, while an epicistrome incorporates tissue-specific DNA chemical modifications and TF-specific chemical sensitivities into these binding profiles. Robust methods to construct comprehensive cistrome and epicistrome maps are critical for elucidating complex transcriptional networks that underlie growth, behavior, and disease. Here, we describe DNA affinity purification sequencing (DAP-seq), a high-throughput TF binding site discovery method that interrogates genomic DNA with in-vitro-expressed TFs. Using DAP-seq, we defined the Arabidopsis cistrome by resolving motifs and peaks for 529 TFs. Because genomic DNA used in DAP-seq retains 5-methylcytosines, we determined that >75% (248/327) of Arabidopsis TFs surveyed were methylation sensitive, a property that strongly impacts the epicistrome landscape. DAP-seq datasets also yielded insight into the biology and binding site architecture of numerous TFs, demonstrating the value of DAP-seq for cost-effective cistromic and epicistromic annotation in any organism.",1
The Cell Nucleus Serves as a Mechanotransducer of Tissue Damage-Induced Inflammation.,"Tissue damage activates cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), releasing arachidonic acid (AA), which is oxidized to proinflammatory eicosanoids by 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) on the nuclear envelope. How tissue damage is sensed to activate cPLA2 is unknown. We investigated this by live imaging in wounded zebrafish larvae, where damage of the fin tissue causes osmotic cell swelling at the wound margin and the generation of a chemotactic eicosanoid signal. Osmotic swelling of cells and their nuclei activates cPla2 by translocating it from the nucleoplasm to the nuclear envelope. Elevated cytosolic Ca(2+) was necessary but not sufficient for cPla2 translocation, and nuclear swelling was required in parallel. cPla2 translocation upon nuclear swelling was reconstituted in isolated nuclei and appears to be a simple physical process mediated by tension in the nuclear envelope. Our data suggest that the nucleus plays a mechanosensory role in inflammation by transducing cell swelling and lysis into proinflammatory eicosanoid signaling.",1
Mechanisms and Consequences of Macromolecular Phase Separation.,"Over a century ago, colloidal phase separation of matter into non-membranous bodies was recognized as a fundamental organizing principal of cell ""protoplasm."" Recent insights into the molecular properties of such phase-separated bodies present challenges to our understanding of cellular protein interaction networks, as well as opportunities for interpreting and understanding of native and pathological genetic and molecular interactions. Here, we briefly review examples of and discuss physical principles of phase-separated cellular bodies and then reflect on how knowledge of these principles may direct future research on their functions.",1
"The Structure and Dynamics of Higher-Order Assemblies: Amyloids, Signalosomes, and Granules.","We here attempt to achieve an integrated understanding of the structure and dynamics of a number of higher-order assemblies, including amyloids, various kinds of signalosomes, and cellular granules. We propose that the synergy between folded domains, linear motifs, and intrinsically disordered regions regulates the formation and intrinsic fuzziness of all higher-order assemblies, creating a structural and dynamic continuum. We describe how such regulatory mechanisms could be influenced under pathological conditions.",1
Mitochondria: Masters of Epigenetics.,"Accumulating evidence argues that aging exerts a profound influence on epigenetics, and vice versa. A pair of studies by Merkwirth et al. and Tian et al. now provide insights on how mitochondrial stress experienced by C. elegans larvae propagates a specific and persistent epigenetic response that protects adult cells and extends lifespan.",1
Swollen Nuclei Signal from the Grave.,"Eicosanoid signaling plays key pro-inflammatory roles during tissue damage. Now, Enyedi et al. show that swelling of nuclei in cell corpses activates eicosanoid signaling to recruit leukocytes to sites of tissue damage. The enhanced membrane tension in swollen nuclei directly promotes calcium-dependent translocation and activation of enzymes involved in eicosanoid biosynthesis.",1
Tension-Time Integrals and Genetic Cardiomyopathy: The Force Is with You.,"Hundreds of different mutations in genes encoding a few dozen sarcomeric proteins cause two reciprocal human disease phenotypes, hypertrophic or dilated cardiomyopathy. How molecular dysfunction evokes different patterns of cardiac remodeling is unclear. Davis et al. describe a biophysical metric of cardiomyocyte function, the force-time integral, which predicts disease phenotype.",1
Lessons from a Recovering Academic.,"The conversion of basic biology into new therapeutics requires scientific activities in both academia and industry.

PCSK9 Inhibitors.,"Alirocumab and evolocumab are monoclonal antibodies that block proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a circulating protein that degrades low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors. These therapies increase LDL receptors on the cell surface and reduce plasma LDL cholesterol. Both therapies are approved to lower LDL cholesterol, a causative agent for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.",1
"High-Throughput, High-Resolution Mapping of Protein Localization in Mammalian Brain by In Vivo Genome Editing.","A scalable and high-throughput method to identify precise subcellular localization of endogenous proteins is essential for integrative understanding of a cell at the molecular level. Here, we developed a simple and generalizable technique to image endogenous proteins with high specificity, resolution, and contrast in single cells in mammalian brain tissue. The technique, single-cell labeling of endogenous proteins by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair (SLENDR), uses in vivo genome editing to insert a sequence encoding an epitope tag or a fluorescent protein to a gene of interest by CRISPR-Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair (HDR). Single-cell, HDR-mediated genome editing was achieved by delivering the editing machinery to dividing neuronal progenitors through in utero electroporation. We demonstrate that SLENDR allows rapid determination of the localization and dynamics of many endogenous proteins in various cell types, regions, and ages in the brain. Thus, SLENDR provides a high-throughput platform to map the subcellular localization of endogenous proteins with the resolution of micro- to nanometers in the brain.",1
A Mechanogenetic Toolkit for Interrogating Cell Signaling in Space and Time.,"Tools capable of imaging and perturbing mechanical signaling pathways with fine spatiotemporal resolution have been elusive, despite their importance in diverse cellular processes. The challenge in developing a mechanogenetic toolkit (i.e., selective and quantitative activation of genetically encoded mechanoreceptors) stems from the fact that many mechanically activated processes are localized in space and time yet additionally require mechanical loading to become activated. To address this challenge, we synthesized magnetoplasmonic nanoparticles that can image, localize, and mechanically load targeted proteins with high spatiotemporal resolution. We demonstrate their utility by investigating the cell-surface activation of two mechanoreceptors: Notch and E-cadherin. By measuring cellular responses to a spectrum of spatial, chemical, temporal, and mechanical inputs at the single-molecule and single-cell levels, we reveal how spatial segregation and mechanical force cooperate to direct receptor activation dynamics. This generalizable technique can be used to control and understand diverse mechanosensitive processes in cell signaling. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",1
SIRT6 Suppresses Pancreatic Cancer through Control of Lin28b.,"Chromatin remodeling proteins are frequently dysregulated in human cancer, yet little is known about how they control tumorigenesis. Here, we uncover an epigenetic program mediated by the NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylase Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) that is critical for suppression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), one of the most lethal malignancies. SIRT6 inactivation accelerates PDAC progression and metastasis via upregulation of Lin28b, a negative regulator of the let-7 microRNA. SIRT6 loss results in histone hyperacetylation at the Lin28b promoter, Myc recruitment, and pronounced induction of Lin28b and downstream let-7 target genes, HMGA2, IGF2BP1, and IGF2BP3. This epigenetic program defines a distinct subset with a poor prognosis, representing 30%-40% of human PDAC, characterized by reduced SIRT6 expression and an exquisite dependence on Lin28b for tumor growth. Thus, we identify SIRT6 as an important PDAC tumor suppressor and uncover the Lin28b pathway as a potential therapeutic target in a molecularly defined PDAC subset. PAPERCLIP.",1
RNA Duplex Map in Living Cells Reveals Higher-Order Transcriptome Structure.,"RNA has the intrinsic property to base pair, forming complex structures fundamental to its diverse functions. Here, we develop PARIS, a method based on reversible psoralen crosslinking for global mapping of RNA duplexes with near base-pair resolution in living cells. PARIS analysis in three human and mouse cell types reveals frequent long-range structures, higher-order architectures, and RNA-RNA interactions in trans across the transcriptome. PARIS determines base-pairing interactions on an individual-molecule level, revealing pervasive alternative conformations. We used PARIS-determined helices to guide phylogenetic analysis of RNA structures and discovered conserved long-range and alternative structures. XIST, a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) essential for X chromosome inactivation, folds into evolutionarily conserved RNA structural domains that span many kilobases. XIST A-repeat forms complex inter-repeat duplexes that nucleate higher-order assembly of the key epigenetic silencing protein SPEN. PARIS is a generally applicable and versatile method that provides novel insights into the RNA structurome and interactome. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",1
Sterol-Rich Membrane Domains Define Fission Yeast Cell Polarity.,"Cell polarization is crucial for the functioning of all organisms. The cytoskeleton is central to the process but its role in symmetry breaking is poorly understood. We study cell polarization when fission yeast cells exit starvation. We show that the basis of polarity generation is de novo sterol biosynthesis, cell surface delivery of sterols, and their recruitment to the cell poles. This involves four phases occurring independent of the polarity factor cdc42p. Initially, multiple, randomly distributed sterol-rich membrane (SRM) domains form at the plasma membrane, independent of the cytoskeleton and cell growth. These domains provide platforms on which the growth and polarity machinery assembles. SRM domains are then polarized by the microtubule-dependent polarity factor tea1p, which prepares for monopolar growth initiation and later switching to bipolar growth. SRM polarization requires F-actin but not the F-actin organizing polarity factors for3p and bud6p. We conclude that SRMs are key to cell polarization.",1
Zika Virus Infection during Pregnancy in Mice Causes Placental Damage and Fetal Demise.,"Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in pregnant women causes intrauterine growth restriction, spontaneous abortion, and microcephaly. Here, we describe two mouse models of placental and fetal disease associated with in utero transmission of ZIKV. Female mice lacking type I interferon signaling (Ifnar1(-/-)) crossed to wild-type (WT) males produced heterozygous fetuses resembling the immune status of human fetuses. Maternal inoculation at embryonic day 6.5 (E6.5) or E7.5 resulted in fetal demise that was associated with ZIKV infection of the placenta and fetal brain. We identified ZIKV within trophoblasts of the maternal and fetal placenta, consistent with a trans-placental infection route. Antibody blockade of Ifnar1 signaling in WT pregnant mice enhanced ZIKV trans-placental infection although it did not result in fetal death. These models will facilitate the study of ZIKV pathogenesis, in utero transmission, and testing of therapies and vaccines to prevent congenital malformations.",1
"Rapid, Low-Cost Detection of Zika Virus Using Programmable Biomolecular Components.","The recent Zika virus outbreak highlights the need for low-cost diagnostics that can be rapidly developed for distribution and use in pandemic regions. Here, we report a pipeline for the rapid design, assembly, and validation of cell-free, paper-based sensors for the detection of the Zika virus RNA genome. By linking isothermal RNA amplification to toehold switch RNA sensors, we detect clinically relevant concentrations of Zika virus sequences and demonstrate specificity against closely related Dengue virus sequences. When coupled with a novel CRISPR/Cas9-based module, our sensors can discriminate between viral strains with single-base resolution. We successfully demonstrate a simple, field-ready sample-processing workflow and detect Zika virus from the plasma of a viremic macaque. Our freeze-dried biomolecular platform resolves important practical limitations to the deployment of molecular diagnostics in the field and demonstrates how synthetic biology can be used to develop diagnostic tools for confronting global health crises.

Distinct Gene Regulatory Pathways for Human Innate versus Adaptive Lymphoid Cells.,"Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) serve as sentinels in mucosal tissues, sensing release of soluble inflammatory mediators, rapidly communicating danger via cytokine secretion, and functioning as guardians of tissue homeostasis. Although ILCs have been extensively studied in model organisms, little is known about these ""first responders"" in humans, especially their lineage and functional kinships to cytokine-secreting T helper (Th) cell counterparts. Here, we report gene regulatory circuitries for four human ILC-Th counterparts derived from mucosal environments, revealing that each ILC subset diverges as a distinct lineage from Th and circulating natural killer cells but shares circuitry devoted to functional polarization with their Th counterparts. Super-enhancers demarcate cohorts of cell-identity genes in each lineage, uncovering new modes of regulation for signature cytokines, new molecules that likely impart important functions to ILCs, and potential mechanisms for autoimmune disease SNP associations within ILC-Th subsets.",1
Developmental Acquisition of Regulomes Underlies Innate Lymphoid Cell Functionality.,"Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) play key roles in host defense, barrier integrity, and homeostasis and mirror adaptive CD4(+) T helper (Th) cell subtypes in both usage of effector molecules and transcription factors. To better understand the relationship between ILC subsets and their Th cell counterparts, we measured genome-wide chromatin accessibility. We find that chromatin in proximity to effector genes is selectively accessible in ILCs prior to high-level transcription upon activation. Accessibility of these regions is acquired in a stepwise manner during development and changes little after in vitro or in vivo activation. Conversely, dramatic chromatin remodeling occurs in naive CD4(+) T cells during Th cell differentiation using a type-2-infection model. This alteration results in a substantial convergence of Th2 cells toward ILC2 regulomes. Our data indicate extensive sharing of regulatory circuitry across the innate and adaptive compartments of the immune system, in spite of their divergent developing pathways.",1
Active Yeast Telomerase Shares Subunits with Ribonucleoproteins RNase P and RNase MRP.,"Telomerase is the ribonucleoprotein enzyme that replenishes telomeric DNA and maintains genome integrity. Minimally, telomerase activity requires a templating RNA and a catalytic protein. Additional proteins are required for activity on telomeres in vivo. Here, we report that the Pop1, Pop6, and Pop7 proteins, known components of RNase P and RNase MRP, bind to yeast telomerase RNA and are essential constituents of the telomerase holoenzyme. Pop1/Pop6/Pop7 binding is specific and involves an RNA domain highly similar to a protein-binding domain in the RNAs of RNase P/MRP. The results also show that Pop1/Pop6/Pop7 function to maintain the essential components Est1 and Est2 on the RNA in vivo. Consistently, addition of Pop1 allows for telomerase activity reconstitution with wild-type telomerase RNA in vitro. Thus, the same chaperoning module has allowed the evolution of functionally and, remarkably, structurally distinct RNPs, telomerase, and RNases P/MRP from unrelated progenitor RNAs.",1
Bacterial Outer Membrane Vesicles Mediate Cytosolic Localization of LPS and Caspase-11 Activation.,"Sensing of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the cytosol triggers caspase-11 activation and is central to host defense against Gram-negative bacterial infections and to the pathogenesis of sepsis. Most Gram-negative bacteria that activate caspase-11, however, are not cytosolic, and the mechanism by which LPS from these bacteria gains access to caspase-11 in the cytosol remains elusive. Here, we identify outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) produced by Gram-negative bacteria as a vehicle that delivers LPS into the cytosol triggering caspase-11-dependent effector responses in vitro and in vivo. OMVs are internalized via endocytosis, and LPS is released into the cytosol from early endosomes. The use of hypovesiculating bacterial mutants, compromised in their ability to generate OMVs, reveals the importance of OMVs in mediating the cytosolic localization of LPS. Collectively, these findings demonstrate a critical role for OMVs in enabling the cytosolic entry of LPS and, consequently, caspase-11 activation during Gram-negative bacterial infections.",1
A TOG Protein Confers Tension Sensitivity to Kinetochore-Microtubule Attachments.,"The development and survival of all organisms depends on equal partitioning of their genomes during cell division. Accurate chromosome segregation requires selective stabilization of kinetochore-microtubule attachments that come under tension due to opposing pulling forces exerted on sister kinetochores by dynamic microtubule tips. Here, we show that the XMAP215 family member, Stu2, makes a major contribution to kinetochore-microtubule coupling. Stu2 and its human ortholog, ch-TOG, exhibit a conserved interaction with the Ndc80 kinetochore complex that strengthens its attachment to microtubule tips. Strikingly, Stu2 can either stabilize or destabilize kinetochore attachments, depending on the level of kinetochore tension and whether the microtubule tip is assembling or disassembling. These dichotomous effects of Stu2 are independent of its previously studied regulation of microtubule dynamics. Altogether, our results demonstrate how a kinetochore-associated factor can confer opposing, tension-dependent effects to selectively stabilize tension-bearing attachments, providing mechanistic insight into the basis for accuracy during chromosome segregation.",1
SnapShot: Mechanical Forces in Development II.,"The forces shaping an organism are not exclusively produced by actin/myosin II networks. In part II of this SnapShot, we present various alternative mechanisms. In addition to driving morphogenesis, cells use mechanical forces to sense and react to the specific mechanical properties of their environment. Also, we present a selection of experimental tools commonly used in force analysis.",1
Real-Time Imaging of Translation on Single mRNA Transcripts in Live Cells.,"Translation is under tight spatial and temporal controls to ensure protein production in the right time and place in cells. Methods that allow real-time, high-resolution visualization of translation in live cells are essential for understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of translation regulation. Based on multivalent fluorescence amplification of the nascent polypeptide signal, we develop a method to image translation on individual mRNA molecules in real time in live cells, allowing direct visualization of translation events at the translation sites. Using this approach, we monitor transient changes of translation dynamics in responses to environmental stresses, capture distinct mobilities of individual polysomes in different subcellular compartments, and detect 3' UTR-dependent local translation and active transport of polysomes in dendrites of primary neurons.",1
Dynamics of Translation of Single mRNA Molecules In Vivo.,"Regulation of mRNA translation, the process by which ribosomes decode mRNAs into polypeptides, is used to tune cellular protein levels. Currently, methods for observing the complete process of translation from single mRNAs in vivo are unavailable. Here, we report the long-term (>1 hr) imaging of single mRNAs undergoing hundreds of rounds of translation in live cells, enabling quantitative measurements of ribosome initiation, elongation, and stalling. This approach reveals a surprising heterogeneity in the translation of individual mRNAs within the same cell, including rapid and reversible transitions between a translating and non-translating state. Applying this method to the cell-cycle gene Emi1, we find strong overall repression of translation initiation by specific 5' UTR sequences, but individual mRNA molecules in the same cell can exhibit dramatically different translational efficiencies. The ability to observe translation of single mRNA molecules in live cells provides a powerful tool to study translation regulation.",1
Lung Adenocarcinoma Distally Rewires Hepatic Circadian Homeostasis.,"The circadian clock controls metabolic and physiological processes through finely tuned molecular mechanisms. The clock is remarkably plastic and adapts to exogenous ""zeitgebers,"" such as light and nutrition. How a pathological condition in a given tissue influences systemic circadian homeostasis in other tissues remains an unanswered question of conceptual and biomedical importance. Here, we show that lung adenocarcinoma operates as an endogenous reorganizer of circadian metabolism. High-throughput transcriptomics and metabolomics revealed unique signatures of transcripts and metabolites cycling exclusively in livers of tumor-bearing mice. Remarkably, lung cancer has no effect on the core clock but rather reprograms hepatic metabolism through altered pro-inflammatory response via the STAT3-Socs3 pathway. This results in disruption of AKT, AMPK, and SREBP signaling, leading to altered insulin, glucose, and lipid metabolism. Thus, lung adenocarcinoma functions as a potent endogenous circadian organizer (ECO), which rewires the pathophysiological dimension of a distal tissue such as the liver. PAPERCLIP.",1
Temporal Stability of the Human Skin Microbiome.,"Biogeography and individuality shape the structural and functional composition of the human skin microbiome. To explore these factors' contribution to skin microbial community stability, we generated metagenomic sequence data from longitudinal samples collected over months and years. Analyzing these samples using a multi-kingdom, reference-based approach, we found that despite the skin's exposure to the external environment, its bacterial, fungal, and viral communities were largely stable over time. Site, individuality, and phylogeny were all determinants of stability. Foot sites exhibited the most variability; individuals differed in stability; and transience was a particular characteristic of eukaryotic viruses, which showed little site-specificity in colonization. Strain and single-nucleotide variant-level analysis showed that individuals maintain, rather than reacquire, prevalent microbes from the environment. Longitudinal stability of skin microbial communities generates hypotheses about colonization resistance and empowers clinical studies exploring alterations observed in disease states.",1
Maternal IgG and IgA Antibodies Dampen Mucosal T Helper Cell Responses in Early Life.,"To maintain a symbiotic relationship between the host and its resident intestinal microbiota, appropriate mucosal T cell responses to commensal antigens must be established. Mice acquire both IgG and IgA maternally; the former has primarily been implicated in passive immunity to pathogens while the latter mediates host-commensal mutualism. Here, we report the surprising observation that mice generate T cell-independent and largely Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent IgG2b and IgG3 antibody responses against their gut microbiota. We demonstrate that maternal acquisition of these antibodies dampens mucosal T follicular helper responses and subsequent germinal center B cell responses following birth. This work reveals a feedback loop whereby T cell-independent, TLR-dependent antibodies limit mucosal adaptive immune responses to newly acquired commensal antigens and uncovers a broader function for maternal IgG.",1
Neuro-Immune Interactions at Barrier Surfaces.,"Multidirectional interactions between the nervous and immune systems have been documented in homeostasis and pathologies ranging from multiple sclerosis to autism, and from leukemia to acute and chronic inflammation. Recent studies have addressed this crosstalk using cell-specific targeting, novel sequencing, imaging, and analytical tools, shedding light on unappreciated mechanisms of neuro-immune regulation. This Review focuses on neuro-immune interactions at barrier surfaces-mostly the gut, but also including the skin and the airways, areas densely populated by neurons and immune cells that constantly sense and adapt to tissue-specific environmental challenges.",1
Inflammasome Complexes: Emerging Mechanisms and Effector Functions.,"Canonical activation of the inflammasome is critical to promote caspase-1-dependent maturation of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and IL-18, as well as to induce pyroptotic cell death in response to pathogens and endogenous danger signals. Recent discoveries, however, are beginning to unveil new components of the inflammasome machinery as well as the full spectrum of inflammasome functions, extending their influence beyond canonical functions to regulation of eicosanoid storm, autophagy, and metabolism. In addition, the receptor components of the inflammasome can also regulate diverse biological processes, such as cellular proliferation, gene transcription, and tumorigenesis, all of which are independent of their inflammasome complex-forming capabilities. Here, we review these recent advances that are shaping our understanding of the complex biology of the inflammasome and its constituents.",1
"Mass Cytometry: Single Cells, Many Features.","Technology development in biological research often aims to either increase the number of cellular features that can be surveyed simultaneously or enhance the resolution at which such observations are possible. For decades, flow cytometry has balanced these goals to fill a critical need by enabling the measurement of multiple features in single cells, commonly to examine complex or hierarchical cellular systems. Recently, a format for flow cytometry has been developed that leverages the precision of mass spectrometry. This fusion of the two technologies, termed mass cytometry, provides measurement of over 40 simultaneous cellular parameters at single-cell resolution, significantly augmenting the ability of cytometry to evaluate complex cellular systems and processes. In this Primer, we review the current state of mass cytometry, providing an overview of the instrumentation, its present capabilities, and methods of data analysis, as well as thoughts on future developments and applications.",1
Transcriptome Encyclopedia of Early Human Development.,"Our understanding of human pre-implantation development is limited by the availability of human embryos and cannot completely rely on mouse studies. Petropoulos et al. now provide an extensive transcriptome analysis of a large number of human pre-implantation embryos at single-cell resolution, revealing previously unrecognized features unique to early human development.",1
Glia Get Neurons in Shape.,"Glial cells are essential components of the nervous system. In this issue, Singhvi et al. uncover cellular and molecular mechanisms through which C. elegans glia shape sensory neuron terminals and thus control animal thermosensing behaviors.",1
Thoughts on Obesity and Brain Glucose.,"Homeostatic control of brain metabolism is essential for neuronal activity. Jais et al., (2016) report that reduced brain glucose uptake elicited by a high-fat diet self-corrects by the recruitment of peripheral, VEGF-producing macrophages to the blood-brain barrier. Their findings further suggest that restoring brain glucose availability might help protect from cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease.",1
Microbial Skin Inhabitants: Friends Forever.,"To gain insight into the stability of the microbial communities that inhabit our skin, Oh et al., in a tour-de-force effort, map the human skin metagenomes over time. Remarkably, their data indicate that the individual, not the environment, primarily drives the composition of skin microbial communities.",1
Rescuing the Lost in Translation.,"The translation of medically relevant academic inventions that could transform public health has been notoriously difficult, stemming largely from cultural differences been academia and industry. New initiatives to kindle academic entrepreneurship and establish stronger public/private partnerships are helping to align these differences and accelerating the translation of promising new therapies.",1
Myeloid-Cell-Derived VEGF Maintains Brain Glucose Uptake and Limits Cognitive Impairment in Obesity.,"High-fat diet (HFD) feeding induces rapid reprogramming of systemic metabolism. Here, we demonstrate that HFD feeding of mice downregulates glucose transporter (GLUT)-1 expression in blood-brain barrier (BBB) vascular endothelial cells (BECs) and reduces brain glucose uptake. Upon prolonged HFD feeding, GLUT1 expression is restored, which is paralleled by increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in macrophages at the BBB. In turn, inducible reduction of GLUT1 expression specifically in BECs reduces brain glucose uptake and increases VEGF serum concentrations in lean mice. Conversely, myeloid-cell-specific deletion of VEGF in VEGF(Deltamyel) mice impairs BBB-GLUT1 expression, brain glucose uptake, and memory formation in obese, but not in lean mice. Moreover, obese VEGF(Deltamyel) mice exhibit exaggerated progression of cognitive decline and neuroinflammation on an Alzheimer's disease background. These experiments reveal that transient, HFD-elicited reduction of brain glucose uptake initiates a compensatory increase of VEGF production and assign obesity-associated macrophage activation a homeostatic role to restore cerebral glucose metabolism, preserve cognitive function, and limit neurodegeneration in obesity.",1
Two Conserved Histone Demethylases Regulate Mitochondrial Stress-Induced Longevity.,"Across eukaryotic species, mild mitochondrial stress can have beneficial effects on the lifespan of organisms. Mitochondrial dysfunction activates an unfolded protein response (UPR(mt)), a stress signaling mechanism designed to ensure mitochondrial homeostasis. Perturbation of mitochondria during larval development in C. elegans not only delays aging but also maintains UPR(mt) signaling, suggesting an epigenetic mechanism that modulates both longevity and mitochondrial proteostasis throughout life. We identify the conserved histone lysine demethylases jmjd-1.2/PHF8 and jmjd-3.1/JMJD3 as positive regulators of lifespan in response to mitochondrial dysfunction across species. Reduction of function of the demethylases potently suppresses longevity and UPR(mt) induction, while gain of function is sufficient to extend lifespan in a UPR(mt)-dependent manner. A systems genetics approach in the BXD mouse reference population further indicates conserved roles of the mammalian orthologs in longevity and UPR(mt) signaling. These findings illustrate an evolutionary conserved epigenetic mechanism that determines the rate of aging downstream of mitochondrial perturbations.",1
Variation in Microbiome LPS Immunogenicity Contributes to Autoimmunity in Humans.,"According to the hygiene hypothesis, the increasing incidence of autoimmune diseases in western countries may be explained by changes in early microbial exposure, leading to altered immune maturation. We followed gut microbiome development from birth until age three in 222 infants in Northern Europe, where early-onset autoimmune diseases are common in Finland and Estonia but are less prevalent in Russia. We found that Bacteroides species are lowly abundant in Russians but dominate in Finnish and Estonian infants. Therefore, their lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposures arose primarily from Bacteroides rather than from Escherichia coli, which is a potent innate immune activator. We show that Bacteroides LPS is structurally distinct from E. coli LPS and inhibits innate immune signaling and endotoxin tolerance; furthermore, unlike LPS from E. coli, B. dorei LPS does not decrease incidence of autoimmune diabetes in non-obese diabetic mice. Early colonization by immunologically silencing microbiota may thus preclude aspects of immune education.",1
Mitochondrial Stress Induces Chromatin Reorganization to Promote Longevity and UPR(mt).,"Organisms respond to mitochondrial stress through the upregulation of an array of protective genes, often perpetuating an early response to metabolic dysfunction across a lifetime. We find that mitochondrial stress causes widespread changes in chromatin structure through histone H3K9 di-methylation marks traditionally associated with gene silencing. Mitochondrial stress response activation requires the di-methylation of histone H3K9 through the activity of the histone methyltransferase met-2 and the nuclear co-factor lin-65. While globally the chromatin becomes silenced by these marks, remaining portions of the chromatin open up, at which point the binding of canonical stress responsive factors such as DVE-1 occurs. Thus, a metabolic stress response is established and propagated into adulthood of animals through specific epigenetic modifications that allow for selective gene expression and lifespan extension.",1
Effector T Cells Abrogate Stroma-Mediated Chemoresistance in Ovarian Cancer.,"Effector T cells and fibroblasts are major components in the tumor microenvironment. The means through which these cellular interactions affect chemoresistance is unclear. Here, we show that fibroblasts diminish nuclear accumulation of platinum in ovarian cancer cells, resulting in resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy. We demonstrate that glutathione and cysteine released by fibroblasts contribute to this resistance. CD8(+) T cells abolish the resistance by altering glutathione and cystine metabolism in fibroblasts. CD8(+) T-cell-derived interferon (IFN)gamma controls fibroblast glutathione and cysteine through upregulation of gamma-glutamyltransferases and transcriptional repression of system xc(-) cystine and glutamate antiporter via the JAK/STAT1 pathway. The presence of stromal fibroblasts and CD8(+) T cells is negatively and positively associated with ovarian cancer patient survival, respectively. Thus, our work uncovers a mode of action for effector T cells: they abrogate stromal-mediated chemoresistance. Capitalizing upon the interplay between chemotherapy and immunotherapy holds high potential for cancer treatment.",1
Fanconi Anemia Proteins Function in Mitophagy and Immunity.,"Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway genes are important tumor suppressors whose best-characterized function is repair of damaged nuclear DNA. Here, we describe an essential role for FA genes in two forms of selective autophagy. Genetic deletion of Fancc blocks the autophagic clearance of viruses (virophagy) and increases susceptibility to lethal viral encephalitis. Fanconi anemia complementation group C (FANCC) protein interacts with Parkin, is required in vitro and in vivo for clearance of damaged mitochondria, and decreases mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and inflammasome activation. The mitophagy function of FANCC is genetically distinct from its role in genomic DNA damage repair. Moreover, additional genes in the FA pathway, including FANCA, FANCF, FANCL, FANCD2, BRCA1, and BRCA2, are required for mitophagy. Thus, members of the FA pathway represent a previously undescribed class of selective autophagy genes that function in immunity and organellar homeostasis. These findings have implications for understanding the pathogenesis of FA and cancers associated with mutations in FA genes.",1
Brain-Region-Specific Organoids Using Mini-bioreactors for Modeling ZIKV Exposure.,"Cerebral organoids, three-dimensional cultures that model organogenesis, provide a new platform to investigate human brain development. High cost, variability, and tissue heterogeneity limit their broad applications. Here, we developed a miniaturized spinning bioreactor (SpinOmega) to generate forebrain-specific organoids from human iPSCs. These organoids recapitulate key features of human cortical development, including progenitor zone organization, neurogenesis, gene expression, and, notably, a distinct human-specific outer radial glia cell layer. We also developed protocols for midbrain and hypothalamic organoids. Finally, we employed the forebrain organoid platform to model Zika virus (ZIKV) exposure. Quantitative analyses revealed preferential, productive infection of neural progenitors with either African or Asian ZIKV strains. ZIKV infection leads to increased cell death and reduced proliferation, resulting in decreased neuronal cell-layer volume resembling microcephaly. Together, our brain-region-specific organoids and SpinOmega provide an accessible and versatile platform for modeling human brain development and disease and for compound testing, including potential ZIKV antiviral drugs.",1
Crystal Structure of Cpf1 in Complex with Guide RNA and Target DNA.,"Cpf1 is an RNA-guided endonuclease of a type V CRISPR-Cas system that has been recently harnessed for genome editing. Here, we report the crystal structure of Acidaminococcus sp. Cpf1 (AsCpf1) in complex with the guide RNA and its target DNA at 2.8 A resolution. AsCpf1 adopts a bilobed architecture, with the RNA-DNA heteroduplex bound inside the central channel. The structural comparison of AsCpf1 with Cas9, a type II CRISPR-Cas nuclease, reveals both striking similarity and major differences, thereby explaining their distinct functionalities. AsCpf1 contains the RuvC domain and a putative novel nuclease domain, which are responsible for cleaving the non-target and target strands, respectively, and for jointly generating staggered DNA double-strand breaks. AsCpf1 recognizes the 5'-TTTN-3' protospacer adjacent motif by base and shape readout mechanisms. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into RNA-guided DNA cleavage by Cpf1 and establish a framework for rational engineering of the CRISPR-Cpf1 toolbox.",1
Whole-Genome Sequencing of a Healthy Aging Cohort.,"Studies of long-lived individuals have revealed few genetic mechanisms for protection against age-associated disease. Therefore, we pursued genome sequencing of a related phenotype-healthy aging-to understand the genetics of disease-free aging without medical intervention. In contrast with studies of exceptional longevity, usually focused on centenarians, healthy aging is not associated with known longevity variants, but is associated with reduced genetic susceptibility to Alzheimer and coronary artery disease. Additionally, healthy aging is not associated with a decreased rate of rare pathogenic variants, potentially indicating the presence of disease-resistance factors. In keeping with this possibility, we identify suggestive common and rare variant genetic associations implying that protection against cognitive decline is a genetic component of healthy aging. These findings, based on a relatively small cohort, require independent replication. Overall, our results suggest healthy aging is an overlapping but distinct phenotype from exceptional longevity that may be enriched with disease-protective genetic factors. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",1
The Dynamic Regulatory Genome of Capsaspora and the Origin of Animal Multicellularity.,"The unicellular ancestor of animals had a complex repertoire of genes linked to multicellular processes. This suggests that changes in the regulatory genome, rather than in gene innovation, were key to the origin of animals. Here, we carry out multiple functional genomic assays in Capsaspora owczarzaki, the unicellular relative of animals with the largest known gene repertoire for transcriptional regulation. We show that changing chromatin states, differential lincRNA expression, and dynamic cis-regulatory sites are associated with life cycle transitions in Capsaspora. Moreover, we demonstrate conservation of animal developmental transcription-factor networks and extensive network interconnection in this premetazoan organism. In contrast, however, Capsaspora lacks animal promoter types, and its regulatory sites are small, proximal, and lack signatures of animal enhancers. Overall, our results indicate that the emergence of animal multicellularity was linked to a major shift in genome cis-regulatory complexity, most notably the appearance of distal enhancer regulation.",1
A Tension-Based Model Distinguishes Hypertrophic versus Dilated Cardiomyopathy.,"The heart either hypertrophies or dilates in response to familial mutations in genes encoding sarcomeric proteins, which are responsible for contraction and pumping. These mutations typically alter calcium-dependent tension generation within the sarcomeres, but how this translates into the spectrum of hypertrophic versus dilated cardiomyopathy is unknown. By generating a series of cardiac-specific mouse models that permit the systematic tuning of sarcomeric tension generation and calcium fluxing, we identify a significant relationship between the magnitude of tension developed over time and heart growth. When formulated into a computational model, the integral of myofilament tension development predicts hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies in mice associated with essentially any sarcomeric gene mutations, but also accurately predicts human cardiac phenotypes from data generated in induced-pluripotent-stem-cell-derived myocytes from familial cardiomyopathy patients. This tension-based model also has the potential to inform pharmacologic treatment options in cardiomyopathy patients.",1
"Trimeric HIV-1-Env Structures Define Glycan Shields from Clades A, B, and G.","The HIV-1-envelope (Env) trimer is covered by a glycan shield of approximately 90 N-linked oligosaccharides, which comprises roughly half its mass and is a key component of HIV evasion from humoral immunity. To understand how antibodies can overcome the barriers imposed by the glycan shield, we crystallized fully glycosylated Env trimers from clades A, B, and G, visualizing the shield at 3.4-3.7 A resolution. These structures reveal the HIV-1-glycan shield to comprise a network of interlocking oligosaccharides, substantially ordered by glycan crowding, that encase the protein component of Env and enable HIV-1 to avoid most antibody-mediated neutralization. The revealed features delineate a taxonomy of N-linked glycan-glycan interactions. Crowded and dispersed glycans are differently ordered, conserved, processed, and recognized by antibody. The structures, along with glycan-array binding and molecular dynamics, reveal a diversity in oligosaccharide affinity and a requirement for accommodating glycans among known broadly neutralizing antibodies that target the glycan-shielded trimer.",1
Progranulin Deficiency Promotes Circuit-Specific Synaptic Pruning by Microglia via Complement Activation.,"Microglia maintain homeostasis in the brain, but whether aberrant microglial activation can cause neurodegeneration remains controversial. Here, we use transcriptome profiling to demonstrate that deficiency in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) gene progranulin (Grn) leads to an age-dependent, progressive upregulation of lysosomal and innate immunity genes, increased complement production, and enhanced synaptic pruning in microglia. During aging, Grn(-/-) mice show profound microglia infiltration and preferential elimination of inhibitory synapses in the ventral thalamus, which lead to hyperexcitability in the thalamocortical circuits and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)-like grooming behaviors. Remarkably, deleting C1qa gene significantly reduces synaptic pruning by Grn(-/-) microglia and mitigates neurodegeneration, behavioral phenotypes, and premature mortality in Grn(-/-) mice. Together, our results uncover a previously unrecognized role of progranulin in suppressing aberrant microglia activation during aging. These results represent an important conceptual advance that complement activation and microglia-mediated synaptic pruning are major drivers, rather than consequences, of neurodegeneration caused by progranulin deficiency.",1
SnapShot: Mechanical Forces in Development I.,"Cell-type-specific F-actin structures and myosin motors are key generators of the forces that drive tissue morphogenesis in developing organisms. These cytoskeletal elements mediate defined cell deformation and control the arrangement of cell-cell contacts. This SnapShot presents a selection of morphogenetic processes, the analysis of which has pioneered specific types of F-actin/myosin-mediated force generation in development.",1
A Small Molecule RAS-Mimetic Disrupts RAS Association with Effector Proteins to Block Signaling.,"Oncogenic activation of RAS genes via point mutations occurs in 20%-30% of human cancers. The development of effective RAS inhibitors has been challenging, necessitating new approaches to inhibit this oncogenic protein. Functional studies have shown that the switch region of RAS interacts with a large number of effector proteins containing a common RAS-binding domain (RBD). Because RBD-mediated interactions are essential for RAS signaling, blocking RBD association with small molecules constitutes an attractive therapeutic approach. Here, we present evidence that rigosertib, a styryl-benzyl sulfone, acts as a RAS-mimetic and interacts with the RBDs of RAF kinases, resulting in their inability to bind to RAS, disruption of RAF activation, and inhibition of the RAS-RAF-MEK pathway. We also find that ribosertib binds to the RBDs of Ral-GDS and PI3Ks. These results suggest that targeting of RBDs across multiple signaling pathways by rigosertib may represent an effective strategy for inactivation of RAS signaling.",1
Collective Space-Sensing Coordinates Pattern Scaling in Engineered Bacteria.,"Scale invariance refers to the maintenance of a constant ratio of developing organ size to body size. Although common, its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we examined scaling in engineered Escherichia coli that can form self-organized core-ring patterns in colonies. We found that the ring width exhibits perfect scale invariance to the colony size. Our analysis revealed a collective space-sensing mechanism, which entails sequential actions of an integral feedback loop and an incoherent feedforward loop. The integral feedback is implemented by the accumulation of a diffusive chemical produced by a colony. This accumulation, combined with nutrient consumption, sets the timing for ring initiation. The incoherent feedforward is implemented by the opposing effects of the domain size on the rate and duration of ring maturation. This mechanism emphasizes a role of timing control in achieving robust pattern scaling and provides a new perspective in examining the phenomenon in natural systems.",1
Rbfox Proteins Regulate Splicing as Part of a Large Multiprotein Complex LASR.,"Rbfox proteins control alternative splicing and posttranscriptional regulation in mammalian brain and are implicated in neurological disease. These proteins recognize the RNA sequence (U)GCAUG, but their structures and diverse roles imply a variety of protein-protein interactions. We find that nuclear Rbfox proteins are bound within a large assembly of splicing regulators (LASR), a multimeric complex containing the proteins hnRNP M, hnRNP H, hnRNP C, Matrin3, NF110/NFAR-2, NF45, and DDX5, all approximately equimolar to Rbfox. We show that splicing repression mediated by hnRNP M is stimulated by Rbfox. Virtually all the intron-bound Rbfox is associated with LASR, and hnRNP M motifs are enriched adjacent to Rbfox crosslinking sites in vivo. These findings demonstrate that Rbfox proteins bind RNA with a defined set of cofactors and affect a broader set of exons than previously recognized. The function of this multimeric LASR complex has implications for deciphering the regulatory codes controlling splicing networks.",1
On the Dependency of Cellular Protein Levels on mRNA Abundance.,"The question of how genomic information is expressed to determine phenotypes is of central importance for basic and translational life science research and has been studied by transcriptomic and proteomic profiling. Here, we review the relationship between protein and mRNA levels under various scenarios, such as steady state, long-term state changes, and short-term adaptation, demonstrating the complexity of gene expression regulation, especially during dynamic transitions. The spatial and temporal variations of mRNAs, as well as the local availability of resources for protein biosynthesis, strongly influence the relationship between protein levels and their coding transcripts. We further discuss the buffering of mRNA fluctuations at the level of protein concentrations. We conclude that transcript levels by themselves are not sufficient to predict protein levels in many scenarios and to thus explain genotype-phenotype relationships and that high-quality data quantifying different levels of gene expression are indispensable for the complete understanding of biological processes.",1
Targeting Neural Circuits.,"Optogenetic methodology enables direct targeting of specific neural circuit elements for inhibition or excitation while spanning timescales from the acute (milliseconds) to the chronic (many days or more). Although the impact of this temporal versatility and cellular specificity has been greater for basic science than clinical research, it is natural to ask whether the dynamic patterns of neural circuit activity discovered to be causal in adaptive or maladaptive behaviors could become targets for treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases. Here, we consider the landscape of ideas related to therapeutic targeting of circuit dynamics. Specifically, we highlight optical, ultrasonic, and magnetic concepts for the targeted control of neural activity, preclinical/clinical discovery opportunities, and recently reported optogenetically guided clinical outcomes.",1
Multimodal Signal Integration for Feeding Control.,"Feeding is arguably one of the most well-conserved and important adaptive behaviors across all species. In this issue of Cell, Yapici et al. use a novel real-time feeding assay in Drosophila flies to identify a neural circuit that integrates gustatory input and hunger state to modulate food ingestion.",1
A New Pillar in Pilus Assembly.,"Pilus assembly in bacteria typically occurs by one of four pathways. In the study by Xu et al., the structures of 20 pilin subunits of human oral and gut Bacteroidales are elucidated, revealing a new pilin superfamily, assembled into pili by a distinct fifth pathway.",1
Wormhole Travel for Macrophages.,"Leukocyte recruitment is generally achieved by rapid migration of inflammatory cells out of circulation, through modified blood vessels, and into affected tissues. Now, Wang and Kubes show that macrophages can be rapidly recruited from body cavities to the liver, via a non-vascular route, where they help to coordinate tissue repair.",1
Engineering Models to Scale.,"Developing organisms can regulate and scale patterns to achieve consistent proportions despite immense changes in size. In this issue, Cao et al. build a model system, using engineered E. coli, to understand how regulatory dynamics can produce pattern scaling without the need for a morphogen gradient.",1
Partnering with Big Pharma-What Academics Need to Know.,"Knowledge of the parameters of drug development can greatly aid academic scientists hoping to partner with pharmaceutical companies. Here, we discuss the three major pillars of drug development-pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity studies-which, in addition to pre-clinical efficacy, are critical for partnering with Big Pharma to produce novel therapeutics.",1
Humanized Anti-IL-5 Antibody Therapy.,"Eosinophils are suppressed by a new class of drugs targeting Interleukin-5 (IL-5), an eosinophil growth, activation, and survival factor. Humanized anti-IL-5 antibodies are effective in treating asthma patients with the severe eosinophilic form of the disease and are the first new class of asthma drugs approved in 12 years.",1
Pooled ChIP-Seq Links Variation in Transcription Factor Binding to Complex Disease Risk.,"Cis-regulatory elements such as transcription factor (TF) binding sites can be identified genome-wide, but it remains far more challenging to pinpoint genetic variants affecting TF binding. Here, we introduce a pooling-based approach to mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for molecular-level traits. Applying this to five TFs and a histone modification, we mapped thousands of cis-acting QTLs, with over 25-fold lower cost compared to standard QTL mapping. We found that single genetic variants frequently affect binding of multiple TFs, and CTCF can recruit all five TFs to its binding sites. These QTLs often affect local chromatin and transcription but can also influence long-range chromosomal contacts, demonstrating a role for natural genetic variation in chromosomal architecture. Thousands of these QTLs have been implicated in genome-wide association studies, providing candidate molecular mechanisms for many disease risk loci and suggesting that TF binding variation may underlie a large fraction of human phenotypic variation.",1
Oncogenic KRAS Regulates Tumor Cell Signaling via Stromal Reciprocation.,"Oncogenic mutations regulate signaling within both tumor cells and adjacent stromal cells. Here, we show that oncogenic KRAS (KRAS(G12D)) also regulates tumor cell signaling via stromal cells. By combining cell-specific proteome labeling with multivariate phosphoproteomics, we analyzed heterocellular KRAS(G12D) signaling in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) cells. Tumor cell KRAS(G12D) engages heterotypic fibroblasts, which subsequently instigate reciprocal signaling in the tumor cells. Reciprocal signaling employs additional kinases and doubles the number of regulated signaling nodes from cell-autonomous KRAS(G12D). Consequently, reciprocal KRAS(G12D) produces a tumor cell phosphoproteome and total proteome that is distinct from cell-autonomous KRAS(G12D) alone. Reciprocal signaling regulates tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis and increases mitochondrial capacity via an IGF1R/AXL-AKT axis. These results demonstrate that oncogene signaling should be viewed as a heterocellular process and that our existing cell-autonomous perspective underrepresents the extent of oncogene signaling in cancer. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",1
"Asprosin, a Fasting-Induced Glucogenic Protein Hormone.","Hepatic glucose release into the circulation is vital for brain function and survival during periods of fasting and is modulated by an array of hormones that precisely regulate plasma glucose levels. We have identified a fasting-induced protein hormone that modulates hepatic glucose release. It is the C-terminal cleavage product of profibrillin, and we name it Asprosin. Asprosin is secreted by white adipose, circulates at nanomolar levels, and is recruited to the liver, where it activates the G protein-cAMP-PKA pathway, resulting in rapid glucose release into the circulation. Humans and mice with insulin resistance show pathologically elevated plasma asprosin, and its loss of function via immunologic or genetic means has a profound glucose- and insulin-lowering effect secondary to reduced hepatic glucose release. Asprosin represents a glucogenic protein hormone, and therapeutically targeting it may be beneficial in type II diabetes and metabolic syndrome.",1
3D RNA and Functional Interactions from Evolutionary Couplings.,"Non-coding RNAs are ubiquitous, but the discovery of new RNA gene sequences far outpaces the research on the structure and functional interactions of these RNA gene sequences. We mine the evolutionary sequence record to derive precise information about the function and structure of RNAs and RNA-protein complexes. As in protein structure prediction, we use maximum entropy global probability models of sequence co-variation to infer evolutionarily constrained nucleotide-nucleotide interactions within RNA molecules and nucleotide-amino acid interactions in RNA-protein complexes. The predicted contacts allow all-atom blinded 3D structure prediction at good accuracy for several known RNA structures and RNA-protein complexes. For unknown structures, we predict contacts in 160 non-coding RNA families. Beyond 3D structure prediction, evolutionary couplings help identify important functional interactions-e.g., at switch points in riboswitches and at a complex nucleation site in HIV. Aided by increasing sequence accumulation, evolutionary coupling analysis can accelerate the discovery of functional interactions and 3D structures involving RNA.",1
Rapid Inflammasome Activation following Mucosal SIV Infection of Rhesus Monkeys.,"The earliest events following mucosal HIV-1 infection, prior to measurable viremia, remain poorly understood. Here, by detailed necropsy studies, we show that the virus can rapidly disseminate following mucosal SIV infection of rhesus monkeys and trigger components of the inflammasome, both at the site of inoculation and at early sites of distal virus spread. By 24 hr following inoculation, a proinflammatory signature that lacked antiviral restriction factors was observed in viral RNA-positive tissues. The early innate response included expression of NLRX1, which inhibits antiviral responses, and activation of the TGF-beta pathway, which negatively regulates adaptive immune responses. These data suggest a model in which the virus triggers specific host mechanisms that suppress the generation of antiviral innate and adaptive immune responses in the first few days of infection, thus facilitating its own replication. These findings have important implications for the development of vaccines and other strategies to prevent infection.",1
Transcriptional Regulators Compete with Nucleosomes Post-replication.,"Every nucleosome across the genome must be disrupted and reformed when the replication fork passes, but how chromatin organization is re-established following replication is unknown. To address this problem, we have developed Mapping In vivo Nascent Chromatin with EdU and sequencing (MINCE-seq) to characterize the genome-wide location of nucleosomes and other chromatin proteins behind replication forks at high temporal and spatial resolution. We find that the characteristic chromatin landscape at Drosophila promoters and enhancers is lost upon replication. The most conspicuous changes are at promoters that have high levels of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) stalling and DNA accessibility and show specific enrichment for the BRM remodeler. Enhancer chromatin is also disrupted during replication, suggesting a role for transcription factor (TF) competition in nucleosome re-establishment. Thus, the characteristic nucleosome landscape emerges from a uniformly packaged genome by the action of TFs, RNAPII, and remodelers minutes after replication fork passage.",1
Cell-to-Cell Variation in p53 Dynamics Leads to Fractional Killing.,"Many chemotherapeutic drugs kill only a fraction of cancer cells, limiting their efficacy. We used live-cell imaging to investigate the role of p53 dynamics in fractional killing of colon cancer cells in response to chemotherapy. We found that both surviving and dying cells reach similar levels of p53, indicating that cell death is not determined by a fixed p53 threshold. Instead, a cell's probability of death depends on the time and levels of p53. Cells must reach a threshold level of p53 to execute apoptosis, and this threshold increases with time. The increase in p53 apoptotic threshold is due to drug-dependent induction of anti-apoptotic genes, predominantly in the inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) family. Our study underlines the importance of measuring the dynamics of key players in response to chemotherapy to determine mechanisms of resistance and optimize the timing of combination therapy.",1
Mechanism of NMDA Receptor Inhibition and Activation.,"N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are glutamate-gated, calcium-permeable ion channels that mediate synaptic transmission and underpin learning and memory. NMDAR dysfunction is directly implicated in diseases ranging from seizure to ischemia. Despite its fundamental importance, little is known about how the NMDAR transitions between inactive and active states and how small molecules inhibit or activate ion channel gating. Here, we report electron cryo-microscopy structures of the GluN1-GluN2B NMDA receptor in an ensemble of competitive antagonist-bound states, an agonist-bound form, and a state bound with agonists and the allosteric inhibitor Ro25-6981. Together with double electron-electron resonance experiments, we show how competitive antagonists rupture the ligand binding domain (LBD) gating ""ring,"" how agonists retain the ring in a dimer-of-dimers configuration, and how allosteric inhibitors, acting within the amino terminal domain, further stabilize the LBD layer. These studies illuminate how the LBD gating ring is fundamental to signal transduction and gating in NMDARs.",1
A Reservoir of Mature Cavity Macrophages that Can Rapidly Invade Visceral Organs to Affect Tissue Repair.,"A key feature of inflammation is the timely recruitment of leukocytes, including monocytes, from blood into tissues, the latter maturing into macrophages over a period of 2-3 days. Using multi-channel spinning disk microscopy, we identified a rapid pathway of macrophage recruitment into an injured organ via a non-vascular route requiring no maturation from monocytes. In response to a sterile injury in liver, a reservoir of fully mature F4/80(hi)GATA6(+) peritoneal cavity macrophages rapidly invaded into afflicted tissue via direct recruitment across the mesothelium. The invasion was dependent on CD44 and DAMP molecule ATP and resulted in rapid replication and switching of macrophage toward an alternatively activated phenotype. These macrophages dismantled the nuclei of necrotic cells releasing DNA and forming a cover across the injury site. Rapid invasion of mature macrophages from body cavity with capacity for induction of reparative phenotype may impact altered tissues ranging from trauma to infections to cancer. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",1
A Distinct Type of Pilus from the Human Microbiome.,"Pili are proteinaceous polymers of linked pilins that protrude from the cell surface of many bacteria and often mediate adherence and virulence. We investigated a set of 20 Bacteroidia pilins from the human microbiome whose structures and mechanism of assembly were unknown. Crystal structures and biochemical data revealed a diverse protein superfamily with a common Greek-key beta sandwich fold with two transthyretin-like repeats that polymerize into a pilus through a strand-exchange mechanism. The assembly mechanism of the central, structural pilins involves proteinase-assisted removal of their N-terminal beta strand, creating an extended hydrophobic groove that binds the C-terminal donor strands of the incoming pilin. Accessory pilins at the tip and base have unique structural features specific to their location, allowing initiation or termination of the assembly. The Bacteroidia pilus, therefore, has a biogenesis mechanism that is distinct from other known pili and likely represents a different type of bacterial pilus.",1
Steroid Receptors Reprogram FoxA1 Occupancy through Dynamic Chromatin Transitions.,"The estrogen receptor (ER), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and forkhead box protein 1 (FoxA1) are significant factors in breast cancer progression. FoxA1 has been implicated in establishing ER-binding patterns though its unique ability to serve as a pioneer factor. However, the molecular interplay between ER, GR, and FoxA1 requires further investigation. Here we show that ER and GR both have the ability to alter the genomic distribution of the FoxA1 pioneer factor. Single-molecule tracking experiments in live cells reveal a highly dynamic interaction of FoxA1 with chromatin in vivo. Furthermore, the FoxA1 factor is not associated with detectable footprints at its binding sites throughout the genome. These findings support a model wherein interactions between transcription factors and pioneer factors are highly dynamic. Moreover, at a subset of genomic sites, the role of pioneer can be reversed, with the steroid receptors serving to enhance binding of FoxA1.",1
Single-Cell RNA-Seq Reveals Lineage and X Chromosome Dynamics in Human Preimplantation Embryos.,"Mouse studies have been instrumental in forming our current understanding of early cell-lineage decisions; however, similar insights into the early human development are severely limited. Here, we present a comprehensive transcriptional map of human embryo development, including the sequenced transcriptomes of 1,529 individual cells from 88 human preimplantation embryos. These data show that cells undergo an intermediate state of co-expression of lineage-specific genes, followed by a concurrent establishment of the trophectoderm, epiblast, and primitive endoderm lineages, which coincide with blastocyst formation. Female cells of all three lineages achieve dosage compensation of X chromosome RNA levels prior to implantation. However, in contrast to the mouse, XIST is transcribed from both alleles throughout the progression of this expression dampening, and X chromosome genes maintain biallelic expression while dosage compensation proceeds. We envision broad utility of this transcriptional atlas in future studies on human development as well as in stem cell research.",1
A Glial K/Cl Transporter Controls Neuronal Receptive Ending Shape by Chloride Inhibition of an rGC.,"Neurons receive input from the outside world or from other neurons through neuronal receptive endings (NREs). Glia envelop NREs to create specialized microenvironments; however, glial functions at these sites are poorly understood. Here, we report a molecular mechanism by which glia control NRE shape and associated animal behavior. The C. elegans AMsh glial cell ensheathes the NREs of 12 neurons, including the thermosensory neuron AFD. KCC-3, a K/Cl transporter, localizes specifically to a glial microdomain surrounding AFD receptive ending microvilli, where it regulates K(+) and Cl(-) levels. We find that Cl(-) ions function as direct inhibitors of an NRE-localized receptor-guanylyl-cyclase, GCY-8, which synthesizes cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). High cGMP mediates the effects of glial KCC-3 on AFD shape by antagonizing the actin regulator WSP-1/NWASP. Components of this pathway are broadly expressed throughout the nervous system, suggesting that ionic regulation of the NRE microenvironment may be a conserved mechanism by which glia control neuron shape and function.",1
The CDK-APC/C Oscillator Predominantly Entrains Periodic Cell-Cycle Transcription.,"Throughout cell-cycle progression, the expression of multiple transcripts oscillate, and whether these are under the centralized control of the CDK-APC/C proteins or can be driven by a de-centralized transcription factor (TF) cascade is a fundamental question for understanding cell-cycle regulation. In budding yeast, we find that the transcription of nearly all genes, as assessed by RNA-seq or fluorescence microscopy in single cells, is dictated by CDK-APC/C. Three exceptional genes are transcribed in a pulsatile pattern in a variety of CDK-APC/C arrests. Pursuing one of these transcripts, the SIC1 inhibitor of B-type cyclins, we use a combination of mathematical modeling and experimentation to provide evidence that, counter-intuitively, Sic1 provides a failsafe mechanism promoting nuclear division when levels of mitotic cyclins are low.",1
RNA Polymerase II Regulates Topoisomerase 1 Activity to Favor Efficient Transcription.,"We report a mechanism through which the transcription machinery directly controls topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) activity to adjust DNA topology throughout the transcription cycle. By comparing TOP1 occupancy using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) versus TOP1 activity using topoisomerase 1 sequencing (TOP1-seq), a method reported here to map catalytically engaged TOP1, TOP1 bound at promoters was discovered to become fully active only after pause-release. This transition coupled the phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal-domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) with stimulation of TOP1 above its basal rate, enhancing its processivity. TOP1 stimulation is strongly dependent on the kinase activity of BRD4, a protein that phosphorylates Ser2-CTD and regulates RNAPII pause-release. Thus the coordinated action of BRD4 and TOP1 overcame the torsional stress opposing transcription as RNAPII commenced elongation but preserved negative supercoiling that assists promoter melting at start sites. This nexus between transcription and DNA topology promises to elicit new strategies to intercept pathological gene expression.",1
Suppression of Enhancer Overactivation by a RACK7-Histone Demethylase Complex.,"Regulation of enhancer activity is important for controlling gene expression programs. Here, we report that a biochemical complex containing a potential chromatin reader, RACK7, and the histone lysine 4 tri-methyl (H3K4me3)-specific demethylase KDM5C occupies many active enhancers, including almost all super-enhancers. Loss of RACK7 or KDM5C results in overactivation of enhancers, characterized by the deposition of H3K4me3 and H3K27Ac, together with increased transcription of eRNAs and nearby genes. Furthermore, loss of RACK7 or KDM5C leads to de-repression of S100A oncogenes and various cancer-related phenotypes. Our findings reveal a RACK7/KDM5C-regulated, dynamic interchange between histone H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 at active enhancers, representing an additional layer of regulation of enhancer activity. We propose that RACK7/KDM5C functions as an enhancer ""brake"" to ensure appropriate enhancer activity, which, when compromised, could contribute to tumorigenesis.",1
A Vulnerability of a Subset of Colon Cancers with Potential Clinical Utility.,"BRAF(V600E) mutant colon cancers (CCs) have a characteristic gene expression signature that is also found in some tumors lacking this mutation. Collectively, they are referred to as ""BRAF-like"" tumors and represent some 20% of CCs. We used a shRNA-based genetic screen focused on genes upregulated in BRAF(V600E) CCs to identify vulnerabilities of this tumor subtype that might be exploited therapeutically. Here, we identify RANBP2 (also known as NUP358) as essential for survival of BRAF-like, but not for non-BRAF-like, CC cells. Suppression of RANBP2 results in mitotic defects only in BRAF-like CC cells, leading to cell death. Mechanistically, RANBP2 silencing reduces microtubule outgrowth from the kinetochores, thereby inducing spindle perturbations, providing an explanation for the observed mitotic defects. We find that BRAF-like CCs display far greater sensitivity to the microtubule poison vinorelbine both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that vinorelbine is a potential tailored treatment for BRAF-like CCs.",1
Core Circadian Clock Genes Regulate Leukemia Stem Cells in AML.,"Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) have the capacity to self-renew and propagate disease upon serial transplantation in animal models, and elimination of this cell population is required for curative therapies. Here, we describe a series of pooled, in vivo RNAi screens to identify essential transcription factors (TFs) in a murine model of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with genetically and phenotypically defined LSCs. These screens reveal the heterodimeric, circadian rhythm TFs Clock and Bmal1 as genes required for the growth of AML cells in vitro and in vivo. Disruption of canonical circadian pathway components produces anti-leukemic effects, including impaired proliferation, enhanced myeloid differentiation, and depletion of LSCs. We find that both normal and malignant hematopoietic cells harbor an intact clock with robust circadian oscillations, and genetic knockout models reveal a leukemia-specific dependence on the pathway. Our findings establish a role for the core circadian clock genes in AML.",1
Microbiome and Anticancer Immunosurveillance.,"Anticancer immune responses can be considered a desirable form of autoimmunity that may be profoundly shaped by the microbiome. Here, we discuss evidence for the microbiome's influence on anti-tumor immunosurveillance, including those that are indirect and can act at a distance, and we put forward hypotheses regarding mechanisms of how these effects are implemented. These may involve cross-reactivity between microbial and tumor antigens shaping T cell repertoires and/or microbial products stimulating pattern recognition receptors that influence the type and intensity of immune responses. Understanding how the microbiome impacts natural cancer immunosurveillance as well as treatment-induced immune responses will pave the way for more effective therapies and prophylactics.",1
Combination Cancer Therapies with Immune Checkpoint Blockade: Convergence on Interferon Signaling.,"Improving efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade for cancer can be facilitated by combining these agents with each other and/or with other conventional or targeted therapies. Interferon and innate immune signaling pathways in immune and tumor cells have emerged as intriguing determinants of response and resistance, often in complex and seemingly paradoxical ways.",1
A Friend in Need (of Nutrients) Is a....,"Endophytic fungi are found within the roots of healthy plants, but their function is poorly understood. In this issue, Hiruma et al. demonstrate that, under phosphate-limiting conditions, the endophytic fungus, Colletotrichum tofieldiae, provides growth-promoting and fitness benefits to Arabidopsis, but the plant must restrict fungal growth or risk pathogenesis.",1
CSR-1 Slices a Balance.,"CSR-1 is a germline-expressed C. elegans Argonaute protein essential for viability. In this issue of Cell, Gerson-Gurwitz et al. now demonstrate a role for CSR-1 and its slicer activity in downregulating the levels of maternally deposited mRNAs to fine-tune the expression of proteins with critical roles in embryonic cell divisions.",1
SMITten by the Speed of Splicing.,"Splicing occurs co-transcriptionally, but relative rates of splicing and transcription that might reveal mechanisms of their coordinated control have remained mysterious. Now, Carrillo Oesterreich et al. show that the fastest introns are gone nearly as soon as the 3' splice site is transcribed and that introns have distinct splicing kinetics with respect to polymerase progression along the gene.",1
Insulin Signaling in a Bit of a Jam.,"In this issue of Cell, Okin and Medzhitov report that sustained inflammation promotes hyperglycemia by targeting the mevalonate pathway. This represents an important step forward in understanding the mechanisms underlying the association between chronic low-grade inflammation and disruption of normal tissue functions in metabolic diseases.",1
A Time Bomb for Leukemia.,"Alterations of the circadian clock have been linked to cancer development. Puram et al. (in this issue) now uncover differential requirements between healthy hematopoietic and diseased leukemic stem cells for core circadian transcription factors, wherein leukemic cells depend on the clock machinery for survival and growth.",1
A Guide to Packing Your DNA.,"Genetic material is not randomly organized within the nucleus of a cell. How this organization occurs and why it matters are questions that Cell editor Marta Koch posed to Mitchell Guttman, Job Dekker, and Stavros Lomvardas. Excerpts from this Conversation are presented below, and an audio file of the full discussion is available with the article online.",1
The Antagonistic Gene Paralogs Upf3a and Upf3b Govern Nonsense-Mediated RNA Decay.,"Gene duplication is a major evolutionary force driving adaptation and speciation, as it allows for the acquisition of new functions and can augment or diversify existing functions. Here, we report a gene duplication event that yielded another outcome--the generation of antagonistic functions. One product of this duplication event--UPF3B--is critical for the nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) pathway, while its autosomal counterpart--UPF3A--encodes an enigmatic protein previously shown to have trace NMD activity. Using loss-of-function approaches in vitro and in vivo, we discovered that UPF3A acts primarily as a potent NMD inhibitor that stabilizes hundreds of transcripts. Evidence suggests that UPF3A acquired repressor activity through simple impairment of a critical domain, a rapid mechanism that may have been widely used in evolution. Mice conditionally lacking UPF3A exhibit ""hyper"" NMD and display defects in embryogenesis and gametogenesis. Our results support a model in which UPF3A serves as a molecular rheostat that directs developmental events.",1
TRIBE: Hijacking an RNA-Editing Enzyme to Identify Cell-Specific Targets of RNA-Binding Proteins.,"RNA transcripts are bound and regulated by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Current methods for identifying in vivo targets of an RBP are imperfect and not amenable to examining small numbers of cells. To address these issues, we developed TRIBE (targets of RNA-binding proteins identified by editing), a technique that couples an RBP to the catalytic domain of the Drosophila RNA-editing enzyme ADAR and expresses the fusion protein in vivo. RBP targets are marked with novel RNA editing events and identified by sequencing RNA. We have used TRIBE to identify the targets of three RBPs (Hrp48, dFMR1, and NonA). TRIBE compares favorably to other methods, including CLIP, and we have identified RBP targets from as little as 150 specific fly neurons. TRIBE can be performed without an antibody and in small numbers of specific cells.",1
Personalized Immunomonitoring Uncovers Molecular Networks that Stratify Lupus Patients.,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by loss of tolerance to nucleic acids and highly diverse clinical manifestations. To assess its molecular heterogeneity, we longitudinally profiled the blood transcriptome of 158 pediatric patients. Using mixed models accounting for repeated measurements, demographics, treatment, disease activity (DA), and nephritis class, we confirmed a prevalent IFN signature and identified a plasmablast signature as the most robust biomarker of DA. We detected gradual enrichment of neutrophil transcripts during progression to active nephritis and distinct signatures in response to treatment in different nephritis subclasses. Importantly, personalized immunomonitoring uncovered individual correlates of disease activity that enabled patient stratification into seven groups, supported by patient genotypes. Our study uncovers the molecular heterogeneity of SLE and provides an explanation for the failure of clinical trials. This approach may improve trial design and implementation of tailored therapies in genetically and clinically complex autoimmune diseases. PAPERCLIP.",1
Oncogenic Role of Fusion-circRNAs Derived from Cancer-Associated Chromosomal Translocations.,"Chromosomal translocations encode oncogenic fusion proteins that have been proven to be causally involved in tumorigenesis. Our understanding of whether such genomic alterations also affect non-coding RNAs is limited, and their impact on circular RNAs (circRNAs) has not been explored. Here, we show that well-established cancer-associated chromosomal translocations give rise to fusion circRNAs (f-circRNA) that are produced from transcribed exons of distinct genes affected by the translocations. F-circRNAs contribute to cellular transformation, promote cell viability and resistance upon therapy, and have tumor-promoting properties in in vivo models. Our work expands the current knowledge regarding molecular mechanisms involved in cancer onset and progression, with potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications.",1
A Taste Circuit that Regulates Ingestion by Integrating Food and Hunger Signals.,"Ingestion is a highly regulated behavior that integrates taste and hunger cues to balance food intake with metabolic needs. To study the dynamics of ingestion in the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster, we developed Expresso, an automated feeding assay that measures individual meal-bouts with high temporal resolution at nanoliter scale. Flies showed discrete, temporally precise ingestion that was regulated by hunger state and sucrose concentration. We identify 12 cholinergic local interneurons (IN1, for ""ingestion neurons"") necessary for this behavior. Sucrose ingestion caused a rapid and persistent increase in IN1 interneuron activity in fasted flies that decreased proportionally in response to subsequent feeding bouts. Sucrose responses of IN1 interneurons in fed flies were significantly smaller and lacked persistent activity. We propose that IN1 neurons monitor ingestion by connecting sugar-sensitive taste neurons in the pharynx to neural circuits that control the drive to ingest. Similar mechanisms for monitoring and regulating ingestion may exist in vertebrates.",1
Innate Lymphocyte/Ly6C(hi) Monocyte Crosstalk Promotes Klebsiella Pneumoniae Clearance.,"Increasing antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens has rendered some infections untreatable with available antibiotics. Klebsiella pneumoniae, a bacterial pathogen that has acquired high-level antibiotic resistance, is a common cause of pulmonary infections. Optimal clearance of K. pneumoniae from the host lung requires TNF and IL-17A. Herein, we demonstrate that inflammatory monocytes are rapidly recruited to the lungs of K. pneumoniae-infected mice and produce TNF, which markedly increases the frequency of IL-17-producing innate lymphoid cells. While pulmonary clearance of K. pneumoniae is preserved in neutrophil-depleted mice, monocyte depletion or TNF deficiency impairs IL-17A-dependent resolution of pneumonia. Monocyte-mediated bacterial uptake and killing is enhanced by ILC production of IL-17A, indicating that innate lymphocytes engage in a positive-feedback loop with monocytes that promotes clearance of pneumonia. Innate immune defense against a highly antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogen depends on crosstalk between inflammatory monocytes and innate lymphocytes that is mediated by TNF and IL-17A.",1
Splicing of Nascent RNA Coincides with Intron Exit from RNA Polymerase II.,"Protein-coding genes in eukaryotes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and introns are removed from pre-mRNA by the spliceosome. Understanding the time lag between Pol II progression and splicing could provide mechanistic insights into the regulation of gene expression. Here, we present two single-molecule nascent RNA sequencing methods that directly determine the progress of splicing catalysis as a function of Pol II position. Endogenous genes were analyzed on a global scale in budding yeast. We show that splicing is 50% complete when Pol II is only 45 nt downstream of introns, with the first spliced products observed as introns emerge from Pol II. Perturbations that slow the rate of spliceosome assembly or speed up the rate of transcription caused splicing delays, showing that regulation of both processes determines in vivo splicing profiles. We propose that matched rates streamline the gene expression pathway, while allowing regulation through kinetic competition.",1
Primary Cilium-Autophagy-Nrf2 (PAN) Axis Activation Commits Human Embryonic Stem Cells to a Neuroectoderm Fate.,"Under defined differentiation conditions, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can be directed toward a mesendoderm (ME) or neuroectoderm (NE) fate, the first decision during hESC differentiation. Coupled with lineage-specific G1 lengthening, a divergent ciliation pattern emerged within the first 24 hr of induced lineage specification, and these changes heralded a neuroectoderm decision before any neural precursor markers were expressed. By day 2, increased ciliation in NE precursors induced autophagy that resulted in the inactivation of Nrf2 and thereby relieved transcriptional activation of OCT4 and NANOG. Nrf2 binds directly to upstream regions of these pluripotency genes to promote their expression and repress NE derivation. Nrf2 suppression was sufficient to rescue poorly neurogenic iPSC lines. Only after these events had been initiated did neural precursor markers get expressed at day 4. Thus, we have identified a primary cilium-autophagy-Nrf2 (PAN) control axis coupled to cell-cycle progression that directs hESCs toward NE.",1
A Small RNA-Catalytic Argonaute Pathway Tunes Germline Transcript Levels to Ensure Embryonic Divisions.,"Multiple division cycles without growth are a characteristic feature of early embryogenesis. The female germline loads proteins and RNAs into oocytes to support these divisions, which lack many quality control mechanisms operating in somatic cells undergoing growth. Here, we describe a small RNA-Argonaute pathway that ensures early embryonic divisions in C. elegans by employing catalytic slicing activity to broadly tune, instead of silence, germline gene expression. Misregulation of one target, a kinesin-13 microtubule depolymerase, underlies a major phenotype associated with pathway loss. Tuning of target transcript levels is guided by the density of homologous small RNAs, whose generation must ultimately be related to target sequence. Thus, the tuning action of a small RNA-catalytic Argonaute pathway generates oocytes capable of supporting embryogenesis. We speculate that the specialized nature of germline chromatin led to the emergence of small RNA-catalytic Argonaute pathways in the female germline as a post-transcriptional control layer to optimize oocyte composition.",1
Types of Ubiquitin Ligases.,"Ubiquitination is a post-translational modification of proteins involved in a variety of cellular processes. Ubiquitination requires the sequential action of three enzymes: E1 (ubiquitin-activating enzymes), E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes), and E3 (ubiquitin ligases). This SnapShot highlights the main types of E3 ubiquitin ligases, which can be classified in three families depending on the presence of characteristic domains and on the mechanism of ubiquitin transfer to the substrate protein.",1
The Fuzzy Logic of Network Connectivity in Mouse Visual Thalamus.,"In an attempt to chart parallel sensory streams passing through the visual thalamus, we acquired a 100-trillion-voxel electron microscopy (EM) dataset and identified cohorts of retinal ganglion cell axons (RGCs) that innervated each of a diverse group of postsynaptic thalamocortical neurons (TCs). Tracing branches of these axons revealed the set of TCs innervated by each RGC cohort. Instead of finding separate sensory pathways, we found a single large network that could not be easily subdivided because individual RGCs innervated different kinds of TCs and different kinds of RGCs co-innervated individual TCs. We did find conspicuous network subdivisions organized on the basis of dendritic rather than neuronal properties. This work argues that, in the thalamus, neural circuits are not based on a canonical set of connections between intrinsically different neuronal types but, rather, may arise by experience-based mixing of different kinds of inputs onto individual postsynaptic cells.",1
Lysosomal Disorders Drive Susceptibility to Tuberculosis by Compromising Macrophage Migration.,"A zebrafish genetic screen for determinants of susceptibility to Mycobacterium marinum identified a hypersusceptible mutant deficient in lysosomal cysteine cathepsins that manifests hallmarks of human lysosomal storage diseases. Under homeostatic conditions, mutant macrophages accumulate undigested lysosomal material, which disrupts endocytic recycling and impairs their migration to, and thus engulfment of, dying cells. This causes a buildup of unengulfed cell debris. During mycobacterial infection, macrophages with lysosomal storage cannot migrate toward infected macrophages undergoing apoptosis in the tuberculous granuloma. The unengulfed apoptotic macrophages undergo secondary necrosis, causing granuloma breakdown and increased mycobacterial growth. Macrophage lysosomal storage similarly impairs migration to newly infecting mycobacteria. This phenotype is recapitulated in human smokers, who are at increased risk for tuberculosis. A majority of their alveolar macrophages exhibit lysosomal accumulations of tobacco smoke particulates and do not migrate to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The incapacitation of highly microbicidal first-responding macrophages may contribute to smokers' susceptibility to tuberculosis.",1
AgRP Neurons Control Systemic Insulin Sensitivity via Myostatin Expression in Brown Adipose Tissue.,"Activation of Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons potently promotes feeding, and chronically altering their activity also affects peripheral glucose homeostasis. We demonstrate that acute activation of AgRP neurons causes insulin resistance through impairment of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake into brown adipose tissue (BAT). AgRP neuron activation acutely reprograms gene expression in BAT toward a myogenic signature, including increased expression of myostatin. Interference with myostatin activity improves insulin sensitivity that was impaired by AgRP neurons activation. Optogenetic circuitry mapping reveals that feeding and insulin sensitivity are controlled by both distinct and overlapping projections. Stimulation of AgRP --> LHA projections impairs insulin sensitivity and promotes feeding while activation of AgRP --> anterior bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (aBNST)vl projections, distinct from AgRP --> aBNSTdm projections controlling feeding, mediate the effect of AgRP neuron activation on BAT-myostatin expression and insulin sensitivity. Collectively, our results suggest that AgRP neurons in mice induce not only eating, but also insulin resistance by stimulating expression of muscle-related genes in BAT, revealing a mechanism by which these neurons rapidly coordinate hunger states with glucose homeostasis.",1
A Tunable Mechanism Determines the Duration of the Transgenerational Small RNA Inheritance in C. elegans.,"In C. elegans, small RNAs enable transmission of epigenetic responses across multiple generations. While RNAi inheritance mechanisms that enable ""memorization"" of ancestral responses are being elucidated, the mechanisms that determine the duration of inherited silencing and the ability to forget the inherited epigenetic effects are not known. We now show that exposure to dsRNA activates a feedback loop whereby gene-specific RNAi responses dictate the transgenerational duration of RNAi responses mounted against unrelated genes, elicited separately in previous generations. RNA-sequencing analysis reveals that, aside from silencing of genes with complementary sequences, dsRNA-induced RNAi affects the production of heritable endogenous small RNAs, which regulate the expression of RNAi factors. Manipulating genes in this feedback pathway changes the duration of heritable silencing. Such active control of transgenerational effects could be adaptive, since ancestral responses would be detrimental if the environments of the progeny and the ancestors were different.",1
Long-Lived Binding of Sox2 to DNA Predicts Cell Fate in the Four-Cell Mouse Embryo.,"Transcription factor (TF) binding to DNA is fundamental for gene regulation. However, it remains unknown how the dynamics of TF-DNA interactions change during cell-fate determination in vivo. Here, we use photo-activatable FCS to quantify TF-DNA binding in single cells of developing mouse embryos. In blastocysts, the TFs Oct4 and Sox2, which control pluripotency, bind DNA more stably in pluripotent than in extraembryonic cells. By contrast, in the four-cell embryo, Sox2 engages in more long-lived interactions than does Oct4. Sox2 long-lived binding varies between blastomeres and is regulated by H3R26 methylation. Live-cell tracking demonstrates that those blastomeres with more long-lived binding contribute more pluripotent progeny, and reducing H3R26 methylation decreases long-lived binding, Sox2 target expression, and pluripotent cell numbers. Therefore, Sox2-DNA binding predicts mammalian cell fate as early as the four-cell stage. More generally, we reveal the dynamic repartitioning of TFs between DNA sites driven by physiological epigenetic changes. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",1
Heterogeneity in Oct4 and Sox2 Targets Biases Cell Fate in 4-Cell Mouse Embryos.,"The major and essential objective of pre-implantation development is to establish embryonic and extra-embryonic cell fates. To address when and how this fundamental process is initiated in mammals, we characterize transcriptomes of all individual cells throughout mouse pre-implantation development. This identifies targets of master pluripotency regulators Oct4 and Sox2 as being highly heterogeneously expressed between blastomeres of the 4-cell embryo, with Sox21 showing one of the most heterogeneous expression profiles. Live-cell tracking demonstrates that cells with decreased Sox21 yield more extra-embryonic than pluripotent progeny. Consistently, decreasing Sox21 results in premature upregulation of the differentiation regulator Cdx2, suggesting that Sox21 helps safeguard pluripotency. Furthermore, Sox21 is elevated following increased expression of the histone H3R26-methylase CARM1 and is lowered following CARM1 inhibition, indicating the importance of epigenetic regulation. Therefore, our results indicate that heterogeneous gene expression, as early as the 4-cell stage, initiates cell-fate decisions by modulating the balance of pluripotency and differentiation.",1
Metastatic Latency and Immune Evasion through Autocrine Inhibition of WNT.,"Metastasis frequently develops years after the removal of a primary tumor, from a minority of disseminated cancer cells that survived as latent entities through unknown mechanisms. We isolated latency competent cancer (LCC) cells from early stage human lung and breast carcinoma cell lines and defined the mechanisms that suppress outgrowth, support long-term survival, and maintain tumor-initiating potential in these cells during the latent metastasis stage. LCC cells show stem-cell-like characteristics and express SOX2 and SOX9 transcription factors, which are essential for their survival in host organs under immune surveillance and for metastatic outgrowth under permissive conditions. Through expression of the WNT inhibitor DKK1, LCC cells self-impose a slow-cycling state with broad downregulation of ULBP ligands for NK cells and evasion of NK-cell-mediated clearance. By expressing a Sox-dependent stem-like state and actively silencing WNT signaling, LCC cells can enter quiescence and evade innate immunity to remain latent for extended periods.",1
Ribosome Footprint Profiling of Translation throughout the Genome.,"Ribosome profiling has emerged as a technique for measuring translation comprehensively and quantitatively by deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments. By identifying the precise positions of ribosomes, footprinting experiments have unveiled key insights into the composition and regulation of the expressed proteome, including delineating potentially functional micropeptides, revealing pervasive translation on cytosolic RNAs, and identifying differences in elongation rates driven by codon usage or other factors. This Primer looks at important experimental and analytical concerns for executing ribosome profiling experiments and surveys recent examples where the approach was developed to explore protein biogenesis and homeostasis.",1
Untangling the Web between Eye and Brain.,"How is the picture of the visual scene that the eye encodes represented by neural circuits in the brain?

From the Beauty of Genomic Landscapes to the Strength of Transcriptional Mechanisms.,Genomic analyses are commonly used to infer trends and broad rules underlying transcriptional control. The innovative approach by Tong et al. to interrogate genomic datasets allows extracting mechanistic information on the specific regulation of individual genes.,1
CASTORing New Light on Amino Acid Sensing.,"The activation state of mTORC1, a master regulator of cell growth, is particularly sensitive to changes in the intracellular levels of the amino acid arginine, but the sensing mechanisms are poorly understood. In this issue of Cell, Chantranupong et al. identify CASTOR1 as a direct arginine sensor that acts through the GATOR2 complex to regulate mTORC1.",1
The Molecular Harbingers of Early Mammalian Embryo Patterning.,"Random or not, the mechanisms at play during the first cell-fate determination in mammalian embryos have been debated for years. Studies by Goolam et al. and White et al. shed new light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the intrinsic biases that lead to non-random lineage segregation in early mammalian development.",1
Capturing the Value of Biomedical Research.,"Assessing the real-world impact of biomedical research is notoriously difficult. Here, we present the framework for building a prospective science-centered information system from scratch that has been afforded by the Sidra Medical and Research Center in Qatar. This experiment is part of the global conversation on maximizing returns on research investment.",1
Root Endophyte Colletotrichum tofieldiae Confers Plant Fitness Benefits that Are Phosphate Status Dependent.,"A staggering diversity of endophytic fungi associate with healthy plants in nature, but it is usually unclear whether these represent stochastic encounters or provide host fitness benefits. Although most characterized species of the fungal genus Colletotrichum are destructive pathogens, we show here that C. tofieldiae (Ct) is an endemic endophyte in natural Arabidopsis thaliana populations in central Spain. Colonization by Ct initiates in roots but can also spread systemically into shoots. Ct transfers the macronutrient phosphorus to shoots, promotes plant growth, and increases fertility only under phosphorus-deficient conditions, a nutrient status that might have facilitated the transition from pathogenic to beneficial lifestyles. The host's phosphate starvation response (PSR) system controls Ct root colonization and is needed for plant growth promotion (PGP). PGP also requires PEN2-dependent indole glucosinolate metabolism, a component of innate immune responses, indicating a functional link between innate immunity and the PSR system during beneficial interactions with Ct.",1
Kv3.3 Channels Bind Hax-1 and Arp2/3 to Assemble a Stable Local Actin Network that Regulates Channel Gating.,"Mutations in the Kv3.3 potassium channel (KCNC3) cause cerebellar neurodegeneration and impair auditory processing. The cytoplasmic C terminus of Kv3.3 contains a proline-rich domain conserved in proteins that activate actin nucleation through Arp2/3. We found that Kv3.3 recruits Arp2/3 to the plasma membrane, resulting in formation of a relatively stable cortical actin filament network resistant to cytochalasin D that inhibits fast barbed end actin assembly. These Kv3.3-associated actin structures are required to prevent very rapid N-type channel inactivation during short depolarizations of the plasma membrane. The effects of Kv3.3 on the actin cytoskeleton are mediated by the binding of the cytoplasmic C terminus of Kv3.3 to Hax-1, an anti-apoptotic protein that regulates actin nucleation through Arp2/3. A human Kv3.3 mutation within a conserved proline-rich domain produces channels that bind Hax-1 but are impaired in recruiting Arp2/3 to the plasma membrane, resulting in growth cones with deficient actin veils in stem cell-derived neurons.",1
The Effect of Sustained Inflammation on Hepatic Mevalonate Pathway Results in Hyperglycemia.,"Control of plasma glucose level is essential to organismal survival. Sustained inflammation has been implicated in control of glucose homeostasis in cases of infection, obesity, and type 2 diabetes; however, the precise role of inflammation in these complex disease states remains poorly understood. Here, we find that sustained inflammation results in elevated plasma glucose due to increased hepatic glucose production. We find that sustained inflammation suppresses CYP7A1, leading to accumulation of intermediate metabolites at the branch point of the mevalonate pathway. This results in prenylation of RHOC, which is concomitantly induced by inflammatory cytokines. Subsequent activation of RHO-associated protein kinase results in elevated plasma glucose. These findings uncover an unexpected mechanism by which sustained inflammation alters glucose homeostasis.",1
Programmable RNA Tracking in Live Cells with CRISPR/Cas9.,"RNA-programmed genome editing using CRISPR/Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes has enabled rapid and accessible alteration of specific genomic loci in many organisms. A flexible means to target RNA would allow alteration and imaging of endogenous RNA transcripts analogous to CRISPR/Cas-based genomic tools, but most RNA targeting methods rely on incorporation of exogenous tags. Here, we demonstrate that nuclease-inactive S. pyogenes CRISPR/Cas9 can bind RNA in a nucleic-acid-programmed manner and allow endogenous RNA tracking in living cells. We show that nuclear-localized RNA-targeting Cas9 (RCas9) is exported to the cytoplasm only in the presence of sgRNAs targeting mRNA and observe accumulation of ACTB, CCNA2, and TFRC mRNAs in RNA granules that correlate with fluorescence in situ hybridization. We also demonstrate time-resolved measurements of ACTB mRNA trafficking to stress granules. Our results establish RCas9 as a means to track RNA in living cells in a programmable manner without genetically encoded tags.",1
Neuronal Firing Rate Homeostasis Is Inhibited by Sleep and Promoted by Wake.,"Homeostatic mechanisms stabilize neural circuit function by keeping firing rates within a set-point range, but whether this process is gated by brain state is unknown. Here, we monitored firing rate homeostasis in individual visual cortical neurons in freely behaving rats as they cycled between sleep and wake states. When neuronal firing rates were perturbed by visual deprivation, they gradually returned to a precise, cell-autonomous set point during periods of active wake, with lengthening of the wake period enhancing firing rate rebound. Unexpectedly, this resetting of neuronal firing was suppressed during sleep. This raises the possibility that memory consolidation or other sleep-dependent processes are vulnerable to interference from homeostatic plasticity mechanisms. PAPERCLIP.",1
Genomic and Transcriptomic Features of Response to Anti-PD-1 Therapy in Metastatic Melanoma.,"PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade provides significant clinical benefits for melanoma patients. We analyzed the somatic mutanomes and transcriptomes of pretreatment melanoma biopsies to identify factors that may influence innate sensitivity or resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. We find that overall high mutational loads associate with improved survival, and tumors from responding patients are enriched for mutations in the DNA repair gene BRCA2. Innately resistant tumors display a transcriptional signature (referred to as the IPRES, or innate anti-PD-1 resistance), indicating concurrent up-expression of genes involved in the regulation of mesenchymal transition, cell adhesion, extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis, and wound healing. Notably, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-targeted therapy (MAPK inhibitor) induces similar signatures in melanoma, suggesting that a non-genomic form of MAPK inhibitor resistance mediates cross-resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. Validation of the IPRES in other independent tumor cohorts defines a transcriptomic subset across distinct types of advanced cancer. These findings suggest that attenuating the biological processes that underlie IPRES may improve anti-PD-1 response in melanoma and other cancer types.",1
The CASTOR Proteins Are Arginine Sensors for the mTORC1 Pathway.,"Amino acids signal to the mTOR complex I (mTORC1) growth pathway through the Rag GTPases. Multiple distinct complexes regulate the Rags, including GATOR1, a GTPase activating protein (GAP), and GATOR2, a positive regulator of unknown molecular function. Arginine stimulation of cells activates mTORC1, but how it is sensed is not well understood. Recently, SLC38A9 was identified as a putative lysosomal arginine sensor required for arginine to activate mTORC1 but how arginine deprivation represses mTORC1 is unknown. Here, we show that CASTOR1, a previously uncharacterized protein, interacts with GATOR2 and is required for arginine deprivation to inhibit mTORC1. CASTOR1 homodimerizes and can also heterodimerize with the related protein, CASTOR2. Arginine disrupts the CASTOR1-GATOR2 complex by binding to CASTOR1 with a dissociation constant of ~30 muM, and its arginine-binding capacity is required for arginine to activate mTORC1 in cells. Collectively, these results establish CASTOR1 as an arginine sensor for the mTORC1 pathway.",1
Gut Microbial Metabolite TMAO Enhances Platelet Hyperreactivity and Thrombosis Risk.,"Normal platelet function is critical to blood hemostasis and maintenance of a closed circulatory system. Heightened platelet reactivity, however, is associated with cardiometabolic diseases and enhanced potential for thrombotic events. We now show gut microbes, through generation of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), directly contribute to platelet hyperreactivity and enhanced thrombosis potential. Plasma TMAO levels in subjects (n > 4,000) independently predicted incident (3 years) thrombosis (heart attack, stroke) risk. Direct exposure of platelets to TMAO enhanced sub-maximal stimulus-dependent platelet activation from multiple agonists through augmented Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores. Animal model studies employing dietary choline or TMAO, germ-free mice, and microbial transplantation collectively confirm a role for gut microbiota and TMAO in modulating platelet hyperresponsiveness and thrombosis potential and identify microbial taxa associated with plasma TMAO and thrombosis potential. Collectively, the present results reveal a previously unrecognized mechanistic link between specific dietary nutrients, gut microbes, platelet function, and thrombosis risk.",1
Signaling in Host-Associated Microbial Communities.,"Human-associated microbiota form and stabilize communities based on interspecies interactions. We review how these microbe-microbe and microbe-host interactions are communicated to shape communities over a human's lifespan, including periods of health and disease. Modeling and dissecting signaling in host-associated communities is crucial to understand their function and will open the door to therapies that prevent or correct microbial community dysfunction to promote health and treat disease.",1
Ecology and Evolution of Communication in Social Insects.,"Insect life strategies comprise all levels of sociality from solitary to eusocial, in which individuals form persistent groups and divide labor. With increasing social complexity, the need to communicate a greater diversity of messages arose to coordinate division of labor, group cohesion, and concerted actions. Here we summarize the knowledge on prominent messages in social insects that inform about reproduction, group membership, resource locations, and threats and discuss potential evolutionary trajectories of each message in the context of social complexity.",1
Insights into the Neural and Genetic Basis of Vocal Communication.,"The use of vocalizations to communicate information and elaborate social bonds is an adaptation seen in many vertebrate species. Human speech is an extreme version of this pervasive form of communication. Unlike the vocalizations exhibited by the majority of land vertebrates, speech is a learned behavior requiring early sensory exposure and auditory feedback for its development and maintenance. Studies in humans and a small number of other species have provided insights into the neural and genetic basis for learned vocal communication and are helping to delineate the roles of brain circuits across the cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum in generating vocal behaviors. This Review provides an outline of the current knowledge about these circuits and the genes implicated in vocal communication, as well as a perspective on future research directions in this field.",1
Information Integration and Communication in Plant Growth Regulation.,"Plants are equipped with the capacity to respond to a large number of diverse signals, both internal ones and those emanating from the environment, that are critical to their survival and adaption as sessile organisms. These signals need to be integrated through highly structured intracellular networks to ensure coherent cellular responses, and in addition, spatiotemporal actions of hormones and peptides both orchestrate local cell differentiation and coordinate growth and physiology over long distances. Further, signal interactions and signaling outputs vary significantly with developmental context. This review discusses our current understanding of the integrated intracellular and intercellular signaling networks that control plant growth.",1
Bone and Muscle Endocrine Functions: Unexpected Paradigms of Inter-organ Communication.,"Most physiological functions originate with the communication between organs. Mouse genetics has revived this holistic view of physiology through the identification of inter-organ communications that are unanticipated, functionally important, and would have been difficult to uncover otherwise. This Review highlights this point by showing how two tissues usually not seen as endocrine ones, bone and striated muscles, influence several physiological processes in a significant manner.",1
The Basis of Oncoimmunology.,"Cancer heterogeneity, a hallmark enabling clonal survival and therapy resistance, is shaped by active immune responses. Antigen-specific T cells can control cancer, as revealed clinically by immunotherapeutics such as adoptive T-cell transfer and checkpoint blockade. The host immune system is thus a powerful tool that, if better harnessed, could significantly enhance the efficacy of cytotoxic therapy and improve outcomes for cancer sufferers. To realize this vision, however, a number of research frontiers must be tackled. These include developing strategies for neutralizing tumor-promoting inflammation, broadening T-cell repertoires (via vaccination), and elucidating the mechanisms by which immune cells organize tumor microenvironments to regulate T-cell activity. Such efforts will pave the way for identifying new targets for combination therapies that overcome resistance to current treatments and promote long-term cancer control.",1
Communication by Extracellular Vesicles: Where We Are and Where We Need to Go.,"In multicellular organisms, distant cells can exchange information by sending out signals composed of single molecules or, as increasingly exemplified in the literature, via complex packets stuffed with a selection of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, called extracellular vesicles (EVs; also known as exosomes and microvesicles, among other names). This Review covers some of the most striking functions described for EV secretion but also presents the limitations on our knowledge of their physiological roles. While there are initial indications that EV-mediated pathways operate in vivo, the actual nature of the EVs involved in these effects still needs to be clarified. Here, we focus on the context of tumor cells and their microenvironment, but similar results and challenges apply to all patho/physiological systems in which EV-mediated communication is proposed to take place.",1
Hardwiring Stem Cell Communication through Tissue Structure.,"Adult stem cells across diverse organs self-renew and differentiate to maintain tissue homeostasis. How stem cells receive input to preserve tissue structure and function largely relies on their communication with surrounding cellular and non-cellular elements. As such, how tissues are organized and patterned not only reflects organ function, but also inherently hardwires networks of communication between stem cells and their environment to direct tissue homeostasis and injury repair. This review highlights how different methods of stem cell communication reflect the unique organization and function of diverse tissues.",1
Hallmarks of Tissue-Resident Lymphocytes.,"Although they are classically viewed as continuously recirculating through the lymphoid organs and blood, lymphocytes also establish residency in non-lymphoid tissues, most prominently at barrier sites, including the mucosal surfaces and skin. These specialized tissue-resident lymphocyte subsets span the innate-adaptive continuum and include innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), unconventional T cells (e.g., NKT, MAIT, gammadelta T cells, and CD8alphaalpha(+) IELs), and tissue-resident memory T (T(RM)) cells. Although these diverse cell types differ in the particulars of their biology, they nonetheless exhibit important shared features, including a role in the preservation of tissue integrity and function during homeostasis, infection, and non-infectious perturbations. In this Review, we discuss the hallmarks of tissue-resident innate, innate-like, and adaptive lymphocytes, as well as their potential functions in non-lymphoid organs.",1
Engineering Cellular Metabolism.,"Metabolic engineering is the science of rewiring the metabolism of cells to enhance production of native metabolites or to endow cells with the ability to produce new products. The potential applications of such efforts are wide ranging, including the generation of fuels, chemicals, foods, feeds, and pharmaceuticals. However, making cells into efficient factories is challenging because cells have evolved robust metabolic networks with hard-wired, tightly regulated lines of communication between molecular pathways that resist efforts to divert resources. Here, we will review the current status and challenges of metabolic engineering and will discuss how new technologies can enable metabolic engineering to be scaled up to the industrial level, either by cutting off the lines of control for endogenous metabolism or by infiltrating the system with disruptive, heterologous pathways that overcome cellular regulation.",1
The Dark Side of Cell Signaling: Positive Roles for Negative Regulators.,"Cell signaling is dominated by analyzing positive responses to stimuli. Signal activation is balanced by negative regulators that are generally considered to terminate signaling. Rather than exerting only negative effects, however, many such regulators play important roles in enhancing cell-signaling control. Considering responses downstream of selected cell-surface receptors, we discuss how receptor internalization affects signaling specificity and how rapid kinase/phosphatase and GTP/GDP cycles increase responsiveness and allow kinetic proofreading in receptor signaling. We highlight the blurring of distinctions between positive and negative signals, recasting signal termination as the response to a switch-like transition into a new cellular state.",1
The Nuclear Pore Complex as a Flexible and Dynamic Gate.,"Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) perforate the nuclear envelope and serve as the primary transport gates for molecular exchange between nucleus and cytoplasm. Stripping the megadalton complex down to its most essential organizational elements, one can divide the NPC into scaffold components and the disordered elements attached to them that generate a selective barrier between compartments. These structural elements exhibit flexibility, which may hold a clue in understanding NPC assembly and function. Here we review the current status of NPC research with a focus on the functional implications of its structural and compositional heterogeneity.",1
Passive Noise Filtering by Cellular Compartmentalization.,"Chemical reactions contain an inherent element of randomness, which presents itself as noise that interferes with cellular processes and communication. Here we discuss the ability of the spatial partitioning of molecular systems to filter and, thus, remove noise, while preserving regulated and predictable differences between single living cells. In contrast to active noise filtering by network motifs, cellular compartmentalization is highly effective and easily scales to numerous systems without requiring a substantial usage of cellular energy. We will use passive noise filtering by the eukaryotic cell nucleus as an example of how this increases predictability of transcriptional output, with possible implications for the evolution of complex multicellularity.",1
"Communication in Neural Circuits: Tools, Opportunities, and Challenges.","Communication, the effective delivery of information, is fundamental to life across all scales and species. Nervous systems (by necessity) may be most specifically adapted among biological tissues for high rate and complexity of information transmitted, and thus, the properties of neural tissue and principles of its organization into circuits may illuminate capabilities and limitations of biological communication. Here, we consider recent developments in tools for studying neural circuits with particular attention to defining neuronal cell types by input and output information streams--i.e., by how they communicate. Complementing approaches that define cell types by virtue of genetic promoter/enhancer properties, this communication-based approach to defining cell types operationally by input/output (I/O) relationships links structure and function, resolves difficulties associated with single-genetic-feature definitions, leverages technology for observing and testing significance of precisely these I/O relationships in intact brains, and maps onto processes through which behavior may be adapted during development, experience, and evolution.",1
Movement: How the Brain Communicates with the World.,"Voluntary movement is a result of signals transmitted through a communication channel that links the internal world in our minds to the physical world around us. Intention can be considered the desire to effect change on our environment, and this is contained in the signals from the brain, passed through the nervous system to converge on muscles that generate displacements and forces on our surroundings. The resulting changes in the world act to generate sensations that feed back to the nervous system, closing the control loop. This Perspective discusses the experimental and theoretical underpinnings of current models of movement generation and the way they are modulated by external information. Movement systems embody intentionality and prediction, two factors that are propelling a revolution in engineering. Development of movement models that include the complexities of the external world may allow a better understanding of the neuronal populations regulating these processes, as well as the development of solutions for autonomous vehicles and robots, and neural prostheses for those who are motor impaired.",1
The 3D Genome as Moderator of Chromosomal Communication.,"Proper expression of genes requires communication with their regulatory elements that can be located elsewhere along the chromosome. The physics of chromatin fibers imposes a range of constraints on such communication. The molecular and biophysical mechanisms by which chromosomal communication is established, or prevented, have become a topic of intense study, and important roles for the spatial organization of chromosomes are being discovered. Here we present a view of the interphase 3D genome characterized by extensive physical compartmentalization and insulation on the one hand and facilitated long-range interactions on the other. We propose the existence of topological machines dedicated to set up and to exploit a 3D genome organization to both promote and censor communication along and between chromosomes.",1
Reverse Engineering Human Pathophysiology with Organs-on-Chips.,"While studies of cultured cells have led to new insights into biological control, greater understanding of human pathophysiology requires the development of experimental systems that permit analysis of intercellular communications and tissue-tissue interactions in a more relevant organ context. Human organs-on-chips offer a potentially powerful new approach to confront this long-standing problem.",1
"Communication in Drug Development: ""Translating"" Scientific Discovery.","The discovery and development of new medicines that promote human health and potentially extend natural life remains a remarkably challenging endeavor. In this Commentary, we identify key elements of communication required to successfully translate promising biological findings to novel approved drug therapies and discuss the attendant challenges and opportunities.",1
"You, Me, and We: Biolabs for the 21st Century.","Twenty-first century biomedical research is advantaged by institutional infrastructures that foster a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach.

Staying Afloat in the Rising Tide of Science.,New York Times columnist and science writer Carl Zimmer discusses the challenges of effectively communicating with the public about science.,1
When Biology Doesn't Add Up.,"Physical models are increasingly used to inform our understanding of biology. Where such models still run into limits was the question that Cell's Robert Kruger posed to Julie Theriot, K.C. Huang, and Mark Goulian. Annotated excerpts from this conversation are presented below, and the full conversation is available with the article online.",1
Bayesian Sparse Regression Analysis Documents the Diversity of Spinal Inhibitory Interneurons.,"Documenting the extent of cellular diversity is a critical step in defining the functional organization of tissues and organs. To infer cell-type diversity from partial or incomplete transcription factor expression data, we devised a sparse Bayesian framework that is able to handle estimation uncertainty and can incorporate diverse cellular characteristics to optimize experimental design. Focusing on spinal V1 inhibitory interneurons, for which the spatial expression of 19 transcription factors has been mapped, we infer the existence of ~50 candidate V1 neuronal types, many of which localize in compact spatial domains in the ventral spinal cord. We have validated the existence of inferred cell types by direct experimental measurement, establishing this Bayesian framework as an effective platform for cell-type characterization in the nervous system and elsewhere.",1
Maturation Pathway from Germline to Broad HIV-1 Neutralizer of a CD4-Mimic Antibody.,"Antibodies with ontogenies from VH1-2 or VH1-46-germline genes dominate the broadly neutralizing response against the CD4-binding site (CD4bs) on HIV-1. Here, we define with longitudinal sampling from time-of-infection the development of a VH1-46-derived antibody lineage that matured to neutralize 90% of HIV-1 isolates. Structures of lineage antibodies CH235 (week 41 from time-of-infection, 18% breadth), CH235.9 (week 152, 77%), and CH235.12 (week 323, 90%) demonstrated the maturing epitope to focus on the conformationally invariant portion of the CD4bs. Similarities between CH235 lineage and five unrelated CD4bs lineages in epitope focusing, length-of-time to develop breadth, and extraordinary level of somatic hypermutation suggested commonalities in maturation among all CD4bs antibodies. Fortunately, the required CH235-lineage hypermutation appeared substantially guided by the intrinsic mutability of the VH1-46 gene, which closely resembled VH1-2. We integrated our CH235-lineage findings with a second broadly neutralizing lineage and HIV-1 co-evolution to suggest a vaccination strategy for inducing both lineages.",1
BOK Is a Non-canonical BCL-2 Family Effector of Apoptosis Regulated by ER-Associated Degradation.,"The mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis is initiated by mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). The BCL-2 family effectors BAX and BAK are thought to be absolutely required for this process. Here, we report that BCL-2 ovarian killer (BOK) is a bona fide yet unconventional effector of MOMP that can trigger apoptosis in the absence of both BAX and BAK. However, unlike the canonical effectors, BOK appears to be constitutively active and unresponsive to antagonistic effects of the antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins. Rather, BOK is controlled at the level of protein stability by components of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation pathway. BOK is ubiquitylated by the AMFR/gp78 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and targeted for proteasomal degradation in a VCP/p97-dependent manner, which allows survival of the cell. When proteasome function, VCP, or gp78 activity is compromised, BOK is stabilized to induce MOMP and apoptosis independently of other BCL-2 proteins.",1
Spinal Inhibitory Interneuron Diversity Delineates Variant Motor Microcircuits.,"Animals generate movement by engaging spinal circuits that direct precise sequences of muscle contraction, but the identity and organizational logic of local interneurons that lie at the core of these circuits remain unresolved. Here, we show that V1 interneurons, a major inhibitory population that controls motor output, fractionate into highly diverse subsets on the basis of the expression of 19 transcription factors. Transcriptionally defined V1 subsets exhibit distinct physiological signatures and highly structured spatial distributions with mediolateral and dorsoventral positional biases. These positional distinctions constrain patterns of input from sensory and motor neurons and, as such, suggest that interneuron position is a determinant of microcircuit organization. Moreover, V1 diversity indicates that different inhibitory microcircuits exist for motor pools controlling hip, ankle, and foot muscles, revealing a variable circuit architecture for interneurons that control limb movement.",1
Exploiting Temporal Collateral Sensitivity in Tumor Clonal Evolution.,"The prevailing approach to addressing secondary drug resistance in cancer focuses on treating the resistance mechanisms at relapse. However, the dynamic nature of clonal evolution, along with potential fitness costs and cost compensations, may present exploitable vulnerabilities-a notion that we term ""temporal collateral sensitivity."" Using a combined pharmacological screen and drug resistance selection approach in a murine model of Ph(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia, we indeed find that temporal and/or persistent collateral sensitivity to non-classical BCR-ABL1 drugs arises in emergent tumor subpopulations during the evolution of resistance toward initial treatment with BCR-ABL1-targeted inhibitors. We determined the sensitization mechanism via genotypic, phenotypic, signaling, and binding measurements in combination with computational models and demonstrated significant overall survival extension in mice. Additional stochastic mathematical models and small-molecule screens extended our insights, indicating the value of focusing on evolutionary trajectories and pharmacological profiles to identify new strategies to treat dynamic tumor vulnerabilities.",1
Cytotoxic T Cells Use Mechanical Force to Potentiate Target Cell Killing.,"The immunological synapse formed between a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and an infected or transformed target cell is a physically active structure capable of exerting mechanical force. Here, we investigated whether synaptic forces promote the destruction of target cells. CTLs kill by secreting toxic proteases and the pore forming protein perforin into the synapse. Biophysical experiments revealed a striking correlation between the magnitude of force exertion across the synapse and the speed of perforin pore formation on the target cell, implying that force potentiates cytotoxicity by enhancing perforin activity. Consistent with this interpretation, we found that increasing target cell tension augmented pore formation by perforin and killing by CTLs. Our data also indicate that CTLs coordinate perforin release and force exertion in space and time. These results reveal an unappreciated physical dimension to lymphocyte function and demonstrate that cells use mechanical forces to control the activity of outgoing chemical signals.",1
A Stringent Systems Approach Uncovers Gene-Specific Mechanisms Regulating Inflammation.,"Much has been learned about transcriptional cascades and networks from large-scale systems analyses of high-throughput datasets. However, analysis methods that optimize statistical power through simultaneous evaluation of thousands of ChIP-seq peaks or differentially expressed genes possess substantial limitations in their ability to uncover mechanistic principles of transcriptional control. By examining nascent transcript RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and binding motif datasets from lipid A-stimulated macrophages with increased attention to the quantitative distribution of signals, we identified unexpected relationships between the in vivo binding properties of inducible transcription factors, motif strength, and transcription. Furthermore, rather than emphasizing common features of large clusters of co-regulated genes, our results highlight the extent to which unique mechanisms regulate individual genes with key biological functions. Our findings demonstrate the mechanistic value of stringent interrogation of well-defined sets of genes as a complement to broader systems analyses of transcriptional cascades and networks.",1
New Brain Tumor Entities Emerge from Molecular Classification of CNS-PNETs.,"Primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the central nervous system (CNS-PNETs) are highly aggressive, poorly differentiated embryonal tumors occurring predominantly in young children but also affecting adolescents and adults. Herein, we demonstrate that a significant proportion of institutionally diagnosed CNS-PNETs display molecular profiles indistinguishable from those of various other well-defined CNS tumor entities, facilitating diagnosis and appropriate therapy for patients with these tumors. From the remaining fraction of CNS-PNETs, we identify four new CNS tumor entities, each associated with a recurrent genetic alteration and distinct histopathological and clinical features. These new molecular entities, designated ""CNS neuroblastoma with FOXR2 activation (CNS NB-FOXR2),"" ""CNS Ewing sarcoma family tumor with CIC alteration (CNS EFT-CIC),"" ""CNS high-grade neuroepithelial tumor with MN1 alteration (CNS HGNET-MN1),"" and ""CNS high-grade neuroepithelial tumor with BCOR alteration (CNS HGNET-BCOR),"" will enable meaningful clinical trials and the development of therapeutic strategies for patients affected by poorly differentiated CNS tumors.",1
Parallel Transformation of Tactile Signals in Central Circuits of Drosophila.,"To distinguish between complex somatosensory stimuli, central circuits must combine signals from multiple peripheral mechanoreceptor types, as well as mechanoreceptors at different sites in the body. Here, we investigate the first stages of somatosensory integration in Drosophila using in vivo recordings from genetically labeled central neurons in combination with mechanical and optogenetic stimulation of specific mechanoreceptor types. We identify three classes of central neurons that process touch: one compares touch signals on different parts of the same limb, one compares touch signals on right and left limbs, and the third compares touch and proprioceptive signals. Each class encodes distinct features of somatosensory stimuli. The axon of an individual touch receptor neuron can diverge to synapse onto all three classes, meaning that these computations occur in parallel, not hierarchically. Representing a stimulus as a set of parallel comparisons is a fast and efficient way to deliver somatosensory signals to motor circuits.",1
Spliceosomal DEAH-Box ATPases Remodel Pre-mRNA to Activate Alternative Splice Sites.,"During pre-mRNA splicing, a central step in the expression and regulation of eukaryotic genes, the spliceosome selects splice sites for intron excision and exon ligation. In doing so, the spliceosome must distinguish optimal from suboptimal splice sites. At the catalytic stage of splicing, suboptimal splice sites are repressed by the DEAH-box ATPases Prp16 and Prp22. Here, using budding yeast, we show that these ATPases function further by enabling the spliceosome to search for and utilize alternative branch sites and 3' splice sites. The ATPases facilitate this search by remodeling the splicing substrate to disengage candidate splice sites. Our data support a mechanism involving 3' to 5' translocation of the ATPases along substrate RNA and toward a candidate site, but, surprisingly, not across the site. Thus, our data implicate DEAH-box ATPases in acting at a distance by pulling substrate RNA from the catalytic core of the spliceosome.",1
The RNase PARN-1 Trims piRNA 3' Ends to Promote Transcriptome Surveillance in C. elegans.,"Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) engage Piwi proteins to suppress transposons and are essential for fertility in diverse organisms. An interesting feature of piRNAs is that, while piRNA lengths are stereotypical within a species, they can differ widely between species. For example, piRNAs are mainly 29 and 30 nucleotides in humans, 24 to 30 nucleotides in D. melanogaster, and uniformly 21 nucleotides in C. elegans. However, how piRNA length is determined and whether length impacts function remains unknown. Here, we show that C. elegans deficient for PARN-1, a conserved RNase, accumulate untrimmed piRNAs with 3' extensions. Surprisingly, these longer piRNAs are stable and associate with the Piwi protein PRG-1 but fail to robustly recruit downstream silencing factors. Our findings identify PARN-1 as a key regulator of piRNA length in C. elegans and suggest that length is regulated to promote efficient transcriptome surveillance.",1
Identification and Functional Analysis of the Pre-piRNA 3' Trimmer in Silkworms.,"PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) play a crucial role in transposon silencing in animal germ cells. In piRNA biogenesis, single-stranded piRNA intermediates are loaded into PIWI-clade proteins and cleaved by Zucchini/MitoPLD, yielding precursor piRNAs (pre-piRNAs). Pre-piRNAs that are longer than the mature piRNA length are then trimmed at their 3' ends. Although recent studies implicated the Tudor domain protein Papi/Tdrkh in pre-piRNA trimming, the identity of Trimmer and its relationship with Papi/Tdrkh remain unknown. Here, we identified PNLDC1, an uncharacterized 3'-5' exonuclease, as Trimmer in silkworms. Trimmer is enriched in the mitochondrial fraction and binds to Papi/Tdrkh. Depletion of Trimmer and Papi/Tdrkh additively inhibits trimming, causing accumulation of approximately 35-40-nt pre-piRNAs that are impaired for target cleavage and prone to degradation. Our results highlight the cooperative action of Trimmer and Papi/Tdrkh in piRNA maturation.",1
A Non-canonical Voltage-Sensing Mechanism Controls Gating in K2P K(+) Channels.,"Two-pore domain (K2P) K(+) channels are major regulators of excitability that endow cells with an outwardly rectifying background ""leak"" conductance. In some K2P channels, strong voltage-dependent activation has been observed, but the mechanism remains unresolved because they lack a canonical voltage-sensing domain. Here, we show voltage-dependent gating is common to most K2P channels and that this voltage sensitivity originates from the movement of three to four ions into the high electric field of an inactive selectivity filter. Overall, this ion-flux gating mechanism generates a one-way ""check valve"" within the filter because outward movement of K(+) induces filter opening, whereas inward movement promotes inactivation. Furthermore, many physiological stimuli switch off this flux gating mode to convert K2P channels into a leak conductance. These findings provide insight into the functional plasticity of a K(+)-selective filter and also refine our understanding of K2P channels and the mechanisms by which ion channels can sense voltage.",1
Unfolding of a Temperature-Sensitive Domain Controls Voltage-Gated Channel Activation.,"Voltage-gated ion channels (VGICs) are outfitted with diverse cytoplasmic domains that impact function. To examine how such elements may affect VGIC behavior, we addressed how the bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel (BacNa(V)) C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (CTD) affects function. Our studies show that the BacNa(V) CTD exerts a profound influence on gating through a temperature-dependent unfolding transition in a discrete cytoplasmic domain, the neck domain, proximal to the pore. Structural and functional studies establish that the BacNa(V) CTD comprises a bi-partite four-helix bundle that bears an unusual hydrophilic core whose integrity is central to the unfolding mechanism and that couples directly to the channel activation gate. Together, our findings define a general principle for how the widespread four-helix bundle cytoplasmic domain architecture can control VGIC responses, uncover a mechanism underlying the diverse BacNa(V) voltage dependencies, and demonstrate that a discrete domain can encode the temperature-dependent response of a channel.",1
NF-kappaB Restricts Inflammasome Activation via Elimination of Damaged Mitochondria.,"Nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), a key activator of inflammation, primes the NLRP3-inflammasome for activation by inducing pro-IL-1beta and NLRP3 expression. NF-kappaB, however, also prevents excessive inflammation and restrains NLRP3-inflammasome activation through a poorly defined mechanism. We now show that NF-kappaB exerts its anti-inflammatory activity by inducing delayed accumulation of the autophagy receptor p62/SQSTM1. External NLRP3-activating stimuli trigger a form of mitochondrial (mt) damage that is caspase-1- and NLRP3-independent and causes release of direct NLRP3-inflammasome activators, including mtDNA and mtROS. Damaged mitochondria undergo Parkin-dependent ubiquitin conjugation and are specifically recognized by p62, which induces their mitophagic clearance. Macrophage-specific p62 ablation causes pronounced accumulation of damaged mitochondria and excessive IL-1beta-dependent inflammation, enhancing macrophage death. Therefore, the ""NF-kappaB-p62-mitophagy"" pathway is a macrophage-intrinsic regulatory loop through which NF-kappaB restrains its own inflammation-promoting activity and orchestrates a self-limiting host response that maintains homeostasis and favors tissue repair.",1
EGLN1 Inhibition and Rerouting of alpha-Ketoglutarate Suffice for Remote Ischemic Protection.,"Ischemic preconditioning is the phenomenon whereby brief periods of sublethal ischemia protect against a subsequent, more prolonged, ischemic insult. In remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC), ischemia to one organ protects others organs at a distance. We created mouse models to ask if inhibition of the alpha-ketoglutarate (alphaKG)-dependent dioxygenase Egln1, which senses oxygen and regulates the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) transcription factor, could suffice to mediate local and remote ischemic preconditioning. Using somatic gene deletion and a pharmacological inhibitor, we found that inhibiting Egln1 systemically or in skeletal muscles protects mice against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Parabiosis experiments confirmed that RIPC in this latter model was mediated by a secreted factor. Egln1 loss causes accumulation of circulating alphaKG, which drives hepatic production and secretion of kynurenic acid (KYNA) that is necessary and sufficient to mediate cardiac ischemic protection in this setting.",1
UCP2 Regulates Mitochondrial Fission and Ventromedial Nucleus Control of Glucose Responsiveness.,"The ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) plays a critical role in regulating systemic glucose homeostasis. How neurons in this brain area adapt to the changing metabolic environment to regulate circulating glucose levels is ill defined. Here, we show that glucose load results in mitochondrial fission and reduced reactive oxygen species in VMH neurons mediated by dynamin-related peptide 1 (DRP1) under the control of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2). Probed by genetic manipulations and chemical-genetic control of VMH neuronal circuitry, we unmasked that this mitochondrial adaptation determines the size of the pool of glucose-excited neurons in the VMH and that this process regulates systemic glucose homeostasis. Thus, our data unmasked a critical cellular biological process controlled by mitochondrial dynamics in VMH regulation of systemic glucose homeostasis.",1
Condensin-Based Chromosome Organization from Bacteria to Vertebrates.,"Condensins are large protein complexes that play a central role in chromosome organization and segregation in the three domains of life. They display highly characteristic, rod-shaped structures with SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes) ATPases as their core subunits and organize large-scale chromosome structure through active mechanisms. Most eukaryotic species have two distinct condensin complexes whose balanced usage is adapted flexibly to different organisms and cell types. Studies of bacterial condensins provide deep insights into the fundamental mechanisms of chromosome segregation. This Review surveys both conserved features and rich variations of condensin-based chromosome organization and discusses their evolutionary implications.",1
Revisiting Management of Pediatric Brain Tumors with New Molecular Insights.,"Pediatric central nervous system primitive neuro-ectodermal brain tumors (CNS-PNETs) are rare tumors with ill-defined biological features. In this issue of Cell, Sturm et al. used state-of-the-art methods to interrogate these tumors' biology. Their integrated molecular analyses led them to propose a new molecular classification, with four new entities identified, that should get oncologists' attention.",1
Ground Control to Major Tom: The Cell Body Signals Axon Degeneration.,"Axon degeneration in response to trophic deprivation was thought to be locally restricted to the axon. However, increasing evidence points to a requirement for the cell body in the degenerative program. Now, Simon et al. identify the pro-apoptotic protein Puma as a key factor in this cell body-derived signal.",1
EMT: Matter of Life or Death?,"TGF-beta is long considered a ""protean"" cytokine in cancer, changing its role from anti- to pro-tumorigenic in a context-dependent manner. In this issue of Cell, David et al. use mouse models of pancreatic cancer to shed light on the mechanistic basis of how TGF-beta-induced EMT is coupled to either apoptosis or tumor progression.",1
A Happy 3' Ending to the piRNA Maturation Story.,"For a decade, mystery has surrounded the mechanisms by which piRNA biogenesis yields distinct size classes of small RNAs within individual PIWI proteins. In this issue of Cell, two studies shed light on this process, identifying conserved PARN-family exonucleases that trim piRNAs to their mature size in silkworms and C. elegans.",1
Getting a Grip on Microtubules.,"Posttranslational modifications control microtubule behavior, yet assigning roles to particular signals was hampered by lack of defined in vitro systems. In this issue of Cell, Valenstein and Roll-Mecak establish a biochemical platform to interrogate consequences of microtubule polyglutamylation, thereby providing important insights into the specificity and quantitative nature of cellular information transfer.",1
Going Germline: Mitochondrial Replacement as a Guide to Genome Editing.,"Mitochondrial replacement (MR) serves as a crucial test case and learning guide for the scientific, ethical, and regulatory challenges of future reproductive breakthroughs. The lessons learned from the regulatory review process of MR over the last decade promise to enrich the emerging dialog over genome editing.",1
Hedgehog Pathway Inhibition.,"The hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is aberrantly activated in a majority of basal cell carcinomas (BCC). Vismodegib and sonidegib are targeted inhibitors of Smoothened (SMO). Both drugs are approved for use in locally advanced BCC (laBCC), with vismodegib also approved for metastatic BCC (mBCC).",1
TGF-beta Tumor Suppression through a Lethal EMT.,"TGF-beta signaling can be pro-tumorigenic or tumor suppressive. We investigated this duality in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), which, with other gastrointestinal cancers, exhibits frequent inactivation of the TGF-beta mediator Smad4. We show that TGF-beta induces an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), generally considered a pro-tumorigenic event. However, in TGF-beta-sensitive PDA cells, EMT becomes lethal by converting TGF-beta-induced Sox4 from an enforcer of tumorigenesis into a promoter of apoptosis. This is the result of an EMT-linked remodeling of the cellular transcription factor landscape, including the repression of the gastrointestinal lineage-master regulator Klf5. Klf5 cooperates with Sox4 in oncogenesis and prevents Sox4-induced apoptosis. Smad4 is required for EMT but dispensable for Sox4 induction by TGF-beta. TGF-beta-induced Sox4 is thus geared to bolster progenitor identity, whereas simultaneous Smad4-dependent EMT strips Sox4 of an essential partner in oncogenesis. Our work demonstrates that TGF-beta tumor suppression functions through an EMT-mediated disruption of a lineage-specific transcriptional network.",1
Axon Degeneration Gated by Retrograde Activation of Somatic Pro-apoptotic Signaling.,"During development, sensory axons compete for limiting neurotrophic support, and local neurotrophin insufficiency triggers caspase-dependent axon degeneration. The signaling driving axon degeneration upon local deprivation is proposed to reside within axons. Our results instead support a model in which, despite the apoptotic machinery being present in axons, the cell body is an active participant in gating axonal caspase activation and axon degeneration. Loss of trophic support in axons initiates retrograde activation of a somatic pro-apoptotic pathway, which, in turn, is required for distal axon degeneration via an anterograde pro-degenerative factor. At a molecular level, the cell body is the convergence point of two signaling pathways whose integrated action drives upregulation of pro-apoptotic Puma, which, unexpectedly, is confined to the cell body. Puma then overcomes inhibition by pro-survival Bcl-xL and Bcl-w and initiates the anterograde pro-degenerative program, highlighting the role of the cell body as an arbiter of large-scale axon removal.",1
Sialylated Milk Oligosaccharides Promote Microbiota-Dependent Growth in Models of Infant Undernutrition.,"Identifying interventions that more effectively promote healthy growth of children with undernutrition is a pressing global health goal. Analysis of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) from 6-month-postpartum mothers in two Malawian birth cohorts revealed that sialylated HMOs are significantly less abundant in those with severely stunted infants. To explore this association, we colonized young germ-free mice with a consortium of bacterial strains cultured from the fecal microbiota of a 6-month-old stunted Malawian infant and fed recipient animals a prototypic Malawian diet with or without purified sialylated bovine milk oligosaccharides (S-BMO). S-BMO produced a microbiota-dependent augmentation of lean body mass gain, changed bone morphology, and altered liver, muscle, and brain metabolism in ways indicative of a greater ability to utilize nutrients for anabolism. These effects were also documented in gnotobiotic piglets using the same consortium and Malawian diet. These preclinical models indicate a causal, microbiota-dependent relationship between S-BMO and growth promotion.",1
Structure and Engineering of Francisella novicida Cas9.,"The RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 cleaves double-stranded DNA targets complementary to the guide RNA and has been applied to programmable genome editing. Cas9-mediated cleavage requires a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) juxtaposed with the DNA target sequence, thus constricting the range of targetable sites. Here, we report the 1.7 A resolution crystal structures of Cas9 from Francisella novicida (FnCas9), one of the largest Cas9 orthologs, in complex with a guide RNA and its PAM-containing DNA targets. A structural comparison of FnCas9 with other Cas9 orthologs revealed striking conserved and divergent features among distantly related CRISPR-Cas9 systems. We found that FnCas9 recognizes the 5'-NGG-3' PAM, and used the structural information to create a variant that can recognize the more relaxed 5'-YG-3' PAM. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the FnCas9-ribonucleoprotein complex can be microinjected into mouse zygotes to edit endogenous sites with the 5'-YG-3' PAM, thus expanding the target space of the CRISPR-Cas9 toolbox.",1
Graded Control of Microtubule Severing by Tubulin Glutamylation.,"Microtubule-severing enzymes are critical for the biogenesis and maintenance of complex microtubule arrays in axons, spindles, and cilia where tubulin detyrosination, acetylation, and glutamylation are abundant. These modifications exhibit stereotyped patterns suggesting spatial and temporal control of microtubule functions. Using human-engineered and differentially modified microtubules we find that glutamylation is the main regulator of the hereditary spastic paraplegia microtubule severing enzyme spastin. Glutamylation acts as a rheostat and tunes microtubule severing as a function of glutamate number added per tubulin. Unexpectedly, glutamylation is a non-linear biphasic tuner and becomes inhibitory beyond a threshold. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of localized glutamylation propagates across neighboring microtubules, modulating severing in trans. Our work provides the first quantitative evidence for a graded response to a tubulin posttranslational modification and a biochemical link between tubulin glutamylation and complex architectures of microtubule arrays such as those in neurons where spastin deficiency causes disease.",1
Complex Interdependence Regulates Heterotypic Transcription Factor Distribution and Coordinates Cardiogenesis.,"Transcription factors (TFs) are thought to function with partners to achieve specificity and precise quantitative outputs. In the developing heart, heterotypic TF interactions, such as between the T-box TF TBX5 and the homeodomain TF NKX2-5, have been proposed as a mechanism for human congenital heart defects. We report extensive and complex interdependent genomic occupancy of TBX5, NKX2-5, and the zinc finger TF GATA4 coordinately controlling cardiac gene expression, differentiation, and morphogenesis. Interdependent binding serves not only to co-regulate gene expression but also to prevent TFs from distributing to ectopic loci and activate lineage-inappropriate genes. We define preferential motif arrangements for TBX5 and NKX2-5 cooperative binding sites, supported at the atomic level by their co-crystal structure bound to DNA, revealing a direct interaction between the two factors and induced DNA bending. Complex interdependent binding mechanisms reveal tightly regulated TF genomic distribution and define a combinatorial logic for heterotypic TF regulation of differentiation.",1

Widespread Expansion of Protein Interaction Capabilities by Alternative Splicing.,"While alternative splicing is known to diversify the functional characteristics of some genes, the extent to which protein isoforms globally contribute to functional complexity on a proteomic scale remains unknown. To address this systematically, we cloned full-length open reading frames of alternatively spliced transcripts for a large number of human genes and used protein-protein interaction profiling to functionally compare hundreds of protein isoform pairs. The majority of isoform pairs share less than 50% of their interactions. In the global context of interactome network maps, alternative isoforms tend to behave like distinct proteins rather than minor variants of each other. Interaction partners specific to alternative isoforms tend to be expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner and belong to distinct functional modules. Our strategy, applicable to other functional characteristics, reveals a widespread expansion of protein interaction capabilities through alternative splicing and suggests that many alternative ""isoforms"" are functionally divergent (i.e., ""functional alloforms"").",1
Multiplexed Intact-Tissue Transcriptional Analysis at Cellular Resolution.,"In recently developed approaches for high-resolution imaging within intact tissue, molecular characterization over large volumes has been largely restricted to labeling of proteins. But volumetric nucleic acid labeling may represent a far greater scientific and clinical opportunity, enabling detection of not only diverse coding RNA variants but also non-coding RNAs. Moreover, scaling immunohistochemical detection to large tissue volumes has limitations due to high cost, limited renewability/availability, and restricted multiplexing capability of antibody labels. With the goal of versatile, high-content, and scalable molecular phenotyping of intact tissues, we developed a method using carbodiimide-based chemistry to stably retain RNAs in clarified tissue, coupled with amplification tools for multiplexed detection. The resulting technology enables robust measurement of activity-dependent transcriptional signatures, cell-identity markers, and diverse non-coding RNAs in rodent and human tissue volumes. The growing set of validated probes is deposited in an online resource for nucleating related developments from across the scientific community.",1
Redefining the Translational Status of 80S Monosomes.,"Fully assembled ribosomes exist in two populations: polysomes and monosomes. While the former has been studied extensively, to what extent translation occurs on monosomes and its importance for overall translational output remain controversial. Here, we used ribosome profiling to examine the translational status of 80S monosomes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that the vast majority of 80S monosomes are elongating, not initiating. Further, most mRNAs exhibit some degree of monosome occupancy, with monosomes predominating on nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) targets, upstream open reading frames (uORFs), canonical ORFs shorter than approximately 590 nt, and ORFs for which the total time required to complete elongation is substantially shorter than that required for initiation. Importantly, mRNAs encoding low-abundance regulatory proteins tend to be enriched in the monosome fraction. Our data highlight the importance of monosomes for the translation of highly regulated mRNAs.",1
Cryo-EM Structures of the Magnesium Channel CorA Reveal Symmetry Break upon Gating.,"CorA, the major Mg(2+) uptake system in prokaryotes, is gated by intracellular Mg(2+) (KD approximately 1-2 mM). X-ray crystallographic studies of CorA show similar conformations under Mg(2+)-bound and Mg(2+)-free conditions, but EPR spectroscopic studies reveal large Mg(2+)-driven quaternary conformational changes. Here, we determined cryo-EM structures of CorA in the Mg(2+)-bound closed conformation and in two open Mg(2+)-free states at resolutions of 3.8, 7.1, and 7.1 A, respectively. In the absence of bound Mg(2+), four of the five subunits are displaced to variable extents ( approximately 10-25 A) by hinge-like motions as large as approximately 35 degrees at the stalk helix. The transition between a single 5-fold symmetric closed state and an ensemble of low Mg(2+), open, asymmetric conformational states is, thus, the key structural signature of CorA gating. This mechanism is likely to apply to other structurally similar divalent ion channels.",1
Shelterin Protects Chromosome Ends by Compacting Telomeric Chromatin.,"Telomeres, repetitive DNA sequences at chromosome ends, are shielded against the DNA damage response (DDR) by the shelterin complex. To understand how shelterin protects telomere ends, we investigated the structural organization of telomeric chromatin in human cells using super-resolution microscopy. We found that telomeres form compact globular structures through a complex network of interactions between shelterin subunits and telomeric DNA, but not by DNA methylation, histone deacetylation, or histone trimethylation at telomeres and subtelomeric regions. Mutations that abrogate shelterin assembly or removal of individual subunits from telomeres cause up to a 10-fold increase in telomere volume. Decompacted telomeres accumulate DDR signals and become more accessible to telomere-associated proteins. Recompaction of telomeric chromatin using an orthogonal method displaces DDR signals from telomeres. These results reveal the chromatin remodeling activity of shelterin and demonstrate that shelterin-mediated compaction of telomeric chromatin provides robust protection of chromosome ends against the DDR machinery.",1
Myc Depletion Induces a Pluripotent Dormant State Mimicking Diapause.,"Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are maintained in a naive ground state of pluripotency in the presence of MEK and GSK3 inhibitors. Here, we show that ground-state ESCs express low Myc levels. Deletion of both c-myc and N-myc (dKO) or pharmacological inhibition of Myc activity strongly decreases transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis, leading to proliferation arrest. This process is reversible and occurs without affecting pluripotency, suggesting that Myc-depleted stem cells enter a state of dormancy similar to embryonic diapause. Indeed, c-Myc is depleted in diapaused blastocysts, and the differential expression signatures of dKO ESCs and diapaused epiblasts are remarkably similar. Following Myc inhibition, pre-implantation blastocysts enter biosynthetic dormancy but can progress through their normal developmental program after transfer into pseudo-pregnant recipients. Our study shows that Myc controls the biosynthetic machinery of stem cells without affecting their potency, thus regulating their entry and exit from the dormant state.",1
Self-Organization of Embryonic Genetic Oscillators into Spatiotemporal Wave Patterns.,"In vertebrate embryos, somites, the precursor of vertebrae, form from the presomitic mesoderm (PSM), which is composed of cells displaying signaling oscillations. Cellular oscillatory activity leads to periodic wave patterns in the PSM. Here, we address the origin of such complex wave patterns. We employed an in vitro randomization and real-time imaging strategy to probe for the ability of cells to generate order from disorder. We found that, after randomization, PSM cells self-organized into several miniature emergent PSM structures (ePSM). Our results show an ordered macroscopic spatial arrangement of ePSM with evidence of an intrinsic length scale. Furthermore, cells actively synchronize oscillations in a Notch-signaling-dependent manner, re-establishing wave-like patterns of gene activity. We demonstrate that PSM cells self-organize by tuning oscillation dynamics in response to surrounding cells, leading to collective synchronization with an average frequency. These findings reveal emergent properties within an ensemble of coupled genetic oscillators.",1
Long Neural Genes Harbor Recurrent DNA Break Clusters in Neural Stem/Progenitor Cells.,"Repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by non-homologous end joining is critical for neural development, and brain cells frequently contain somatic genomic variations that might involve DSB intermediates. We now use an unbiased, high-throughput approach to identify genomic regions harboring recurrent DSBs in primary neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs). We identify 27 recurrent DSB clusters (RDCs), and remarkably, all occur within gene bodies. Most of these NSPC RDCs were detected only upon mild, aphidicolin-induced replication stress, providing a nucleotide-resolution view of replication-associated genomic fragile sites. The vast majority of RDCs occur in long, transcribed, and late-replicating genes. Moreover, almost 90% of identified RDC-containing genes are involved in synapse function and/or neural cell adhesion, with a substantial fraction also implicated in tumor suppression and/or mental disorders. Our characterization of NSPC RDCs reveals a basis of gene fragility and suggests potential impacts of DNA breaks on neurodevelopment and neural functions.",1
Distinct Circuits for the Formation and Retrieval of an Imprinted Olfactory Memory.,"Memories formed early in life are particularly stable and influential, representing privileged experiences that shape enduring behaviors. We show that exposing newly hatched C. elegans to pathogenic bacteria results in persistent aversion to those bacterial odors, whereas adult exposure generates only transient aversive memory. Long-lasting imprinted aversion has a critical period in the first larval stage and is specific to the experienced pathogen. Distinct groups of neurons are required during formation (AIB, RIM) and retrieval (AIY, RIA) of the imprinted memory. RIM synthesizes the neuromodulator tyramine, which is required in the L1 stage for learning. AIY memory retrieval neurons sense tyramine via the SER-2 receptor, which is essential for imprinted, but not for adult-learned, aversion. Odor responses in several neurons, most notably RIA, are altered in imprinted animals. These findings provide insight into neuronal substrates of different forms of memory, and lay a foundation for further understanding of early learning.",1
Dorsal Raphe Dopamine Neurons Represent the Experience of Social Isolation.,"The motivation to seek social contact may arise from either positive or negative emotional states, as social interaction can be rewarding and social isolation can be aversive. While ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons may mediate social reward, a cellular substrate for the negative affective state of loneliness has remained elusive. Here, we identify a functional role for DA neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), in which we observe synaptic changes following acute social isolation. DRN DA neurons show increased activity upon social contact following isolation, revealed by in vivo calcium imaging. Optogenetic activation of DRN DA neurons increases social preference but causes place avoidance. Furthermore, these neurons are necessary for promoting rebound sociability following an acute period of isolation. Finally, the degree to which these neurons modulate behavior is predicted by social rank, together supporting a role for DRN dopamine neurons in mediating a loneliness-like state. PAPERCLIP.",1
The Cellular Phase of Alzheimer's Disease.,"The amyloid hypothesis for Alzheimer's disease (AD) posits a neuron-centric, linear cascade initiated by Abeta and leading to dementia. This direct causality is incompatible with clinical observations. We review evidence supporting a long, complex cellular phase consisting of feedback and feedforward responses of astrocytes, microglia, and vasculature. The field must incorporate this holistic view and take advantage of advances in single-cell approaches to resolve the critical junctures at which perturbations initially amenable to compensatory feedback transform into irreversible, progressive neurodegeneration.",1
A New Way to Diversify Antibodies by DNA Transposition.,"While searching for new therapeutics against malaria, Lanzavecchia and colleagues discovered that antibodies can be diversified by DNA sequences encoded outside of antibody genes.",1
A Receptor for All Occasions.,"Cells communicate with their environment, in part, through cell surface receptors. Engineering receptors that both sense arbitrary inputs and provide outputs orthogonal to endogenous signaling pathways has been a challenge. Now, Lim and colleagues report a system based on synthetic Notch receptors that allows independent control of both inputs and outputs in diverse cell types.",1
"Let It Go and Open Up, an Ensemble of Ion Channel Active States.","Ligand binding usually moves the target protein from an ensemble of inactive states to a well-defined active conformation. Matthies et al. flip this scheme around, finding that, for the magnesium channel CorA, loss of ligand binding induces an ensemble of conformations that turn the channel on.",1
Pluripotency without Proliferation.,"Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) are capable of unlimited proliferation without losing pluripotency. Scognamiglio et al. now reveal that Myc depletion shifts mESCs into a dormant state reminiscent of embryonic diapause in which pluripotency remains fully preserved, thus decoupling pluripotency from proliferative programs.",1
A Mechanism for Somatic Brain Mosaicism.,"Double-strand break repair is required for neural development, and brain cells contain somatic genomic variations. Now, Wei et al. demonstrate that neural stem and progenitor cells undergo very frequent DNA breaks in a very restricted set of genes involved in neural cell adhesion and synapse function.",1
Degradation of Phage Transcripts by CRISPR-Associated RNases Enables Type III CRISPR-Cas Immunity.,"Type III-A CRISPR-Cas systems defend prokaryotes against viral infection using CRISPR RNA (crRNA)-guided nucleases that perform co-transcriptional cleavage of the viral target DNA and its transcripts. Whereas DNA cleavage is essential for immunity, the function of RNA targeting is unknown. Here, we show that transcription-dependent targeting results in a sharp increase of viral genomes in the host cell when the target is located in a late-expressed phage gene. In this targeting condition, mutations in the active sites of the type III-A RNases Csm3 and Csm6 lead to the accumulation of the target phage mRNA and abrogate immunity. Csm6 is also required to provide defense in the presence of mutated phage targets, when DNA cleavage efficiency is reduced. Our results show that the degradation of phage transcripts by CRISPR-associated RNases ensures robust immunity in situations that lead to a slow clearance of the target DNA.",1
Metabolic Heterogeneity in Human Lung Tumors.,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is heterogeneous in the genetic and environmental parameters that influence cell metabolism in culture. Here, we assessed the impact of these factors on human NSCLC metabolism in vivo using intraoperative (13)C-glucose infusions in nine NSCLC patients to compare metabolism between tumors and benign lung. While enhanced glycolysis and glucose oxidation were common among these tumors, we observed evidence for oxidation of multiple nutrients in each of them, including lactate as a potential carbon source. Moreover, metabolically heterogeneous regions were identified within and between tumors, and surprisingly, our data suggested potential contributions of non-glucose nutrients in well-perfused tumor areas. Our findings not only demonstrate the heterogeneity in tumor metabolism in vivo but also highlight the strong influence of the microenvironment on this feature.",1
Dynein Clusters into Lipid Microdomains on Phagosomes to Drive Rapid Transport toward Lysosomes.,"Diverse cellular processes are driven by motor proteins that are recruited to and generate force on lipid membranes. Surprisingly little is known about how membranes control the force from motors and how this may impact specific cellular functions. Here, we show that dynein motors physically cluster into microdomains on the membrane of a phagosome as it matures inside cells. Such geometrical reorganization allows many dyneins within a cluster to generate cooperative force on a single microtubule. This results in rapid directed transport of the phagosome toward microtubule minus ends, likely promoting phagolysosome fusion and pathogen degradation. We show that lipophosphoglycan, the major molecule implicated in immune evasion of Leishmania donovani, inhibits phagosome motion by disrupting the clustering and therefore the cooperative force generation of dynein. These findings appear relevant to several pathogens that prevent phagosome-lysosome fusion by targeting lipid microdomains on phagosomes.",1
Precision Tumor Recognition by T Cells With Combinatorial Antigen-Sensing Circuits.,"T cells can be re-directed to kill cancer cells using chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) or T cell receptors (TCRs). This approach, however, is constrained by the rarity of tumor-specific single antigens. Targeting antigens also found on bystander tissues can cause life-threatening adverse effects. A powerful way to enhance ON-target activity of therapeutic T cells is to engineer them to require combinatorial antigens. Here, we engineer a combinatorially activated T cell circuit in which a synthetic Notch receptor for one antigen induces the expression of a CAR for a second antigen. These dual-receptor AND-gate T cells are only armed and activated in the presence of dual antigen tumor cells. These T cells show precise therapeutic discrimination in vivo-sparing single antigen ""bystander"" tumors while efficiently clearing combinatorial antigen ""disease"" tumors. This type of precision dual-receptor circuit opens the door to immune recognition of a wider range of tumors. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",1
Engineering Customized Cell Sensing and Response Behaviors Using Synthetic Notch Receptors.,"The Notch protein is one of the most mechanistically direct transmembrane receptors-the intracellular domain contains a transcriptional regulator that is released from the membrane when engagement of the cognate extracellular ligand induces intramembrane proteolysis. We find that chimeric forms of Notch, in which both the extracellular sensor module and the intracellular transcriptional module are replaced with heterologous protein domains, can serve as a general platform for generating novel cell-cell contact signaling pathways. Synthetic Notch (synNotch) pathways can drive user-defined functional responses in diverse mammalian cell types. Because individual synNotch pathways do not share common signaling intermediates, the pathways are functionally orthogonal. Thus, multiple synNotch receptors can be used in the same cell to achieve combinatorial integration of environmental cues, including Boolean response programs, multi-cellular signaling cascades, and self-organized cellular patterns. SynNotch receptors provide extraordinary flexibility in engineering cells with customized sensing/response behaviors to user-specified extracellular cues.",1
Actin Dynamics Regulates Dendritic Cell-Mediated Transfer of HIV-1 to T Cells.,"Whereas human dendritic cells (DCs) are largely resistant to productive infection with HIV-1, they have a unique ability to take up the virus and transmit it efficiently to T lymphocytes through a process of trans-infection or trans-enhancement. To elucidate the molecular and cell biological mechanism for trans-enhancement, we performed an shRNA screen of several hundred genes involved in organelle and membrane trafficking in immature human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs). We identified TSPAN7 and DNM2, which control actin nucleation and stabilization, as having important and distinct roles in limiting HIV-1 endocytosis and in maintaining virus particles on dendrites, which is required for efficient transfer to T lymphocytes. Further characterization of this process may provide insights not only into the role of DCs in transmission and dissemination of HIV-1 but also more broadly into mechanisms controlling capture and internalization of pathogens.",1
Timeline: iPSCs--The First Decade.,"Research into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has expanded at a remarkable pace in the decade since Shinya Yamanaka and Kazutoshi Takahashi first reported their groundbreaking discovery in 2006. This Timeline highlights the key events in the development of this field, including basic insights into the production of iPSCs and how they have been applied to improve our understanding and treatment of human disease.",1
Parsing the Interferon Transcriptional Network and Its Disease Associations.,"Type 1 interferon (IFN) is a key mediator of organismal responses to pathogens, eliciting prototypical ""interferon signature genes"" that encode antiviral and inflammatory mediators. For a global view of IFN signatures and regulatory pathways, we performed gene expression and chromatin analyses of the IFN-induced response across a range of immunocyte lineages. These distinguished ISGs by cell-type specificity, kinetics, and sensitivity to tonic IFN and revealed underlying changes in chromatin configuration. We combined 1,398 human and mouse datasets to computationally infer ISG modules and their regulators, validated by genetic analysis in both species. Some ISGs are controlled by Stat1/2 and Irf9 and the ISRE DNA motif, but others appeared dependent on non-canonical factors. This regulatory framework helped to interpret JAK1 blockade pharmacology, different clusters being affected under tonic or IFN-stimulated conditions, and the IFN signatures previously associated with human diseases, revealing unrecognized subtleties in disease footprints, as affected by human ancestry.",1
Molecular Profiling Reveals Biologically Discrete Subsets and Pathways of Progression in Diffuse Glioma.,"Therapy development for adult diffuse glioma is hindered by incomplete knowledge of somatic glioma driving alterations and suboptimal disease classification. We defined the complete set of genes associated with 1,122 diffuse grade II-III-IV gliomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas and used molecular profiles to improve disease classification, identify molecular correlations, and provide insights into the progression from low- to high-grade disease. Whole-genome sequencing data analysis determined that ATRX but not TERT promoter mutations are associated with increased telomere length. Recent advances in glioma classification based on IDH mutation and 1p/19q co-deletion status were recapitulated through analysis of DNA methylation profiles, which identified clinically relevant molecular subsets. A subtype of IDH mutant glioma was associated with DNA demethylation and poor outcome; a group of IDH-wild-type diffuse glioma showed molecular similarity to pilocytic astrocytoma and relatively favorable survival. Understanding of cohesive disease groups may aid improved clinical outcomes.",1
Cell-Type-Specific Control of Brainstem Locomotor Circuits by Basal Ganglia.,"The basal ganglia (BG) are critical for adaptive motor control, but the circuit principles underlying their pathway-specific modulation of target regions are not well understood. Here, we dissect the mechanisms underlying BG direct and indirect pathway-mediated control of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR), a brainstem target of BG that is critical for locomotion. We optogenetically dissect the locomotor function of the three neurochemically distinct cell types within the MLR: glutamatergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic neurons. We find that the glutamatergic subpopulation encodes locomotor state and speed, is necessary and sufficient for locomotion, and is selectively innervated by BG. We further show activation and suppression, respectively, of MLR glutamatergic neurons by direct and indirect pathways, which is required for bidirectional control of locomotion by BG circuits. These findings provide a fundamental understanding of how BG can initiate or suppress a motor program through cell-type-specific regulation of neurons linked to specific actions.",1
Muscle-type Identity of Proprioceptors Specified by Spatially Restricted Signals from Limb Mesenchyme.,"The selectivity with which proprioceptive sensory neurons innervate their central and peripheral targets implies that they exhibit distinctions in muscle-type identity. The molecular correlates of proprioceptor identity and its origins remain largely unknown, however. In screens to define muscle-type proprioceptor character, we find all-or-none differences in gene expression for proprioceptors that control antagonistic muscles at a single hindlimb joint. Analysis of three of these genes, cadherin13 (cdh13), semaphorin5a (sema5a), and cartilage-acidic protein-1 (crtac1), reveals expression in proprioceptor subsets that supply muscle groups located at restricted dorsoventral and proximodistal domains of the limb. Genetically altering the dorsoventral character of the limb mesenchyme elicits a change in the profile of proprioceptor cdh13, sema5a, and crtac1 expression. These findings indicate that proprioceptors acquire aspects of their muscle-type identity in response to mesenchymal signals expressed in restricted proximodistal and dorsoventral domains of the developing limb.",1
LRRC8 Proteins Form Volume-Regulated Anion Channels that Sense Ionic Strength.,"The volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) is activated when a cell swells, and it plays a central role in maintaining cell volume in response to osmotic challenges. SWELL1 (LRRC8A) was recently identified as an essential component of VRAC. However, the identity of the pore-forming subunits of VRAC and how the channel is gated by cell swelling are unknown. Here, we show that SWELL1 and up to four other LRRC8 subunits assemble into heterogeneous complexes of approximately 800 kDa. When reconstituted into bilayers, LRRC8 complexes are sufficient to form anion channels activated by osmolality gradients. In bilayers, as well as in cells, the single-channel conductance of the complexes depends on the LRRC8 composition. Finally, low ionic strength (Gamma) in the absence of an osmotic gradient activates the complexes in bilayers. These data demonstrate that LRRC8 proteins together constitute the VRAC pore and that hypotonic stress can activate VRAC through a decrease in cytoplasmic Gamma.",1
Post-translational Control of the Temporal Dynamics of Transcription Factor Activity Regulates Neurogenesis.,"Neurogenesis is initiated by the transient expression of the highly conserved proneural proteins, bHLH transcriptional regulators. Here, we discover a conserved post-translational switch governing the duration of proneural protein activity that is required for proper neuronal development. Phosphorylation of a single Serine at the same position in Scute and Atonal proneural proteins governs the transition from active to inactive forms by regulating DNA binding. The equivalent Neurogenin2 Threonine also regulates DNA binding and proneural activity in the developing mammalian neocortex. Using genome editing in Drosophila, we show that Atonal outlives its mRNA but is inactivated by phosphorylation. Inhibiting the phosphorylation of the conserved proneural Serine causes quantitative changes in expression dynamics and target gene expression resulting in neuronal number and fate defects. Strikingly, even a subtle change from Serine to Threonine appears to shift the duration of Atonal activity in vivo, resulting in neuronal fate defects.",1
Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Regulates Glycolysis through Mobilization of Aldolase from the Actin Cytoskeleton.,"The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway regulates multiple steps in glucose metabolism and also cytoskeletal functions, such as cell movement and attachment. Here, we show that PI3K directly coordinates glycolysis with cytoskeletal dynamics in an AKT-independent manner. Growth factors or insulin stimulate the PI3K-dependent activation of Rac, leading to disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, release of filamentous actin-bound aldolase A, and an increase in aldolase activity. Consistently, PI3K inhibitors, but not AKT, SGK, or mTOR inhibitors, cause a significant decrease in glycolysis at the step catalyzed by aldolase, while activating PIK3CA mutations have the opposite effect. These results point toward a master regulatory function of PI3K that integrates an epithelial cell's metabolism and its form, shape, and function, coordinating glycolysis with the energy-intensive dynamics of actin remodeling.",1
Electron Transport Chain Remodeling by GSK3 during Oogenesis Connects Nutrient State to Reproduction.,"Reproduction is heavily influenced by nutrition and metabolic state. Many common reproductive disorders in humans are associated with diabetes and metabolic syndrome. We characterized the metabolic mechanisms that support oogenesis and found that mitochondria in mature Drosophila oocytes enter a low-activity state of respiratory quiescence by remodeling the electron transport chain (ETC). This shift in mitochondrial function leads to extensive glycogen accumulation late in oogenesis and is required for the developmental competence of the oocyte. Decreased insulin signaling initiates ETC remodeling and mitochondrial respiratory quiescence through glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). Intriguingly, we observed similar ETC remodeling and glycogen uptake in maturing Xenopus oocytes, suggesting that these processes are evolutionarily conserved aspects of oocyte development. Our studies reveal an important link between metabolism and oocyte maturation.",1
Toll Receptor-Mediated Hippo Signaling Controls Innate Immunity in Drosophila.,"The Hippo signaling pathway functions through Yorkie to control tissue growth and homeostasis. How this pathway regulates non-developmental processes remains largely unexplored. Here, we report an essential role for Hippo signaling in innate immunity whereby Yorkie directly regulates the transcription of the Drosophila IkappaB homolog, Cactus, in Toll receptor-mediated antimicrobial response. Loss of Hippo pathway tumor suppressors or activation of Yorkie in fat bodies, the Drosophila immune organ, leads to elevated cactus mRNA levels, decreased expression of antimicrobial peptides, and vulnerability to infection by Gram-positive bacteria. Furthermore, Gram-positive bacteria acutely activate Hippo-Yorkie signaling in fat bodies via the Toll-Myd88-Pelle cascade through Pelle-mediated phosphorylation and degradation of the Cka subunit of the Hippo-inhibitory STRIPAK PP2A complex. Our studies elucidate a Toll-mediated Hippo signaling pathway in antimicrobial response, highlight the importance of regulating IkappaB/Cactus transcription in innate immunity, and identify Gram-positive bacteria as extracellular stimuli of Hippo signaling under physiological settings.",1
Trim28 Haploinsufficiency Triggers Bi-stable Epigenetic Obesity.,"More than one-half billion people are obese, and despite progress in genetic research, much of the heritability of obesity remains enigmatic. Here, we identify a Trim28-dependent network capable of triggering obesity in a non-Mendelian, ""on/off"" manner. Trim28(+/D9) mutant mice exhibit a bi-modal body-weight distribution, with isogenic animals randomly emerging as either normal or obese and few intermediates. We find that the obese-""on"" state is characterized by reduced expression of an imprinted gene network including Nnat, Peg3, Cdkn1c, and Plagl1 and that independent targeting of these alleles recapitulates the stochastic bi-stable disease phenotype. Adipose tissue transcriptome analyses in children indicate that humans too cluster into distinct sub-populations, stratifying according to Trim28 expression, transcriptome organization, and obesity-associated imprinted gene dysregulation. These data provide evidence of discrete polyphenism in mouse and man and thus carry important implications for complex trait genetics, evolution, and medicine.",1
Alpha and Beta Type 1 Interferon Signaling: Passage for Diverse Biologic Outcomes.,"Type I interferon (IFN-I) elicits a complex cascade of events in response to microbial infection. Here, we review recent developments illuminating the large number of IFN-I species and describing their unique biologic functions.",1
The Importance of Timing.,"Building a nervous system requires a precise sequence of genetic transitions, mediated in part by the temporal and spatial regulation of transcription factors. Quan et al. add to our understanding of this regulation by describing an evolutionarily conserved post-translational mechanism that rapidly extinguishes proneural protein activity in neural precursors.",1
Flexible Ion Barrier.,"The central vasculature of plant roots is protected by a hydrophobic ring of endodermal cells that are enclosed by lamellae of suberin. Barberon et al. demonstrate that endodermal suberization plasticity facilitates ion homeostasis, with antithetical regulation of suberin deposition and degradation by the phytohormones abscisic acid and ethylene.",1
Reflexes in Immunity.,"Simple reflex circuits provide crucial infrastructure for the neurological control of organ systems--even the immune system. Now, Gabanyi et al. reveal a reflex mechanism in gut activated by the presence of pathogens that forces macrophages into a tissue protective phenotype.",1
Epigenetic ON/OFF Switches for Obesity.,Heritable epigenetic mechanisms might contribute to the worldwide increase in the prevalence of obesity. Dalgaard et al. identify an epigenetic molecular switch that controls body weight control. The discovery suggests the existence of mammalian polyphenism in energy metabolism and might have implications for strategies to limit the obesity epidemic.,1
Are We Really Vastly Outnumbered? Revisiting the Ratio of Bacterial to Host Cells in Humans.,"It is often presented as common knowledge that, in the human body, bacteria outnumber human cells by a ratio of at least 10:1. Revisiting the question, we find that the ratio is much closer to 1:1.",1
Cancer Immunosurveillance by Tissue-Resident Innate Lymphoid Cells and Innate-like T Cells.,"Malignancy can be suppressed by the immune system in a process termed immunosurveillance. However, to what extent immunosurveillance occurs in spontaneous cancers and the composition of participating cell types remains obscure. Here, we show that cell transformation triggers a tissue-resident lymphocyte response in oncogene-induced murine cancer models. Non-circulating cytotoxic lymphocytes, derived from innate, T cell receptor (TCR)alphabeta, and TCRgammadelta lineages, expand in early tumors. Characterized by high expression of NK1.1, CD49a, and CD103, these cells share a gene-expression signature distinct from those of conventional NK cells, T cells, and invariant NKT cells. Generation of these lymphocytes is dependent on the cytokine IL-15, but not the transcription factor Nfil3 that is required for the differentiation of tumor-infiltrating NK cells, and IL-15 deficiency, but not Nfil3 deficiency, results in accelerated tumor growth. These findings reveal a tumor-elicited immunosurveillance mechanism that engages unconventional type-1-like innate lymphoid cells and type 1 innate-like T cells.",1
Mutational Strand Asymmetries in Cancer Genomes Reveal Mechanisms of DNA Damage and Repair.,"Mutational processes constantly shape the somatic genome, leading to immunity, aging, cancer, and other diseases. When cancer is the outcome, we are afforded a glimpse into these processes by the clonal expansion of the malignant cell. Here, we characterize a less explored layer of the mutational landscape of cancer: mutational asymmetries between the two DNA strands. Analyzing whole-genome sequences of 590 tumors from 14 different cancer types, we reveal widespread asymmetries across mutagenic processes, with transcriptional (""T-class"") asymmetry dominating UV-, smoking-, and liver-cancer-associated mutations and replicative (""R-class"") asymmetry dominating POLE-, APOBEC-, and MSI-associated mutations. We report a striking phenomenon of transcription-coupled damage (TCD) on the non-transcribed DNA strand and provide evidence that APOBEC mutagenesis occurs on the lagging-strand template during DNA replication. As more genomes are sequenced, studying and classifying their asymmetries will illuminate the underlying biological mechanisms of DNA damage and repair.",1
Cross-Reactive and Potent Neutralizing Antibody Responses in Human Survivors of Natural Ebolavirus Infection.,"Recent studies have suggested that antibody-mediated protection against the Ebolaviruses may be achievable, but little is known about whether or not antibodies can confer cross-reactive protection against viruses belonging to diverse Ebolavirus species, such as Ebola virus (EBOV), Sudan virus (SUDV), and Bundibugyo virus (BDBV). We isolated a large panel of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against BDBV glycoprotein (GP) using peripheral blood B cells from survivors of the 2007 BDBV outbreak in Uganda. We determined that a large proportion of mAbs with potent neutralizing activity against BDBV bind to the glycan cap and recognize diverse epitopes within this major antigenic site. We identified several glycan cap-specific mAbs that neutralized multiple ebolaviruses, including SUDV, and a cross-reactive mAb that completely protected guinea pigs from the lethal challenge with heterologous EBOV. Our results provide a roadmap to develop a single antibody-based treatment effective against multiple Ebolavirus infections.",1
De Novo Evolutionary Emergence of a Symmetrical Protein Is Shaped by Folding Constraints.,"Molecular evolution has focused on the divergence of molecular functions, yet we know little about how structurally distinct protein folds emerge de novo. We characterized the evolutionary trajectories and selection forces underlying emergence of beta-propeller proteins, a globular and symmetric fold group with diverse functions. The identification of short propeller-like motifs (<50 amino acids) in natural genomes indicated that they expanded via tandem duplications to form extant propellers. We phylogenetically reconstructed 47-residue ancestral motifs that form five-bladed lectin propellers via oligomeric assembly. We demonstrate a functional trajectory of tandem duplications of these motifs leading to monomeric lectins. Foldability, i.e., higher efficiency of folding, was the main parameter leading to improved functionality along the entire evolutionary trajectory. However, folding constraints changed along the trajectory: initially, conflicts between monomer folding and oligomer assembly dominated, whereas subsequently, upon tandem duplication, tradeoffs between monomer stability and foldability took precedence.",1
ATPase-Modulated Stress Granules Contain a Diverse Proteome and Substructure.,"Stress granules are mRNA-protein granules that form when translation initiation is limited, and they are related to pathological granules in various neurodegenerative diseases. Super-resolution microscopy reveals stable substructures, referred to as cores, within stress granules that can be purified. Proteomic analysis of stress granule cores reveals a dense network of protein-protein interactions and links between stress granules and human diseases and identifies ATP-dependent helicases and protein remodelers as conserved stress granule components. ATP is required for stress granule assembly and dynamics. Moreover, multiple ATP-driven machines affect stress granules differently, with the CCT complex inhibiting stress granule assembly, while the MCM and RVB complexes promote stress granule persistence. Our observations suggest that stress granules contain a stable core structure surrounded by a dynamic shell with assembly, disassembly, and transitions between the core and shell modulated by numerous protein and RNA remodeling complexes.",1
Neuro-immune Interactions Drive Tissue Programming in Intestinal Macrophages.,"Proper adaptation to environmental perturbations is essential for tissue homeostasis. In the intestine, diverse environmental cues can be sensed by immune cells, which must balance resistance to microorganisms with tolerance, avoiding excess tissue damage. By applying imaging and transcriptional profiling tools, we interrogated how distinct microenvironments in the gut regulate resident macrophages. We discovered that macrophages exhibit a high degree of gene-expression specialization dependent on their proximity to the gut lumen. Lamina propria macrophages (LpMs) preferentially expressed a pro-inflammatory phenotype when compared to muscularis macrophages (MMs), which displayed a tissue-protective phenotype. Upon luminal bacterial infection, MMs further enhanced tissue-protective programs, and this was attributed to swift activation of extrinsic sympathetic neurons innervating the gut muscularis and norepinephrine signaling to beta2 adrenergic receptors on MMs. Our results reveal unique intra-tissue macrophage specialization and identify neuro-immune communication between enteric neurons and macrophages that induces rapid tissue-protective responses to distal perturbations.",1
Adaptation of Root Function by Nutrient-Induced Plasticity of Endodermal Differentiation.,"Plant roots forage the soil for minerals whose concentrations can be orders of magnitude away from those required for plant cell function. Selective uptake in multicellular organisms critically requires epithelia with extracellular diffusion barriers. In plants, such a barrier is provided by the endodermis and its Casparian strips--cell wall impregnations analogous to animal tight and adherens junctions. Interestingly, the endodermis undergoes secondary differentiation, becoming coated with hydrophobic suberin, presumably switching from an actively absorbing to a protective epithelium. Here, we show that suberization responds to a wide range of nutrient stresses, mediated by the stress hormones abscisic acid and ethylene. We reveal a striking ability of the root to not only regulate synthesis of suberin, but also selectively degrade it in response to ethylene. Finally, we demonstrate that changes in suberization constitute physiologically relevant, adaptive responses, pointing to a pivotal role of the endodermal membrane in nutrient homeostasis.",1
Evolving New Skeletal Traits by cis-Regulatory Changes in Bone Morphogenetic Proteins.,"Changes in bone size and shape are defining features of many vertebrates. Here we use genetic crosses and comparative genomics to identify specific regulatory DNA alterations controlling skeletal evolution. Armor bone-size differences in sticklebacks map to a major effect locus overlapping BMP family member GDF6. Freshwater fish express more GDF6 due in part to a transposon insertion, and transgenic overexpression of GDF6 phenocopies evolutionary changes in armor-plate size. The human GDF6 locus also has undergone distinctive regulatory evolution, including complete loss of an enhancer that is otherwise highly conserved between chimps and other mammals. Functional tests show that the ancestral enhancer drives expression in hindlimbs but not forelimbs, in locations that have been specifically modified during the human transition to bipedalism. Both gain and loss of regulatory elements can localize BMP changes to specific anatomical locations, providing a flexible regulatory basis for evolving species-specific changes in skeletal form.",1
Regulation of T Cell Receptor Signaling by DENND1B in TH2 Cells and Allergic Disease.,"The DENN domain is an evolutionary conserved protein module found in all eukaryotes and serves as an exchange factor for Rab-GTPases to regulate diverse cellular functions. Variants in DENND1B are associated with development of childhood asthma and other immune disorders. To understand how DENND1B may contribute to human disease, Dennd1b(-/-) mice were generated and exhibit hyper-allergic responses following antigen challenge. Dennd1b(-/-) TH2, but not other TH cells, exhibit delayed receptor-induced T cell receptor (TCR) downmodulation, enhanced TCR signaling, and increased production of effector cytokines. As DENND1B interacts with AP-2 and Rab35, TH2 cells deficient in AP-2 or Rab35 also exhibit enhanced TCR-mediated effector functions. Moreover, human TH2 cells carrying asthma-associated DENND1B variants express less DENND1B and phenocopy Dennd1b(-/-) TH2 cells. These results provide a molecular basis for how DENND1B, a previously unrecognized regulator of TCR downmodulation in TH2 cells, contributes to asthma pathogenesis and how DENN-domain-containing proteins may contribute to other human disorders.",1

A Proteome-wide Fission Yeast Interactome Reveals Network Evolution Principles from Yeasts to Human.,"Here, we present FissionNet, a proteome-wide binary protein interactome for S. pombe, comprising 2,278 high-quality interactions, of which approximately 50% were previously not reported in any species. FissionNet unravels previously unreported interactions implicated in processes such as gene silencing and pre-mRNA splicing. We developed a rigorous network comparison framework that accounts for assay sensitivity and specificity, revealing extensive species-specific network rewiring between fission yeast, budding yeast, and human. Surprisingly, although genes are better conserved between the yeasts, S. pombe interactions are significantly better conserved in human than in S. cerevisiae. Our framework also reveals that different modes of gene duplication influence the extent to which paralogous proteins are functionally repurposed. Finally, cross-species interactome mapping demonstrates that coevolution of interacting proteins is remarkably prevalent, a result with important implications for studying human disease in model organisms. Overall, FissionNet is a valuable resource for understanding protein functions and their evolution.",1
"Functional Genomic Landscape of Human Breast Cancer Drivers, Vulnerabilities, and Resistance.","Large-scale genomic studies have identified multiple somatic aberrations in breast cancer, including copy number alterations and point mutations. Still, identifying causal variants and emergent vulnerabilities that arise as a consequence of genetic alterations remain major challenges. We performed whole-genome small hairpin RNA (shRNA) ""dropout screens"" on 77 breast cancer cell lines. Using a hierarchical linear regression algorithm to score our screen results and integrate them with accompanying detailed genetic and proteomic information, we identify vulnerabilities in breast cancer, including candidate ""drivers,"" and reveal general functional genomic properties of cancer cells. Comparisons of gene essentiality with drug sensitivity data suggest potential resistance mechanisms, effects of existing anti-cancer drugs, and opportunities for combination therapy. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of this large dataset by identifying BRD4 as a potential target in luminal breast cancer and PIK3CA mutations as a resistance determinant for BET-inhibitors.",1
Generation and Application of Mouse-Rat Allodiploid Embryonic Stem Cells.,"Mammalian interspecific hybrids provide unique advantages for mechanistic studies of speciation, gene expression regulation, and X chromosome inactivation (XCI) but are constrained by their limited natural resources. Previous artificially generated mammalian interspecific hybrid cells are usually tetraploids with unstable genomes and limited developmental abilities. Here, we report the generation of mouse-rat allodiploid embryonic stem cells (AdESCs) by fusing haploid ESCs of the two species. The AdESCs have a stable allodiploid genome and are capable of differentiating into all three germ layers and early-stage germ cells. Both the mouse and rat alleles have comparable contributions to the expression of most genes. We have proven AdESCs as a powerful tool to study the mechanisms regulating X chromosome inactivation and to identify X inactivation-escaping genes, as well as to efficiently identify genes regulating phenotypic differences between species. A similar method could be used to create hybrid AdESCs of other distantly related species.",1
Ebola Viral Glycoprotein Bound to Its Endosomal Receptor Niemann-Pick C1.,"Filoviruses, including Ebola and Marburg, cause fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and primates. Understanding how these viruses enter host cells could help to develop effective therapeutics. An endosomal protein, Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), has been identified as a necessary entry receptor for this process, and priming of the viral glycoprotein (GP) to a fusion-competent state is a prerequisite for NPC1 binding. Here, we have determined the crystal structure of the primed GP (GPcl) of Ebola virus bound to domain C of NPC1 (NPC1-C) at a resolution of 2.3 A. NPC1-C utilizes two protruding loops to engage a hydrophobic cavity on head of GPcl. Upon enzymatic cleavage and NPC1-C binding, conformational change in the GPcl further affects the state of the internal fusion loop, triggering membrane fusion. Our data therefore provide structural insights into filovirus entry in the late endosome and the molecular basis for design of therapeutic inhibitors of viral entry.",1
Extracellular Vesicles from Trypanosoma brucei Mediate Virulence Factor Transfer and Cause Host Anemia.,"Intercellular communication between parasites and with host cells provides mechanisms for parasite development, immune evasion, and disease pathology. Bloodstream African trypanosomes produce membranous nanotubes that originate from the flagellar membrane and disassociate into free extracellular vesicles (EVs). Trypanosome EVs contain several flagellar proteins that contribute to virulence, and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense EVs contain the serum resistance-associated protein (SRA) necessary for human infectivity. T. b. rhodesiense EVs transfer SRA to non-human infectious trypanosomes, allowing evasion of human innate immunity. Trypanosome EVs can also fuse with mammalian erythrocytes, resulting in rapid erythrocyte clearance and anemia. These data indicate that trypanosome EVs are organelles mediating non-hereditary virulence factor transfer and causing host erythrocyte remodeling, inducing anemia.",1
Restoration of Visual Function by Enhancing Conduction in Regenerated Axons.,"Although a number of repair strategies have been shown to promote axon outgrowth following neuronal injury in the mammalian CNS, it remains unclear whether regenerated axons establish functional synapses and support behavior. Here, in both juvenile and adult mice, we show that either PTEN and SOCS3 co-deletion, or co-overexpression of osteopontin (OPN)/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1)/ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), induces regrowth of retinal axons and formation of functional synapses in the superior colliculus (SC) but not significant recovery of visual function. Further analyses suggest that regenerated axons fail to conduct action potentials from the eye to the SC due to lack of myelination. Consistent with this idea, administration of voltage-gated potassium channel blockers restores conduction and results in increased visual acuity. Thus, enhancing both regeneration and conduction effectively improves function after retinal axon injury.",1
Prefrontal Parvalbumin Neurons in Control of Attention.,"While signatures of attention have been extensively studied in sensory systems, the neural sources and computations responsible for top-down control of attention are largely unknown. Using chronic recordings in mice, we found that fast-spiking parvalbumin (FS-PV) interneurons in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) uniformly show increased and sustained firing during goal-driven attentional processing, correlating to the level of attention. Elevated activity of FS-PV neurons on the timescale of seconds predicted successful execution of behavior. Successful allocation of attention was characterized by strong synchronization of FS-PV neurons, increased gamma oscillations, and phase locking of pyramidal firing. Phase-locked pyramidal neurons showed gamma-phase-dependent rate modulation during successful attentional processing. Optogenetic silencing of FS-PV neurons deteriorated attentional processing, while optogenetic synchronization of FS-PV neurons at gamma frequencies had pro-cognitive effects and improved goal-directed behavior. FS-PV neurons thus act as a functional unit coordinating the activity in the local mPFC circuit during goal-driven attentional processing.",1
Astrocytes Assemble Thalamocortical Synapses by Bridging NRX1alpha and NL1 via Hevin.,"Proper establishment of synapses is critical for constructing functional circuits. Interactions between presynaptic neurexins and postsynaptic neuroligins coordinate the formation of synaptic adhesions. An isoform code determines the direct interactions of neurexins and neuroligins across the synapse. However, whether extracellular linker proteins can expand such a code is unknown. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches, we found that hevin, an astrocyte-secreted synaptogenic protein, assembles glutamatergic synapses by bridging neurexin-1alpha and neuroligin-1B, two isoforms that do not interact with each other. Bridging of neurexin-1alpha and neuroligin-1B via hevin is critical for the formation and plasticity of thalamocortical connections in the developing visual cortex. These results show that astrocytes promote the formation of synapses by modulating neurexin/neuroligin adhesions through hevin secretion. Our findings also provide an important mechanistic insight into how mutations in these genes may lead to circuit dysfunction in diseases such as autism.",1
Nitric Oxide as a Switching Mechanism between Axon Degeneration and Regrowth during Developmental Remodeling.,"During development, neurons switch among growth states, such as initial axon outgrowth, axon pruning, and regrowth. By studying the stereotypic remodeling of the Drosophila mushroom body (MB), we found that the heme-binding nuclear receptor E75 is dispensable for initial axon outgrowth of MB gamma neurons but is required for their developmental regrowth. Genetic experiments and pharmacological manipulations on ex-vivo-cultured brains indicate that neuronally generated nitric oxide (NO) promotes pruning but inhibits regrowth. We found that high NO levels inhibit the physical interaction between the E75 and UNF nuclear receptors, likely accounting for its repression of regrowth. Additionally, NO synthase (NOS) activity is downregulated at the onset of regrowth, at least partially, by short inhibitory NOS isoforms encoded within the NOS locus, indicating how NO production could be developmentally regulated. Taken together, these results suggest that NO signaling provides a switching mechanism between the degenerative and regenerative states of neuronal remodeling.",1
WNT-SHH Antagonism Specifies and Expands Stem Cells prior to Niche Formation.,"Adult stem cell (SC) maintenance and differentiation are known to depend on signals received from the niche. Here, however, we demonstrate a mechanism for SC specification and regulation that is niche independent. Using immunofluorescence, live imaging, genetics, cell-cycle analyses, in utero lentiviral transduction, and lineage-tracing, we show that in developing hair buds, SCs are born from asymmetric divisions that differentially display WNT and SHH signaling. Displaced WNT(lo) suprabasal daughters become SCs that respond to paracrine SHH and symmetrically expand. By contrast, basal daughters remain WNT(hi). They express but do not respond to SHH and hence maintain slow-cycling, asymmetric divisions. Over time, they become short-lived progenitors, generating differentiating daughters rather than SCs. Thus, in contrast to an established niche that harbors a fixed SC pool whose expelled progeny differentiate, asymmetric divisions first specify and displace early SCs into an environment conducive to expansion and later restrict their numbers by switching asymmetric fates.",1
Integrins Form an Expanding Diffusional Barrier that Coordinates Phagocytosis.,"Phagocytosis is initiated by lateral clustering of receptors, which in turn activates Src-family kinases (SFKs). Activation of SFKs requires depletion of tyrosine phosphatases from the area of particle engagement. We investigated how the major phosphatase CD45 is excluded from contact sites, using single-molecule tracking. The mobility of CD45 increased markedly upon engagement of Fcgamma receptors. While individual CD45 molecules moved randomly, they were displaced from the advancing phagocytic cup by an expanding diffusional barrier. By micropatterning IgG, the ligand of Fcgamma receptors, we found that the barrier extended well beyond the perimeter of the receptor-ligand engagement zone. Second messengers generated by Fcgamma receptors activated integrins, which formed an actin-tethered diffusion barrier that excluded CD45. The expanding integrin wave facilitates the zippering of Fcgamma receptors onto the target and integrates the information from sparse receptor-ligand complexes, coordinating the progression and ultimate closure of the phagocytic cup.",1
Force Feedback Controls Motor Activity and Mechanical Properties of Self-Assembling Branched Actin Networks.,"Branched actin networks--created by the Arp2/3 complex, capping protein, and a nucleation promoting factor--generate and transmit forces required for many cellular processes, but their response to force is poorly understood. To address this, we assembled branched actin networks in vitro from purified components and used simultaneous fluorescence and atomic force microscopy to quantify their molecular composition and material properties under various forces. Remarkably, mechanical loading of these self-assembling materials increases their density, power, and efficiency. Microscopically, increased density reflects increased filament number and altered geometry but no change in average length. Macroscopically, increased density enhances network stiffness and resistance to mechanical failure beyond those of isotropic actin networks. These effects endow branched actin networks with memory of their mechanical history that shapes their material properties and motor activity. This work reveals intrinsic force feedback mechanisms by which mechanical resistance makes self-assembling actin networks stiffer, stronger, and more powerful.",1
The Protease Ste24 Clears Clogged Translocons.,"Translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the first step in the biogenesis of thousands of eukaryotic endomembrane proteins. Although functional ER translocation has been avidly studied, little is known about the quality control mechanisms that resolve faulty translocational states. One such faulty state is translocon clogging, in which the substrate fails to properly translocate and obstructs the translocon pore. To shed light on the machinery required to resolve clogging, we carried out a systematic screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that highlighted a role for the ER metalloprotease Ste24. We could demonstrate that Ste24 approaches the translocon upon clogging, and it interacts with and generates cleavage fragments of the clogged protein. Importantly, these functions are conserved in the human homolog, ZMPSTE24, although disease-associated mutant forms of ZMPSTE24 fail to clear the translocon. These results shed light on a new and critical task of Ste24, which safeguards the essential process of translocation.",1
Cell-free DNA Comprises an In Vivo Nucleosome Footprint that Informs Its Tissues-Of-Origin.,"Nucleosome positioning varies between cell types. By deep sequencing cell-free DNA (cfDNA), isolated from circulating blood plasma, we generated maps of genome-wide in vivo nucleosome occupancy and found that short cfDNA fragments harbor footprints of transcription factors. The cfDNA nucleosome occupancies correlate well with the nuclear architecture, gene structure, and expression observed in cells, suggesting that they could inform the cell type of origin. Nucleosome spacing inferred from cfDNA in healthy individuals correlates most strongly with epigenetic features of lymphoid and myeloid cells, consistent with hematopoietic cell death as the normal source of cfDNA. We build on this observation to show how nucleosome footprints can be used to infer cell types contributing to cfDNA in pathological states such as cancer. Since this strategy does not rely on genetic differences to distinguish between contributing tissues, it may enable the noninvasive monitoring of a much broader set of clinical conditions than currently possible.",1
Biology and Applications of CRISPR Systems: Harnessing Nature's Toolbox for Genome Engineering.,"Bacteria and archaea possess a range of defense mechanisms to combat plasmids and viral infections. Unique among these are the CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR associated) systems, which provide adaptive immunity against foreign nucleic acids. CRISPR systems function by acquiring genetic records of invaders to facilitate robust interference upon reinfection. In this Review, we discuss recent advances in understanding the diverse mechanisms by which Cas proteins respond to foreign nucleic acids and how these systems have been harnessed for precision genome manipulation in a wide array of organisms.",1
The Heroes of CRISPR.,"Three years ago, scientists reported that CRISPR technology can enable precise and efficient genome editing in living eukaryotic cells. Since then, the method has taken the scientific community by storm, with thousands of labs using it for applications from biomedicine to agriculture. Yet, the preceding 20-year journey--the discovery of a strange microbial repeat sequence; its recognition as an adaptive immune system; its biological characterization; and its repurposing for genome engineering--remains little known. This Perspective aims to fill in this backstory--the history of ideas and the stories of pioneers--and draw lessons about the remarkable ecosystem underlying scientific discovery.",1
Shadow on the Plant: A Strategy to Exit.,"The light spectrum perceived by plants is affected by crowding, which results in the shade avoidance syndrome (SAS). Findings presented by Pedmale et al. bring cryptochromes to the forefront of SAS and elucidate a fascinating molecular crosstalk between photoreceptor systems operating in different wavebands.",1
Street View of the Cognitive Map.,"To understand the origins of spatial navigational signals, Acharya et al. record the activity of hippocampal neurons in rats running in open two-dimensional environments in both the real world and in virtual reality. They find that a subset of hippocampal neurons have directional tuning that persists in virtual reality, where vestibular cues are absent.",1
A New aDENNDum to Genetics of Childhood Asthma.,"Childhood asthma is typically associated with a polarized Th2 response to inhaled allergens and is influenced by genetics. Yang et al. show that the asthma susceptibility gene DENND1B controls cytokine production in Th2 lymphocytes by controlling the rate of TCR internalization and routing to endosomes, providing a molecular basis for how DENND1B contributes to asthma pathogenesis.",1
Standing Up for Sticklebacks.,"The morphology of the vertebrate skeleton exhibits tremendous plasticity in evolution, allowing adaptation to a wide variety of ecological niches and lifestyles. Indjeian et al. now uncover how the cis regulation of a gene controls skeletal variation in fish and might have contributed to the evolution of bipedalism in humans.",1
Structure of Human DROSHA.,"MicroRNA maturation is initiated by RNase III DROSHA that cleaves the stem loop of primary microRNA. DROSHA functions together with its cofactor DGCR8 in a heterotrimeric complex known as Microprocessor. Here, we report the X-ray structure of DROSHA in complex with the C-terminal helix of DGCR8. We find that DROSHA contains two DGCR8-binding sites, one on each RNase III domain (RIIID), which mediate the assembly of Microprocessor. The overall structure of DROSHA is surprisingly similar to that of Dicer despite no sequence homology apart from the C-terminal part, suggesting that DROSHA may have evolved from a Dicer homolog. DROSHA exhibits unique features, including non-canonical zinc-finger motifs, a long insertion in the first RIIID, and the kinked link between Connector helix and RIIID, which explains the 11-bp-measuring ""ruler"" activity of DROSHA. Our study implicates the evolutionary origin of DROSHA and elucidates the molecular basis of Microprocessor assembly and primary microRNA processing.",1
Cryptochromes Interact Directly with PIFs to Control Plant Growth in Limiting Blue Light.,"Sun-loving plants have the ability to detect and avoid shading through sensing of both blue and red light wavelengths. Higher plant cryptochromes (CRYs) control how plants modulate growth in response to changes in blue light. For growth under a canopy, where blue light is diminished, CRY1 and CRY2 perceive this change and respond by directly contacting two bHLH transcription factors, PIF4 and PIF5. These factors are also known to be controlled by phytochromes, the red/far-red photoreceptors; however, transcriptome analyses indicate that the gene regulatory programs induced by the different light wavelengths are distinct. Our results indicate that CRYs signal by modulating PIF activity genome wide and that these factors integrate binding of different plant photoreceptors to facilitate growth changes under different light conditions.",1
Noncoding RNA NORAD Regulates Genomic Stability by Sequestering PUMILIO Proteins.,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as regulators of diverse biological processes. Here, we describe the initial functional analysis of a poorly characterized human lncRNA (LINC00657) that is induced after DNA damage, which we termed ""noncoding RNA activated by DNA damage"", or NORAD. NORAD is highly conserved and abundant, with expression levels of approximately 500-1,000 copies per cell. Remarkably, inactivation of NORAD triggers dramatic aneuploidy in previously karyotypically stable cell lines. NORAD maintains genomic stability by sequestering PUMILIO proteins, which repress the stability and translation of mRNAs to which they bind. In the absence of NORAD, PUMILIO proteins drive chromosomal instability by hyperactively repressing mitotic, DNA repair, and DNA replication factors. These findings introduce a mechanism that regulates the activity of a deeply conserved and highly dosage-sensitive family of RNA binding proteins and reveal unanticipated roles for a lncRNA and PUMILIO proteins in the maintenance of genomic stability.",1
Structure of a Chaperone-Usher Pilus Reveals the Molecular Basis of Rod Uncoiling.,"Types 1 and P pili are prototypical bacterial cell-surface appendages playing essential roles in mediating adhesion of bacteria to the urinary tract. These pili, assembled by the chaperone-usher pathway, are polymers of pilus subunits assembling into two parts: a thin, short tip fibrillum at the top, mounted on a long pilus rod. The rod adopts a helical quaternary structure and is thought to play essential roles: its formation may drive pilus extrusion by preventing backsliding of the nascent growing pilus within the secretion pore; the rod also has striking spring-like properties, being able to uncoil and recoil depending on the intensity of shear forces generated by urine flow. Here, we present an atomic model of the P pilus generated from a 3.8 A resolution cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction. This structure provides the molecular basis for the rod's remarkable mechanical properties and illuminates its role in pilus secretion.",1
Insertion of the Biogenesis Factor Rei1 Probes the Ribosomal Tunnel during 60S Maturation.,"Eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis depends on several hundred assembly factors to produce functional 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits. The final phase of 60S subunit biogenesis is cytoplasmic maturation, which includes the proofreading of functional centers of the 60S subunit and the release of several ribosome biogenesis factors. We report the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the yeast 60S subunit in complex with the biogenesis factors Rei1, Arx1, and Alb1 at 3.4 A resolution. In addition to the network of interactions formed by Alb1, the structure reveals a mechanism for ensuring the integrity of the ribosomal polypeptide exit tunnel. Arx1 probes the entire set of inner-ring proteins surrounding the tunnel exit, and the C terminus of Rei1 is deeply inserted into the ribosomal tunnel, where it forms specific contacts along almost its entire length. We provide genetic and biochemical evidence that failure to insert the C terminus of Rei1 precludes subsequent steps of 60S maturation.",1
Causal Influence of Visual Cues on Hippocampal Directional Selectivity.,"Hippocampal neurons show selectivity with respect to visual cues in primates, including humans, but this has never been found in rodents. To address this long-standing discrepancy, we measured hippocampal activity from rodents during real-world random foraging. Surprisingly, approximately 25% of neurons exhibited significant directional modulation with respect to visual cues. To dissociate the contributions of visual and vestibular cues, we made similar measurements in virtual reality, in which only visual cues were informative. Here, we found significant directional modulation despite the severe loss of vestibular information, challenging prevailing theories of directionality. Changes in the amount of angular information in visual cues induced corresponding changes in head-directional modulation at the neuronal and population levels. Thus, visual cues are sufficient for-and play a predictable, causal role in-generating directionally selective hippocampal responses. These results dissociate hippocampal directional and spatial selectivity and bridge the gap between primate and rodent studies.",1
SnapShot: Interferon Signaling.,"Interferons (IFNs) are crucial cytokines of antimicrobial, antitumor, and immunomodulatory activity. The three types of IFN (I, II, and III) are classified by their receptor specificity and sequence homology. IFNs are produced and secreted by cells in response to specific stimuli. Here, we review the subsequent IFN signaling events occurring through unique receptors leading to regulation of gene expression for modulation of innate and adaptive immunity.

SPED Light Sheet Microscopy: Fast Mapping of Biological System Structure and Function.,"The goal of understanding living nervous systems has driven interest in high-speed and large field-of-view volumetric imaging at cellular resolution. Light sheet microscopy approaches have emerged for cellular-resolution functional brain imaging in small organisms such as larval zebrafish, but remain fundamentally limited in speed. Here, we have developed SPED light sheet microscopy, which combines large volumetric field-of-view via an extended depth of field with the optical sectioning of light sheet microscopy, thereby eliminating the need to physically scan detection objectives for volumetric imaging. SPED enables scanning of thousands of volumes-per-second, limited only by camera acquisition rate, through the harnessing of optical mechanisms that normally result in unwanted spherical aberrations. We demonstrate capabilities of SPED microscopy by performing fast sub-cellular resolution imaging of CLARITY mouse brains and cellular-resolution volumetric Ca(2+) imaging of entire zebrafish nervous systems. Together, SPED light sheet methods enable high-speed cellular-resolution volumetric mapping of biological system structure and function.",1
Genetic Identification of an Expansive Mechanoreceptor Sensitive to Skin Stroking.,"Touch perception begins with activation of low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) in the periphery. LTMR terminals exhibit tremendous morphological heterogeneity that specifies their mechanical receptivity. In a survey of mammalian skin, we found a preponderance of neurofilament-heavy-chain(+) circumferential endings associated with hair follicles, prompting us to develop a genetic strategy to interrogate these neurons. Targeted in vivo recordings revealed them to be Abeta field-LTMRs, identified 50 years ago but largely elusive thereafter. Remarkably, while Abeta field-LTMRs are highly sensitive to gentle stroking of the skin, they are unresponsive to hair deflection, and they encode skin indentation in the noxious range across large, spotty receptive fields. Individual Abeta field-LTMRs form up to 180 circumferential endings, making them the most anatomically expansive LTMR identified to date. Thus, Abeta field-LTMRs are a major mammalian LTMR subtype that forms circumferential endings in hairy skin, and their sensitivity to gentle skin stroking arises through integration across many low-sensitivity circumferential endings.",1
Control of Synaptic Connectivity by a Network of Drosophila IgSF Cell Surface Proteins.,"We have defined a network of interacting Drosophila cell surface proteins in which a 21-member IgSF subfamily, the Dprs, binds to a nine-member subfamily, the DIPs. The structural basis of the Dpr-DIP interaction code appears to be dictated by shape complementarity within the Dpr-DIP binding interface. Each of the six dpr and DIP genes examined here is expressed by a unique subset of larval and pupal neurons. In the neuromuscular system, interactions between Dpr11 and DIP-gamma affect presynaptic terminal development, trophic factor responses, and neurotransmission. In the visual system, dpr11 is selectively expressed by R7 photoreceptors that use Rh4 opsin (yR7s). Their primary synaptic targets, Dm8 amacrine neurons, express DIP-gamma. In dpr11 or DIP-gamma mutants, yR7 terminals extend beyond their normal termination zones in layer M6 of the medulla. DIP-gamma is also required for Dm8 survival or differentiation. Our findings suggest that Dpr-DIP interactions are important determinants of synaptic connectivity.",1
Ig Superfamily Ligand and Receptor Pairs Expressed in Synaptic Partners in Drosophila.,"Information processing relies on precise patterns of synapses between neurons. The cellular recognition mechanisms regulating this specificity are poorly understood. In the medulla of the Drosophila visual system, different neurons form synaptic connections in different layers. Here, we sought to identify candidate cell recognition molecules underlying this specificity. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we show that neurons with different synaptic specificities express unique combinations of mRNAs encoding hundreds of cell surface and secreted proteins. Using RNA-seq and protein tagging, we demonstrate that 21 paralogs of the Dpr family, a subclass of immunoglobulin (Ig)-domain containing proteins, are expressed in unique combinations in homologous neurons with different layer-specific synaptic connections. Dpr interacting proteins (DIPs), comprising nine paralogs of another subclass of Ig-containing proteins, are expressed in a complementary layer-specific fashion in a subset of synaptic partners. We propose that pairs of Dpr/DIP paralogs contribute to layer-specific patterns of synaptic connectivity.",1
Coordinated and Compartmentalized Neuromodulation Shapes Sensory Processing in Drosophila.,"Learned and adaptive behaviors rely on neural circuits that flexibly couple the same sensory input to alternative output pathways. Here, we show that the Drosophila mushroom body functions like a switchboard in which neuromodulation reroutes the same odor signal to different behavioral circuits, depending on the state and experience of the fly. Using functional synaptic imaging and electrophysiology, we reveal that dopaminergic inputs to the mushroom body modulate synaptic transmission with exquisite spatial specificity, allowing individual neurons to differentially convey olfactory signals to each of their postsynaptic targets. Moreover, we show that the dopaminergic neurons function as an interconnected network, encoding information about both an animal's external context and internal state to coordinate synaptic plasticity throughout the mushroom body. Our data suggest a general circuit mechanism for behavioral flexibility in which neuromodulatory networks act with synaptic precision to transform a single sensory input into different patterns of output activity.

Immunogenicity of Stabilized HIV-1 Envelope Trimers with Reduced Exposure of Non-neutralizing Epitopes.,"The envelope glycoprotein trimer mediates HIV-1 entry into cells. The trimer is flexible, fluctuating between closed and more open conformations and sometimes sampling the fully open, CD4-bound form. We hypothesized that conformational flexibility and transient exposure of non-neutralizing, immunodominant epitopes could hinder the induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). We therefore modified soluble Env trimers to stabilize their closed, ground states. The trimer variants were indeed stabilized in the closed conformation, with a reduced ability to undergo receptor-induced conformational changes and a decreased exposure of non-neutralizing V3-directed antibody epitopes. In rabbits, the stabilized trimers induced similar autologous Tier-1B or Tier-2 NAb titers to those elicited by the corresponding wild-type trimers but lower levels of V3-directed Tier-1A NAbs. Stabilized, closed trimers might therefore be useful components of vaccines aimed at inducing bNAbs.",1
Structural Basis of Vesicle Formation at the Inner Nuclear Membrane.,"Vesicular nucleo-cytoplasmic transport is becoming recognized as a general cellular mechanism for translocation of large cargoes across the nuclear envelope. Cargo is recruited, enveloped at the inner nuclear membrane (INM), and delivered by membrane fusion at the outer nuclear membrane. To understand the structural underpinning for this trafficking, we investigated nuclear egress of progeny herpesvirus capsids where capsid envelopment is mediated by two viral proteins, forming the nuclear egress complex (NEC). Using a multi-modal imaging approach, we visualized the NEC in situ forming coated vesicles of defined size. Cellular electron cryo-tomography revealed a protein layer showing two distinct hexagonal lattices at its membrane-proximal and membrane-distant faces, respectively. NEC coat architecture was determined by combining this information with integrative modeling using small-angle X-ray scattering data. The molecular arrangement of the NEC establishes the basic mechanism for budding and scission of tailored vesicles at the INM.",1
The Branching Point in Erythro-Myeloid Differentiation.,"Development of mature blood cell progenies from hematopoietic stem cells involves the transition through lineage-restricted progenitors. The first branching point along this developmental process is thought to separate the erythro-myeloid and lymphoid lineage fate by yielding two intermediate progenitors, the common myeloid and the common lymphoid progenitors (CMPs and CLPs). Here, we use single-cell lineage tracing to demonstrate that so-called CMPs are highly heterogeneous with respect to cellular output, with most individual CMPs yielding either only erythrocytes or only myeloid cells after transplantation. Furthermore, based on the labeling of earlier progenitors, we show that the divergence between the myeloid and erythroid lineage develops within multipotent progenitors (MPP). These data provide evidence for a model of hematopoietic branching in which multiple distinct lineage commitments occur in parallel within the MPP pool.",1
Chromothripsis and Kataegis Induced by Telomere Crisis.,"Telomere crisis occurs during tumorigenesis when depletion of the telomere reserve leads to frequent telomere fusions. The resulting dicentric chromosomes have been proposed to drive genome instability. Here, we examine the fate of dicentric human chromosomes in telomere crisis. We observed that dicentric chromosomes invariably persisted through mitosis and developed into 50-200 mum chromatin bridges connecting the daughter cells. Before their resolution at 3-20 hr after anaphase, the chromatin bridges induced nuclear envelope rupture in interphase, accumulated the cytoplasmic 3' nuclease TREX1, and developed RPA-coated single stranded (ss) DNA. CRISPR knockouts showed that TREX1 contributed to the generation of the ssDNA and the resolution of the chromatin bridges. Post-crisis clones showed chromothripsis and kataegis, presumably resulting from DNA repair and APOBEC editing of the fragmented chromatin bridge DNA. We propose that chromothripsis in human cancer may arise through TREX1-mediated fragmentation of dicentric chromosomes formed in telomere crisis.",1
DNA Entry into and Exit out of the Cohesin Ring by an Interlocking Gate Mechanism.,"Structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) complexes are proteinaceous rings that embrace DNA to enable vital chromosomal functions. The ring is formed by two SMC subunits, closed at a pair of ATPase heads, whose interaction is reinforced by a kleisin subunit. Using biochemical analysis of fission-yeast cohesin, we find that a similar series of events facilitates both topological entrapment and release of DNA. DNA-sensing lysines trigger ATP hydrolysis to open the SMC head interface, whereas the Wapl subunit disengages kleisin, but only after ATP rebinds. This suggests an interlocking gate mechanism for DNA transport both into and out of the cohesin ring. The entry direction is facilitated by a cohesin loader that appears to fold cohesin to expose the DNA sensor. Our results provide a model for dynamic DNA binding by all members of the SMC family and explain how lysine acetylation of cohesin establishes enduring sister chromatid cohesion.",1
Control of Transcript Variability in Single Mammalian Cells.,"A central question in biology is whether variability between genetically identical cells exposed to the same culture conditions is largely stochastic or deterministic. Using image-based transcriptomics in millions of single human cells, we find that while variability of cytoplasmic transcript abundance is large, it is for most genes minimally stochastic and can be predicted with multivariate models of the phenotypic state and population context of single cells. Computational multiplexing of these predictive signatures across hundreds of genes revealed a complex regulatory system that controls the observed variability of transcript abundance between individual cells. Mathematical modeling and experimental validation show that nuclear retention and transport of transcripts between the nucleus and the cytoplasm is central to buffering stochastic transcriptional fluctuations in mammalian gene expression. Our work indicates that cellular compartmentalization confines transcriptional noise to the nucleus, thereby preventing it from interfering with the control of single-cell transcript abundance in the cytoplasm.",1
Non-lethal Inhibition of Gut Microbial Trimethylamine Production for the Treatment of Atherosclerosis.,"Trimethylamine (TMA) N-oxide (TMAO), a gut-microbiota-dependent metabolite, both enhances atherosclerosis in animal models and is associated with cardiovascular risks in clinical studies. Here, we investigate the impact of targeted inhibition of the first step in TMAO generation, commensal microbial TMA production, on diet-induced atherosclerosis. A structural analog of choline, 3,3-dimethyl-1-butanol (DMB), is shown to non-lethally inhibit TMA formation from cultured microbes, to inhibit distinct microbial TMA lyases, and to both inhibit TMA production from physiologic polymicrobial cultures (e.g., intestinal contents, human feces) and reduce TMAO levels in mice fed a high-choline or L-carnitine diet. DMB inhibited choline diet-enhanced endogenous macrophage foam cell formation and atherosclerotic lesion development in apolipoprotein e(-/-) mice without alterations in circulating cholesterol levels. The present studies suggest that targeting gut microbial production of TMA specifically and non-lethal microbial inhibitors in general may serve as a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of cardiometabolic diseases.",1
Physical and Mathematical Modeling in Experimental Papers.,"An increasing number of publications include modeling. Often, such studies help us to gain a deeper insight into the phenomena studied and break down barriers between experimental and theoretical communities. However, combining experimental and theoretical work is challenging for authors, reviewers, and readers. To help maximize the usefulness and impact of combined theoretical and experimental research, this Primer describes the purpose, usefulness, and different types of models and addresses the practical aspect of integrated publications by outlining characteristics of good modeling, presentation, and fruitful collaborations.",1
Astrocytes Underlie Neuroinflammatory Memory Impairment.,Neuroinflammation is being increasingly recognized as a potential mediator of cognitive impairments in various neurological conditions. Habbas et al. demonstrate that the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha signals through astrocytes to alter synaptic transmission and impair cognition in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis.,1
How Low Cholesterol Is Good for Anti-viral Immunity.,"York et al. identify a role for decreased cholesterol biosynthesis in virally infected cells as a critical event in the induction of the anti-viral response. The mechanism involves enhanced signaling by STING in the ER membrane in response to the second messenger cGAMP, promoting increased transcription of type I interferons. The authors suggest that a ""lipid code"" is being sensed by STING to allow it to signal.",1

Zhao et al. reveal a unique intermediate state during chemical reprogramming allowing a significant improvement in its efficiency and kinetics.,1
Not All Created Equal: Lineage Hard-Wiring in the Production of Blood.,The multiple cell types comprising blood have been thought to emerge from progenitors with progressively narrower lineage options.

Cell-to-Cell Transcript Variability: Seeing Signal in the Noise.,"How stochastic is gene expression in mammalian cells? Not very, according to Battich et al., who report that single-cell variability in cytoplasmic mRNAs is remarkably predictable given measurements of a cell's phenotypic state and microenvironment. The noise from transcriptional bursts is buffered by a hallmark of eukaryotes-the nucleus.",1
Drug the Bug!,"Microbial metabolism of dietary components has been causally linked to cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis. Now, Wang et al. demonstrate that inhibition of microbial TMA lyases, essential for production of pro-atherogenic trimethylamines, prevents atherosclerosis in vivo.",1
Neuroinflammatory TNFalpha Impairs Memory via Astrocyte Signaling.,"The occurrence of cognitive disturbances upon CNS inflammation or infection has been correlated with increased levels of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha). To date, however, no specific mechanism via which this cytokine could alter cognitive circuits has been demonstrated. Here, we show that local increase of TNFalpha in the hippocampal dentate gyrus activates astrocyte TNF receptor type 1 (TNFR1), which in turn triggers an astrocyte-neuron signaling cascade that results in persistent functional modification of hippocampal excitatory synapses. Astrocytic TNFR1 signaling is necessary for the hippocampal synaptic alteration and contextual learning-memory impairment observed in experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). This process may contribute to the pathogenesis of cognitive disturbances in MS, as well as in other CNS conditions accompanied by inflammatory states or infections.",1
Limiting Cholesterol Biosynthetic Flux Spontaneously Engages Type I IFN Signaling.,"Cellular lipid requirements are achieved through a combination of biosynthesis and import programs. Using isotope tracer analysis, we show that type I interferon (IFN) signaling shifts the balance of these programs by decreasing synthesis and increasing import of cholesterol and long chain fatty acids. Genetically enforcing this metabolic shift in macrophages is sufficient to render mice resistant to viral challenge, demonstrating the importance of reprogramming the balance of these two metabolic pathways in vivo. Unexpectedly, mechanistic studies reveal that limiting flux through the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway spontaneously engages a type I IFN response in a STING-dependent manner. The upregulation of type I IFNs was traced to a decrease in the pool size of synthesized cholesterol and could be inhibited by replenishing cells with free cholesterol. Taken together, these studies delineate a metabolic-inflammatory circuit that links perturbations in cholesterol biosynthesis with activation of innate immunity.",1
A XEN-like State Bridges Somatic Cells to Pluripotency during Chemical Reprogramming.,"Somatic cells can be reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) by using pure chemicals, providing a different paradigm to study somatic reprogramming. However, the cell fate dynamics and molecular events that occur during the chemical reprogramming process remain unclear. We now show that the chemical reprogramming process requires the early formation of extra-embryonic endoderm (XEN)-like cells and a late transition from XEN-like cells to chemically-induced (Ci)PSCs, a unique route that fundamentally differs from the pathway of transcription factor-induced reprogramming. Moreover, precise manipulation of the cell fate transition in a step-wise manner through the XEN-like state allows us to identify small-molecule boosters and establish a robust chemical reprogramming system with a yield up to 1,000-fold greater than that of the previously reported protocol. These findings demonstrate that chemical reprogramming is a promising approach to manipulate cell fates.",1
CTCF-Mediated Human 3D Genome Architecture Reveals Chromatin Topology for Transcription.,"Spatial genome organization and its effect on transcription remains a fundamental question. We applied an advanced chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) strategy to comprehensively map higher-order chromosome folding and specific chromatin interactions mediated by CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) with haplotype specificity and nucleotide resolution in different human cell lineages. We find that CTCF/cohesin-mediated interaction anchors serve as structural foci for spatial organization of constitutive genes concordant with CTCF-motif orientation, whereas RNAPII interacts within these structures by selectively drawing cell-type-specific genes toward CTCF foci for coordinated transcription. Furthermore, we show that haplotype variants and allelic interactions have differential effects on chromosome configuration, influencing gene expression, and may provide mechanistic insights into functions associated with disease susceptibility. 3D genome simulation suggests a model of chromatin folding around chromosomal axes, where CTCF is involved in defining the interface between condensed and open compartments for structural regulation. Our 3D genome strategy thus provides unique insights in the topological mechanism of human variations and diseases.",1

The African Turquoise Killifish Genome Provides Insights into Evolution and Genetic Architecture of Lifespan.,"Lifespan is a remarkably diverse trait ranging from a few days to several hundred years in nature, but the mechanisms underlying the evolution of lifespan differences remain elusive. Here we de novo assemble a reference genome for the naturally short-lived African turquoise killifish, providing a unique resource for comparative and experimental genomics. The identification of genes under positive selection in this fish reveals potential candidates to explain its compressed lifespan. Several aging genes are under positive selection in this short-lived fish and long-lived species, raising the intriguing possibility that the same gene could underlie evolution of both compressed and extended lifespans. Comparative genomics and linkage analysis identify candidate genes associated with lifespan differences between various turquoise killifish strains. Remarkably, these genes are clustered on the sex chromosome, suggesting that short lifespan might have co-evolved with sex determination. Our study provides insights into the evolutionary forces that shape lifespan in nature.",1
Insights into Sex Chromosome Evolution and Aging from the Genome of a Short-Lived Fish.,"The killifish Nothobranchius furzeri is the shortest-lived vertebrate that can be bred in the laboratory. Its rapid growth, early sexual maturation, fast aging, and arrested embryonic development (diapause) make it an attractive model organism in biomedical research. Here, we report a draft sequence of its genome that allowed us to uncover an intra-species Y chromosome polymorphism representing-in real time-different stages of sex chromosome formation that display features of early mammalian XY evolution ""in action."" Our data suggest that gdf6Y, encoding a TGF-beta family growth factor, is the master sex-determining gene in N. furzeri. Moreover, we observed genomic clustering of aging-related genes, identified genes under positive selection, and revealed significant similarities of gene expression profiles between diapause and aging, particularly for genes controlling cell cycle and translation. The annotated genome sequence is provided as an online resource (http://www.nothobranchius.info/NFINgb).",1
"Simple, Scalable Proteomic Imaging for High-Dimensional Profiling of Intact Systems.","Combined measurement of diverse molecular and anatomical traits that span multiple levels remains a major challenge in biology. Here, we introduce a simple method that enables proteomic imaging for scalable, integrated, high-dimensional phenotyping of both animal tissues and human clinical samples. This method, termed SWITCH, uniformly secures tissue architecture, native biomolecules, and antigenicity across an entire system by synchronizing the tissue preservation reaction. The heat- and chemical-resistant nature of the resulting framework permits multiple rounds (>20) of relabeling. We have performed 22 rounds of labeling of a single tissue with precise co-registration of multiple datasets. Furthermore, SWITCH synchronizes labeling reactions to improve probe penetration depth and uniformity of staining. With SWITCH, we performed combinatorial protein expression profiling of the human cortex and also interrogated the geometric structure of the fiber pathways in mouse brains. Such integrated high-dimensional information may accelerate our understanding of biological systems at multiple levels.",1
A Dynamic Protein Interaction Landscape of the Human Centrosome-Cilium Interface.,"The centrosome is the primary microtubule organizing center of the cells and templates the formation of cilia, thereby operating at a nexus of critical cellular functions. Here, we use proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID) to map the centrosome-cilium interface; with 58 bait proteins we generate a protein topology network comprising >7,000 interactions. Analysis of interaction profiles coupled with high resolution phenotypic profiling implicates a number of protein modules in centriole duplication, ciliogenesis, and centriolar satellite biogenesis and highlights extensive interplay between these processes. By monitoring dynamic changes in the centrosome-cilium protein interaction landscape during ciliogenesis, we also identify satellite proteins that support cilia formation. Systematic profiling of proximity interactions combined with functional analysis thus provides a rich resource for better understanding human centrosome and cilia biology. Similar strategies may be applied to other complex biological structures or pathways.",1
Amyloidogenic Oligomerization Transforms Drosophila Orb2 from a Translation Repressor to an Activator.,"Memories are thought to be formed in response to transient experiences, in part through changes in local protein synthesis at synapses. In Drosophila, the amyloidogenic (prion-like) state of the RNA binding protein Orb2 has been implicated in long-term memory, but how conformational conversion of Orb2 promotes memory formation is unclear. Combining in vitro and in vivo studies, we find that the monomeric form of Orb2 represses translation and removes mRNA poly(A) tails, while the oligomeric form enhances translation and elongates the poly(A) tails and imparts its translational state to the monomer. The CG13928 protein, which binds only to monomeric Orb2, promotes deadenylation, whereas the putative poly(A) binding protein CG4612 promotes oligomeric Orb2-dependent translation. Our data support a model in which monomeric Orb2 keeps target mRNA in a translationally dormant state and experience-dependent conversion to the amyloidogenic state activates translation, resulting in persistent alteration of synaptic activity and stabilization of memory.",1
Epithelial IL-18 Equilibrium Controls Barrier Function in Colitis.,"The intestinal mucosal barrier controlling the resident microbiome is dependent on a protective mucus layer generated by goblet cells, impairment of which is a hallmark of the inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis. Here, we show that IL-18 is critical in driving the pathologic breakdown of barrier integrity in a model of colitis. Deletion of Il18 or its receptor Il18r1 in intestinal epithelial cells (Delta/EC) conferred protection from colitis and mucosal damage in mice. In contrast, deletion of the IL-18 negative regulator Il18bp resulted in severe colitis associated with loss of mature goblet cells. Colitis and goblet cell loss were rescued in Il18bp(-/-);Il18r(Delta/EC) mice, demonstrating that colitis severity is controlled at the level of IL-18 signaling in intestinal epithelial cells. IL-18 inhibited goblet cell maturation by regulating the transcriptional program instructing goblet cell development. These results inform on the mechanism of goblet cell dysfunction that underlies the pathology of ulcerative colitis.",1
Microbiota-Modulated Metabolites Shape the Intestinal Microenvironment by Regulating NLRP6 Inflammasome Signaling.,"Host-microbiome co-evolution drives homeostasis and disease susceptibility, yet regulatory principles governing the integrated intestinal host-commensal microenvironment remain obscure. While inflammasome signaling participates in these interactions, its activators and microbiome-modulating mechanisms are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the microbiota-associated metabolites taurine, histamine, and spermine shape the host-microbiome interface by co-modulating NLRP6 inflammasome signaling, epithelial IL-18 secretion, and downstream anti-microbial peptide (AMP) profiles. Distortion of this balanced AMP landscape by inflammasome deficiency drives dysbiosis development. Upon fecal transfer, colitis-inducing microbiota hijacks this microenvironment-orchestrating machinery through metabolite-mediated inflammasome suppression, leading to distorted AMP balance favoring its preferential colonization. Restoration of the metabolite-inflammasome-AMP axis reinstates a normal microbiota and ameliorates colitis. Together, we identify microbial modulators of the NLRP6 inflammasome and highlight mechanisms by which microbiome-host interactions cooperatively drive microbial community stability through metabolite-mediated innate immune modulation. Therefore, targeted ""postbiotic"" metabolomic intervention may restore a normal microenvironment as treatment or prevention of dysbiosis-driven diseases.",1
Redox Signaling by the RNA Polymerase III TFIIB-Related Factor Brf2.,"TFIIB-related factor 2 (Brf2) is a member of the family of TFIIB-like core transcription factors. Brf2 recruits RNA polymerase (Pol) III to type III gene-external promoters, including the U6 spliceosomal RNA and selenocysteine tRNA genes. Found only in vertebrates, Brf2 has been linked to tumorigenesis but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We have solved crystal structures of a human Brf2-TBP complex bound to natural promoters, obtaining a detailed view of the molecular interactions occurring at Brf2-dependent Pol III promoters and highlighting the general structural and functional conservation of human Pol II and Pol III pre-initiation complexes. Surprisingly, our structural and functional studies unravel a Brf2 redox-sensing module capable of specifically regulating Pol III transcriptional output in living cells. Furthermore, we establish Brf2 as a central redox-sensing transcription factor involved in the oxidative stress pathway and provide a mechanistic model for Brf2 genetic activation in lung and breast cancer.",1
Gut Microbiota Orchestrates Energy Homeostasis during Cold.,"Microbial functions in the host physiology are a result of the microbiota-host co-evolution. We show that cold exposure leads to marked shift of the microbiota composition, referred to as cold microbiota. Transplantation of the cold microbiota to germ-free mice is sufficient to increase insulin sensitivity of the host and enable tolerance to cold partly by promoting the white fat browning, leading to increased energy expenditure and fat loss. During prolonged cold, however, the body weight loss is attenuated, caused by adaptive mechanisms maximizing caloric uptake and increasing intestinal, villi, and microvilli lengths. This increased absorptive surface is transferable with the cold microbiota, leading to altered intestinal gene expression promoting tissue remodeling and suppression of apoptosis-the effect diminished by co-transplanting the most cold-downregulated strain Akkermansia muciniphila during the cold microbiota transfer. Our results demonstrate the microbiota as a key factor orchestrating the overall energy homeostasis during increased demand.",1

Microscopy-Based High-Content Screening.,"Image-based screening is used to measure a variety of phenotypes in cells and whole organisms. Combined with perturbations such as RNA interference, small molecules, and mutations, such screens are a powerful method for gaining systematic insights into biological processes. Screens have been applied to study diverse processes, such as protein-localization changes, cancer cell vulnerabilities, and complex organismal phenotypes. Recently, advances in imaging and image-analysis methodologies have accelerated large-scale perturbation screens. Here, we describe the state of the art for image-based screening experiments and delineate experimental approaches and image-analysis approaches as well as discussing challenges and future directions, including leveraging CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering.",1
Genome Sequencing Fishes out Longevity Genes.,"Understanding the molecular basis underlying aging is critical if we are to fully understand how and why we age-and possibly how to delay the aging process. Up until now, most longevity pathways were discovered in invertebrates because of their short lifespans and availability of genetic tools. Now, Reichwald et al. and Valenzano et al. independently provide a reference genome for the short-lived African turquoise killifish, establishing its role as a vertebrate system for aging research.",1

A Metabolic Switch for Th17 Pathogenicity.,"T helper 17 (Th17) cells are critical for host defense but can also drive autoimmunity.

Driving the Early Auditory Network the Old-Fashioned Way.,Spontaneous neuronal activity during the development of the auditory sensory system is important in establishing mature connectivity.

Transcriptional Heterogeneity and Lineage Commitment in Myeloid Progenitors.,"Within the bone marrow, stem cells differentiate and give rise to diverse blood cell types and functions. Currently, hematopoietic progenitors are defined using surface markers combined with functional assays that are not directly linked with in vivo differentiation potential or gene regulatory mechanisms. Here, we comprehensively map myeloid progenitor subpopulations by transcriptional sorting of single cells from the bone marrow. We describe multiple progenitor subgroups, showing unexpected transcriptional priming toward seven differentiation fates but no progenitors with a mixed state. Transcriptional differentiation is correlated with combinations of known and previously undefined transcription factors, suggesting that the process is tightly regulated. Histone maps and knockout assays are consistent with early transcriptional priming, while traditional transplantation experiments suggest that in vivo priming may still allow for plasticity given strong perturbations. These data establish a reference model and general framework for studying hematopoiesis at single-cell resolution.",1
High-Resolution CRISPR Screens Reveal Fitness Genes and Genotype-Specific Cancer Liabilities.,"The ability to perturb genes in human cells is crucial for elucidating gene function and holds great potential for finding therapeutic targets for diseases such as cancer. To extend the catalog of human core and context-dependent fitness genes, we have developed a high-complexity second-generation genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 gRNA library and applied it to fitness screens in five human cell lines. Using an improved Bayesian analytical approach, we consistently discover 5-fold more fitness genes than were previously observed. We present a list of 1,580 human core fitness genes and describe their general properties. Moreover, we demonstrate that context-dependent fitness genes accurately recapitulate pathway-specific genetic vulnerabilities induced by known oncogenes and reveal cell-type-specific dependencies for specific receptor tyrosine kinases, even in oncogenic KRAS backgrounds. Thus, rigorous identification of human cell line fitness genes using a high-complexity CRISPR-Cas9 library affords a high-resolution view of the genetic vulnerabilities of a cell.",1
Gene Essentiality Is a Quantitative Property Linked to Cellular Evolvability.,"Gene essentiality is typically determined by assessing the viability of the corresponding mutant cells, but this definition fails to account for the ability of cells to adaptively evolve to genetic perturbations. Here, we performed a stringent screen to assess the degree to which Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells can survive the deletion of ~1,000 individual ""essential"" genes and found that ~9% of these genetic perturbations could in fact be overcome by adaptive evolution. Our analyses uncovered a genome-wide gradient of gene essentiality, with certain essential cellular functions being more ""evolvable"" than others. Ploidy changes were prevalent among the evolved mutant strains, and aneuploidy of a specific chromosome was adaptive for a class of evolvable nucleoporin mutants. These data justify a quantitative redefinition of gene essentiality that incorporates both viability and evolvability of the corresponding mutant cells and will enable selection of therapeutic targets associated with lower risk of emergence of drug resistance.",1
beta-Cell Insulin Secretion Requires the Ubiquitin Ligase COP1.,"A variety of signals finely tune insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells to prevent both hyper-and hypoglycemic states. Here, we show that post-translational regulation of the transcription factors ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5 by the ubiquitin ligase COP1 (also called RFWD2) in beta cells is critical for insulin secretion. Mice lacking COP1 in beta cells developed diabetes due to insulin granule docking defects that were fully rescued by genetic deletion of Etv1, Etv4, and Etv5. Genes regulated by ETV1, ETV4, or ETV5 in the absence of mouse COP1 were enriched in human diabetes-associated genes, suggesting that they also influence human beta-cell pathophysiology. In normal beta cells, ETV4 was stabilized upon membrane depolarization and limited insulin secretion under hyperglycemic conditions. Collectively, our data reveal that ETVs negatively regulate insulin secretion for the maintenance of normoglycemia.",1
Spontaneous Activity of Cochlear Hair Cells Triggered by Fluid Secretion Mechanism in Adjacent Support Cells.,"Spontaneous electrical activity of neurons in developing sensory systems promotes their maturation and proper connectivity. In the auditory system, spontaneous activity of cochlear inner hair cells (IHCs) is initiated by the release of ATP from glia-like inner supporting cells (ISCs), facilitating maturation of central pathways before hearing onset. Here, we find that ATP stimulates purinergic autoreceptors in ISCs, triggering Cl(-) efflux and osmotic cell shrinkage by opening TMEM16A Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) channels. Release of Cl(-) from ISCs also forces K(+) efflux, causing transient depolarization of IHCs near ATP release sites. Genetic deletion of TMEM16A markedly reduces the spontaneous activity of IHCs and spiral ganglion neurons in the developing cochlea and prevents ATP-dependent shrinkage of supporting cells. These results indicate that supporting cells in the developing cochlea have adapted a pathway used for fluid secretion in other organs to induce periodic excitation of hair cells.",1
Single-Cell Genomics Unveils Critical Regulators of Th17 Cell Pathogenicity.,"Extensive cellular heterogeneity exists within specific immune-cell subtypes classified as a single lineage, but its molecular underpinnings are rarely characterized at a genomic scale. Here, we use single-cell RNA-seq to investigate the molecular mechanisms governing heterogeneity and pathogenicity of Th17 cells isolated from the central nervous system (CNS) and lymph nodes (LN) at the peak of autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) or differentiated in vitro under either pathogenic or non-pathogenic polarization conditions. Computational analysis relates a spectrum of cellular states in vivo to in-vitro-differentiated Th17 cells and unveils genes governing pathogenicity and disease susceptibility. Using knockout mice, we validate four new genes: Gpr65, Plzp, Toso, and Cd5l (in a companion paper). Cellular heterogeneity thus informs Th17 function in autoimmunity and can identify targets for selective suppression of pathogenic Th17 cells while potentially sparing non-pathogenic tissue-protective ones.",1
CD5L/AIM Regulates Lipid Biosynthesis and Restrains Th17 Cell Pathogenicity.,"Th17 cells play a critical role in host defense against extracellular pathogens and tissue homeostasis but can induce autoimmunity. The mechanisms implicated in balancing ""pathogenic"" and ""non-pathogenic"" Th17 cell states remain largely unknown. We used single-cell RNA-seq to identify CD5L/AIM as a regulator expressed in non-pathogenic, but not in pathogenic Th17 cells. Although CD5L does not affect Th17 differentiation, it is a functional switch that regulates the pathogenicity of Th17 cells. Loss of CD5L converts non-pathogenic Th17 cells into pathogenic cells that induce autoimmunity. CD5L mediates this effect by modulating the intracellular lipidome, altering fatty acid composition and restricting cholesterol biosynthesis and, thus, ligand availability for Rorgammat, the master transcription factor of Th17 cells. Our study identifies CD5L as a critical regulator of the Th17 cell functional state and highlights the importance of lipid metabolism in balancing immune protection and disease induced by T cells.",1
Perinuclear Anchoring of H3K9-Methylated Chromatin Stabilizes Induced Cell Fate in C. elegans Embryos.,"Interphase chromatin is organized in distinct nuclear sub-compartments, reflecting its degree of compaction and transcriptional status. In Caenorhabditis elegans embryos, H3K9 methylation is necessary to silence and to anchor repeat-rich heterochromatin at the nuclear periphery. In a screen for perinuclear anchors of heterochromatin, we identified a previously uncharacterized C. elegans chromodomain protein, CEC-4. CEC-4 binds preferentially mono-, di-, or tri-methylated H3K9 and localizes at the nuclear envelope independently of H3K9 methylation and nuclear lamin. CEC-4 is necessary for endogenous heterochromatin anchoring, but not for transcriptional repression, in contrast to other known H3K9 methyl-binders in worms, which mediate gene repression but not perinuclear anchoring. When we ectopically induce a muscle differentiation program in embryos, cec-4 mutants fail to commit fully to muscle cell fate. This suggests that perinuclear sequestration of chromatin during development helps restrict cell differentiation programs by stabilizing commitment to a specific cell fate. PAPERCLIP.",1
5' UTR m(6)A Promotes Cap-Independent Translation.,"Protein translation typically begins with the recruitment of the 43S ribosomal complex to the 5' cap of mRNAs by a cap-binding complex. However, some transcripts are translated in a cap-independent manner through poorly understood mechanisms. Here, we show that mRNAs containing N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) in their 5' UTR can be translated in a cap-independent manner. A single 5' UTR m(6)A directly binds eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3), which is sufficient to recruit the 43S complex to initiate translation in the absence of the cap-binding factor eIF4E. Inhibition of adenosine methylation selectively reduces translation of mRNAs containing 5'UTR m(6)A. Additionally, increased m(6)A levels in the Hsp70 mRNA regulate its cap-independent translation following heat shock. Notably, we find that diverse cellular stresses induce a transcriptome-wide redistribution of m(6)A, resulting in increased numbers of mRNAs with 5' UTR m(6)A. These data show that 5' UTR m(6)A bypasses 5' cap-binding proteins to promote translation under stresses.",1
Chromosomal Loop Domains Direct the Recombination of Antigen Receptor Genes.,"RAG initiates antibody V(D)J recombination in developing lymphocytes by generating ""on-target"" DNA breaks at matched pairs of bona fide recombination signal sequences (RSSs). We employ bait RAG-generated breaks in endogenous or ectopically inserted RSS pairs to identify huge numbers of RAG ""off-target"" breaks. Such breaks occur at the simple CAC motif that defines the RSS cleavage site and are largely confined within convergent CTCF-binding element (CBE)-flanked loop domains containing bait RSS pairs. Marked orientation dependence of RAG off-target activity within loops spanning up to 2 megabases implies involvement of linear tracking. In this regard, major RAG off-targets in chromosomal translocations occur as convergent RSS pairs at enhancers within a loop. Finally, deletion of a CBE-based IgH locus element disrupts V(D)J recombination domains and, correspondingly, alters RAG on- and off-target distributions within IgH. Our findings reveal how RAG activity is developmentally focused and implicate mechanisms by which chromatin domains harness biological processes within them.",1
SnapShot: Hypoxia-Inducible Factors.,"Molecular oxygen (O2) is a key substrate for mitochondrial ATP production and numerous intracellular biochemical reactions. The maintenance of O2 homeostasis is therefore essential for the survival of most species. During O2 deprivation, mammalian cells rely on multiple adaptations mediated by the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), mTOR, autophagy, and the ER stress response. This SnapShot will summarize recent reports expanding our current understanding of HIF-dependent adaptations to low O2 levels.",1
Coupling of mRNA Structure Rearrangement to Ribosome Movement during Bypassing of Non-coding Regions.,"Nearly half of the ribosomes translating a particular bacteriophage T4 mRNA bypass a region of 50 nt, resuming translation 3' of this gap. How this large-scale, specific hop occurs and what determines whether a ribosome bypasses remain unclear. We apply single-molecule fluorescence with zero-mode waveguides to track individual Escherichia coli ribosomes during translation of T4's gene 60 mRNA. Ribosomes that bypass are characterized by a 10- to 20-fold longer pause in a non-canonical rotated state at the take-off codon. During the pause, mRNA secondary structure rearrangements are coupled to ribosome forward movement, facilitated by nascent peptide interactions that disengage the ribosome anticodon-codon interactions for slippage. Close to the landing site, the ribosome then scans mRNA in search of optimal base-pairing interactions. Our results provide a mechanistic and conformational framework for bypassing, highlighting a non-canonical ribosomal state to allow for mRNA structure refolding to drive large-scale ribosome movements.",1
K-Ras Promotes Tumorigenicity through Suppression of Non-canonical Wnt Signaling.,"K-Ras and H-Ras share identical effectors and have similar properties; however, the high degree of tumor-type specificity associated with K-Ras and H-Ras mutations suggests that they have unique roles in oncogenesis. Here, we report that oncogenic K-Ras, but not H-Ras, suppresses non-canonical Wnt/Ca(2+) signaling, an effect that contributes strongly to its tumorigenic properties. K-Ras does this by binding to calmodulin and so reducing CaMKii activity and expression of Fzd8. Restoring Fzd8 in K-Ras mutant pancreatic cells suppresses malignancy, whereas depletion of Fzd8 in H-Ras(V12)-transformed cells enhances their tumor initiating capacity. Interrupting K-Ras-calmodulin binding using genetic means or by treatment with an orally active protein kinase C (PKC)-activator, prostratin, represses tumorigenesis in K-Ras mutant pancreatic cancer cells. These findings provide an alternative way to selectively target this ""undruggable"" protein.",1
Post-transcriptional Wnt Signaling Governs Epididymal Sperm Maturation.,"The canonical Wnt signaling pathway is of paramount importance in development and disease. An emergent question is whether the upstream cascade of the canonical Wnt pathway has physiologically relevant roles beyond beta-catenin-mediated transcription, which is difficult to study due to the pervasive role of this protein. Here, we show that transcriptionally silent spermatozoa respond to Wnt signals released from the epididymis and that mice mutant for the Wnt regulator Cyclin Y-like 1 are male sterile due to immotile and malformed spermatozoa. Post-transcriptional Wnt signaling impacts spermatozoa through GSK3 by (1) reducing global protein poly-ubiquitination to maintain protein homeostasis; (2) inhibiting septin 4 phosphorylation to establish a membrane diffusion barrier in the sperm tail; and (3) inhibiting protein phosphatase 1 to initiate sperm motility. The results indicate that Wnt signaling orchestrates a rich post-transcriptional sperm maturation program and invite revisiting transcription-independent Wnt signaling in somatic cells as well.",1
Calcium and SOL Protease Mediate Temperature Resetting of Circadian Clocks.,"Circadian clocks integrate light and temperature input to remain synchronized with the day/night cycle. Although light input to the clock is well studied, the molecular mechanisms by which circadian clocks respond to temperature remain poorly understood. We found that temperature phase shifts Drosophila circadian clocks through degradation of the pacemaker protein TIM. This degradation is mechanistically distinct from photic CRY-dependent TIM degradation. Thermal TIM degradation is triggered by cytosolic calcium increase and CALMODULIN binding to TIM and is mediated by the atypical calpain protease SOL. This thermal input pathway and CRY-dependent light input thus converge on TIM, providing a molecular mechanism for the integration of circadian light and temperature inputs. Mammals use body temperature cycles to keep peripheral clocks synchronized with their brain pacemaker. Interestingly, downregulating the mammalian SOL homolog SOLH blocks thermal mPER2 degradation and phase shifts. Thus, we propose that circadian thermosensation in insects and mammals share common principles.",1
Descending Command Neurons in the Brainstem that Halt Locomotion.,"The episodic nature of locomotion is thought to be controlled by descending inputs from the brainstem. Most studies have largely attributed this control to initiating excitatory signals, but little is known about putative commands that may specifically determine locomotor offset. To link identifiable brainstem populations to a potential locomotor stop signal, we used developmental genetics and considered a discrete neuronal population in the reticular formation: the V2a neurons. We find that those neurons constitute a major excitatory pathway to locomotor areas of the ventral spinal cord. Selective activation of V2a neurons of the rostral medulla stops ongoing locomotor activity, owing to an inhibition of premotor locomotor networks in the spinal cord. Moreover, inactivation of such neurons decreases spontaneous stopping in vivo. Therefore, the V2a ""stop neurons"" represent a glutamatergic descending pathway that favors immobility and may thus help control the episodic nature of locomotion.",1
Hippocampal Dopamine/DRD1 Signaling Dependent on the Ghrelin Receptor.,"The ghrelin receptor (GHSR1a) and dopamine receptor-1 (DRD1) are coexpressed in hippocampal neurons, yet ghrelin is undetectable in the hippocampus; therefore, we sought a function for apo-GHSR1a. Real-time single-molecule analysis on hippocampal neurons revealed dimerization between apo-GHSR1a and DRD1 that is enhanced by DRD1 agonism. In addition, proximity measurements support formation of preassembled apo-GHSR1a:DRD1:Galphaq heteromeric complexes in hippocampal neurons. Activation by a DRD1 agonist produced non-canonical signal transduction via Galphaq-PLC-IP3-Ca(2+) at the expense of canonical DRD1 Galphas cAMP signaling to result in CaMKII activation, glutamate receptor exocytosis, synaptic reorganization, and expression of early markers of hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Remarkably, this pathway is blocked by genetic or pharmacological inactivation of GHSR1a. In mice, GHSR1a inactivation inhibits DRD1-mediated hippocampal behavior and memory. Our findings identify a previously unrecognized mechanism essential for DRD1 initiation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity that is dependent on GHSR1a, and independent of cAMP signaling.",1
Dopamine Neurons Encoding Long-Term Memory of Object Value for Habitual Behavior.,"Dopamine neurons promote learning by processing recent changes in reward values, such that reward may be maximized. However, such a flexible signal is not suitable for habitual behaviors that are sustained regardless of recent changes in reward outcome. We discovered a type of dopamine neuron in the monkey substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) that retains past learned reward values stably. After reward values of visual objects are learned, these neurons continue to respond differentially to the objects, even when reward is not expected. Responses are strengthened by repeated learning and are evoked upon presentation of the objects long after learning is completed. These ""sustain-type"" dopamine neurons are confined to the caudal-lateral SNc and project to the caudate tail, which encodes long-term value memories of visual objects and guides gaze automatically to stably valued objects. This population of dopamine neurons thus selectively promotes learning and retention of habitual behavior.",1
Htr2a-Expressing Cells in the Central Amygdala Control the Hierarchy between Innate and Learned Fear.,"Fear is induced by innate and learned mechanisms involving separate pathways. Here, we used an olfactory-mediated innate-fear versus learned-fear paradigm to investigate how these pathways are integrated. Notably, prior presentation of innate-fear stimuli inhibited learned-freezing response, but not vice versa. Whole-brain mapping and pharmacological screening indicated that serotonin-2A receptor (Htr2a)-expressing cells in the central amygdala (CeA) control both innate and learned freezing, but in opposing directions. In vivo fiber photometry analyses in freely moving mice indicated that innate but not learned-fear stimuli suppressed the activity of Htr2a-expressing CeA cells. Artificial inactivation of these cells upregulated innate-freezing response and downregulated learned-freezing response. Thus, Htr2a-expressing CeA cells serve as a hierarchy generator, prioritizing innate fear over learned fear.",1
Personalized Nutrition by Prediction of Glycemic Responses.,"Elevated postprandial blood glucose levels constitute a global epidemic and a major risk factor for prediabetes and type II diabetes, but existing dietary methods for controlling them have limited efficacy. Here, we continuously monitored week-long glucose levels in an 800-person cohort, measured responses to 46,898 meals, and found high variability in the response to identical meals, suggesting that universal dietary recommendations may have limited utility. We devised a machine-learning algorithm that integrates blood parameters, dietary habits, anthropometrics, physical activity, and gut microbiota measured in this cohort and showed that it accurately predicts personalized postprandial glycemic response to real-life meals. We validated these predictions in an independent 100-person cohort. Finally, a blinded randomized controlled dietary intervention based on this algorithm resulted in significantly lower postprandial responses and consistent alterations to gut microbiota configuration. Together, our results suggest that personalized diets may successfully modify elevated postprandial blood glucose and its metabolic consequences. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",1
Establishment and Dysfunction of the Blood-Brain Barrier.,"Structural and functional brain connectivity, synaptic activity, and information processing require highly coordinated signal transduction between different cell types within the neurovascular unit and intact blood-brain barrier (BBB) functions. Here, we examine the mechanisms regulating the formation and maintenance of the BBB and functions of BBB-associated cell types. Furthermore, we discuss the growing evidence associating BBB breakdown with the pathogenesis of inherited monogenic neurological disorders and complex multifactorial diseases, including Alzheimer's disease.",1
Improving Cancer Treatment via Mathematical Modeling: Surmounting the Challenges Is Worth the Effort.,"Drug delivery schedules are key factors in the efficacy of cancer therapies, and mathematical modeling of population dynamics and treatment responses can be applied to identify better drug administration regimes as well as provide mechanistic insights. To capitalize on the promise of this approach, the cancer field must meet the challenges of moving this type of work into clinics.",1
Microbiota's No Wasting Policy.,"Schieber et al. demonstrate that a specific gut microbiota bacterial strain induces a host-mediated protection mechanism against inflammation-driven wasting syndrome. This salutary effect confers a net survival advantage against bacterial infection, without interfering with the host's pathogen load, revealing that host-microbiota interactions regulate disease tolerance to infection.",1
A Common Mechanism that Underpins Antibody Diversification.,"Targeting of AID to antibody variable (V) regions results in somatic hypermutation, whereas its recruitment to switch (S) regions leads to class-switch recombination. Yeap et al. find that the mechanism by which variable and switch regions recruit AID essentially is the same but that the two regions differ in the density of double-stranded DNA breaks that are generated. These lead to either point mutations in V exons in somatic hypermutation or deletion of intervening DNA sequences during class switch recombination.",1
Potent Antibody Protection against an Emerging Alphavirus Threat.,"Chikungunya virus recently caused large outbreaks world-wide. In this issue of Cell, Fox et al. describe several potently neutralizing antibodies against multiple alphaviruses. The structure of the virus in complex with one of the antibodies reveals the antibody-induced rearrangement and crosslinking of the viral surface proteins that result in neutralization.",1
"Siri, What Should I Eat?","Zeevi et al. report that extensive monitoring of a human cohort for variations in dietary intake, lifestyle, host phenotype, and the gut microbiome has enabled the development of a machine-learning algorithm that accurately predicts the individual glycemic response to meals, providing an important first step toward personalized nutrition.",1
Jagged 1 Rescues the Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Phenotype.,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), caused by mutations at the dystrophin gene, is the most common form of muscular dystrophy. There is no cure for DMD and current therapeutic approaches to restore dystrophin expression are only partially effective. The absence of dystrophin in muscle results in dysregulation of signaling pathways, which could be targets for disease therapy and drug discovery. Previously, we identified two exceptional Golden Retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) dogs that are mildly affected, have functional muscle, and normal lifespan despite the complete absence of dystrophin. Now, our data on linkage, whole-genome sequencing, and transcriptome analyses of these dogs compared to severely affected GRMD and control animals reveals that increased expression of Jagged1 gene, a known regulator of the Notch signaling pathway, is a hallmark of the mild phenotype. Functional analyses demonstrate that Jagged1 overexpression ameliorates the dystrophic phenotype, suggesting that Jagged1 may represent a target for DMD therapy in a dystrophin-independent manner.

Sequence-Intrinsic Mechanisms that Target AID Mutational Outcomes on Antibody Genes.,"In activated B lymphocytes, AID initiates antibody variable (V) exon somatic hypermutation (SHM) for affinity maturation in germinal centers (GCs) and IgH switch (S) region DNA breaks (DSBs) for class-switch recombination (CSR). To resolve long-standing questions, we have developed an in vivo assay to study AID targeting of passenger sequences replacing a V exon. First, we find AID targets SHM hotspots within V exon and S region passengers at similar frequencies and that the normal SHM process frequently generates deletions, indicating that SHM and CSR employ the same mechanism. Second, AID mutates targets in diverse non-Ig passengers in GC B cells at levels similar to those of V exons, definitively establishing the V exon location as ""privileged"" for SHM. Finally, Peyer's patch GC B cells generate a reservoir of V exons that are highly mutated before selection for affinity maturation. We discuss the implications of these findings for harnessing antibody diversification mechanisms.",1
Defining Hsp70 Subnetworks in Dengue Virus Replication Reveals Key Vulnerability in Flavivirus Infection.,"Viral protein homeostasis depends entirely on the machinery of the infected cell. Accordingly, viruses can illuminate the interplay between cellular proteostasis components and their distinct substrates. Here, we define how the Hsp70 chaperone network mediates the dengue virus life cycle. Cytosolic Hsp70 isoforms are required at distinct steps of the viral cycle, including entry, RNA replication, and virion biogenesis. Hsp70 function at each step is specified by nine distinct DNAJ cofactors. Of these, DnaJB11 relocalizes to virus-induced replication complexes to promote RNA synthesis, while DnaJB6 associates with capsid protein and facilitates virion biogenesis. Importantly, an allosteric Hsp70 inhibitor, JG40, potently blocks infection of different dengue serotypes in human primary blood cells without eliciting viral resistance or exerting toxicity to the host cells. JG40 also blocks replication of other medically-important flaviviruses including yellow fever, West Nile and Japanese encephalitis viruses. Thus, targeting host Hsp70 subnetworks provides a path for broad-spectrum antivirals.",1
Broadly Neutralizing Alphavirus Antibodies Bind an Epitope on E2 and Inhibit Entry and Egress.,"We screened a panel of mouse and human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against chikungunya virus and identified several with inhibitory activity against multiple alphaviruses. Passive transfer of broadly neutralizing MAbs protected mice against infection by chikungunya, Mayaro, and O'nyong'nyong alphaviruses. Using alanine-scanning mutagenesis, loss-of-function recombinant proteins and viruses, and multiple functional assays, we determined that broadly neutralizing MAbs block multiple steps in the viral lifecycle, including entry and egress, and bind to a conserved epitope on the B domain of the E2 glycoprotein. A 16 A resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of a Fab fragment bound to CHIKV E2 B domain provided an explanation for its neutralizing activity. Binding to the B domain was associated with repositioning of the A domain of E2 that enabled cross-linking of neighboring spikes. Our results suggest that B domain antigenic determinants could be targeted for vaccine or antibody therapeutic development against multiple alphaviruses of global concern.",1
MAJIN Links Telomeric DNA to the Nuclear Membrane by Exchanging Telomere Cap.,"In meiosis, telomeres attach to the inner nuclear membrane (INM) and drive the chromosome movement required for homolog pairing and recombination. Here, we address the question of how telomeres are structurally adapted for the meiotic task. We identify a multi-subunit meiotic telomere-complex, TERB1/2-MAJIN, which takes over telomeric DNA from the shelterin complex in mouse germ cells. TERB1/2-MAJIN initially assembles on the INM sequestered by its putative transmembrane subunit MAJIN. In early meiosis, telomere attachment is achieved by the formation of a chimeric complex of TERB1/2-MAJIN and shelterin. The chimeric complex matures during prophase into DNA-bound TERB1/2-MAJIN by releasing shelterin, forming a direct link between telomeric DNA and the INM. These hierarchical processes, termed ""telomere cap exchange,"" are regulated by CDK-dependent phosphorylation and the DNA-binding activity of MAJIN. Further, we uncover a positive feedback between telomere attachment and chromosome movement, revealing a comprehensive regulatory network underlying meiosis-specific telomere function in mammals.",1
Molecular Mechanism of V(D)J Recombination from Synaptic RAG1-RAG2 Complex Structures.,"Diverse repertoires of antigen-receptor genes that result from combinatorial splicing of coding segments by V(D)J recombination are hallmarks of vertebrate immunity. The (RAG1-RAG2)2 recombinase (RAG) recognizes recombination signal sequences (RSSs) containing a heptamer, a spacer of 12 or 23 base pairs, and a nonamer (12-RSS or 23-RSS) and introduces precise breaks at RSS-coding segment junctions. RAG forms synaptic complexes only with one 12-RSS and one 23-RSS, a dogma known as the 12/23 rule that governs the recombination fidelity. We report cryo-electron microscopy structures of synaptic RAG complexes at up to 3.4 A resolution, which reveal a closed conformation with base flipping and base-specific recognition of RSSs. Distortion at RSS-coding segment junctions and base flipping in coding segments uncover the two-metal-ion catalytic mechanism. Induced asymmetry involving tilting of the nonamer-binding domain dimer of RAG1 upon binding of HMGB1-bent 12-RSS or 23-RSS underlies the molecular mechanism for the 12/23 rule.",1
No Evidence for Cardiomyocyte Number Expansion in Preadolescent Mice.,"The magnitude of cardiomyocyte generation in the adult heart has been heavily debated. A recent report suggests that during mouse preadolescence, cardiomyocyte proliferation leads to a 40% increase in the number of cardiomyocytes. Such an expansion would change our understanding of heart growth and have far-reaching implications for cardiac regeneration. Here, using design-based stereology, we found that cardiomyocyte proliferation accounted for 30% of postnatal DNA synthesis; however, we were unable to detect any changes in cardiomyocyte number after postnatal day 11. (15)N-thymidine and BrdU analyses provided no evidence for a proliferative peak in preadolescent mice. By contrast, cardiomyocyte multinucleation comprises 57% of postnatal DNA synthesis, followed by cardiomyocyte nuclear polyploidisation, contributing with 13% to DNA synthesis within the second and third postnatal weeks. We conclude that the majority of cardiomyocytes is set within the first postnatal week and that this event is followed by two waves of non-replicative DNA synthesis. This Matters Arising paper is in response to Naqvi et al. (2014), published in Cell. See also the associated Correspondence by Soonpaa et al. (2015), and the response by Naqvi et al. (2015), published in this issue.",1
The Molecular Taxonomy of Primary Prostate Cancer.,"There is substantial heterogeneity among primary prostate cancers, evident in the spectrum of molecular abnormalities and its variable clinical course. As part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we present a comprehensive molecular analysis of 333 primary prostate carcinomas. Our results revealed a molecular taxonomy in which 74% of these tumors fell into one of seven subtypes defined by specific gene fusions (ERG, ETV1/4, and FLI1) or mutations (SPOP, FOXA1, and IDH1). Epigenetic profiles showed substantial heterogeneity, including an IDH1 mutant subset with a methylator phenotype. Androgen receptor (AR) activity varied widely and in a subtype-specific manner, with SPOP and FOXA1 mutant tumors having the highest levels of AR-induced transcripts. 25% of the prostate cancers had a presumed actionable lesion in the PI3K or MAPK signaling pathways, and DNA repair genes were inactivated in 19%. Our analysis reveals molecular heterogeneity among primary prostate cancers, as well as potentially actionable molecular defects.",1
Dissecting Polyclonal Vaccine-Induced Humoral Immunity against HIV Using Systems Serology.,"While antibody titers and neutralization are considered the gold standard for the selection of successful vaccines, these parameters are often inadequate predictors of protective immunity. As antibodies mediate an array of extra-neutralizing Fc functions, when neutralization fails to predict protection, investigating Fc-mediated activity may help identify immunological correlates and mechanism(s) of humoral protection. Here, we used an integrative approach termed Systems Serology to analyze relationships among humoral responses elicited in four HIV vaccine trials. Each vaccine regimen induced a unique humoral ""Fc fingerprint."" Moreover, analysis of case:control data from the first moderately protective HIV vaccine trial, RV144, pointed to mechanistic insights into immune complex composition that may underlie protective immunity to HIV. Thus, multi-dimensional relational comparisons of vaccine humoral fingerprints offer a unique approach for the evaluation and design of novel vaccines against pathogens for which correlates of protection remain elusive.",1
Fezf2 Orchestrates a Thymic Program of Self-Antigen Expression for Immune Tolerance.,"Self-tolerance to immune reactions is established via promiscuous expression of tissue-restricted antigens (TRAs) in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs), leading to the elimination of T cells that respond to self-antigens. The transcriptional regulator Aire has been thought to be sufficient for the induction of TRAs, despite some indications that other factors may promote TRA expression in the thymus. Here, we show that the transcription factor Fezf2 directly regulates various TRA genes in mTECs independently of Aire. Mice lacking Fezf2 in mTECs displayed severe autoimmune symptoms, including the production of autoantibodies and inflammatory cell infiltration targeted to peripheral organs. These responses differed from those detected in Aire-deficient mice. Furthermore, Fezf2 expression and Aire expression are regulated by distinct signaling pathways and promote the expression of different classes of proteins. Thus, two independent factors, Fezf2 and Aire, permit the expression of TRAs in the thymus to ensure immune tolerance.",1
A biomolecule-compatible visible-light-induced azide reduction from a DNA-encoded reaction-discovery system.,"Using a system that accelerates the serendipitous discovery of new reactions by evaluating hundreds of DNA-encoded substrate combinations in a single experiment, we explored a broad range of reaction conditions for new bond-forming reactions. We discovered reactivity that led to a biomolecule-compatible, Ru(II)-catalysed azide-reduction reaction induced by visible light. In contrast to current azide-reduction methods, this reaction is highly chemoselective and is compatible with alcohols, phenols, acids, alkenes, alkynes, aldehydes, alkyl halides, alkyl mesylates and disulfides. The remarkable functional group compatibility and mild conditions of the reaction enabled the azide reduction of nucleic acid and oligosaccharide substrates, with no detectable occurrence of side reactions. The reaction was also performed in the presence of a protein enzyme without the loss of enzymatic activity, in contrast to two commonly used azide-reduction methods. The visible-light dependence of this reaction provides a means of photouncaging functional groups, such as amines and carboxylates, on biological macromolecules without using ultraviolet irradiation.",2
Visible-light-mediated conversion of alcohols to halides.,"The development of new means of activating molecules and bonds for chemical reactions is a fundamental objective for chemists. In this regard, visible-light photoredox catalysis has emerged as a powerful technique for chemoselective activation of chemical bonds under mild reaction conditions. Here, we report a visible-light-mediated photocatalytic alcohol activation, which we use to convert alcohols to the corresponding bromides and iodides in good yields, with exceptional functional group tolerance. In this fundamentally useful reaction, the design and operation of the process is simple, the reaction is highly efficient, and the formation of stoichiometric waste products is minimized.",2
Carbon oxidation state as a metric for describing the chemistry of atmospheric organic aerosol.,"A detailed understanding of the sources, transformations and fates of organic species in the environment is crucial because of the central roles that they play in human health, biogeochemical cycles and the Earth's climate. However, such an understanding is hindered by the immense chemical complexity of environmental mixtures of organics; for example, atmospheric organic aerosol consists of at least thousands of individual compounds, all of which likely evolve chemically over their atmospheric lifetimes. Here, we demonstrate the utility of describing organic aerosol (and other complex organic mixtures) in terms of average carbon oxidation state, a quantity that always increases with oxidation, and is readily measured using state-of-the-art analytical techniques. Field and laboratory measurements of the average carbon oxidation state, using several such techniques, constrain the chemical properties of the organics and demonstrate that the formation and evolution of organic aerosol involves simultaneous changes to both carbon oxidation state and carbon number.",2
Interrogating viral capsid assembly with ion mobility-mass spectrometry.,"Most proteins fulfil their function as part of large protein complexes. Surprisingly, little is known about the pathways and regulation of protein assembly. Several viral coat proteins can spontaneously assemble into capsids in vitro with morphologies identical to the native virion and thus resemble ideal model systems for studying protein complex formation. Even for these systems, the mechanism for self-assembly is still poorly understood, although it is generally thought that smaller oligomeric structures form key intermediates. This assembly nucleus and larger viral assembly intermediates are typically low abundant and difficult to monitor. Here, we characterised small oligomers of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and norovirus under equilibrium conditions using native ion mobility mass spectrometry. This data in conjunction with computational modelling enabled us to elucidate structural features of these oligomers. Instead of more globular shapes, the intermediates exhibit sheet-like structures suggesting that they are assembly competent. We propose pathways for the formation of both capsids.",2
A molybdenum complex bearing PNP-type pincer ligands leads to the catalytic reduction of dinitrogen into ammonia.,"The synthesis of transition metal-dinitrogen complexes and the stoichiometric transformation of their coordinated dinitrogen into ammonia and hydrazine have been the subject of considerable research, with a view to achieving nitrogen fixation under ambient conditions. Since a single example in 2003, no examples have been reported of the catalytic conversion of dinitrogen into ammonia under ambient conditions. The dimolybdenum-dinitrogen complex bearing PNP pincer ligands was found to work as an effective catalyst for the formation of ammonia from dinitrogen, with 23 equiv. of ammonia being produced with the catalyst (12 equiv. of ammonia are produced based on the molybdenum atom of the catalyst). This is another successful example of the catalytic and direct conversion of dinitrogen into ammonia under ambient reaction conditions. We believe that the results described in this Article provide valuable information with which to develop a more effective nitrogen-fixation system under mild reaction conditions.",2
Cis-dicarbonyl binding at cobalt and iron porphyrins with saddle-shape conformation.,"Diatomic molecules attached to complexed iron or cobalt centres are important in many biological processes. In natural systems, metallotetrapyrrole units carry respiratory gases or provide sensing and catalytic functions. Conceiving synthetic model systems strongly helps to determine the pertinent chemical foundations for such processes, with recent work highlighting the importance of the prosthetic groups' conformational flexibility as an intricate variable affecting their functional properties. Here, we present simple model systems to investigate, at the single molecule level, the interaction of carbon monoxide with saddle-shaped iron- and cobalt-porphyrin conformers, which have been stabilized as two-dimensional arrays on well-defined surfaces. Using scanning tunnelling microscopy we identified a novel bonding scheme expressed in tilted monocarbonyl and cis-dicarbonyl configurations at the functional metal-macrocycle unit. Modelling with density functional theory revealed that the weakly bonded diatomic carbonyl adduct can effectively bridge specific pyrrole groups with the metal atom as a result of the pronounced saddle-shape conformation of the porphyrin cage.",2
Dynamic DNA nanotechnology using strand-displacement reactions.,"The specificity and predictability of Watson-Crick base pairing make DNA a powerful and versatile material for engineering at the nanoscale. This has enabled the construction of a diverse and rapidly growing set of DNA nanostructures and nanodevices through the programmed hybridization of complementary strands. Although it had initially focused on the self-assembly of static structures, DNA nanotechnology is now also becoming increasingly attractive for engineering systems with interesting dynamic properties. Various devices, including circuits, catalytic amplifiers, autonomous molecular motors and reconfigurable nanostructures, have recently been rationally designed to use DNA strand-displacement reactions, in which two strands with partial or full complementarity hybridize, displacing in the process one or more pre-hybridized strands. This mechanism allows for the kinetic control of reaction pathways. Here, we review DNA strand-displacement-based devices, and look at how this relatively simple mechanism can lead to a surprising diversity of dynamic behaviour.",2
Surface-mediated chain reaction through dissociative attachment.,"Chain reactions on a surface offer an important route to linear nanopatterning. We recently reported cooperative reactions on a silicon surface in which the reaction of one halogen atom with a silicon atom of a silicon dimer induced the halogenation of its neighbouring silicon atom through surface-mediated charge transfer. The reaction was unable to propagate further but here we describe how, by chemically bridging the gaps between the rows of these silicon dimers, this mechanism is able to form extended chains. The agents for chain growth are CH(3)Cl molecules that dissociatively attach CH(3) groups and chlorine atoms to silicon atoms from different dimers. By means of charge transfer through the surface, this gives rise to dangling bonds adjacent to the CH(3) groups and chlorine atoms (in effect, 'free radicals') that dissociate further incoming CH(3)Cl molecules, thereby providing the growing points for chains of indefinite length. This versatile mechanism of chain growth is examined in experiments and using ab initio theory.",2
Rapid room-temperature synthesis of nanocrystalline spinels as oxygen reduction and evolution electrocatalysts.,"Spinels can serve as alternative low-cost bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER), which are the key barriers in various electrochemical devices such as metal-air batteries, fuel cells and electrolysers. However, conventional ceramic synthesis of crystalline spinels requires an elevated temperature, complicated procedures and prolonged heating time, and the resulting product exhibits limited electrocatalytic performance. It has been challenging to develop energy-saving, facile and rapid synthetic methodologies for highly active spinels. In this Article, we report the synthesis of nanocrystalline M(x)Mn(3-x)O(4) (M = divalent metals) spinels under ambient conditions and their electrocatalytic application. We show rapid and selective formation of tetragonal or cubic M(x)Mn(3-x)O(4) from the reduction of amorphous MnO(2) in aqueous M(2+) solution. The prepared Co(x)Mn(3-x)O(4) nanoparticles manifest considerable catalytic activity towards the ORR/OER as a result of their high surface areas and abundant defects. The newly discovered phase-dependent electrocatalytic ORR/OER characteristics of Co-Mn-O spinels are also interpreted by experiment and first-principle theoretical studies.",2
Guest-induced growth of a surface-based supramolecular bilayer.,"Self-assembly of planar molecules on a surface can result in the formation of a wide variety of close-packed or porous structures. Two-dimensional porous arrays provide host sites for trapping guest species of suitable size. Here we show that a non-planar guest species (C(60)) can play a more complex role by promoting the growth of a second layer of host molecules (p-terphenyl-3,5,3'',5''-tetracarboxylic acid) above and parallel to the surface so that self-assembly is extended into the third dimension. The addition of guest molecules and the formation of the second layer are co-dependent. Adding a planar guest (coronene) can displace the C(60) and cause reversion to a monolayer arrangement. The system provides an example of a reversible transformation between a planar and a non-planar supramolecular network, an important step towards the controlled self-assembly of functional, three-dimensional, surface-based supramolecular architectures.",2
Redox-responsive molecular helices with highly condensed pi-clouds.,"Helices have long attracted the attention of chemists, both for their inherent chiral structure and their potential for applications such as the separation of chiral compounds or the construction of molecular machines. As a result of steric forces, polymeric o-phenylenes adopt a tight helical conformation in which the densely packed phenylene units create a highly condensed pi-cloud. Here, we show an oligomeric o-phenylene that undergoes a redox-responsive dynamic motion. In solution, the helices undergo a rapid inversion. During crystallization, however, a chiral symmetry-breaking phenomenon is observed in which each crystal contains only one enantiomeric form. Crystals of both handedness are obtained, but in a non-racemic mixture. Furthermore, in solution, the dynamic motion of the helical oligomer is dramatically suppressed by one-electron oxidation. X-ray crystallography of both the neutral and oxidized forms indicated that a hole, generated upon oxidation, is shared by the repeating o-phenylene units. This enables conformational locking of the helix, and represents a long-lasting chiroptical memory.",2
Surface-assisted cyclodehydrogenation provides a synthetic route towards easily processable and chemically tailored nanographenes.,"Atomically thin sheets of sp(2)-hybridized carbon--graphene--have enormous potential for applications in future electronic devices. Particularly promising are nanostructured (sub)units of graphene, the electronic properties of which can be tuned by changing the spatial extent or the specific edge termination of the carbon network. Processability and precise tailoring of graphene-derived structures are, however, still major obstacles in developing applications; both bottom-up and top-down routes are presently under investigation in attempts to overcome this limitation. Here, we propose a surface chemical route that allows for the atomically precise fabrication of tailored nanographenes from polyphenylene precursors. The cyclodehydrogenation of a prototypical polyphenylene on Cu(111) is studied using scanning tunnelling microscopy and density functional theory. We find that the thermally induced cyclodehydrogenation proceeds via several intermediate steps, two of which can be stabilized on the surface, yielding unprecedented insight into a dehydrogenative intramolecular aryl-aryl coupling reaction.",2
Reversing the direction in a light-driven rotary molecular motor.,"Biological rotary motors can alter their mechanical function by changing the direction of rotary motion. Achieving a similar reversal of direction of rotation in artificial molecular motors presents a fundamental stereochemical challenge: how to change from clockwise to anticlockwise motion without compromising the autonomous unidirectional rotary behaviour of the system. A new molecular motor with multilevel control of rotary motion is reported here, in which the direction of light-powered rotation can be reversed by base-catalysed epimerization. The key steps are deprotonation and reprotonation of the photochemically generated less-stable isomers during the 360 degrees unidirectional rotary cycle, with complete inversion of the configuration at the stereogenic centre. The ability to change directionality is an essential step towards mechanical molecular systems with adaptive functional behaviour.",2
Anion order in perovskite oxynitrides.,"Transition-metal oxynitrides with perovskite-type structures are an emerging class of materials with optical, photocatalytic, dielectric and magnetoresistive properties that may be sensitive to oxide-nitride order, but the anion-ordering principles were unclear. Here we report an investigation of the representative compounds SrMO(2)N (M = Nb, Ta) using neutron and electron diffraction. This revealed a robust 1O/2(O(0.5)N(0.5)) partial anion order (up to at least 750 degrees C in the apparently cubic high-temperature phases) that directs the rotations of MO(4)N(2) octahedra in the room-temperature superstructure. The anion distribution is consistent with local cis-ordering of the two nitrides in each octahedron driven by covalency, which results in disordered zigzag M-N chains in planes within the perovskite lattice. Local structures for the full range of oxynitride perovskites are predicted and a future challenge is to tune properties by controlling the order and dimensionality of the anion chains and networks.",2
The effect of isotopic substitution on the chirality of a self-assembled helix.,"N,N',N''-trialkylbenzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamides (BTAs) self-assemble by means of strong, threefold alpha-helix-type intermolecular hydrogen bonding into well-defined, helical, one-dimensional columnar aggregates. When a stereogenic centre is introduced into the alkyl side chains of these BTAs, strong Cotton effects are observed in dilute apolar solutions, indicating the preference for one helical conformation over the other. Here, we report the creation of a helical sense preference in self-assembled BTAs by introducing deuterium/hydrogen isotope chirality into the alkyl side chains. We determine the relative stabilities of the left- and right-handed helical conformations of these deuterated supramolecular polymers by performing a conformational analysis. Our findings show that the results of deuterium/hydrogen substitution in BTA-based supramolecular polymers and helical polyisocyanates are very similar, although the formation mechanisms differ. The selectively deuterated BTAs discussed here represent the first example of supramolecular chirality resulting from isotope substitution.",2
Highly efficient photocatalytic oxygenation reactions using water as an oxygen source.,"The effective utilization of solar energy requires photocatalytic reactions with high quantum efficiency. Water is the most abundant reactant that can be used as an oxygen source in efficient photocatalytic reactions, just as nature uses water in an oxygenic photosynthesis. We report that photocatalytic oxygenation of organic substrates such as sodium p-styrene sulfonate occurs with nearly 100% quantum efficiency using manganese(III) porphyrins as an oxygenation catalyst, [Ru(II)(bpy)(3)](2+) (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine) as a photosensitized electron-transfer catalyst, [Co(III)(NH(3))(5)Cl](2+) as a low-cost and weak one-electron oxidant, and water as an oxygen source in a phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4). A high-valent manganese-oxo porphyrin is proposed as an active oxidant that effects the oxygenation reactions.",2
Macroscopic self-assembly through molecular recognition.,"Molecular recognition plays an important role in nature, with perhaps the best known example being the complementarity exhibited by pairs of nucleobases in DNA. Studies of self-assembling and self-organizing systems based on molecular recognition are often performed at the molecular level, however, and any macroscopic implications of these processes are usually far removed from the specific molecular interactions. Here, we demonstrate that well-defined molecular-recognition events can be used to direct the assembly of macroscopic objects into larger aggregated structures. Acrylamide-based gels functionalized with either host (cyclodextrin) rings or small hydrocarbon-group guest moieties were synthesized. Pieces of host and guest gels are shown to adhere to one another through the mutual molecular recognition of the cyclodextrins and hydrocarbon groups on their surfaces. By changing the size and shape of the host and guest units, different gels can be selectively assembled and sorted into distinct macroscopic structures that are on the order of millimetres to centimetres in size.",2
Control and imaging of O(1D2) precession.,"Larmor precession of a quantum mechanical angular momentum vector about an applied magnetic field forms the basis for a range of magnetic resonance techniques, including nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging. We have used a polarized laser pump-probe scheme with velocity-map imaging detection to visualize, for the first time, the precessional motion of a quantum mechanical angular momentum vector. Photodissociation of O(2) at 157 nm provides a clean source of fast-moving O((1)D(2)) atoms, with their electronic angular momentum vector strongly aligned perpendicular to the recoil direction. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the distribution of atomic angular momenta precesses about the field direction, and polarization-sensitive images of the atomic scattering distribution recorded as a function of field strength yield 'time-lapse-photography' style movies of the precessional motion. We present movies recorded in various experimental geometries, and discuss potential consequences and applications in atmospheric chemistry and reaction dynamics.",2
Exchange-enhanced reactivity in bond activation by metal-oxo enzymes and synthetic reagents.,"Reactivity principles based on orbital overlap and bonding/antibonding interactions are well established to describe the reactivity of organic species, and atomic structures are typically predicted by Hund's rules to have maximum single-electron occupancy of degenerate orbitals in the ground state. Here, we extend the role of exchange to transition states and discuss how, for reactions and kinetics of bioinorganic species, the analogue of Hund's rules is exchange-controlled reactivity. Pathways that increase the number of unpaired and spin-identical electrons on a metal centre will be favoured by exchange stabilization. Such exchange-enhanced reactivity endows transition states with a stereochemistry different from that observed in cases that are not exchange-enhanced, and is in good agreement with the reactivity observed for iron-based enzymes and synthetic analogues. We discuss the interplay between orbital- and exchange-controlled principles, and how this depends on the identity of the transition metal, its oxidation number and its coordination sphere.",2
Quantum size effects in ambient CO oxidation catalysed by ligand-protected gold clusters.,"Finely dispersed nanometre-scale gold particles are known to catalyse several oxidation reactions in aerobic, ambient conditions. The catalytic activity has been explained by various complementary mechanisms, including support effects, particle-size-dependent metal-insulator transition, charging effects, frontier orbital interactions and geometric fluxionality. We show, by considering a series of robust and structurally well-characterized ligand-protected gold clusters with diameters between 1.2 and 2.4 nm, that electronic quantum size effects, particularly the magnitude of the so-called HOMO-LUMO energy gap, has a decisive role in binding oxygen to the nano-catalyst in an activated form. This can lead to the oxidation reaction 2CO + O(2) --> 2CO(2) with low activation barriers. Binding of dioxygen is significant only for the smallest particles with a metal core diameter clearly below 2 nm. Our results suggest a potentially viable route to practical applications using ligand-protected gold clusters for green chemistry.",2
Loading and selective release of cargo in DNA nanotubes with longitudinal variation.,"Nanotubes hold promise for a number of biological and materials applications because of their high aspect ratio and encapsulation potential. A particularly attractive goal is to access nanotubes that exert well-defined control over their cargo, such as selective encapsulation, precise positioning of the guests along the nanotube length and triggered release of this cargo in response to specific external stimuli. Here, we report the construction of DNA nanotubes with longitudinal variation and alternating larger and smaller capsules along the tube length. Size-selective encapsulation of gold nanoparticles into the large capsules of these tubes leads to 'nanopeapod' particle lines with positioning of the particles 65 nm apart. These nanotubes can then be opened when specific DNA strands are added to release their particle cargo spontaneously. This approach could lead to new applications of self-assembled nanotubes, such as in the precise organization of one-dimensional nanomaterials, gene-triggered selective delivery of drugs and biological sensing.",2
Preparation of functionalized organoaluminiums by direct insertion of aluminium to unsaturated halides.,"The preparation of polyfunctional organometallics is important in organic synthesis as these reagents are very popular nucleophiles. The preparation of functionalized aluminium reagents by direct insertion of aluminium powder is in general not possible. Such a reaction would be of special importance owing to the low price of aluminium compared with magnesium (it is half the price), the low toxicity of this metal and the chemoselectivity of the resultant organoaluminium reagents. We have now found that by adding catalytic amounts of selected metallic chlorides (TiCl(4), BiCl(3), InCl(3) or PbCl(2)) in the presence of LiCl, aluminium powder inserts into various unsaturated iodides and bromides under mild conditions. These resulting new organoaluminium reagents undergo smooth Pd-catalysed cross-coupling and acylation reactions, as well as copper-catalysed allylic substitutions, affording various interesting products for pharmaceutical and material science applications.",2
Face-directed self-assembly of an electronically active Archimedean polyoxometalate architecture.,"The convergent assembly of metal-organic frameworks has enabled the design of porous materials using a structural building unit approach, but functional systems incorporating pre-assembled structural building unit 'pore' openings are rare. Here, we show that the face-directed assembly of a ring-shaped macrocyclic polyoxometalate structural building unit, {P(8)W(48)O(184)}(40-) with an integrated 1-nm pore as an 'aperture synthon', with manganese linkers yields a vast three-dimensional extended framework architecture based on a truncated cuboctahedron. The 1-nm-diameter entrance pores of the {P(8)W(48)O(184)}(40-) structural building unit lead to approximately spherical 7.24-nm(3) cavities containing exchangeable alkali-metal cations that can be replaced by transition-metal ions through a cation exchange process. Control over this process can be exerted by either electrochemically switching the overall framework charge by manipulating the oxidation state of the manganese linker ions, or by physically gating the pores with large organic cations, thus demonstrating how metal-organic framework-like structures with integrated pores and new physical properties can be assembled.",2
Stereoinduction by distortional asymmetry.,"Stereoselective chemical synthesis requires the two faces of a pi bond to be differentiated. Theoretically sound qualitative models for understanding stereoinduction seem to break down in sterically unbiased cyclic systems. Presented here as the distortional asymmetry model is new insight that identifies circumstances where distortional ground state contributions are highly asymmetric and thereby contribute significantly to face selectivity. Out-of-plane distortional potential calculations, transition state calculations and molecular orbital analysis agree with experimental data that cannot otherwise be attributed to steric, torsion, polar or emergent transition state stabilizing effects. The model is readily understood in terms of reaction theory. The explanatory power of the model is also discussed.",2
Quantum-induced symmetry breaking explains infrared spectra of CH(5)(+) isotopologues.,"For decades, protonated methane, CH(5)(+), has provided new surprises and challenges for both experimentalists and theoreticians. This is because of the correlated large-amplitude motion of its five protons around the carbon nucleus, which leads to so-called hydrogen scrambling and causes a fluxional molecular structure. Here, the infrared spectra of all its H/D isotopologues have been measured using the 'Laser Induced Reactions' technique. Their shapes are found to be extremely dissimilar and depend strongly on the level of deuteration (only CD(5)(+) is similar to CH(5)(+)). All the spectra can be reproduced and assigned based on ab initio quantum simulations. The occupation of the topologically different sites by protons and deuterons is found to be strongly non-combinatorial and thus non-classical. This purely quantum-statistical effect implies a breaking of the classical symmetry of the site occupations induced by zero-point fluctuations, and this phenomenon is key to understanding the spectral changes studied here.",2
Triflimide-catalysed sigmatropic rearrangement of N-allylhydrazones as an example of a traceless bond construction.,"The recognition of structural elements (that is, retrons) that signal the application of specific chemical transformations is a key cognitive event in the design of synthetic routes to complex molecules. Reactions that produce compounds without an easily identifiable retron, by way of either substantial structural rearrangement or loss of the atoms required for the reaction to proceed, are significantly more difficult to apply during retrosynthetic planning, yet allow for non-traditional pathways that may facilitate efficient acquisition of the target molecule. We have developed a triflimide (Tf(2)NH)-catalysed rearrangement of N-allylhydrazones that allows for the generation of a sigma bond between two unfunctionalized sp(3) carbons in such a way that no clear retron for the reaction remains. This new 'traceless' bond construction displays a broad substrate profile and should open avenues for synthesizing complex molecules using non-traditional disconnections.",2
Nanocrystalline intermetallics on mesoporous carbon for direct formic acid fuel cell anodes.,"Shape- and size-controlled supported metal and intermetallic nanocrystallites are of increasing interest because of their catalytic and electrocatalytic properties. In particular, intermetallics PtX (X = Bi, Pb, Pd, Ru) are very attractive because of their high activity as fuel-cell anode catalysts for formic acid or methanol oxidation. These are normally synthesized using high-temperature techniques, but rigorous size control is very challenging. Even low-temperature techniques typically produce nanoparticles with dimensions much greater than the optimum <6 nm required for fuel cell catalysis. Here, we present a simple and robust, chemically controlled process for synthesizing size-controlled noble metal or bimetallic nanocrystallites embedded within the porous structure of ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC). By using surface-modified ordered mesoporous carbon to trap the metal precursors, nanocrystallites are formed with monodisperse sizes as low as 1.5 nm, which can be tuned up to approximately 3.5 nm. To the best of our knowledge, 3-nm ordered mesoporous carbon-supported PtBi nanoparticles exhibit the highest mass activity for formic acid oxidation reported to date, and over double that of Pt-Au.",2
Total synthesis of the large non-ribosomal peptide polytheonamide B.,"Polytheonamide B is by far the largest non-ribosomal peptide known at present, and displays extraordinary cytotoxicity (EC(50) = 68 pg ml(-1), mouse leukaemia P388 cells). Its 48 amino-acid residues include a variety of non-proteinogenic d- and l-amino acids, and the absolute stereochemistry of these amino acids alternate in sequence. These structural features induce the formation of a stable beta-strand-type structure, giving rise to an overall tubular structure over 30 A in length. In a biological setting, this fold is believed to transport cations across the lipid bilayer through a pore, thereby acting as an ion channel. Here, we report the first chemical construction of polytheonamide B. Our synthesis relies on the combination of four key stages: syntheses of non-proteinogenic amino acids, a solid-phase assembly of four fragments of polytheonamide B, silver-mediated connection of the fragments and, finally, global deprotection. The synthetic material now available will allow studies of the relationships between its conformational properties, channel functions and cytotoxicity.",2
"Binding energies, lifetimes and implications of bulk and interface solvated electrons in water.","Solvated electrons in liquid water are one of the seemingly simplest, but most important, transients in chemistry and biology, but they have resisted disclosing important information about their energetics, binding motifs and dynamics. Here we report the first ultrafast liquid-jet photoelectron spectroscopy measurements of solvated electrons in liquid water. The results prove unequivocally the existence of solvated electrons bound at the water surface and of solvated electrons in the bulk solution, with vertical binding energies of 1.6 eV and 3.3 eV, respectively, and with lifetimes longer than 100 ps. The unexpectedly long lifetime of solvated electrons bound at the water surface is attributed to a free-energy barrier that separates surface and interior states. Beyond constituting important energetic and kinetic benchmark and reference data, the results also help to understand the mechanisms of a number of very efficient electron-transfer processes in nature.",2
Chlorofullerenes featuring triple sequentially fused pentagons.,"The triple sequentially fused pentagons (TSFP) motif is one of the basic subunits that could be used for constructing fullerenes, but it violates the isolated pentagon rule (IPR) and has not been found in carbon cages to date. The properties of TSFP-incorporating fullerenes are thus poorly explored both theoretically and experimentally. Reported herein are four chlorinated derivatives of three different fullerene cages, all with the TSFP motif. X-ray crystallographic analyses indicate that the molecular strain inherent to the pentagon adjacency of a TSFP is significantly relieved upon exohedral chlorination, leaving one of the four pentagon fusion sites unsaturated and rendering the present derivatives chiral. This unique reactivity, in stark contrast to that of previously reported non-IPR fullerenes containing double fused pentagons or triple directly fused pentagons, can be rationalized by density functional theory calculations, and are expected to stimulate further studies of these new members of the fullerene family, both theoretically and experimentally.",2
Novel polymerization catalysts and hydride clusters from rare-earth metal dialkyls.,"This Review gives an overview on recent progress in the synthesis and chemistry of rare-earth metal dialkyl complexes bearing monoanionic ancillary ligands, with an emphasis on novel polymerization catalysts. These structurally well-defined and highly reactive compounds are prepared either by alkane elimination reactions between trialkyl rare-earth complexes and acidic neutral ligands, or by the metathetical reactions of rare-earth trihalides with the alkali metal salts of the corresponding ligands. On treatment with an appropriate borate compound, the dialkyl complexes are converted into the corresponding cationic monoalkyl species, which serve as excellent catalysts for the polymerization and copolymerization of a variety of olefins to yield a series of new polymer materials that exhibit novel properties. Alternatively, hydrogenation of the dialkyl rare-earth complexes with H(2) affords a new class of rare-earth polyhydride complexes with unique features in terms of both their structure and reactivity.",2
Exceptional ammonia uptake by a covalent organic framework.,"Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are porous crystalline materials composed of light elements linked by strong covalent bonds. A number of these materials contain a high density of Lewis acid boron sites that can strongly interact with Lewis basic guests, which makes them ideal for the storage of corrosive chemicals such as ammonia. We found that a member of the covalent organic framework family, COF-10, shows the highest uptake capacity (15 mol kg(-)(1), 298 K, 1 bar) of any porous material, including microporous 13X zeolite (9 mol kg(-)(1)), Amberlyst 15 (11 mol kg(-)(1)) and mesoporous silica, MCM-41 (7.9 mol kg(-)(1)). Notably, ammonia can be removed from the pores of COF-10 by heating samples at 200 degrees C under vacuum. In addition, repeated adsorption of ammonia into COF-10 causes a shift in the interlayer packing, which reduces its apparent surface area to nitrogen. However, owing to the strong Lewis acid-base interactions, the total uptake capacity of ammonia and the structural integrity of the COF are maintained after several cycles of adsorption/desorption.",2
Solution structure of a DNA double helix with consecutive metal-mediated base pairs.,"Metal-mediated base pairs represent a powerful tool for the site-specific functionalization of nucleic acids with metal ions. The development of applications of the metal-modified nucleic acids will depend on the availability of structural information on these double helices. We present here the NMR solution structure of a self-complementary DNA oligonucleotide with three consecutive imidazole nucleotides in its centre. In the absence of transition-metal ions, a hairpin structure is adopted with the artificial nucleotides forming the loop. In the presence of Ag(i) ions, a duplex comprising three imidazole-Ag(+)-imidazole base pairs is formed. Direct proof for the formation of metal-mediated base pairs was obtained from (1)J((1)(5)N,(1)(0)(7)/(1)(0)(9)Ag) couplings upon incorporation of (1)(5)N-labelled imidazole. The duplex adopts a B-type conformation with only minor deviations in the region of the artificial bases. This work represents the first structural characterization of a metal-modified nucleic acid with a continuous stretch of metal-mediated base pairs.",2
Exploring local currents in molecular junctions.,"Electron transfer through molecules is an ubiquitous process underlying the function of biological systems and synthetic devices. The electronic coupling between components varies with the structure of the molecular bridge, often in classically unintuitive ways, as determined by its quantum electronic structure. Considerable efforts in electron-transfer theory have yielded models that are useful conceptually and provide quantitative means to understand transfer rates in terms of local contributions. Here we show how a description of the local currents within a bridging molecule bound to metallic electrodes can provide chemical insight into current flow. In particular, we show that through-space, as opposed to through-bond, terms dominate in a surprising number of instances, and that interference effects can be characterized by the reversal of ring currents. Together these ideas have implications for the design of molecular electronic devices, in particular for the ways in which substituent effects may be used for maximum impact.",2
Synthesis of a molecular trefoil knot by folding and closing on an octahedral coordination template.,"The advent of template-directed synthesis has provided access to a range of new interlocked molecular architectures. Although many syntheses of molecular catenanes and rotaxanes have been reported, molecular knots are a class of molecules with topologically non-planar graphs that are rather rare. Here we report a synthetic strategy for the preparation of a molecular trefoil knot from a flexible bipyridine oligomer and a zinc(II) octahedral coordination template. The oligomer folds into a stable open-knot conformation in the presence of the template, and trapping of this arrangement through esterification or ring-closing metathesis produces the closed-knot complex. Subsequent removal of the template from the metathesis product results in a molecular trefoil knot.",2
Anisotropic oxygen diffusion at low temperature in perovskite-structure iron oxides.,"Oxygen-ion conduction in transition-metal oxides is exploited in, for example, electrolytes in solid-oxide fuel cells and oxygen-separation membranes, which currently work at high temperatures. Conduction at low temperature is a key to developing further utilization, and an understanding of the structures that enable conduction is also important to gain insight into oxygen-diffusion pathways. Here we report the structural changes observed when single-crystalline, epitaxial CaFeO(2).(5) thin films were changed into CaFeO(2) by low-temperature reductions with CaH(2). During the reduction process from the brownmillerite CaFeO(2).(5) into the infinite-layer structure of CaFeO(2), some of the oxygen atoms are released from and others are rearranged within the perovskite-structure framework. We evaluated these changes and the reaction time they required, and found two oxygen diffusion pathways and the related kinetics at low temperature. The results demonstrate that oxygen diffusion in the brownmillerite is highly anisotropic, significantly higher along the lateral direction of the tetrahedral and octahedral layers.",2
A facile route to ketene-functionalized polymers for general materials applications.,"Function matters in materials science, and methodologies that provide paths to multiple functionality in a single step are to be prized. Therefore, we introduce a robust and efficient strategy for exploiting the versatile reactivity of ketenes in polymer chemistry. New monomers for both radical and ring-opening metathesis polymerization have been developed, which take advantage of Meldrum's acid as both a synthetic building block and a thermolytic precursor to dialkyl ketenes. The ketene-functionalized polymers are directly detected by their characteristic infrared absorption and are found to be stable under ambient conditions. The inherent ability of ketenes to provide crosslinking via dimerization and to act as reactive chemical handles via addition, provides simple methodology for application in complex materials challenges. Such versatile characteristics are illustrated by covalently attaching and patterning a dye through microcontact printing. The strategy highlights the significant opportunities afforded by the traditionally neglected ketene functional group in polymer chemistry.",2
A concentric planar doubly pi-aromatic B(1)(9)(-) cluster.,"Atomic clusters often show unique, size-dependent properties and have become a fertile ground for the discovery of novel molecular structures and chemical bonding. Here we report an investigation of the B(1)(9)(-) cluster, which shows chemical bonding reminiscent of that in [10]annulene (C(1)(0)H(1)(0)) and [6]circulene (C(2)(4)H(1)(2)). Photoelectron spectroscopy reveals a relatively simple spectrum for B(1)(9)(-), with a high electron-binding energy. Theoretical calculations show that the global minimum of B(1)(9)(-) is a nearly circular planar structure with a central B(6) pentagonal unit bonded to an outer B(1)(3) ring. Chemical bonding analyses reveal that the B(1)(9)(-) cluster possesses a unique double pi-aromaticity in two concentric pi-systems, with two pi-electrons delocalized over the central pentagonal B(6) unit and another ten pi-electrons responsible for the pi-bonding between the central pentagonal unit and the outer ring. Such peculiar chemical bonding does not exist in organic compounds; it can only be found in atomic clusters.",2
Formation of mixed-phase particles during the freezing of polar stratospheric ice clouds.,"Polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) are extremely efficient at catalysing the transformation of photostable chlorine reservoirs into photolabile species, which are actively involved in springtime ozone-depletion events. Why PSCs are such efficient catalysts, however, is not well understood. Here, we investigate the freezing behaviour of ternary HNO(3)-H(2)SO(4)-H(2)O droplets of micrometric size, which form type II PSC ice particles. We show that on freezing, a phase separation into pure ice and a residual solution coating occurs; this coating does not freeze but transforms into glass below approximately 150 K. We find that the coating, which is thicker around young ice crystals, can still be approximately 30 nm around older ice crystals of diameter about 10 microm. These results affect our understanding of PSC microphysics and chemistry and suggest that chlorine-activation reactions are better studied on supercooled HNO(3)-H(2)SO(4)-H(2)O solutions rather than on a pure ice surface.",2
Selective incarceration of caesium ions by Venus flytrap action of a flexible framework sulfide.,"The selective capture of Cs(+) from solution is relevant to the remediation of nuclear waste and remains a significant challenge. Here we describe a new framework composed of [(CH(3))(2)NH(2)](+) and [Ga(2)Sb(2)S(7)](2)(-) layers, which are perforated with holes. Shape selectivity couples with framework flexibility, allowing the compound to respond to the ion-exchange process. The size, shape and flexibility of the holes allow Cs(+) ions in an aqueous solution to selectively pass through and enter the material via an ion-exchange process. Following capture, the structure dynamically closes its holes in a manner reminiscent of a Venus flytrap, which prevents the Cs(+) ions from leaching out. This process has useful implications in the separation science of Cs as it relates to the clean-up of nuclear waste. The dynamic response we describe here provides important insights for designing new materials for the selective removal of difficult-to-capture ions.",2
Organocatalytic cascade reactions as a new tool in total synthesis.,"The total synthesis of natural products and biologically active compounds, such as pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, has reached an extraordinary level of sophistication. We are, however, still far away from the 'ideal synthesis' and the state of the art is still frequently hampered by lengthy protecting-group strategies and costly purification procedures derived from the step-by-step protocols. In recent years several new criteria have been brought forward to solve these problems and to improve total synthesis: atom, step and redox economy or protecting-group-free synthesis. Over the past decade the research area of organocatalysis has rapidly grown to become a third pillar of asymmetric catalysis standing next to metal and biocatalysis, thus paving the way for a new and powerful strategy that can help to address these issues - organocatalytic cascade reactions. In this Review we present the first applications of such asymmetric organocascade reactions to the total synthesis of natural products.",2
A versatile approach to high-throughput microarrays using thiol-ene chemistry.,"Microarray technology has become extremely useful in expediting the investigation of large libraries of materials in a variety of biomedical applications, such as in DNA chips, protein and cellular microarrays. In the development of cellular microarrays, traditional high-throughput printing strategies on stiff, glass substrates and non-covalent attachment methods are limiting. We have developed a facile strategy to fabricate multifunctional high-throughput microarrays embedded at the surface of a hydrogel substrate using thiol-ene chemistry. This user-friendly method provides a platform for the immobilization of a combination of bioactive and diagnostic molecules, such as peptides and dyes, at the surface of poly(ethylene glycol)-based hydrogels. The robust and orthogonal nature of thiol-ene chemistry allows for a range of covalent attachment strategies in a fast and reliable manner, and two complementary strategies for the attachment of active molecules are demonstrated.",2
Random two-dimensional string networks based on divergent coordination assembly.,"The bulk properties of glasses and amorphous materials have been studied widely, but the determination of their structural details at the molecular level is hindered by the lack of long-range order. Recently, two-dimensional, supramolecular random networks were assembled on surfaces, and the identification of elementary structural motifs and defects has provided insights into the intriguing nature of disordered materials. So far, however, such networks have been obtained with homomolecular hydrogen-bonded systems of limited stability. Here we explore robust, disordered coordination networks that incorporate transition-metal centres. Cobalt atoms were co-deposited on metal surfaces with a ditopic linker that is nonlinear, prochiral (deconvoluted in three stereoisomers on two-dimensional confinement) and bears terminal carbonitrile groups. In situ scanning tunnelling microscopy revealed the formation of a set of coordination nodes of similar energy that drives a divergent assembly scenario. The expressed string formation and bifurcation motifs result in a random reticulation of the entire surface.",2
"Highly diastereoselective Csp(3)-Csp(2) Negishi cross-coupling with 1,2-, 1,3- and 1,4-substituted cycloalkylzinc compounds.","Stereoselective functionalizations of organic molecules are of great importance to modern synthesis. A stereoselective preparation of pharmaceutically active molecules is often required to ensure the appropriate biological activity. Thereby, diastereoselective methods represent valuable tools for an efficient set-up of multiple stereocentres. In this article, highly diastereoselective Csp(3) Negishi cross-couplings of various cycloalkylzinc reagents with aryl halides are reported. In all cases, the thermodynamically most-stable stereoisomer was obtained. Remarkably, this diastereoselective coupling was successful not only for 1,2-substituted cyclic systems, but also for 1,3- and 1,4-substituted cyclohexylzinc reagents. The origin of this remote stereocontrol was investigated by NMR experiments and density functional theory calculations. A detailed mechanism based on these experimental and theoretical data is proposed.",2
Analysis of the reactivity and selectivity of fullerene dimerization reactions at the atomic level.,"High-resolution transmission electron microscopy has proved useful for its ability to provide time-resolved images of small molecules and their movements. One of the next challenges in this area is to visualize chemical reactions by monitoring time-dependent changes in the atomic positions of reacting molecules. Such images may provide information that is not available with other experimental methods. Here we report a study on bimolecular reactions of fullerene and metallofullerene molecules inside carbon nanotubes as a function of electron dose. Images of how the fullerenes move during the dimerization process reveal the specific orientations in which two molecules interact, as well as how bond reorganization occurs after their initial contact. Studies on the concentration, specimen temperature, effect of catalyst and accelerating voltage indicate that the reactions can be imaged under a variety of conditions.",2
Dianionic species with a bond consisting of two pentacoordinated silicon atoms.,"Silicon can form bonds to other tetracoordinated silicon atoms and these bonds form the framework of many organosilicon compounds and crystalline silicon. Silicon can also form a pentacoordinated anionic structure-a so-called 'silicate'. No compounds containing a direct bond between two silicate moieties-'disilicates' where two silicate structures are combined in one species-have been reported because of the electronic repulsion between the anionic halves and difficulty preventing the release of anions. Here we report the synthesis of thermally stable and isolable disilicates by the reductive coupling reaction of a silane bearing two electron-withdrawing bidentate ligands. Two pentacoordinated silicons, positively charged despite the formal negative charge, constitute a single sigma-bond and bind eight negatively charged atoms. They can be reversibly protonated, cleaving two Si-O bonds, to afford a tetracoordinated disilane. Their unique electronic properties could be promising for the construction of functional materials with silicon wire made up of silicate chains.",2
Towards quantum chemistry on a quantum computer.,"Exact first-principles calculations of molecular properties are currently intractable because their computational cost grows exponentially with both the number of atoms and basis set size. A solution is to move to a radically different model of computing by building a quantum computer, which is a device that uses quantum systems themselves to store and process data. Here we report the application of the latest photonic quantum computer technology to calculate properties of the smallest molecular system: the hydrogen molecule in a minimal basis. We calculate the complete energy spectrum to 20 bits of precision and discuss how the technique can be expanded to solve large-scale chemical problems that lie beyond the reach of modern supercomputers. These results represent an early practical step toward a powerful tool with a broad range of quantum-chemical applications.",2
Chemoenzymatic synthesis of differentially protected 3-deoxysugars.,"3-Deoxysugars are important constituents of complex carbohydrates. For example, 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (KDO) is an essential component of lipopolysaccharides in Gram-negative bacteria, 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nonulosonic acid (KDN) is widely found in carbohydrates of the bacterial cell wall and in lower vertebrates, and sialic acid is a common cap of mammalian glycoproteins. Although ready access to such sugars would benefit the creation of vaccine candidates, antibiotics and small-molecule drugs, their chemical synthesis is difficult. Here we present a simple chemoenzymatic method for preparing differentially protected 3-deoxysugar derivatives from readily available starting materials. It exploits the promiscuous aldolase activity of the enzyme macrophomate synthase (MPS) to add pyruvate enolate diastereoselectively to a wide range of structurally complex aldehydes. A short synthesis of KDN illustrates the utility of this approach. Enzyme promiscuity, which putatively fosters large functional leaps in natural evolution, has great promise as a source of synthetically useful catalytic transformations.",2
A synthetic small molecule that can walk down a track.,"Although chemists have made small-molecule rotary motors, to date there have been no reports of small-molecule linear motors. Here we describe the synthesis and operation of a 21-atom two-legged molecular unit that is able to walk up and down a four-foothold molecular track. High processivity is conferred by designing the track-binding interactions of the two feet to be labile under different sets of conditions such that each foot can act as a temporarily fixed pivot for the other. The walker randomly and processively takes zero or one step along the track using a 'passing-leg' gait each time the environment is switched between acid and base. Replacing the basic step with a redox-mediated, disulfide-exchange reaction directionally transports the bipedal molecules away from the minimum-energy distribution by a Brownian ratchet mechanism. The ultimate goal of such studies is to produce artificial, linear molecular motors that move directionally along polymeric tracks to transport cargoes and perform tasks in a manner reminiscent of biological motor proteins.",2
Tailoring molecular layers at metal surfaces.,"The design of networks of organic molecules at metal surfaces, highly attractive for a variety of applications ranging from molecular electronics to gas sensors to protective coatings, has matured to a degree that patterns with multinanometre unit cells and almost any arbitrary geometry can be fabricated. This Review provides an overview of vacuum-deposited organic networks at metal surfaces, using intermolecular hydrogen bonding, metal-atom coordination and in situ polymerization. Recent progress in these areas highlights how the design of surface patterns can benefit from the wealth of information available from solution- and bulk-phase chemistry, while at the same time providing novel insights into the nature of such bonds through the applicability of direct scanning probe imaging at metal surfaces.",2
Vapour-phase gold-surface-mediated coupling of aldehydes with methanol.,"Selective coupling of oxygenates is critical to many synthetic processes, including those necessary for the development of alternative fuels. We report a general process for selective coupling of aldehydes and methanol as a route to ester synthesis. All steps are mediated by oxygen-covered metallic gold nanoparticles on Au(111). Remarkably, cross-coupling of methanol with formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, benzaldehyde and benzeneacetaldehyde to methyl esters is promoted by oxygen-covered Au(111) below room temperature with high selectivity. The high selectivity is attributed to the ease of nucleophilic attack of the aldehydes by the methoxy intermediate-formed from methanol on the surface-which yields the methyl esters. The competing combustion occurs via attack of both methanol and the aldehydes by oxygen. The mechanistic model constructed in this study provides insight into factors that control selectivity and clearly elucidates the crucial role of Au nanoparticles as active species in the catalytic oxidation of alcohols, even in solution.",2
A biocompatible condensation reaction for controlled assembly of nanostructures in living cells.,"Through controlled synthesis and molecular assembly, biological systems are able to organize molecules into supramolecular structures that carry out sophisticated processes. Although chemists have reported a few examples of supramolecular assembly in water, the controlled covalent synthesis of large molecules and structures in vivo has remained challenging. Here we report a condensation reaction between 1,2-aminothiol and 2-cyanobenzothiazole that occurs in vitro and in living cells under the control of either pH, disulfide reduction or enzymatic cleavage. In vitro, the size and shape of the condensation products, and the nanostructures subsequently assembled, were different in each case and could thus be controlled by tuning the structure of the monomers. Direct imaging of the products obtained in the cells revealed their locations-near the Golgi bodies under enzymatic cleavage control-demonstrating the feasibility of a controlled and localized reaction in living cells. This intracellular condensation process enabled the imaging of the proteolytic activity of furin.",2
Pressure-induced bonding and compound formation in xenon-hydrogen solids.,"Closed electron shell systems, such as hydrogen, nitrogen or group 18 elements, can form weakly bound stoichiometric compounds at high pressures. An understanding of the stability of these van der Waals compounds is lacking, as is information on the nature of their interatomic interactions. We describe the formation of a stable compound in the Xe-H(2) binary system, revealed by a suite of X-ray diffraction and optical spectroscopy measurements. At 4.8 GPa, a unique hydrogen-rich structure forms that can be viewed as a tripled solid hydrogen lattice modulated by layers of xenon, consisting of xenon dimers. Varying the applied pressure tunes the Xe-Xe distances in the solid over a broad range from that of an expanded xenon lattice to the distances observed in metallic xenon at megabar pressures. Infrared and Raman spectra indicate a weakening of the intramolecular covalent bond as well as persistence of semiconducting behaviour in the compound to at least 255 GPa.",2
Radically enhanced molecular recognition.,"The tendency for viologen radical cations to dimerize has been harnessed to establish a recognition motif based on their ability to form extremely strong inclusion complexes with cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) in its diradical dicationic redox state. This previously unreported complex involving three bipyridinium cation radicals increases the versatility of host-guest chemistry, extending its practice beyond the traditional reliance on neutral and charged guests and hosts. In particular, transporting the concept of radical dimerization into the field of mechanically interlocked molecules introduces a higher level of control within molecular switches and machines. Herein, we report that bistable and tristable [2]rotaxanes can be switched by altering electrochemical potentials. In a tristable [2]rotaxane composed of a cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) ring and a dumbbell with tetrathiafulvalene, dioxynaphthalene and bipyridinium recognition sites, the position of the ring can be switched. On oxidation, it moves from the tetrathiafulvalene to the dioxynaphthalene, and on reduction, to the bipyridinium radical cation, provided the ring is also reduced simultaneously to the diradical dication.",2
Converting homogeneous to heterogeneous in electrophilic catalysis using monodisperse metal nanoparticles.,"A continuing goal in catalysis is to unite the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic processes. To this end, nanoparticles represent a new frontier in heterogeneous catalysis, where this unification can also be supplemented by the ability to obtain new or divergent reactivity and selectivity. We report a novel method for applying heterogeneous catalysts to known homogeneous catalytic reactions through the design and synthesis of electrophilic platinum nanoparticles. These nanoparticles are selectively oxidized by the hypervalent iodine species PhICl(2), and catalyse a range of pi-bond activation reactions previously only catalysed through homogeneous processes. Multiple experimental methods are used to unambiguously verify the heterogeneity of the catalytic process. The discovery of treatments for nanoparticles that induce the desired homogeneous catalytic activity should lead to the further development of reactions previously inaccessible in heterogeneous catalysis. Furthermore, a size and capping agent study revealed that Pt PAMAM dendrimer-capped nanoparticles demonstrate superior activity and recyclability compared with larger, polymer-capped analogues.",2
Dinitrogen cleavage and functionalization by carbon monoxide promoted by a hafnium complex.,"Molecular nitrogen (N(2)) and carbon monoxide (CO) have the two strongest bonds in chemistry and present significant challenges in developing new transformations that exploit these two abundant feedstocks. At the core of this objective is the discovery of transition-metal compounds that promote the six-electron reductive cleavage of N(2) at ambient temperature and pressure and also promote new nitrogen-element bond formation. Here we show that an organometallic hafnium compound induces N(2) cleavage on the addition of CO, with a simultaneous assembly of new nitrogen-carbon and carbon-carbon bonds. Subsequent addition of a weak acid liberates oxamide, which demonstrates that an important agrochemical can be synthesized directly from N(2) and CO. These studies introduce an alternative paradigm for N(2) cleavage and functionalization in which the six-electron reductive cleavage is promoted by both the transition metal and the incoming ligand, CO, used for the new bond formations.",2
Template synthesis of precisely monodisperse silica nanoparticles within self-assembled organometallic spheres.,"One of the key challenges in materials science is to control the size and shape of inorganic nanoparticles with a high degree of precision, as these parameters have a significant influence on the nanoparticles' properties and potential applications. Here, we describe the preparation of highly monodisperse silica nanoparticles smaller than 5 nm in diameter by using self-assembled, hollow, spherical compounds as 'endo-templates'. These coordination complexes with pendant sugar groups lining their interiors-assembled from 12 metal ions and 24 bis-pyridyl ligands containing glucose substituents-acted as structurally well-defined templates for the sol-gel condensation of alkoxysilanes. The polydispersities of the silica nanoparticles made with this method approached unity, with M(w)/M(n) < 1.01. The component ligands are modified easily, which enables an accurate expansion of the coordination complex and the subsequent control of the monodisperse silica nanoparticles that span molecular weights of 5,000 to 31,000 Da (corresponding to 2-4 nm in diameter). This method could be applicable to the preparation of other inorganic nanoparticles.",2
Designing artificial enzymes by intuition and computation.,"The rational design of artificial enzymes, either by applying physico-chemical intuition of protein structure and function or with the aid of computational methods, is a promising area of research with the potential to tremendously impact medicine, industrial chemistry and energy production. Designed proteins also provide a powerful platform for dissecting enzyme mechanisms of natural systems. Artificial enzymes have come a long way from simple alpha-helical peptide catalysts to proteins that facilitate multistep chemical reactions designed by state-of-the-art computational methods. Looking forward, we examine strategies employed by natural enzymes that could be used to improve the speed and selectivity of artificial catalysts.",2
A flash of magnesium.,Magnesium is commonly found in rocks and sea water as well as living organisms. Paul Knochel relates how this element has also sparked a great deal of interest among chemists.,2
Dynamic hook-and-eye nanoparticle sponges.,"Systems in which nanoscale components of different types can be captured and/or released from organic scaffolds provide a fertile basis for the construction of dynamic, exchangeable functional materials. In such heterogeneous systems, the components interact with one another by means of programmable, noncovalent bonding interactions. Herein, we describe polymers that capture and release functionalized nanoparticles selectively during redox-controlled aggregation and disaggregation, respectively. The interactions between the polymer and the NPs are mediated by the reversible formation of polypseudorotaxanes, and give rise to architectures ranging from short chains composed of few nanoparticles to extended networks of nanoparticles crosslinked by the polymer. In the latter case, the polymer/nanoparticle aggregates precipitate from solution such that the polymer acts as a selective 'sponge' for the capture/release of the nanoparticles of different types.",2
Complete chiral symmetry breaking of an amino acid derivative directed by circularly polarized light.,"Circularly polarized light (CPL) emitted from star-forming regions is an attractive candidate as a cause of single chirality in nature. It has remained difficult, however, to translate the relatively small chemical effects observed on irradiation of molecular systems with CPL into high enantiomeric excesses. Here we demonstrate that irradiation of a racemic amino acid derivative with CPL leads to a small amount of chiral induction that can be amplified readily to give an enantiopure solid phase. A racemate composed of equal amounts of left- and right-handed crystals in contact with the irradiated solution is converted completely into crystals of single-handedness through abrasive grinding when racemization is effected in the solution. The rotation sense of the CPL fully determines the handedness of the final solid state. These findings illustrate the potential effectiveness of CPL in the control of molecular asymmetry, which is relevant for the origin of the single chirality inherent to many biological molecules.",2
Identification of active Zr-WO(x) clusters on a ZrO2 support for solid acid catalysts.,"Tungstated zirconia is a robust solid acid catalyst for light alkane (C(4)-C(8)) isomerization. Several structural models for catalytically active sites have been proposed, but the topic remains controversial, partly because of the absence of direct structural imaging information on the various supported WO(x) species. High-angle annular dark-field imaging of WO(3)/ZrO(2) catalysts in an aberration-corrected analytical electron microscope allows, for the first time, direct imaging of the various species present. Comparison of the relative distribution of these WO(x) species in materials showing low and high catalytic activities has allowed the deduction of the likely identity of the catalytic active site--namely, subnanometre Zr-WO(x) clusters. This information has subsequently been used in the design of new catalysts, in which the activity of a poor catalyst has been increased by two orders of magnitude using a synthesis procedure that deliberately increases the number density of catalytically relevant active species.",2
Cooperative molecular dynamics in surface reactions.,"The controlled imprinting of surfaces with specified patterns is important in the development of nanoscale devices. Previously, such patterns were created using self-assembled physisorbed adsorbate molecules that can be stabilized on the surface by subsequent chemical bonding. Here we show a first step towards use of the bonding within a surface to propagate reactions for patterning, namely the cooperative reaction of adjacent silicon atoms. We exploit the double-bonded silicon dimer pairs present on the surface of Si(100)-2x1 and show that the halogenation of one silicon atom (induced by electrons or heat) results in cooperative halogenation of the neighbouring silicon atom with unit efficiency. The reactants used were two 1-halopentane molecules physisorbed over a pair of silicon atoms. This cooperative pair of halogenation reactions was shown by ab initio calculation to be sequential on a timescale of femtoseconds.",2
Anhydrous proton conduction at 150 degrees C in a crystalline metal-organic framework.,"Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are particularly exciting materials that couple porosity, diversity and crystallinity. But although they have been investigated for a wide range of applications, MOF chemistry focuses almost exclusively on properties intrinsic to the empty frameworks; the use of guest molecules to control functions has been essentially unexamined. Here we report Na(3)(2,4,6-trihydroxy-1,3,5-benzenetrisulfonate) (named beta-PCMOF2), a MOF that conducts protons in regular one-dimensional pores lined with sulfonate groups. Proton conduction in beta-PCMOF2 was modulated by the controlled loading of 1H-1,2,4-triazole (Tz) guests within the pores and reached 5 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) at 150 degrees C in anhydrous H(2), as confirmed by electrical measurements in H(2) and D(2), and by solid-state NMR spectroscopy. To confirm its potential as a gas separator membrane, the partially loaded MOF (beta-PCMOF2(Tz)(0.45)) was also incorporated into a H(2)/air membrane electrode assembly. The resulting membrane proved to be gas tight, and gave an open circuit voltage of 1.18 V at 100 degrees C.",2
Soft porous crystals.,"The field of host-guest complexation is intensely attractive from diverse perspectives, including materials science, chemistry and biology. The uptake and encapsulation of guest species by host frameworks are being investigated for a wide variety of purposes, including separation and storage using zeolites, and recognition and sensing by enzymes in solution. Here we focus on the concept of the cooperative integration of 'softness' and 'regularity'. Recent developments on porous coordination polymers (or metal-organic frameworks) have provided the inherent properties that combine these features. Such soft porous crystals exhibit dynamic frameworks that are able to respond to external stimuli such as light, electric fields or the presence of particular species, but they are also crystalline and can change their channels reversibly while retaining high regularity. We discuss the relationship between the structures and properties of these materials in view of their practical applications.",2
Chemistry goes abstract.,"Can philosophy make worthwhile contributions to science? Eric Scerri thinks it can, and looks at what it has brought to the table for chemistry.",2
Communicating chemistry.,"New web-based models of scholarly communication have made a significant impact in some scientific disciplines, but chemistry is not one of them. What has prevented the widespread adoption of these developments by chemists-and what are the prospects for adoption over time?",2
Questioning 'chemistry'.,"The Nobel Prize in Chemistry for 2009 was awarded for research into the structure and function of the ribosome, sparking debate about its significance to chemists.",2
Small-molecule-mediated G-quadruplex isolation from human cells.,"Nucleic acids containing stretches of tandem guanines can fold into four-stranded structures called G-quadruplexes. The existence of such sequences in genomic DNA suggests the occurrence of these motifs in cells, with potential implications in a number of biological processes relevant to cancer. Small molecules have proven to be valuable tools to dissect cell circuitry. Here, we describe a synthetic small molecule derived from an N,N'-bis(2-quinolinyl)pyridine-2,6-dicarboxamide, which is designed to mediate the selective isolation of G-quadruplex nucleic acids. The methodology was successfully applied to a range of DNA and RNA G-quadruplexes in vitro. We demonstrate the general applicability of the method by isolating telomeric DNA-containing G-quadruplex motifs from cells. We show that telomeres are targets for the probe, providing further evidence of the formation of G-quadruplexes in human cells.",2
Biocatalytic induction of supramolecular order.,"Supramolecular gels, which demonstrate tunable functionalities, have attracted much interest in a range of areas, including healthcare, environmental protection and energy-related technologies. Preparing these materials in a reliable manner is challenging, with an increased level of kinetic defects observed at higher self-assembly rates. Here, by combining biocatalysis and molecular self-assembly, we have shown the ability to more quickly access higher-ordered structures. By simply increasing enzyme concentration, supramolecular order expressed at molecular, nano- and micro-levels is dramatically enhanced, and, importantly, the gelator concentrations remain identical. Amphiphile molecules were prepared by attaching an aromatic moiety to a dipeptide backbone capped with a methyl ester. Their self-assembly was induced by an enzyme that hydrolysed the ester. Different enzyme concentrations altered the catalytic activity and size of the enzyme clusters, affecting their mobility. This allowed structurally diverse materials that represent local minima in the free energy landscape to be accessed based on a single gelator structure.",2
Mineralization of the metre-long biosilica structures of glass sponges is templated on hydroxylated collagen.,"The minerals involved in the formation of metazoan skeletons principally comprise glassy silica, calcium phosphate or carbonate. Because of their ancient heritage, glass sponges (Hexactinellida) may shed light on fundamental questions such as molecular evolution, the unique chemistry and formation of the first skeletal silica-based structures, and the origin of multicellular animals. We have studied anchoring spicules from the metre-long stalk of the glass rope sponge (Hyalonema sieboldi; Porifera, Class Hexactinellida), which are remarkable for their size, durability, flexibility and optical properties. Using slow-alkali etching of biosilica, we isolated the organic fraction, which was revealed to be dominated by a hydroxylated fibrillar collagen that contains an unusual [Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp] motif. We speculate that this motif is predisposed for silica precipitation, and provides a novel template for biosilicification in nature.",2
Mutual modulation between membrane-embedded receptor clustering and ligand binding in lipid membranes.,"Thanks largely to a cooperative chelate effect, clustered membrane-embedded proteins favourably bind to multivalent ligands in solution and, conversely, a multivalent receptor can induce the clustering of membrane-embedded proteins. Here, we use a chemical model to show that the binding of a monovalent ligand and the clustering of a membrane-embedded receptor are closely related processes that modulate each other without the contribution of any apparent multivalence effect. Clearly, the confinement of the receptor within the surface reveals cooperative effects between clustering and binding that are too weak to detect in bulk-solution systems. This work shows that for membrane-embedded receptors that undergo some degree of spontaneous clustering, analyses based on multivalence-mediated cooperativity are insufficient to describe fully the molecular recognition events induced by ligands in solution. Instead, a binding-clustering thermodynamic cycle is proposed for the analysis of the interaction of any kind of ligand with membrane-embedded receptors.",2
Crystallographic snapshots of the reaction of aromatic C-H with O(2) catalysed by a protein-bound iron complex.,"Chemical reactions inside single crystals are quite rare because crystallinity is difficult to retain owing to atomic rearrangements. Protein crystals in general have a high solvent content. This allows for some molecular flexibility, which makes it possible to trap reaction intermediates of enzymatic reactions without disrupting the crystal lattice. A similar approach has not yet been fully implemented in the field of inorganic chemistry. Here, we have combined model chemistry and protein X-ray crystallography to study the intramolecular aromatic dihydroxylation by an arene-containing protein-bound iron complex. The bound complex was able to activate dioxygen in the presence of a reductant, leading to the formation of catechol as the sole product. The structure determination of four of the catalytic cycle intermediates and the end product showed that the hydroxylation reaction implicates an iron peroxo, generated by reductive O(2) activation, an intermediate already observed in iron monooxygenases. This strategy also provided unexpected mechanistic details such as the rearrangement of the iron coordination sphere on metal reduction.",2
A bioinspired approach for controlling accessibility in calix[4]arene-bound metal cluster catalysts.,"In enzymes, the electronic and steric environments of active centres, and therefore their activity in biological processes, are controlled by the surrounding amino acids. In a similar manner, organic ligands have been used for the 'passivation' of metal clusters, that is, inhibition of their aggregation and control of their environment. However, the ability of enzymes to maintain large degrees of accessibility has remained difficult to mimic in synthetic systems in which little room, if any, is typically left to bind to other species. Here, using calix[4]arene macrocycles bearing phosphines as crude mimics of the rigid backbones of proteins, we demonstrate the synthesis of gold clusters and the control of their accessibility through an interplay between the sizes of the calixarene ligands and metal cores. For 0.9-nm cores, 25% of all the gold atoms within the cluster bind to the chemisorption probe 2-naphthalenethiol. This accessibility dramatically decreases with 1.1-nm and 4-nm gold cores.",2
Uranyl oxo activation and functionalization by metal cation coordination.,"The oxo groups in the uranyl ion [UO(2)](2+)-one of many oxo cations formed by metals from across the periodic table-are particularly inert, which explains the dominance of this ion in the laboratory and its persistence as an environmental contaminant. In contrast, transition metal oxo (M=O) compounds can be highly reactive and carry out difficult reactions such as the oxygenation of hydrocarbons. Here we show how the sequential addition of a lithium metal base to the uranyl ion constrained in a 'Pacman' environment results in lithium coordination to the U=O bonds and single-electron reduction. This reaction depends on the nature and stoichiometry of the lithium reagent and suggests that competing reduction and C-H bond activation reactions are occurring.",2
Synergistic self-assembly of RNA and DNA molecules.,"DNA has recently been used as a programmable 'smart' building block for the assembly of a wide range of nanostructures. It remains difficult, however, to construct DNA assemblies that are also functional. Incorporating RNA is a promising strategy to circumvent this issue as RNA is structurally related to DNA but exhibits rich chemical, structural and functional diversities. However, only a few examples of rationally designed RNA structures have been reported. Herein, we describe a simple, general strategy for the de novo design of nanostructures in which the self-assembly of RNA strands is programmed by DNA strands. To demonstrate the versatility of this approach, we have designed and constructed three different RNA-DNA hybrid branched nanomotifs (tiles), which readily assemble into one-dimensional nanofibres, extended two-dimensional arrays and a discrete three-dimensional object. The current strategy could enable the integration of the precise programmability of DNA with the rich functionality of RNA.",2
An efficient organocatalytic method for constructing biaryls through aromatic C-H activation.,"The direct functionalization of C-H bonds has drawn the attention of chemists for almost a century. C-H activation has mainly been achieved through four metal-mediated pathways: oxidative addition, electrophilic substitution, sigma-bond metathesis and metal-associated carbene/nitrene/oxo insertion. However, the identification of methods that do not require transition-metal catalysts is important because methods involving such catalysts are often expensive. Another advantage would be that the requirement to remove metallic impurities from products could be avoided, an important issue in the synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds. Here, we describe the identification of a cross-coupling between aryl iodides/bromides and the C-H bonds of arenes that is mediated solely by the presence of 1,10-phenanthroline as catalyst in the presence of KOt-Bu as a base. This apparently transition-metal-free process provides a new strategy with which to achieve direct C-H functionalization.",2
Anion-switchable supramolecular gels for controlling pharmaceutical crystal growth.,"We describe the use of low-molecular-weight supramolecular gels as media for the growth of molecular crystals. Growth of a range of crystals of organic compounds, including pharmaceuticals, was achieved in bis(urea) gels. Low-molecular-weight supramolecular gelators allow access to an unlimited range of solvent systems, in contrast to conventional aqueous gels such as gelatin and agarose. A detailed study of carbamazepine crystal growth in four different bis(urea) gelators, including a metallogelator, is reported. The crystallization of a range of other drug substances, namely sparfloxacin, piroxicam, theophylline, caffeine, ibuprofen, acetaminophen (paracetamol), sulindac and indomethacin, was also achieved in supramolecular gel media without co-crystal formation. In many cases, crystals can be conveniently recovered from the gels by using supramolecular anion-triggered gel dissolution; however, crystals of substances that themselves bind to anions are dissolved by them. Overall, supramolecular gel-phase crystallization offers an extremely versatile new tool in pharmaceutical polymorph screening.",2
Coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism by chemical design.,"Although the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism in one compound is rare, some examples of such materials are known to exist. Methods to physically prepare hybrid structures with both competing phases are also known, which rely on the nanofabrication of alternating conducting layers. Chemical methods of building up hybrid materials with organic molecules (superconducting layers) and metal complexes (magnetic layers) have provided examples of superconductivity with some magnetic properties, but not fully ordered. Now, we report a chemical design strategy that uses the self assembly in solution of macromolecular nanosheet building blocks to engineer the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism in [Ni(0.66)Al(0.33)(OH)(2)][TaS(2)] at approximately 4 K. The method is further demonstrated in the isostructural [Ni(0.66)Fe(0.33)(OH)(2)][TaS(2)], in which the magnetic ordering is shifted from 4 K to 16 K.",2
"Storable, thermally activated, near-infrared chemiluminescent dyes and dye-stained microparticles for optical imaging.","Imaging techniques are a vital part of clinical diagnostics, biomedical research and nanotechnology. Optical molecular imaging makes use of relatively harmless, low-energy light and technically straightforward instrumentation. Self-illuminating, chemiluminescent systems are particularly attractive because they have inherently high signal contrast due to the lack of background emission. Currently, chemiluminescence imaging involves short-lived molecular species that are not stored but are instead generated in situ, and they typically emit visible light, which does not penetrate far through heterogeneous biological media. Here, we describe a new paradigm for optical molecular imaging using squaraine rotaxane endoperoxides, interlocked fluorescent and chemiluminescent dye molecules that have a squaraine chromophore encapsulated inside a macrocycle endoperoxide. Squaraine rotaxane endoperoxides can be stored indefinitely at temperatures below -20 degrees C, but upon warming to body temperature they undergo a unimolecular chemical reaction and emit near-infrared light that can pass through a living mouse.",2
Graphene oxide as a chemically tunable platform for optical applications.,"Chemically derived graphene oxide (GO) is an atomically thin sheet of graphite that has traditionally served as a precursor for graphene, but is increasingly attracting chemists for its own characteristics. It is covalently decorated with oxygen-containing functional groups - either on the basal plane or at the edges - so that it contains a mixture of sp(2)- and sp(3)-hybridized carbon atoms. In particular, manipulation of the size, shape and relative fraction of the sp(2)-hybridized domains of GO by reduction chemistry provides opportunities for tailoring its optoelectronic properties. For example, as-synthesized GO is insulating but controlled deoxidation leads to an electrically and optically active material that is transparent and conducting. Furthermore, in contrast to pure graphene, GO is fluorescent over a broad range of wavelengths, owing to its heterogeneous electronic structure. In this Review, we highlight the recent advances in optical properties of chemically derived GO, as well as new physical and biological applications.",2
Neglected neptunium.,"Jim Ibers talks about neptunium, an element that has remained largely unnoticed despite the flurry of activity devoted to its neighbours in the periodic table, uranium and plutonium.",2
Catalytic enantioselective syn hydration of enones in water using a DNA-based catalyst.,"The enantioselective addition of water to olefins in an aqueous environment is a common transformation in biological systems, but was beyond the ability of synthetic chemists. Here, we present the first examples of a non-enzymatic catalytic enantioselective hydration of enones, for which we used a catalyst that comprises a copper complex, based on an achiral ligand, non-covalently bound to (deoxy)ribonucleic acid, which is the only source of chirality present under the reaction conditions. The chiral beta-hydroxy ketone product was obtained in up to 82% enantiomeric excess. Deuterium-labelling studies demonstrated that the reaction is diastereospecific, with only the syn hydration product formed. So far, this diastereospecific and enantioselective reaction had no equivalent in conventional homogeneous catalysis.",2
A bidentate Lewis acid with a telluronium ion as an anion-binding site.,"The search for receptors that can selectively capture small and potentially toxic anions in protic media has sparked a renewed interest in the synthesis and anion-binding properties of polydentate Lewis acids. Seeking new paradigms to enhance the anion affinities of such systems, we synthesized a bidentate Lewis acid that contains a boryl and a telluronium moiety as Lewis acidic sites. Anion-complexation studies indicate that this telluronium borane displays a high affinity for fluoride in methanol. Structural and computational studies show that the unusual fluoride affinity of this bidentate telluronium borane can be correlated with the formation of a B-F --> Te chelate motif supported by a strong lone-pair(F) --> sigma*(Te-C) donor-acceptor interaction. These results, which illustrate the viability of heavier chalcogenium centres as anion-binding sites, allow us to introduce a novel strategy for the design of polydentate Lewis acids with enhanced anion affinities.",2
Spectroscopic visualization of sound-induced liquid vibrations using a supramolecular nanofibre.,"The question of whether sound vibration of a medium can bring about any kind of molecular or macromolecular events is a long-standing scientific controversy. Although it is known that ultrasonic vibrations with frequencies of more than 1 MHz are able to align certain macromolecules in solution, no effect has yet been reported with audible sound, the frequency of which is much lower (20-20,000 Hz). Here, we report on the design of a supramolecular nanofibre that in solution becomes preferentially aligned parallel to the propagation direction of audible sound. This phenomenon can be used to spectroscopically visualize sound-induced vibrations in liquids and may find application in a wide range of vibration sensing technologies.",2
Direct enantio-convergent transformation of racemic substrates without racemization or symmetrization.,"Asymmetric reactions that transform racemic mixtures into enantio-enriched products are in high demand, but classical kinetic resolution produces enantiopure compounds in <50% yield even in an ideal case. Many deracemization processes have thus been developed including dynamic kinetic resolution and dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation, which can provide enantio-enriched products even after complete conversion of the racemic starting materials. However, these dynamic processes require racemization or symmetrization of the substrates or intermediates. We demonstrate a direct chemical enantio-convergent transformation without a racemization or symmetrization process. Copper(I)-catalysed asymmetric allylic substitution of a racemic allylic ether afforded a single enantiomer of an alpha-chiral allylboronate with complete conversion and high enantioselectivity (up to 98% enantiomeric excess). One enantiomer of the substrate undergoes an anti-S(N)2'-type reaction whereas the other enantiomer reacts via a syn-S(N)2' pathway. The products, which cannot be prepared by dynamic procedures, have been used to construct all-carbon quaternary stereocentres.",2
Synthesis of polyynes to model the sp-carbon allotrope carbyne.,"Carbyne is an allotrope of carbon composed of sp-hybridized carbon atoms. Although its formation in the laboratory is suggested, no well-defined sample is described. Interest in carbyne and its potential properties remains intense because of, at least in part, technological breakthroughs offered by other carbon allotropes, such as fullerenes, carbon nanotubes and graphene. Here, we describe the synthesis of a series of conjugated polyynes as models for carbyne. The longest of the series consists of 44 contiguous acetylenic carbons, and it maintains a framework clearly composed of alternating single and triple bonds. Spectroscopic analyses for these polyynes reveal a distinct trend towards a finite gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital for carbyne, which is estimated to be approximately 485 nm ( approximately 2.56 eV). Even the longest members of this series of polyynes are not particularly sensitive to light, moisture or oxygen, and they can be handled and characterized under normal laboratory conditions.",2
Recognition-mediated activation of therapeutic gold nanoparticles inside living cells.,"Supramolecular chemistry provides a versatile tool for the organization of molecular systems into functional structures and the actuation of these assemblies for applications through the reversible association between complementary components. Use of this methodology in living systems, however, represents a significant challenge owing to the chemical complexity of cellular environments and lack of selectivity of conventional supramolecular interactions. Herein, we present a host-guest system featuring diaminohexane-terminated gold nanoparticles (AuNP-NH(2)) and complementary cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]). In this system, threading of CB[7] on the particle surface reduces the cytotoxicity of AuNP-NH(2) through sequestration of the particle in endosomes. Intracellular triggering of the therapeutic effect of AuNP-NH(2) was then achieved through the administration of 1-adamantylamine (ADA), removing CB[7] from the nanoparticle surface, causing the endosomal release and concomitant in situ cytotoxicity of AuNP-NH(2). This supramolecular strategy for intracellular activation provides a new tool for potential therapeutic applications.",2
The maximum pentagon separation rule provides a guideline for the structures of endohedral metallofullerenes.,"Fullerenes tend to follow the isolated pentagon rule, which requires that each of the 12 pentagons is surrounded only by hexagons. Over the past decade many violations to this rule were reported for endohedral fullerenes. Based on the ionic model M(3)N(6+)@C(2n)(6-) and the orbital energies of the isolated cages, in 2005 we formulated a molecular orbital rule to identify the most suitable hosting cages in endohedral metallofullerenes. Now, we give physical support to the orbital rule, and we propose the maximum pentagon separation rule, which can be applied to either isolated pentagon rule cages or to non-isolated pentagon rule cages with the same number of adjacent pentagon pairs. The maximum pentagon separation rule can be formulated as 'The electron transfer from the internal cluster to the fullerene host preferentially adds electrons to the pentagons; therefore, the most suitable carbon cages are those with the largest separations among the 12 pentagons'.",2
Synthesis of glycine-containing complexes in impacts of comets on early Earth.,"Delivery of prebiotic compounds to early Earth from an impacting comet is thought to be an unlikely mechanism for the origins of life because of unfavourable chemical conditions on the planet and the high heat from impact. In contrast, we find that impact-induced shock compression of cometary ices followed by expansion to ambient conditions can produce complexes that resemble the amino acid glycine. Our ab initio molecular dynamics simulations show that shock waves drive the synthesis of transient C-N bonded oligomers at extreme pressures and temperatures. On post impact quenching to lower pressures, the oligomers break apart to form a metastable glycine-containing complex. We show that impact from cometary ice could possibly yield amino acids by a synthetic route independent of the pre-existing atmospheric conditions and materials on the planet.",2
De novo synthesis of a metal-organic framework material featuring ultrahigh surface area and gas storage capacities.,"Metal-organic frameworks--a class of porous hybrid materials built from metal ions and organic bridges--have recently shown great promise for a wide variety of applications. The large choice of building blocks means that the structures and pore characteristics of the metal-organic frameworks can be tuned relatively easily. However, despite much research, it remains challenging to prepare frameworks specifically tailored for particular applications. Here, we have used computational modelling to design and predictively characterize a metal-organic framework (NU-100) with a particularly high surface area. Subsequent experimental synthesis yielded a material, matching the calculated structure, with a high BET surface area (6,143 m(2) g(-1)). Furthermore, sorption measurements revealed that the material had high storage capacities for hydrogen (164 mg g(-1)) and carbon dioxide (2,315 mg g(-1))--gases of high importance in the contexts of clean energy and climate alteration, respectively--in excellent agreement with predictions from modelling.",2
N-silyl oxyketene imines are underused yet highly versatile reagents for catalytic asymmetric synthesis.,"The reactions of acyl anion equivalents (d1 synthons) with carbonyl electrophiles allow for the construction of a wide range of molecules useful for the synthesis of biologically active compounds, natural products and chiral ligands. Despite their utility, significant challenges still exist for developing catalytic, enantioselective variants of these reactions. For example, the asymmetric benzoin process, arguably the most characteristic reaction of d synthetic equivalents, finds no general solution for reactions involving aliphatic acyl anions. In this Article, we introduce a new class of stable, isolable silyl ketene imines derived from protected cyanohydrins. These nucleophiles serve as acyl anion equivalents in Lewis base catalysed aldol addition reactions and allow for the preparation of cross-benzoin and glycolate-aldol products in high yield and with exceptional diastereo- and enantioselectivities.",2
Photoelectrochemical complexes for solar energy conversion that chemically and autonomously regenerate.,"Naturally occurring photosynthetic systems use elaborate pathways of self-repair to limit the impact of photo-damage. Here, we demonstrate a complex consisting of two recombinant proteins, phospholipids and a carbon nanotube that mimics this process. The components self-assemble into a configuration in which an array of lipid bilayers aggregate on the surface of the carbon nanotube, creating a platform for the attachment of light-converting proteins. The system can disassemble upon the addition of a surfactant and reassemble upon its removal over an indefinite number of cycles. The assembly is thermodynamically metastable and can only transition reversibly if the rate of surfactant removal exceeds a threshold value. Only in the assembled state do the complexes exhibit photoelectrochemical activity. We demonstrate a regeneration cycle that uses surfactant to switch between assembled and disassembled states, resulting in an increased photoconversion efficiency of more than 300% over 168 hours and an indefinite extension of the system lifetime.",2
A primary hydrogen-deuterium isotope effect observed at the single-molecule level.,"The covalent chemistry of reactants tethered within a single protein pore can be monitored by observing the time-dependence of ionic current flow through the pore, which responds to bond making and breaking in individual reactant molecules. Here we use this 'nanoreactor' approach to examine the reaction of a quinone with a thiol to form a substituted hydroquinone by reductive 1,4-Michael addition. Remarkably, a primary hydrogen-deuterium isotope effect is readily detected at the single-molecule level during prototropic rearrangement of an initial adduct. The observation of individual reaction intermediates allows the measurement of an isotope effect whether or not the step involved is rate limiting, which would not be the case in an ensemble measurement.",2
Porous organic molecules.,"Most synthetic materials that show molecular-scale porosity consist of one-, two- or three-dimensional networks. Porous metal-organic frameworks in particular have attracted a lot of recent attention. By contrast, discrete molecules tend to pack efficiently in the solid state, leaving as little empty space as possible, which leads to non-porous materials. This Perspective discusses recent developments with discrete organic molecules that are porous in the solid state. Such molecules, which may be either crystalline or amorphous, can be categorized as either intrinsically porous (containing permanent covalent cavities) or extrinsically porous (inefficiently packed). We focus on the possible advantages of organic molecules over inorganic or hybrid systems in terms of molecular solubility, choice of components and functionalities, and structural mobility and responsiveness in non-covalent extended solids. We also highlight the potential for 'undiscovered' porous systems among the large number of cage-like organic molecules that are already known.",2
Bridging-ligand-substitution strategy for the preparation of metal-organic polyhedra.,"Metal-organic polyhedra-discrete molecular architectures constructed through the coordination of metal ions and organic linkers-have recently attracted considerable attention due to their intriguing structures, their potential for a variety of applications and their relevance to biological self-assembly. Several synthetic routes have been investigated to prepare these complexes. However, to date, these preparative methods have typically been based on the direct assembly of metal ions and organic linkers. Although these routes are convenient, it remains difficult to find suitable reaction conditions or to control the outcome of the assembly process. Here, we demonstrate a synthetic strategy based on the substitution of bridging ligands in soluble metal-organic polyhedra. The introduction of linkers with different properties from those of the initial metal-organic polyhedra can thus lead to new metal-organic polyhedra with distinct properties (including size and shape). Furthermore, partial substitution can also occur and form mixed-ligand species that may be difficult to access by means of other approaches.",2
"Synthesis of cortistatins A, J, K and L.","The cortistatins are a recently identified class of marine natural products characterized by an unusual steroidal skeleton, which have been found to inhibit differentially the proliferation of various mammalian cells in culture by an unknown mechanism. We describe a comprehensive route for the synthesis of cortistatins from a common precursor, which in turn is assembled from two fragments of similar structural complexity. Cortistatins A and J, and for the first time K and L, have been synthesized in parallel processes from like intermediates prepared from a single compound. With the identification of facile laboratory transformations linking intermediates in the cortistatin L synthetic series with corresponding intermediates to cortistatins A and J, we have been led to speculate that somewhat related paths might occur in nature, offering potential sequencing and chemical detail for cortistatin biosynthetic pathways.",2
Enhanced electrocatalysis of the oxygen reduction reaction based on patterning of platinum surfaces with cyanide.,"The slow rate of the oxygen reduction reaction in the phosphoric acid fuel cell is the main factor limiting its wide application. Here, we present an approach that can be used for the rational design of cathode catalysts with potential use in phosphoric acid fuel cells, or in any environments containing strongly adsorbing tetrahedral anions. This approach is based on molecular patterning of platinum surfaces with cyanide adsorbates that can efficiently block the sites for adsorption of spectator anions while the oxygen reduction reaction proceeds unhindered. We also demonstrate that, depending on the supporting electrolyte anions and cations, on the same CN-covered Pt(111) surface, the oxygen reduction reaction activities can range from a 25-fold increase to a 50-fold decrease. This behaviour is discussed in the light of the role of covalent and non-covalent interactions in controlling the ensemble of platinum active sites required for high turn over rates of the oxygen reduction reaction.",2
Highly stable tetrathiafulvalene radical dimers in [3]catenanes.,"Two [3]catenane 'molecular flasks' have been designed to create stabilized, redox-controlled tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) dimers, enabling their spectrophotometric and structural properties to be probed in detail. The mechanically interlocked framework of the [3]catenanes creates the ideal arrangement and ultrahigh local concentration for the encircled TTF units to form stable dimers associated with their discrete oxidation states. These dimerization events represent an affinity umpolung, wherein the inversion in electronic affinity replaces the traditional TTF-bipyridinium interaction, which is over-ridden by stabilizing mixed-valence (TTF)2*+ and radical-cation (TTF*+)2 states inside the 'molecular flasks.' The experimental data, collected in the solid state as well as in solution under ambient conditions, together with supporting quantum mechanical calculations, are consistent with the formation of stabilized paramagnetic mixed-valence dimers, and then diamagnetic radical-cation dimers following subsequent one-electron oxidations of the [3]catenanes.",2
Synthesis of a stable adduct of dialane(4) (Al2H4) via hydrogenation of a magnesium(I) dimer.,"The desorption of dihydrogen from magnesium(II) hydride, MgH2 (containing 7.6 wt% H), is reversible. MgH2 therefore holds promise as a hydrogen storage material in devices powered by fuel cells. We believed that dimeric magnesium(I) dimers (LMgMgL, L=beta-diketiminate) could find use as soluble models to aid the study of the mechanisms and/or kinetics of the hydrogenation of magnesium and its alloys. Here, we show that LMgMgL can be readily hydrogenated to yield LMg(micro-H)2MgL by treatment with aluminium(III) hydride complexes. In one case, hydrogenation was reversed by treating LMg(micro-H)2MgL with potassium metal. The hydrogenation by-products are the first thermally stable, neutral aluminium(II) hydride complexes to be produced, one of which, [{(IPr)(H)2Al}2] (IPr=:C[{(C6H3-i-Pr(2)-2,6)NCH}2]), is an N-heterocyclic carbene adduct of the elusive parent dialane4 (Al2H4). A computational analysis of this compound is presented.",2
Reconstitution of a fungal meroterpenoid biosynthesis reveals the involvement of a novel family of terpene cyclases.,"Meroterpenoids are hybrid natural products of both terpenoid and polyketide origin. We identified a biosynthetic gene cluster that is responsible for the production of the meroterpenoid pyripyropene in the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus through reconstituted biosynthesis of up to five steps in a heterologous fungal expression system. The cluster revealed a previously unknown terpene cyclase with an unusual sequence and protein primary structure. The wide occurrence of this sequence in other meroterpenoid and indole-diterpene biosynthetic gene clusters indicates the involvement of these enzymes in the biosynthesis of various terpenoid-bearing metabolites produced by fungi and bacteria. In addition, a novel polyketide synthase that incorporated nicotinyl-CoA as the starter unit and a prenyltransferase, similar to that in ubiquinone biosynthesis, was found to be involved in the pyripyropene biosynthesis. The successful production of a pyripyropene analogue illustrates the catalytic versatility of these enzymes for the production of novel analogues with useful biological activities.",2
Charge transfer to solvent identified using dark channel fluorescence-yield L-edge spectroscopy.,"Aqueous ions are central to catalysis and biological function and play an important role in radiation biology as sources of damage-inducing electrons. Detailed knowledge of solute-solvent interactions is therefore crucial. For transition-metal ions, soft X-ray L-edge spectroscopy allows access to d orbitals, which are involved in chemical bonding. Using this technique, we show that the fluorescence-yield spectra of aqueous ionic species exhibit additional features compared with those of non-aqueous solvents. Some features dip below the fluorescence background of the solvent and this is rationalized by the competition between the fluorescence yields of the solute and solvent species, and between the solute radiative (fluorescence) and non-radiative channels; in particular, electron transfer to the water molecules. This method allows us to determine the nature, directionality and timescale of the electron transfer. Remarkably, we observe such features even for fully ligated metal atoms, which indicates a direct interaction with the water molecules.",2
Kinetic resolution of constitutional isomers controlled by selective protection inside a supramolecular nanocapsule.,"The concept of self-assembling container molecules as yocto-litre reaction flasks is gaining prominence. However, the idea of using such containers as a means of protection is not well developed. Here, we illustrate this idea in the context of kinetic resolutions. Specifically, we report on the use of a water-soluble, deep-cavity cavitand to bring about kinetic resolutions within pairs of esters that otherwise cannot be resolved because they react at very similar rates. Resolution occurs because the presence of the cavitand leads to a competitive binding equilibrium in which the stronger binder primarily resides inside the host and the weaker binding ester primarily resides in the bulk hydrolytic medium. For the two families of ester examined, the observed kinetic resolutions were highest within the optimally fitting smaller esters.",2
A series of isoreticular chiral metal-organic frameworks as a tunable platform for asymmetric catalysis.,"Metal-organic frameworks, built by bridging metal ions with organic linkers, represent a new class of porous hybrid materials with attractive tunability in compositions, structures and functions. In particular, the mild conditions typically employed for their synthesis allow for the functionalization of their building blocks, and thus the rational design of novel materials. Here we demonstrate the systematic design of eight mesoporous chiral metal-organic frameworks, with the framework formula [LCu2(solvent)2] (where L is a chiral tetracarboxylate ligand derived from 1,1'-bi-2-naphthol), that have the same structures but channels of different sizes. Chiral Lewis acid catalysts were generated by postsynthesis functionalization with Ti(OiPr)4, and the resulting materials proved to be highly active asymmetric catalysts for diethylzinc and alkynylzinc additions, which converted aromatic aldehydes into chiral secondary alcohols. The enantioselectivities of these reactions can be modified by tuning the size of the channels, which alters the diffusion rates of the organic substrates.",2
A combinatorial approach to the identification of self-assembled ligands for rhodium-catalysed asymmetric hydrogenation.,"An effective and efficient means to catalyst discovery is the high-throughput screening of catalyst libraries. However, the current status of this approach suffers from a number of limitations, namely access to structurally diverse and meaningful ligand libraries and the enormous effort required for massive parallel screening of the resulting catalysts. We report an integrated solution to these drawbacks, which combines a diversity-oriented ligand synthesis, a catalyst-generation process driven by self-assembly and, finally, a combinatorial iterative library deconvolution strategy to identify the optimal catalyst. As a test case, rhodium-catalysed asymmetric hydrogenation was studied and, from a library of 120 self-assembling catalysts, highly enantioselective catalysts for the asymmetric hydrogenation of different olefinic substrates were identified within 17 experiments. Comparison of the results of the iterative library deconvolution strategy with those of the classic parallel-screening process confirmed the validity of this approach.",2
Efficient water oxidation at carbon nanotube-polyoxometalate electrocatalytic interfaces.,"Water is the renewable, bulk chemical that nature uses to enable carbohydrate production from carbon dioxide. The dream goal of energy research is to transpose this incredibly efficient process and make an artificial device whereby the catalytic splitting of water is finalized to give a continuous production of oxygen and hydrogen. Success in this task would guarantee the generation of hydrogen as a carbon-free fuel to satisfy our energy demands at no environmental cost. Here we show that very efficient and stable nanostructured, oxygen-evolving anodes are obtained by the assembly of an oxygen-evolving polyoxometalate cluster (a totally inorganic ruthenium catalyst) with a conducting bed of multiwalled carbon nanotubes. Our bioinspired electrode addresses the one major challenge of artificial photosynthesis, namely efficient water oxidation, which brings us closer to being able to power the planet with carbon-free fuels.",2
Organic structure determination using atomic-resolution scanning probe microscopy.,"Nature offers a huge and only partially explored variety of small molecules with potential pharmaceutical applications. Commonly used characterization methods for natural products include spectroscopic techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. In some cases, however, these techniques do not succeed in the unambiguous determination of the chemical structure of unknown compounds. To validate the usefulness of scanning probe microscopy as an adjunct to the other tools available for organic structure analysis, we used the natural product cephalandole A, which had previously been misassigned, and later corrected. Our results, corroborated by density functional theory, demonstrate that direct imaging of an organic compound with atomic-resolution force microscopy facilitates the accurate determination of its chemical structure. We anticipate that our method may be developed further towards molecular imaging with chemical sensitivity, and will become generally useful in solving certain classes of natural product structures.",2
'Green' reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization.,"Reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization has revolutionized the field of polymer synthesis as a versatile tool for the production of complex polymeric architectures. As for all chemical processes, research and development in RAFT have to focus on the design and application of chemical products and processes that have a minimum environmental impact, and follow the principles of 'green' chemistry. In this Review, we summarize some of the green features of the RAFT process, and review the recent advances in the production of degradable polymers obtained from RAFT polymerization. Its use to modify biodegradable and renewable inorganic and organic materials to yield more functional products with enhanced applications is also covered. RAFT is a promising candidate for answering both the increasing need of modern society to employ highly functional polymeric materials and the global requirements for developing sustainable chemicals and processes.",2
Behind platinum's sparkle.,"As a rare and precious metal that is also resistant to wear and tarnish, platinum is known to be particularly well-suited to jewellery. Vivian Yam reflects on how, beyond its prestigious image, platinum has also found its way into a variety of fields ranging from the petrochemical to the pharmaceutical industry.",2
Two- and three-dimensional extended solids and metallization of compressed XeF2.,"The application of pressure, internal or external, transforms molecular solids into extended solids with more itinerant electrons to soften repulsive interatomic interactions in a tight space. Examples include insulator-to-metal transitions in O(2), Xe and I(2), as well as molecular-to-non-molecular transitions in CO(2) and N(2). Here, we present new discoveries of novel two- and three-dimensional extended non-molecular phases of solid XeF(2) and their metallization. At approximately 50 GPa, the transparent linear insulating XeF(2) transforms into a reddish two-dimensional graphite-like hexagonal layered structure of semiconducting XeF(4). Above 70 GPa, it further transforms into a black three-dimensional fluorite-like structure of the first observed metallic XeF(8) polyhedron. These simultaneously occurring molecular-to-non-molecular and insulator-to-metal transitions of XeF(2) arise from the pressure-induced delocalization of non-bonded lone-pair electrons to sp(3)d(2) hybridization in two-dimensional XeF(4) and to p(3)d(5) in three-dimensional XeF(8) through the chemical bonding of all eight valence electrons in Xe and, thereby, fulfilling the octet rule at high pressures.",2
Networked molecular cages as crystalline sponges for fullerenes and other guests.,"Many molecular cages selectively bind guests in solution, but in the solid state close packing often prevents guest entry, which renders the cages inactive. We envisioned that coordination networks constructed from well-known molecular cages could transfer the richness of solution-state host-guest chemistry into the solid state. We report a crystalline coordination network generated from an infinite array of octahedral M(6)L(4) cage subunits (M = metal, L = ligand). This coordination network is a 'crystalline molecular sponge' engineered on the molecular level and retains similar guest recognition properties to those found in solution. The network crystallinity is robust and thus X-ray diffraction analysis can be used to unambiguously observe single-crystal to single-crystal guest inclusion. The void spaces define alternating M(12)L(8) and M(12)L(24) cuboctahedral molecular cages and these large cages absorb up to 35 weight per cent of C(60) or C(70) by simply soaking the crystals in a toluene solution of the fullerene. When the crystals are immersed in fullerene mixtures, C(70) is preferentially absorbed.",2
A polyhedron made of tRNAs.,"Supramolecular assembly is a powerful strategy used by nature to build nanoscale architectures with predefined sizes and shapes. With synthetic systems, however, numerous challenges remain to be solved before precise control over the synthesis, folding and assembly of rationally designed three-dimensional nano-objects made of RNA can be achieved. Here, using the transfer RNA molecule as a structural building block, we report the design, efficient synthesis and structural characterization of stable, modular three-dimensional particles adopting the polyhedral geometry of a non-uniform square antiprism. The spatial control within the final architecture allows the precise positioning and encapsulation of proteins. This work demonstrates that a remarkable degree of structural control can be achieved with RNA structural motifs for the construction of thermostable three-dimensional nano-architectures that do not rely on helix bundles or tensegrity. RNA three-dimensional particles could potentially be used as carriers or scaffolds in nanomedicine and synthetic biology.",2
Cooperative catalysis by carbenes and Lewis acids in a highly stereoselective route to gamma-lactams.,"Enzymes are a continuing source of inspiration for the design of new chemical reactions that proceed with efficiency, high selectivity and minimal waste. In many biochemical processes, different catalytic species, such as Lewis acids and bases, are involved in precisely orchestrated interactions to activate reactants simultaneously or sequentially. This type of 'cooperative catalysis', in which two or more catalytic cycles operate concurrently to achieve one overall transformation, has great potential in enhancing known reactivity and driving the development of new chemical reactions with high value. In this disclosure, a cooperative N-heterocyclic carbene/Lewis acid catalytic system promotes the addition of homoenolate equivalents to hydrazones, generating highly substituted gamma-lactams in moderate to good yields and with high levels of diastereo- and enantioselectivity.",2
Raising the cycling stability of aqueous lithium-ion batteries by eliminating oxygen in the electrolyte.,"Aqueous lithium-ion batteries may solve the safety problem associated with lithium-ion batteries that use highly toxic and flammable organic solvents, and the poor cycling life associated with commercialized aqueous rechargeable batteries such as lead-acid and nickel-metal hydride systems. But all reported aqueous lithium-ion battery systems have shown poor stability: the capacity retention is typically less than 50% after 100 cycles. Here, the stability of electrode materials in an aqueous electrolyte was extensively analysed. The negative electrodes of aqueous lithium-ion batteries in a discharged state can react with water and oxygen, resulting in capacity fading upon cycling. By eliminating oxygen, adjusting the pH values of the electrolyte and using carbon-coated electrode materials, LiTi(2)(PO(4))(3)/Li(2)SO(4)/LiFePO(4) aqueous lithium-ion batteries exhibited excellent stability with capacity retention over 90% after 1,000 cycles when being fully charged/discharged in 10 minutes and 85% after 50 cycles even at a very low current rate of 8 hours for a full charge/discharge offering an energy storage system with high safety, low cost, long cycling life and appropriate energy density.",2
Crystal structure of a metal ion-bound oxoiron(IV) complex and implications for biological electron transfer.,"Critical biological electron-transfer processes involving high-valent oxometal chemistry occur widely, for example in haem proteins [oxoiron(IV); Fe(IV)(O)] and in photosystem II. Photosystem II involves Ca(2+) as well as high-valent oxomanganese cluster species. However, there is no example of an interaction between metal ions and oxoiron(IV) complexes. Here, we report new findings concerning the binding of the redox-inactive metal ions Ca(2+) and Sc(3+) to a non-haem oxoiron(IV) complex, [(TMC)Fe(IV)(O)](2+) (TMC = 1,4,8,11-tetramethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane). As determined by X-ray diffraction analysis, an oxo-Sc(3+) interaction leads to a structural distortion of the oxoiron(IV) moiety. More importantly, this interaction facilitates a two-electron reduction by ferrocene, whereas only a one-electron reduction process occurs without the metal ions. This control of redox behaviour provides valuable mechanistic insights into oxometal redox chemistry, and suggests a possible key role that an auxiliary Lewis acid metal ion could play in nature, as in photosystem II.",2
Triply interlocked covalent organic cages.,"Interlocked molecules comprise two or more separate components that are joined by 'mechanical' rather than covalent bonds. In other words, these molecular assemblies cannot be dissociated without the cleavage of one or more chemical bonds. Although recent progress has enabled the preparation of such topologies through coordination or templating interactions, three-dimensional interlocked covalent architectures remain difficult to prepare. Here, we present a template-free one-pot synthesis of triply interlocked organic cages. These 20-component dimers consist of two tetrahedral monomeric cages each built from four nodes and six linkers. The monomers exhibit axial chirality, which is recognized by their partner cage during the template-free interlocking assembly process. The dimeric cages also include two well-defined cavities per assembly, which for one of the systems studied led to the formation of a supramolecular host-guest chain. These interlocked organic molecules may prove useful as part of a toolkit for the modular construction of complex porous solids and other supramolecular assemblies.",2
Electrically induced bonding of DNA to gold.,"The development of single-molecule techniques has afforded many new methods for the observation and assembly of supramolecular structures and biomolecular networks. We previously reported a method, known as the single-molecule cut-and-paste approach, to pick up and deposit individual DNA strands on a surface. This, however, required pre-functionalization of the surface with DNA strands complementary to those that were to be picked up and then deposited. Here we show that single molecules of double-stranded DNA, bound to the tip of an atomic force microscope, can be deposited on a bare gold electrode using an electrical trigger (surface potential cycling). The interactions between the DNA and the electrode were investigated and we found that double-stranded DNA chemisorbs to the gold electrode exclusively at its end through primary amine groups. We corroborated this finding in experiments in which only a single adenosine nucleotide on a polyethylene glycol spacer was 'electrosorbed' to the gold electrode.",2
Molecules containing rare-earth atoms solely bonded by transition metals.,"Although metal-metal bonding is important in the chemistry of both solid-state intermetallic compounds and molecular species, the study of this bonding is limited by the compounds available and it is rarely possible to identify connections between these two areas. In this study, molecular intermetalloids [Ln(ReCp(2))(3)] (Ln = Sm, Lu and La) have been synthesized that contain lanthanoid metals bound only to transition metals. Although they are highly reactive species, such lanthanoid-core transition-metal-shell compounds can be stable in solution. They mimic the bonding situation of intermetallic compounds, as revealed by a direct comparison of molecular and solid state lanthanoid-transition metal bonding.",2
Highly enantioselective synthesis and cellular evaluation of spirooxindoles inspired by natural products.,"In biology-oriented synthesis the underlying scaffold classes of natural products selected in evolution are used to define biologically relevant starting points in chemical structure space for the synthesis of compound collections with focused structural diversity. Here we describe a highly enantioselective synthesis of natural-product-inspired 3,3'-pyrrolidinyl spirooxindoles--which contain an all-carbon quaternary centre and three tertiary stereocentres. This synthesis takes place by means of an asymmetric Lewis acid-catalysed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of an azomethine ylide to a substituted 3-methylene-2-oxindole using 1-3 mol% of a chiral catalyst formed from a N,P-ferrocenyl ligand and CuPF(6)(CH(3)CN)(4). Cellular evaluation has identified a molecule that arrests mitosis, induces multiple microtubule organizing centres and multipolar spindles, causes chromosome congression defects during mitosis and inhibits tubulin regrowth in cells. Our findings support the concept that compound collections based on natural-product-inspired scaffolds constructed with complex stereochemistry will be a rich source of compounds with diverse bioactivity.",2
The role of steps in surface catalysis and reaction oscillations.,"Atomic steps at the surface of a catalyst play an important role in heterogeneous catalysis, for example as special sites with increased catalytic activity. Exposure to reactants can cause entirely new structures to form at the catalyst surface, and these may dramatically influence the reaction by 'poisoning' it or by acting as the catalytically active phase. For example, thin metal oxide films have been identified as highly active structures that form spontaneously on metal surfaces during the catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide. Here, we present operando X-ray diffraction experiments on a palladium surface during this reaction. They reveal that a high density of steps strongly alters the stability of the thin, catalytically active palladium oxide film. We show that stabilization of the metal, caused by the steps and consequent destabilization of the oxide, is at the heart of the well-known reaction rate oscillations exhibited during CO oxidation at atmospheric pressure.",2
Uranium azide photolysis results in C-H bond activation and provides evidence for a terminal uranium nitride.,"Uranium nitride [U[triple bond]N](x) is an alternative nuclear fuel that has great potential in the expanding future of nuclear power; however, very little is known about the U[triple bond]N functionality. We show, for the first time, that a terminal uranium nitride complex can be generated by photolysis of an azide (U-N=N=N) precursor. The transient U[triple bond]N fragment is reactive and undergoes insertion into a ligand C-H bond to generate new N-H and N-C bonds. The mechanism of this unprecedented reaction has been evaluated through computational and spectroscopic studies, which reveal that the photochemical azide activation pathway can be shut down through coordination of the terminal azide ligand to the Lewis acid B(C(6)F(5))(3). These studies demonstrate that photochemistry can be a powerful tool for inducing redox transformations for organometallic actinide complexes, and that the terminal uranium nitride fragment is reactive, cleaving strong C-H bonds.",2
Heterogeneous oxidation of atmospheric aerosol particles by gas-phase radicals.,"Atmospheric aerosol particles play pivotal roles in climate and air quality. Just as chemically reduced gases experience oxidation in the atmosphere, it is now apparent that solid and liquid atmospheric particulates are also subject to similar oxidative processes. The most reactive atmospheric gas-phase radicals, in particular the hydroxyl radical, readily promote such chemistry through surficial interactions. This Review looks at progress made in this field, discussing the radical-initiated heterogeneous oxidation of organic and inorganic constituents of atmospheric aerosols. We focus on the kinetics and reaction mechanisms of such processes as well as how they can affect the physico-chemical properties of particles, such as their composition, size, density and hygroscopicity. Potential impacts on the atmosphere include the release of chemically reactive gases such as halogens, aldehydes and organic acids, reactive loss of particle-borne molecular tracer and toxic species, and enhanced hygroscopic properties of aerosols that may improve their ability to form cloud droplets.",2
Uncertainty in chemistry.,"It might come as a disappointment to some chemists, but just as there are uncertainties in physics and mathematics, there are some chemistry questions we may never know the answer to either, suggests Fredric M. Menger.",2

"Geometric and electronic structure and reactivity of a mononuclear ""side-on"" nickel(III)-peroxo complex.","Metal-dioxygen adducts, such as metal-superoxo and -peroxo species, are key intermediates often detected in the catalytic cycles of dioxygen activation by metalloenzymes and biomimetic compounds. The synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of an end-on nickel(II)-superoxo complex with a 14-membered macrocyclic ligand was reported previously. Here we report the isolation, spectroscopic characterization, and high-resolution crystal structure of a mononuclear side-on nickel(III)-peroxo complex with a 12-membered macrocyclic ligand, [Ni(12-TMC)(O(2))](+) (1) (12-TMC = 1,4,7,10-tetramethyl-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane). Different from the end-on Ni(II)-superoxo complex, the Ni(III)-peroxo complex is not reactive in electrophilic reactions, but is capable of conducting nucleophilic reactions. The Ni(III)-peroxo complex transfers the bound dioxygen to manganese(II) complexes, thus affording the corresponding nickel(II) and manganese(III)-peroxo complexes. The present results demonstrate the significance of supporting ligands in tuning the geometric and electronic structures and reactivities of metal-O(2) intermediates that have been shown to have biological as well as synthetic usefulness in biomimetic reactions.",2
Amyloid-beta protein oligomerization and the importance of tetramers and dodecamers in the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease.,"In recent years, small protein oligomers have been implicated in the aetiology of a number of important amyloid diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. As a consequence, research efforts are being directed away from traditional targets, such as amyloid plaques, and towards characterization of early oligomer states. Here we present a new analysis method, ion mobility coupled with mass spectrometry, for this challenging problem, which allows determination of in vitro oligomer distributions and the qualitative structure of each of the aggregates. We applied these methods to a number of the amyloid-beta protein isoforms of Abeta40 and Abeta42 and showed that their oligomer-size distributions are very different. Our results are consistent with previous observations that Abeta40 and Abeta42 self-assemble via different pathways and provide a candidate in the Abeta42 dodecamer for the primary toxic species in Alzheimer's disease.",2
A palladium-catalysed enolate alkylation cascade for the formation of adjacent quaternary and tertiary stereocentres.,"The catalytic enantioselective synthesis of densely functionalised organic molecules containing all-carbon quaternary stereocentres is a challenge to modern chemical methodology research. The catalytically controlled asymmetric alpha-alkylation of ketones represents another difficult task and has been of major interest to our and other research groups in the past. We now report a palladium-catalyzed enantioselective process that addresses both problems at once and allows the installation of vicinal all-carbon quaternary and tertiary stereocentres at the alpha-carbon of a ketone in a single step. This multiple bond forming process is carried out on readily available beta-ketoester starting materials and proceeds via conjugate addition of an in situ-generated palladium enolate to activated Michael acceptors. In other words, the CO(2)-moiety of the substrate is displaced by a C-C fragment in an asymmetric cut-and-paste reaction. The products are obtained in high yield, diastereomeric ratio, and enantiomeric excess.",2
Photoreactivity examined through incorporation in metal-organic frameworks.,"Metal-organic frameworks, typically built by bridging metal centres with organic linkers, have recently shown great promise for a wide variety of applications, including gas separation and drug delivery. Here, we have used them as a scaffold to probe the photophysical and photochemical properties of metal-diimine complexes. We have immobilized a M(diimine)(CO)(3)X moiety (where M is Re or Mn, and X can be Cl or Br) by using it as the linker of a metal-organic framework, with Mn(II) cations acting as nodes. Time-resolved infrared measurements showed that the initial excited state formed on ultraviolet irradiation of the rhenium-based metal-organic framework was characteristic of an intra-ligand state, rather than the metal-ligand charge transfer state typically observed in solution, and revealed that the metal-diimine complexes rearranged from the fac- to mer-isomer in the crystalline solid state. This approach also enabled characterization of the photoactivity of Mn(diimine)(CO)(3)Br by single-crystal X-ray diffraction.",2
Cascading transformations within a dynamic self-assembled system.,"Molecular subcomponents such as phosphate groups are often passed between biomolecules during complex signalling cascades, the flow of which define the motion of the machinery of life. Here, we show how an abiological system consisting of organic subcomponents knitted together by metal-ion coordination can respond to simple signals in complex ways. A Cu(I)(3) helicate transformed into its Zn(II)(2)Cu(I) analogue following the addition of zinc(II), and the ejected copper(I) went on to induce the self-assembly of a Cu(I)(2) helicate from other free subcomponents present in solution. The addition of an additional subcomponent, 8-aminoquinoline, resulted in the formation of a third, more stable Cu(I)(3) helicate, requiring the destruction of both the Zn(II)(2)Cu(I) and Cu(I)(2) helicates to scavenge sufficient Cu(I) for the new structure. This system thus demonstrates two examples in which the application of one signal provokes two distinct responses involving the creation or destruction of complex assemblies as the system seeks thermodynamic equilibrium following perturbation.",2
A layered ionic crystal of polar Li@C(60) superatoms.,"If the physical properties of C(60) fullerene molecules can be controlled in C(60) products already in use in various applications, the potential for industrial development will be significant. Encapsulation of a metal atom in the C(60) fullerene molecule is a promising way to control its physical properties. However, the isolation of C(60)-based metallofullerenes has been difficult due to their insolubility. Here, we report the complete isolation and determination of the molecular and crystal structure of polar cationic Li@C(60) metallofullerene. The physical and chemical properties of Li@C(60) cation are compared with those of pristine C(60). It is found that the lithium cation is located at off-centre positions in the C(60)-I(h) cage interior and that the [Li(+)@C(60)] salt has a unique two-dimensional structure. The present method of purification and crystallization of C(60)-based metallofullerenes provides a new C(60) fullerene material that contains a metal atom.",2
Lewis acid-catalysed formation of two-dimensional phthalocyanine covalent organic frameworks.,"Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer a new strategy for assembling organic semiconductors into robust networks with atomic precision and long-range order. General methods for COF synthesis will allow complex building blocks to be incorporated into these emerging materials. Here we report a new Lewis acid-catalysed protocol to form boronate esters directly from protected catechols and arylboronic acids. This transformation also provides crystalline boronate ester-linked COFs from protected polyfunctional catechols and bis(boronic acids). Using this method, we prepared a new COF that features a square lattice composed of phthalocyanine macrocycles joined by phenylene bis(boronic acid) linkers. The phthalocyanines stack in an eclipsed fashion within the COF to form 2.3 nm pores that run parallel to the stacked chromophores. The material's broad absorbance over the solar spectrum, potential for efficient charge transport through the stacked phthalocyanines, good thermal stability and the modular nature of COF synthesis, show strong promise for applications in organic photovoltaic devices.",2
Computational evidence that hyperconjugative interactions are not responsible for the anomeric effect.,"The 'anomeric effect' is the thermodynamic preference for polar substituents to occupy the axial position in the chair conformation of various heterocycles. The most common explanation given for this effect at present is hyperconjugation from the lone pairs on the ring heteroatom to the antibonding orbital between the anomeric carbon and its linking substituent. Alternatively, the anomeric effect could be explained by intramolecular electrostatic interactions between local dipoles. Few models can provide convincing data for either theory at the quantum-mechanical level. Now, using the extended block-localized wavefunction method, which is the simplest form of valence bond theory, we have evaluated the degree of hyperconjugation in various compounds that display the anomeric effect and have interpreted their conformational preferences in terms of steric, hyperconjugation and dispersion effects. The results provide strong evidence that hyperconjugative interactions are not responsible for the anomeric effect and that it is better interpreted in terms of electrostatic interactions.",2
Etching and narrowing of graphene from the edges.,"Large-scale graphene electronics requires lithographic patterning of narrow graphene nanoribbons for device integration. However, conventional lithography can only reliably pattern approximately 20-nm-wide GNR arrays limited by lithography resolution, while sub-5-nm GNRs are desirable for high on/off ratio field-effect transistors at room temperature. Here, we devised a gas phase chemical approach to etch graphene from the edges without damaging its basal plane. The reaction involved high temperature oxidation of graphene in a slightly reducing environment in the presence of ammonia to afford controlled etch rate (less than or approximately 1 nm min(-1)). We fabricated approximately 20-30-nm-wide graphene nanoribbon arrays lithographically, and used the gas phase etching chemistry to narrow the ribbons down to <10 nm. For the first time, a high on/off ratio up to approximately 10(4) was achieved at room temperature for field-effect transistors built with sub-5-nm-wide graphene nanoribbon semiconductors derived from lithographic patterning and narrowing. Our controlled etching method opens up a chemical way to control the size of various graphene nano-structures beyond the capability of top-down lithography.",2
Sequence-selective assembly of tweezer molecules on linear templates enables frameshift-reading of sequence information.,"Information storage and processing is carried out at the level of individual macromolecules in biological systems, but there is no reason, in principle, why synthetic copolymers should not be used for the same purpose. Previous work has suggested that monomer sequence information in chain-folding synthetic copolyimides can be recognized by tweezer-type molecules binding to adjacent triplet sequences, and we show here that different tweezer molecules can show different sequence selectivities. This work, based on (1)H NMR spectroscopy in solution and on single-crystal X-ray analysis of tweezer-oligomer complexes in the solid state, provides the first clear-cut demonstration of polyimide chain-folding and adjacent-tweezer binding. It also reveals a new and entirely unexpected mechanism for sequence recognition, which, by analogy with a related process in biomolecular information processing, may be termed 'frameshift-reading'. The ability of one particular tweezer molecule to detect, with exceptionally high sensitivity, long-range sequence information in chain-folding aromatic copolyimides is readily explained by this novel process.",2
Singlet fission in pentacene through multi-exciton quantum states.,"Multi-exciton generation-the creation of multiple charge carrier pairs from a single photon-has been reported for several materials and may dramatically increase solar cell efficiency. Singlet fission, its molecular analogue, may govern multi-exciton generation in a variety of materials, but a fundamental mechanism for singlet fission has yet to be described. Here, we use sophisticated ab initio calculations to show that singlet fission in pentacene proceeds through rapid internal conversion of the photoexcited state into a dark state of multi-exciton character that efficiently splits into two triplets. We show that singlet fission to produce a pair of triplet excitons must involve an intermediate state that (i) has a multi-exciton character, (ii) is energetically accessible from the optically allowed excited state, and (iii) efficiently dissociates into multiple electron-hole pairs. The rational design of photovoltaic materials that make use of singlet fission will require similar ab initio analysis of multi-exciton states such as the dark state studied here.",2
Isolation of a radical dianion of nitrogen oxide (NO)(2-).,"Nitric oxide, NO, the diatomic hybrid of dinitrogen and dioxygen, has extensive biochemical, industrial and atmospheric chemistry. The unpaired electron on NO makes it highly reactive and its facile oxidation and reduction to make (NO)(1+) and (NO)(1-), respectively, have been heavily studied. Now the (NO)(2-) dianion has been isolated for the first time from the two-electron reduction of NO by the recently discovered (N(2))(3-) yttrium complex {[(Me(3)Si)(2)N](2)(THF)Y}(2)(micro(3)-eta(2):eta(2):eta(2)-N(2))K. NO reacts with this complex to form {[(Me(3)Si)(2)N](2)(THF)Y}(2)(micro-eta(2):eta(2)-NO), a paramagnetic complex that has an electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum definitive for the (NO)(2-) radical. Density functional theory reveals that a metal d(pi) to ligand pi* interaction is crucial for the stability of this complex, which reacts with additional NO to generate the diamagnetic (ON=NO)(2-) product, {[(Me(3)Si)(2)N](2)Y}(4)(micro(3)-ON=NO)(2)(THF)(2).",2
Convergent and stereospecific synthesis of complex skipped polyenes and polyunsaturated fatty acids.,"Skipped polyenes (that is, 1,4-dienes and higher homologues) are stereodefined components of a vast array of biologically important natural products, including polyunsaturated fatty acids. Although widespread in nature, these architectures are generally considered to represent significant barriers to efficient chemical synthesis. Partial reduction of skipped poly-ynes provides a pathway to a subset of such structures, but general chemical methods for the preparation of skipped polyenes that contain varied stereochemistries and substitution patterns are lacking. Here, we describe a metal-promoted reductive cross-coupling reaction between vinylcyclopropanes and alkynes (or vinylsilanes) that provides stereoselective access to a diverse array of skipped polyenes through a process that establishes one C-C bond, generates up to three stereodefined alkenes, and can be used to introduce stereogenic centres at the central positions of the skipped polyene motif. We also demonstrate the significance of the present bond construction by preparing substituted and stereodefined polyunsaturated synthetic fatty acids.",2
Selective sorption of oxygen and nitric oxide by an electron-donating flexible porous coordination polymer.,"Porous coordination polymers are materials formed from metal ions that are bridged together by organic linkers and that can combine two seemingly contradictory properties-crystallinity and flexibility. Porous coordination polymers can therefore create highly regular yet dynamic nanoporous domains that are particularly promising for sorption applications. Here, we describe the effective selective sorption of dioxygen and nitric oxide by a structurally and electronically dynamic porous coordination polymer built from zinc centres and tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) as a linker. In contrast to a variety of other gas molecules (C(2)H(2), Ar, CO(2), N(2) and CO), O(2) and NO are accommodated in its pores. This unprecedented preference arises from the concerted effect of the charge-transfer interaction between TCNQ and these guests, and the switchable gate opening and closing of the pores of the framework. This system provides further insight into the efficient recognition of small gas molecules.",2
Experimental probing of conical intersection dynamics in the photodissociation of thioanisole.,"Chemical reactions that occur in the ground electronic state are described well by invoking the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, which allows their development to be rationalized by nuclear rearrangements that smoothly traverse an adiabatic potential energy surface. The situation is different, however, for reactions in electronically excited states, where non-adiabatic transitions occur between adiabatic surfaces. The conical intersection, in which two adiabatic surfaces touch, is accepted widely as the dynamic funnel for efficient non-adiabatic transitions, but its direct experimental probing is rare. Here, we investigate the photodissociation of thioanisole and observe a striking dependence of the relative yields of two reaction channels on the photoexcitation energy as indicated by a dynamic resonance in the product branching ratio. This results from the interference of two different adiabatic states that are in close proximity in the region of a conical intersection. The location of the observed resonance on the multidimensional potential energy surface thus reveals the nuclear configuration of the conical intersection and its dynamic role in the non-adiabatic transition.",2
Reversible dioxygen binding in solvent-free liquid myoglobin.,"The ensemble of forces that stabilize protein structure and facilitate biological function are intimately linked with the ubiquitous aqueous environment of living systems. As a consequence, biomolecular activity is highly sensitive to the interplay of solvent-protein interactions, and deviation from the native conditions, for example by exposure to increased thermal energy or severe dehydration, results in denaturation and subsequent loss of function. Although certain enzymes can be extracted into non-aqueous solvents without significant loss of activity, there are no known examples of solvent-less (molten) liquids of functional metalloproteins. Here we describe the synthesis and properties of room-temperature solvent-free myoglobin liquids with near-native structure and reversible dioxygen binding ability equivalent to the haem protein under physiological conditions. The realization of room-temperature solvent-free myoglobin liquids with retained function presents novel challenges to existing theories on the role of solvent molecules in structural biology, and should offer new opportunities in protein-based nanoscience and bionanotechnology.",2
Supramolecular catalysis beyond enzyme mimics.,"Supramolecular catalysis - the assembly of catalyst species by harnessing multiple weak intramolecular interactions - has, until recently, been dominated by enzyme-inspired approaches. Such approaches often attempt to create an enzyme-like 'active site' and have concentrated on reactions similar to those catalysed by enzymes themselves. Here, we discuss the application of supramolecular assembly to the more traditional transition metal catalysis and to small-molecule organocatalysis. The modularity of self-assembled multicomponent catalysts means that a relatively small pool of catalyst components can provide rapid access to a large number of catalysts that can be evaluated for industrially relevant reactions. In addition, we discuss how catalyst-substrate interactions can be tailored to direct substrates along particular reaction paths and selectivities.",2
Watching conformational- and photo-dynamics of single fluorescent proteins in solution.,"Observing the dynamics of single biomolecules over prolonged time periods is difficult to achieve without significantly altering the molecule through immobilization. It can, however, be accomplished using the Anti-Brownian ELectrokinetic (ABEL) Trap, which allows extended investigation of solution-phase biomolecules - without immobilization -through real-time electrokinetic feedback. Here we apply the ABEL trap to study an important photosynthetic antenna protein, Allophycocyanin (APC). The technique allows the observation of single molecules of solution-phase APC for more than one second. We observe a complex relationship between fluorescence intensity and lifetime that cannot be explained by simple static kinetic models. Light-induced conformational changes are shown to occur and evidence is obtained for fluctuations in the spontaneous emission lifetime, which is typically assumed to be constant. Our methods provide a new window into the dynamics of fluorescent proteins and the observations are relevant for the interpretation of in vivo single-molecule imaging experiments, bacterial photosynthetic regulation, and biomaterials for solar energy harvesting.",2
"Hydroacylation of alpha,beta-unsaturated esters via aerobic C-H activation.","The development of methods for carbon-carbon bond formation under benign conditions is an ongoing challenge for the synthetic chemist. In recent years there has been considerable interest in using selective C-H activation as a direct route for generating reactive intermediates. In this article, we describe the use of aldehyde auto-oxidation as a simple, clean and effective method for C-H activation, resulting in the generation of an acyl radical. This acyl radical can be used for carbon-carbon bond formation and herein we describe the application of this method for the hydroacylation of alpha,beta-unsaturated esters without the requirement of additional catalysts or reagents. This methodology generates unsymmetrical ketones, which have been shown to have broad use in organic synthesis.",2
Cleave and capture chemistry illustrated through bimetallic-induced fragmentation of tetrahydrofuran.,"The cleavage of ethers is commonly encountered in organometallic chemistry, although rarely studied in the context of new, emerging bimetallic reagents. Recently, it was reported that a bimetallic sodium-zinc base can deprotonate cyclic tetrahydrofuran under mild conditions without opening its heterocyclic (OC(4)) ring. In marked contrast to this synergic sedation, herein we show that switching to the more reactive sodium-magnesium or sodium-manganese bases promotes cleavage of at least six bonds in tetrahydrofuran, but uniquely the ring fragments are captured in separate crystalline complexes. Oxide fragments occupy guest positions in bimetallic, inverse crown ethers and C(4) fragments ultimately appear in bimetallated butadiene molecules. These results demonstrate the special synergic reactivity that can be executed by bimetallic reagents, which include the ability to capture and control, and thereby study, reactive fragments from sensitive substrates.",2
Structural evolution during the reduction of chemically derived graphene oxide.,"The excellent electrical, optical and mechanical properties of graphene have driven the search to find methods for its large-scale production, but established procedures (such as mechanical exfoliation or chemical vapour deposition) are not ideal for the manufacture of processable graphene sheets. An alternative method is the reduction of graphene oxide, a material that shares the same atomically thin structural framework as graphene, but bears oxygen-containing functional groups. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations to study the atomistic structure of progressively reduced graphene oxide. The chemical changes of oxygen-containing functional groups on the annealing of graphene oxide are elucidated and the simulations reveal the formation of highly stable carbonyl and ether groups that hinder its complete reduction to graphene. The calculations are supported by infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. Finally, more effective reduction treatments to improve the reduction of graphene oxide are proposed.",2
From silicon(II)-based dioxygen activation to adducts of elusive dioxasiliranes and sila-ureas stable at room temperature.,"Dioxygen activation for the subsequent oxygenation of organic substrates that involves cheap and environmentally friendly chemical elements is at the cutting edge of chemical research. As silicon is a non-toxic and highly oxophilic element, the use of silylenes could be attractive for facile dioxygen activation to give dioxasiliranes with a SiO(2)-peroxo ring as versatile oxo-transfer reagents. However, the latter are elusive species, and have been generated and studied only in argon matrices at -233 degrees C. Recently, it was demonstrated that unstable silicon species can be isolated by applying the concept of donor-acceptor stabilization. We now report the first synthesis and crystallographic characterization of dioxasiliranes stabilized by N-heterocyclic carbenes that feature a three-membered SiO(2)-peroxide ring, isolable at room temperature. Unexpectedly, these can undergo internal oxygen transfer in toluene solution at ambient temperature to give a unique complex of cyclic sila-urea with C=O --> Si=O interaction and the shortest Si=O double-bond distance reported to date.",2
Mechanistic insights into the ruthenium-catalysed diene ring-closing metathesis reaction.,"Ruthenium-catalysed ring-closing metathesis (RCM) is a powerful technique for the preparation of medium-to-large rings in organic synthesis, but the details of the intimate mechanism are obscure. The dynamic behaviour of an RCM-relevant ruthenacyclobutane complex and its reactivity with ethene were studied using low-temperature NMR spectroscopy to illuminate the mechanism of this widely used reaction. These kinetic and thermodynamic experiments allowed for mapping the energy surface of the key steps in the RCM reaction as mediated by Grubbs-type catalysts for alkene metathesis. The highest barrier along the RCM path is only 65 kJ mol(-1), which shows that this catalyst has extremely high inherent activity. Furthermore, this transition state corresponds to that connecting the intermediates in this reaction leading to ring opening of the cyclopentene product. This shows that ring closing is kinetically slightly favoured over ring opening, in addition to being driven by the loss of ethene.",2
Monodisperse cylindrical micelles by crystallization-driven living self-assembly.,"Non-spherical nanostructures derived from soft matter and with uniform size-that is, monodisperse materials-are of particular utility and interest, but are very rare outside the biological domain. We report the controlled formation of highly monodisperse cylindrical block copolymer micelles (length dispersity < or = 1.03; length range, approximately 200 nm to 2 microm) by the use of very small (approximately 20 nm) uniform crystallite seeds that serve as initiators for the crystallization-driven living self-assembly of added block-copolymer unimers with a crystallizable, core-forming metalloblock. This process is analogous to the use of small initiator molecules in classical living polymerization reactions. The length of the nanocylinders could be precisely controlled by variation of the unimer-to-crystallite seed ratio. Samples of the highly monodisperse nanocylinders of different lengths that are accessible using this approach have been shown to exhibit distinct liquid-crystalline alignment behaviour.",2
Triggering N(2) uptake via redox-induced expulsion of coordinated NH(3) and N(2) silylation at trigonal bipyramidal iron.,"The biological reduction of N(2) to give NH(3) may occur by one of two predominant pathways in which nitrogenous N(x)H(y) intermediates, including hydrazine (N(2)H(4)), diazene (N(2)H(2)), nitride (N(3-)) and imide (NH(2-)), may be involved. To test the validity of hypotheses on iron's direct role in the stepwise reduction of N(2), model systems for iron are needed. Such systems can test the chemical compatibility of iron with various proposed N(x)H(y) intermediates and the reactivity patterns of such species. Here we describe a trigonal bipyramidal Si(o-C(6)H(4)PR(2))(3)Fe-L scaffold (R = Ph or i-Pr) in which the apical site is occupied by nitrogenous ligands such as N(2), N(2)H(4), NH(3) and N(2)R. The system accommodates terminally bound N(2) in the three formal oxidation states (iron(0), +1 and +2). N(2) uptake is demonstrated by the displacement of its reduction partners NH(3) and N(2)H(4), and N(2) functionalizaton is illustrated by electrophilic silylation.",2
"Chiral-auxiliary-mediated 1,2-cis-glycosylations for the solid-supported synthesis of a biologically important branched alpha-glucan.","Solid-phase oligosaccharide synthesis offers the promise of providing libraries of oligosaccharides for glycomics research. A major stumbling block to solid-phase oligosaccharide synthesis has been a lack of general methods for the stereoselective installation of 1,2-cis-glycosides, and intractable mixtures of compounds are obtained if several such glycosides need to be installed. We have prepared on-resin a biologically important glucoside containing multiple 1,2-cis-glycosidic linkages with complete anomeric control by using glycosyl donors having a participating (S)-(phenylthiomethyl)benzyl chiral auxiliary at C2. A branching point could be installed by using 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) and allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc) as a versatile set of orthogonal protecting groups. The synthetic strategy made it possible to achieve partial on-resin deprotection of the completed oligosaccharide, thereby increasing the overall efficiency of the synthesis. The combination of classical and auxiliary-mediated neighbouring-group participation for controlling anomeric selectivity is bringing the promise of routine automated solid-supported oligosaccharide synthesis closer.",2
Enantioselective iron-catalysed O-H bond insertions.,"The ready availability, low price and environmentally benign character of iron mean that it is an ideal alternative to precious metals in catalysis. Recent growth in the number of iron-catalysed reactions reported reflects an increasing demand for sustainable chemistry. Only a limited number of chiral iron catalysts have been reported and these have, in general, proven less enantioselective than other transition-metal catalysts, thus limiting their appeal. Here, we report that iron complexes of spiro-bisoxazoline ligands are highly efficient catalysts for asymmetric O-H bond insertion reactions. These complexes catalyse insertions into the O-H bond of a wide variety of alcohols and even water, with exceptional enantioselectivities under mild reaction conditions. The selectivities surpass those obtained with other transition-metal catalysts. This study should inspire and encourage the use of iron instead of traditional precious metals in the development of greener catalysts for catalytic asymmetric synthesis.",2
Synthesis of a metal oxide with a room-temperature photoreversible phase transition.,"Photoinduced phase-transition materials, such as chalcogenides, spin-crossover complexes, photochromic organic compounds and charge-transfer materials, are of interest because of their application to optical data storage. Here we report a photoreversible metal-semiconductor phase transition at room temperature with a unique phase of Ti(3)O(5), lambda-Ti(3)O(5). lambda-Ti(3)O(5) nanocrystals are made by the combination of reverse-micelle and sol-gel techniques. Thermodynamic analysis suggests that the photoinduced phase transition originates from a particular state of lambda-Ti(3)O(5) trapped at a thermodynamic local energy minimum. Light irradiation causes reversible switching between this trapped state (lambda-Ti(3)O(5)) and the other energy-minimum state (beta-Ti(3)O(5)), both of which are persistent phases. This is the first demonstration of a photorewritable phenomenon at room temperature in a metal oxide. lambda-Ti(3)O(5) satisfies the operation conditions required for a practical optical storage system (operational temperature, writing data by short wavelength light and the appropriate threshold laser power).",2
Experimental evidence for the functional relevance of anion-pi interactions.,"Attractive in theory and confirmed to exist, anion-pi interactions have never really been seen at work. To catch them in action, we prepared a collection of monomeric, cyclic and rod-shaped naphthalenediimide transporters. Their ability to exert anion-pi interactions was demonstrated by electrospray tandem mass spectrometry in combination with theoretical calculations. To relate this structural evidence to transport activity in bilayer membranes, affinity and selectivity sequences were recorded. pi-acidification and active-site decrowding increased binding, transport and chloride > bromide > iodide selectivity, and supramolecular organization inverted acetate > nitrate to nitrate > acetate selectivity. We conclude that anion-pi interactions on monomeric surfaces are ideal for chloride recognition, whereas their supramolecular enhancement by pi,pi-interactions appears perfect to target nitrate. Chloride transporters are relevant to treat channelopathies, and nitrate sensors to monitor cellular signaling and cardiovascular diseases. A big impact on organocatalysis can be expected from the stabilization of anionic transition states on chiral pi-acidic surfaces.",2
Visible light photocatalysis as a greener approach to photochemical synthesis.,"Light can be considered an ideal reagent for environmentally friendly, 'green' chemical synthesis; unlike many conventional reagents, light is non-toxic, generates no waste, and can be obtained from renewable sources. Nevertheless, the need for high-energy ultraviolet radiation in most organic photochemical processes has limited both the practicality and environmental benefits of photochemical synthesis on industrially relevant scales. This perspective describes recent approaches to the use of metal polypyridyl photocatalysts in synthetic organic transformations. Given the remarkable photophysical properties of these complexes, these new transformations, which use Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and related photocatalysts, can be conducted using almost any source of visible light, including both store-bought fluorescent light bulbs and ambient sunlight. Transition metal photocatalysis thus represents a promising strategy towards the development of practical, scalable industrial processes with great environmental benefits.",2
Enhancement of anhydrous proton transport by supramolecular nanochannels in comb polymers.,"Transporting protons is essential in several biological processes as well as in renewable energy devices, such as fuel cells. Although biological systems exhibit precise supramolecular organization of chemical functionalities on the nanoscale to effect highly efficient proton conduction, to achieve similar organization in artificial systems remains a daunting challenge. Here, we are concerned with transporting protons on a micron scale under anhydrous conditions, that is proton transfer unassisted by any solvent, especially water. We report that proton-conducting systems derived from facially amphiphilic polymers that exhibit organized supramolecular assemblies show a dramatic enhancement in anhydrous conductivity relative to analogous materials that lack the capacity for self-organization. We describe the design, synthesis and characterization of these macromolecules, and suggest that nanoscale organization of proton-conducting functionalities is a key consideration in obtaining efficient anhydrous proton transport.",2
Electrochemistry through glass.,"In this Article we have used new approaches to investigate a well-known chemical process, the propagation of electrochemical signals through a thin glass membrane. This process, which has been extensively studied over the last century, is the basis of the response of a potentiometric glass pH sensor; however, no amperometric glass sensors have yet been reported because of its high ohmic resistance. Voltammetry at nanoelectrodes has revealed that water molecules can diffuse through nanometre-thick layers of dry glass and undergo oxidation/reduction at the buried platinum surface. After soaking for a few hours in an aqueous solution, voltammetric waves of other redox couples, such as Ru(NH(3))(6)(3+/2+), could also be obtained at the glass-covered platinum nanoelectrodes. This behaviour suggests that the nanometre-thick insulating glass sheath surrounding the platinum core can be largely converted to hydrated gel, and electrochemical processes occur at the platinum/hydrogel interface. Potential applications range from use in nanometre-sized solid-state pH probes and determination of the water content in organic solvents to glass-modified voltammetric sensors and electrocatalysts.",2
Nucleophilic catalysis of acylhydrazone equilibration for protein-directed dynamic covalent chemistry.,"Dynamic covalent chemistry uses reversible chemical reactions to set up an equilibrating network of molecules at thermodynamic equilibrium, which can adjust its composition in response to any agent capable of altering the free energy of the system. When the target is a biological macromolecule, such as a protein, the process corresponds to the protein directing the synthesis of its own best ligand. Here, we demonstrate that reversible acylhydrazone formation is an effective chemistry for biological dynamic combinatorial library formation. In the presence of aniline as a nucleophilic catalyst, dynamic combinatorial libraries equilibrate rapidly at pH 6.2, are fully reversible, and may be switched on or off by means of a change in pH. We have interfaced these hydrazone dynamic combinatorial libraries with two isozymes from the glutathione S-transferase class of enzyme, and observed divergent amplification effects, where each protein selects the best-fitting hydrazone for the hydrophobic region of its active site.",2
Using first principles to predict bimetallic catalysts for the ammonia decomposition reaction.,"The facile decomposition of ammonia to produce hydrogen is critical to its use as a hydrogen storage medium in a hydrogen economy, and although ruthenium shows good activity for catalysing this process, its expense and scarcity are prohibitive to large-scale commercialization. The need to develop alternative catalysts has been addressed here, using microkinetic modelling combined with density functional studies to identify suitable monolayer bimetallic (surface or subsurface) catalysts based on nitrogen binding energies. The Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surface, with one monolayer of Ni atoms residing on a Pt(111) substrate, was predicted to be a catalytically active surface. This was verified using temperature-programmed desorption and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy experiments. The results reported here provide a framework for complex catalyst discovery. They also demonstrate the critical importance of combining theoretical and experimental approaches for identifying desirable monolayer bimetallic systems when the surface properties are not a linear function of the parent metals.",2
Efficient stereo- and regioselective hydroxylation of alkanes catalysed by a bulky polyoxometalate.,"Direct functionalization of alkanes by oxidation of C-H bonds to form alcohols under mild conditions is a challenge for synthetic chemistry. Most alkanes contain a large number of C-H bonds that present difficulties for selectivity, and the oxidants employed often result in overoxidation. Here we describe a divanadium-substituted phosphotungstate that catalyses the stereo- and regioselective hydroxylation of alkanes with hydrogen peroxide as the sole oxidant. Both cyclic and acyclic alkanes were oxidized to form alcohols with greater than 96% selectivity. The bulky polyoxometalate framework of the catalyst results in an unusual selectivity that can lead to the oxidation of secondary rather than the weaker tertiary C-H bonds. The catalyst also avoids wasteful decomposition of the stoichiometric oxidant, which can result in the production of hydroxyl radicals and lead to non-selective oxidation and overoxidation of the desired products.",2
Geometry-controlled kinetics.,"It has long been appreciated that the transport properties of molecules can control reaction kinetics. This effect can be characterized by the time it takes a diffusing molecule to reach a target-the first-passage time (FPT). Determining the FPT distribution in realistic confined geometries has until now, however, seemed intractable. Here, we calculate this FPT distribution analytically and show that transport processes as varied as regular diffusion, anomalous diffusion, and diffusion in disordered media and fractals, fall into the same universality classes. Beyond the theoretical aspect, this result changes our views on standard reaction kinetics and we introduce the concept of 'geometry-controlled kinetics'. More precisely, we argue that geometry-and in particular the initial distance between reactants in 'compact' systems-can become a key parameter. These findings could help explain the crucial role that the spatial organization of genes has in transcription kinetics, and more generally the impact of geometry on diffusion-limited reactions.",2
Direct detection of CH/pi interactions in proteins.,"XH/pi interactions make important contributions to biomolecular structure and function. These weakly polar interactions, involving pi-system acceptor groups, are usually identified from the three-dimensional structures of proteins. Here, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has been used to directly detect methyl/pi (Me/pi) interactions in proteins at atomic resolution. Density functional theory calculations predict the existence of weak scalar (J) couplings between nuclei involved in Me/pi interactions. Using an optimized isotope-labelling strategy, these J couplings have been detected in proteins using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The resulting spectra provide direct experimental evidence of Me/pi interactions in proteins and allow a simple and unambiguous assignment of donor and acceptor groups. The use of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is an elegant way to identify and experimentally characterize Me/pi interactions in proteins without the need for arbitrary geometric descriptions or pre-existing three-dimensional structures.",2
Assembly of a metal-organic framework by sextuple intercatenation of discrete adamantane-like cages.,"Metal-organic frameworks form a unique class of multifunctional hybrid materials and have myriad applications, including gas storage and catalysis. Their structure is usually achieved through the infinite coordination of metal ions and multidentate organic ligands by means of strong covalent bonds. Threaded molecules such as catenanes and rotaxanes have largely been restricted to comprising components of two-dimensional interlocking rings or polygons. There are very few examples of the catenation of polyhedral cages. Although it has been postulated that the infinite extended architecture can be obtained from the polycatenation of a discrete cage based on such threading, this has not been documented to date. Here we describe an infinite three-dimensional metal-organic framework composed of catenated polyhedral cages, in which the framework is achieved by mechanical interlocking of all of the vertices of the cages. The three-dimensional polycatenated framework shows twofold self-interpenetration in its crystal packing. The penetration of polycatenanes creates nanosized voids into which the Keggin polyoxometalate anions are perfectly accommodated as counteranions.",2
Lattice-strain control of the activity in dealloyed core-shell fuel cell catalysts.,"Electrocatalysis will play a key role in future energy conversion and storage technologies, such as water electrolysers, fuel cells and metal-air batteries. Molecular interactions between chemical reactants and the catalytic surface control the activity and efficiency, and hence need to be optimized; however, generalized experimental strategies to do so are scarce. Here we show how lattice strain can be used experimentally to tune the catalytic activity of dealloyed bimetallic nanoparticles for the oxygen-reduction reaction, a key barrier to the application of fuel cells and metal-air batteries. We demonstrate the core-shell structure of the catalyst and clarify the mechanistic origin of its activity. The platinum-rich shell exhibits compressive strain, which results in a shift of the electronic band structure of platinum and weakening chemisorption of oxygenated species. We combine synthesis, measurements and an understanding of strain from theory to generate a reactivity-strain relationship that provides guidelines for tuning electrocatalytic activity.",2
Direct transformation of graphene to fullerene.,"Although fullerenes can be efficiently generated from graphite in high yield, the route to the formation of these symmetrical and aesthetically pleasing carbon cages from a flat graphene sheet remains a mystery. The most widely accepted mechanisms postulate that the graphene structure dissociates to very small clusters of carbon atoms such as C(2), which subsequently coalesce to form fullerene cages through a series of intermediates. In this Article, aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy directly visualizes, in real time, a process of fullerene formation from a graphene sheet. Quantum chemical modelling explains four critical steps in a top-down mechanism of fullerene formation: (i) loss of carbon atoms at the edge of graphene, leading to (ii) the formation of pentagons, which (iii) triggers the curving of graphene into a bowl-shaped structure and which (iv) subsequently zips up its open edges to form a closed fullerene structure.",2
Ion-triggered spring-like motion of a double helicate accompanied by anisotropic twisting.,"Molecules that extend and contract under external stimuli are used to build molecular machines with nanomechanical functions. But although common in biological systems, such extension and contraction motions with helical molecules have rarely been accompanied by unidirectional twisting in synthetic systems. Here we show that sodium ions can trigger the reversible anisotropic twisting of an enantiomeric double-stranded helicate, without racemization. An optically active helicate consisting of two tetraphenol strands bridged by two spiroborate groups sandwiches a sodium ion. On removal of the central sodium-through addition of a cryptand [2.2.1] in solution-the double helicate extends. Crystallographic and nuclear magnetic resonance studies reveal that the extended helicate is over twice as long as the initial molecule, and is twisted in the right-handed direction. Circular dichroism analysis suggests that the twisting doesn't affect the helicate's handedness. This anisotropic extension-contraction process is reversibly triggered by the successive addition and removal of sodium ions in solution.",2
Robust dynamics.,"Although metal-organic frameworks are extensive in number and have found widespread applications, there remains a need to add complexity to their structures in a controlled manner. It is inevitable that frameworks capable of dynamics will be required. However, as in other extended structures, when they are flexible, they fail. We propose that mechanically interlocked molecules be inserted covalently into the rigid framework backbone such that they are mounted as integrated components, capable of dynamics, without compromising the fidelity of the entire system. We have coined the term 'robust dynamics' to describe constructs where the repeated dynamics of one entity does not affect the integrity of any others linked to it. The implication of this concept for dynamic molecules, whose performance has the disadvantages of random motion, is to bring them to a standstill in three-dimensional extended structures and thus significantly enhance their order, and ultimately their coherence and performance.",2
Enantioselective protonation.,"Enantioselective protonation is a common process in biosynthetic sequences. The decarboxylase and esterase enzymes that effect this valuable transformation are able to control both the steric environment around the proton acceptor (typically an enolate) and the proton donor (typically a thiol). Recently, several chemical methods to achieve enantioselective protonation have been developed by exploiting various means of enantiocontrol in different mechanisms. These laboratory transformations have proven useful for the preparation of a number of valuable organic compounds.",2
Catalyst selection based on intermediate stability measured by mass spectrometry.,"The power of natural selection through survival of the fittest is nature's ultimate tool for the improvement and advancement of species. To apply this concept in catalyst development is attractive and may lead to more rapid discoveries of new catalysts for the synthesis of relevant targets, such as pharmaceuticals. Recent advances in ligand synthesis using combinatorial methods have allowed the generation of a great diversity of catalysts. However, selection methods are few in number. We introduce a new selection method that focuses on the stability of catalytic intermediates measured by mass spectrometry. The stability of the intermediate relates inversely to the reactivity of the catalyst, which forms the basis of a catalyst-screening protocol in which less-abundant species represent the most-active catalysts, 'the survival of the weakest'. We demonstrate this concept in the palladium-catalysed allylic alkylation reaction using diphosphine and IndolPhos ligands and support our results with high-level density functional theory calculations.",2
Rapid preparation of flexible porous coordination polymer nanocrystals with accelerated guest adsorption kinetics.,"Porous coordination polymers, in particular flexible porous coordination polymer networks that change their network structure on guest adsorption, have enormous potential in applications involving selective storage, separation and sensing. Despite the expected significant differences in their adsorption properties, porous coordination polymer nanocrystals remain largely unexplored, and there have been no reports about studies on flexible porous coordination polymer nanocrystals, mainly due to a lack of preparation methods. Here, we present a new technique for the rapid preparation of porous coordination polymer nanocrystals that combines non-aqueous inverse microemulsion with ultrasonication. Uniform nanocrystals of {[Zn(ip)(bpy)]}(n) (ip = isophthalate, bpy = 4,4'-bipyridyl; CID-1), a flexible porous coordination polymer, have been prepared by this method and analysed using field-emission scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray powder diffraction. A model for particle formation and growth is presented and discussed. Adsorption experiments with methanol show that the overall adsorption capacities of nanoparticles and bulk are almost identical, but the shapes of the sorption isotherms differ significantly and the adsorption kinetics increase dramatically.",2
A 'Texas-sized' molecular box that forms an anion-induced supramolecular necklace.,"The 'blue box' (cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) or CBPQT(4+)), developed by Stoddart and colleagues, forms effective charge transfer complexes with a variety of electron-rich species and has been used to support the formation of a wide range of interlocked structures. However, little effort seems to have been devoted to generalizing the blue box concept. We describe a new flexible tetracationic macrocycle-a 'Texas-sized' molecular box. This positively charged receptor is capable of binding the mono-terephthalate anion, forming pseudorotaxanes. These pseudorotaxanes self-assemble into short supramolecular pseudo-oligorotaxanes in solution and more extended pseudo-polyrotaxanes in the solid state. The supramolecular oligomers formed in solution are environmentally responsive; they undergo deaggregation as the overall concentration of the cationic and anionic constituents is reduced, the temperature is increased, or the protonation state of the threading mono-terephthalate anion is changed.",2
Million-fold activation of the [Fe(2)(micro-O)(2)] diamond core for C-H bond cleavage.,"In biological systems, the cleavage of strong C-H bonds is often carried out by iron centres-such as that of methane monooxygenase in methane hydroxylation-through dioxygen activation mechanisms. High valent species with [Fe(2)(micro-O)(2)] diamond cores are thought to act as the oxidizing moieties, but the synthesis of complexes that cleave strong C-H bonds efficiently has remained a challenge. We report here the conversion of a synthetic complex with a valence-delocalized [Fe(3.5)(micro-O)(2)Fe(3.5)](3+) diamond core (1) into a complex with a valence-localized [HO-Fe(III)-O-Fe(IV)=O](2+) open core (4), which cleaves C-H bonds over a million-fold faster. This activity enhancement results from three factors: the formation of a terminal oxoiron(iv) moiety, the conversion of the low-spin (S = 1) Fe(IV)=O centre to a high-spin (S = 2) centre, and the concentration of the oxidizing capability to the active terminal oxoiron(iv) moiety. This suggests that similar isomerization strategies might be used by nonhaem diiron enzymes.",2
Self-assembly and optically triggered disassembly of hierarchical dendron-virus complexes.,"Nature offers a vast array of biological building blocks that can be combined with synthetic materials to generate a variety of hierarchical architectures. Viruses are particularly interesting in this respect because of their structure and the possibility of them functioning as scaffolds for the preparation of new biohybrid materials. We report here that cowpea chlorotic mottle virus particles can be assembled into well-defined micrometre-sized objects and then reconverted into individual viruses by application of a short optical stimulus. Assembly is achieved using photosensitive dendrons that bind on the virus surface through multivalent interactions and then act as a molecular glue between the virus particles. Optical triggering induces the controlled decomposition and charge switching of dendrons, which results in the loss of multivalent interactions and the release of virus particles. We demonstrate that the method is not limited to the virus particles alone, but can also be applied to other functional protein cages such as magnetoferritin.",2
The rational design of helium bonds.,"The chemistry of helium has hitherto been confined to experimental and theoretical analysis of small molecules containing three to five atoms in the gas phase. Here a new suggestion is made for compounds of helium deriving from a recent proposal that five-coordinate carbon might be captured as a frozen S(N)2 transition state. A series of logical steps, originally discussed as postings and comments to two blogs, led to the outcome described here of a central hypervalent atom bound on one face by a small cyclic carbon ligand, with the other free face having an interaction to a helium atom with the topological properties of a charge-shift rather than a covalent bond. Although high-level theory predicts these helium bonds to be quite short with relatively high stretching frequencies, the kinetic barriers to the loss of helium are predicted to be small, and are not increased by the strategy of having bulky substituents on the ring ligand.",2
An organic redox electrolyte to rival triiodide/iodide in dye-sensitized solar cells.,"Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have achieved impressive conversion efficiencies for solar energy of over 11% with an electrolyte that contains triiodide/iodide as a redox couple. Although triiodide/iodide redox couples work efficiently in DSCs, they suffer from two major disadvantages: electrolytes that contain triiodide/iodide corrode electrical contacts made of silver (which reduces the options for the scale up of DSCs to module size) and triiodide partially absorbs visible light. Here, we present a new disulfide/thiolate redox couple that has negligible absorption in the visible spectral range, a very attractive feature for flexible DSCs that use transparent conductors as current collectors. Using this novel, iodide-free redox electrolyte in conjunction with a sensitized heterojunction, we achieved an unprecedented efficiency of 6.4% under standard illumination test conditions. This novel redox couple offers a viable pathway to develop efficient DSCs with attractive properties for scale up and practical applications.",2
Synergistic organocatalysis in the kinetic resolution of secondary thiols with concomitant desymmetrization of an anhydride.,"Kinetic resolution is an important method for the separation of racemates into their component enantiomers. Thiols are precursors to a variety of organosulfur compounds, with high utility in both chemistry and chemical biology, yet there is a surprising dearth of methodologies for their direct and efficient catalytic kinetic resolution. Here, we demonstrate an organocatalytic process involving the highly enantioselective desymmetrization of an achiral electrophile with the simultaneous kinetic resolution of a racemic thiol. The preparative potential of the methodology is exemplified by the synthesis of a drug precursor antipode in excellent yield and enantioselectivity as a by-product of a process that also resolves a sec-thiol substrate with a selectivity of S = 226 (that is, both thiol antipodes produced in >95% ee at 51% conversion). In a second example a racemic sec-thiol representing the stereocentre-containing core of the anti-asthma drug (R)-Montelukast was resolved with synthetically useful selectivity under mild conditions.",2
Charge-transfer-induced structural rearrangements at both sides of organic/metal interfaces.,"Organic/metal interfaces control the performance of many optoelectronic organic devices, including organic light-emitting diodes or field-effect transistors. Using scanning tunnelling microscopy, low-energy electron diffraction, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we show that electron transfer at the interface between a metal surface and the organic electron acceptor tetracyano-p-quinodimethane leads to substantial structural rearrangements on both the organic and metallic sides of the interface. These structural modifications mediate new intermolecular interactions through the creation of stress fields that could not have been predicted on the basis of gas-phase neutral tetracyano-p-quinodimethane conformation.",2
Isolation of crystalline carbene-stabilized P(2)-radical cations and P(2)-dications.,"The discovery in 1900 by Gomberg that the trityl radical (Ph(3)C(.)) exists at room temperature is often considered to be the beginning of radical chemistry. Since then, persistent and even room-temperature stable radicals based on second-row and heavier elements have been synthesized. However, few of them have been characterized crystallographically, because they are either too reactive or dimerize in the solid state. Here, we show that a P(2) fragment, capped with two bulky, strongly electron-releasing singlet carbenes (dicoordinate carbon compounds with only six valence electrons), can undergo one-electron oxidation, giving rise to room-temperature stable radical cations. Moreover, when N-heterocyclic carbenes are used, two-electron oxidation can also be performed, producing the corresponding stable dicationic diphosphene, which has to be regarded as a P(2)(2+) fragment coordinated by two carbenes. These results reveal a new application of stable singlet carbenes, the stabilization of paramagnetic species and electron-poor fragments.",2
High-spin ground states via electron delocalization in mixed-valence imidazolate-bridged divanadium complexes.,"The field of molecular magnetism has grown tremendously since the discovery of single-molecule magnets, but it remains centred around the superexchange mechanism. The possibility of instead using a double-exchange mechanism (based on electron delocalization rather than Heisenberg exchange through a non-magnetic bridge) presents a tantalizing prospect for synthesizing molecules with high-spin ground states that are well isolated in energy. We now demonstrate that magnetic double exchange can be sustained by simple imidazolate bridging ligands, known to be well suited for the construction of coordination clusters and solids. A series of mixed-valence molecules of the type [(PY5Me(2))V(II)(micro-L(br)) V(III)(PY5Me(2))](4+) were synthesized and their electron delocalization probed through cyclic voltammetry and spectroelectrochemistry. Magnetic susceptibility data reveal a well-isolated S = 5/2 ground state arising from double exchange for [(PY5Me(2))(2)V(2)(micro-5,6-dimethylbenzimidazolate)](4+). Combined modelling of the magnetic data and spectral analysis leads to an estimate of the double-exchange parameter of B = 220 cm(-1) when vibronic coupling is taken into account.",2
Induction of chiral porous solids containing only achiral building blocks.,"In many areas of chemistry the synthesis of chiral compounds is a target of increasing importance. They play a vital role in biological function and in many areas of society and science, including biology, medicine, biotechnology, chemistry and agriculture. Many pharmaceutical molecules, like their biological targets, are chiral and it is therefore easy to understand the growing demand for efficient methods of producing enantiomerically pure compounds. This is equally true for the preparation of chiral solids, which have potential applications in asymmetric catalysis, chiral separations and the like. In this Review we will consider recent progress and future potential in the development of methods for the preparation of chirally pure solids, in particular where the building blocks of the structure are achiral themselves. We will discuss strategies for the synthesis of both inorganic (for example, zeolites) and inorganic-organic hybrid (for example, metal organic framework) chiral porous solids.",2
Type-zero copper proteins.,"Many proteins contain copper in a range of coordination environments, where it has various biological roles, such as transferring electrons or activating dioxygen. These copper sites can be classified by their function or spectroscopic properties. Those with a single copper atom are either type 1, with an intense absorption band near 600 nm, or type 2, with weak absorption in the visible region. We have built a novel copper(II) binding site within structurally modified Pseudomonas aeruginosa azurins that does not resemble either existing type, which we therefore call 'type zero'. X-ray crystallographic analysis shows that these sites adopt distorted tetrahedral geometries, with an unusually short Cu-O (G45 carbonyl) bond. Relatively weak absorption near 800 nm and narrow parallel hyperfine splittings in electron paramagnetic resonance spectra are the spectroscopic signatures of type zero copper. Cyclic voltammetric experiments demonstrate that the electron transfer reactivities of type-zero azurins are enhanced relative to that of the corresponding type 2 (C112D) protein.",2
Enantioselective sulfonylation reactions mediated by a tetrapeptide catalyst.,"While Nature excels at performing selective modifications of complex polyfunctional molecules through the use of tailoring enzymes, synthetic chemistry has lagged behind in this regard. In prior work, we have applied a biomimetic approach to this problem, developing small peptides to achieve various group transfer reactions on polyol substrates with high enantio- or regioselectivity. The utility of sulfonates as synthetic building blocks and the scarcity of direct, selective methods for their preparation prompted our investigation into this area. In this article we report the development of a pi-methyl histidine-based tetrameric peptide that effects the desymmetrization of meso-1,3-diols through enantioselective (mono)sulfonylation. The catalyst exhibits structural similarities to another catalyst found to be effective in orthogonal group transfers, but results in modification of the enantiotopic alcohol. The practical and mechanistic implications of this discovery may extend beyond synthetic considerations and provide analogies to the diverse roles of histidine in enzyme active sites.",2
Opportunities and challenges in synthetic oligosaccharide and glycoconjugate research.,"Synthetic oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates are increasingly used as probes for biological research and as lead compounds for drug and vaccine discovery. These endeavors are, however, complicated by a lack of general methods for the routine preparation of this important class of compounds. Recent development such as one-pot multi-step protecting group manipulations, the use of unified monosaccharide building blocks, the introduction of stereoselective glycosylation protocols, and convergent strategies for oligosaccharide assembly, are beginning to address these problems. Furthermore, oligosaccharide synthesis can be facilitated by chemo-enzymatic methods, which employ a range of glycosyl transferases to modify a synthetic oligosaccharide precursor. Glycosynthases, which are mutant glycosidases, that can readily form glycosidic linkages are addressing a lack of a wide range glycosyltransferases. The power of carbohydrate chemistry is highlighted by an ability to synthesize glycoproteins.",2
Sensing of proteins in human serum using conjugates of nanoparticles and green fluorescent protein.,"There is a direct correlation between protein levels and disease states in human serum, which makes it an attractive target for sensors and diagnostics. However, this is challenging because serum features more than 20,000 proteins, with an overall protein content greater than 1 mM. Here we report a sensor based on a hybrid synthetic-biomolecule that uses arrays of green fluorescent protein and nanoparticles to detect proteins at biorelevant concentrations in both buffer and human serum. Distinct and reproducible fluorescence-response patterns were obtained from five serum proteins (human serum albumin, immunoglobulin G, transferrin, fibrinogen and a-antitrypsin), both in buffer and when spiked into human serum. Using linear discriminant analysis we identified these proteins with an identification accuracy of 100% in buffer and 97% in human serum. The arrays were also able to discriminate between different concentrations of the same protein, as well as a mixture of different proteins in human serum.",2
A bonding model for gold(I) carbene complexes.,"The last decade has witnessed dramatic growth in the number of reactions catalyzed by electrophilic gold complexes. While proposed mechanisms often invoke the intermediacy of gold-stabilized cationic species, the nature of bonding in these intermediates remains unclear. Herein, we propose that the carbon-gold bond in these intermediates is comprised of varying degrees of both sigma and pi-bonding; however, the overall bond order is generally less than or equal to unity. The bonding in a given gold-stabilized intermediate, and the position of this intermediate on a continuum ranging from gold-stabilized singlet carbene to gold-coordinated carbocation, is dictated by the carbene substituents and the ancillary ligand. Experiments show that the correlation between bonding and reactivity is reflected in the yield of gold-catalyzed cyclopropanation reactions.",2
An optoelectronic nose for the detection of toxic gases.,"We have developed a simple colorimetric sensor array that detects a wide range of volatile analytes and then applied it to the detection of toxic gases. The sensor consists of a disposable array of cross-responsive nanoporous pigments with colours that are changed by diverse chemical interactions with analytes. Although no single chemically responsive pigment is specific for any one analyte, the pattern of colour change for the array is a unique molecular fingerprint. Clear differentiation among 19 different toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) within two minutes of exposure at concentrations immediately dangerous to life or health were demonstrated. Based on the colour change of the array, quantification of each analyte was accomplished easily, and excellent detection limits were achieved, generally below the permissible exposure limits. Different TICs were identified readily using a standard chemometric approach (hierarchical clustering analysis), with no misclassifications over 140 trials.",2
A diiron(IV) complex that cleaves strong C-H and O-H bonds.,"The controlled cleavage of strong C-H bonds like those of methane poses a significant challenge for chemists. In nature methane is oxidized to methanol by soluble methane monooxygenase via a diiron(IV) intermediate called Q. To model the chemistry of MMO-Q, an oxo-bridged diiron(IV) complex has been generated by electrochemical oxidation and characterized by several spectroscopic methods. This novel species has an Fe(IV/III) redox potential of +1.50 V vs. ferrocene (>2 V vs. NHE), the highest value thus far determined electrochemically for an iron complex. This species is quite an effective oxidant. It can attack C-H bonds as strong as 100 kcal mol(-1) and reacts with cyclohexane a hundred- to a thousand-fold faster than mononuclear Fe(IV)=O complexes of closely related ligands. Strikingly, this species can also cleave the strong O-H bonds of methanol and tert-butanol instead of their weaker C-H bonds, representing the first example of O-H bond activation for iron complexes.",2
A ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complex for direct imaging of DNA structure in living cells.,"In the search for new biological imaging agents, metal coordination compounds able to emit from triplet metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) states offer many advantages as luminescent probes of DNA structure. However, poor cellular uptake restricts their use in live cells. Here, we present a dinuclear ruthenium(II) polypyridyl system that works as a multifunctional biological imaging agent staining the DNA of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells for both luminescence and transition electron microscopy. This MLCT 'light switch' complex directly images nuclear DNA of living cells without requiring prior membrane permeabilization. Furthermore, inhibition and transmission electron microscopy studies show this to be via a non-endocytotic, but temperature-dependent, mechanism of cellular uptake in MCF-7 cells, and confocal microscopy reveals multiple emission peaks that function as markers for cellular DNA structure.",2
Streamlined microwave-assisted preparation of narrow-bandgap conjugated polymers for high-performance bulk heterojunction solar cells.,"The most efficient plastic solar cells comprise a blend of conjugated polymer and a suitable electron acceptor, typically a fullerene derivative. Therefore narrow-bandgap conjugated polymers are currently sought for the fabrication of such devices. A significant challenge is being able to predict device function and performance from consideration of the molecular connectivity and dimensions of the partners within the active layer. Improved chemical syntheses are therefore required to make structurally varied polymers and enable the delineation of structure-function relationships with the aim of improving power conversion efficiencies. Here, we demonstrate that microwave heating in combination with the screening of comonomer reactant ratios can be used to obtain donor-acceptor copolymers with high average molecular weights and properties that make them suitable for solar cell incorporation. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of high molecular weight and the contribution of solubilizing side groups in determining the final device properties.",2
Hierarchical functional gradients of pH-responsive self-assembled monolayers using dynamic covalent chemistry on surfaces.,"Surface chemistry is an important field of research, especially for the study and design of (bio)nanostructures in which nearly every atom lies at an interface. Here we show that dynamic covalent chemistry is an efficient tool for functionalizing surfaces in such a way that their interfacial properties can be varied controllably in space and time. Modulation of pH is used to tune the fast, selective and reversible attachment of functional amines (with different pK(a) values) to an aldehyde-coated surface. To illustrate the potential of this technique, we developed dynamic self-assembled monolayers ('DynaSAMs'), which enable the hierarchical construction of mixed gradients comprising either small functional molecules or proteins. Control of the (bio)chemical composition at any point on the surface potentially provides a simple bottom-up method to access numerous surface patterns with a broad range of functionalities.",2
In silico design of tubulin-targeted antimitotic peptides.,"Microtubules are polymeric structures formed by the self-assembly of tubulin dimers. The growth and shrinkage of these dynamic arrays have a key role during the cell-proliferation process. This makes tubulin the molecular target of many anticancer drugs currently in use or under clinical trial. Their impressive success is limited by the onset of resistant tumour cells during the treatment, so new resistance-proof molecules need to be developed. Here we use molecular dynamics and free-energy calculations to study the network of interactions that allow microtubule formation. Modelling the protein-protein interface allows us to identify the amino acids responsible for tubulin-tubulin binding and thus to design peptides, which correspond to tubulin subsequences, that interfere with microtubule formation. We show that the application of molecular modelling techniques leads to the identification of peptides that exhibit antitubulin activity both in vitro and in cultured cells.",2
Rectification and stability of a single molecular diode with controlled orientation.,"In the molecular electronics field it is highly desirable to engineer the structure of molecules to achieve specific functions. In particular, diode (or rectification) behaviour in single molecules is an attractive device function. Here we study charge transport through symmetric tetraphenyl and non-symmetric diblock dipyrimidinyldiphenyl molecules covalently bound to two electrodes. The orientation of the diblock is controlled through a selective deprotection strategy, and a method in which the electrode-electrode distance is modulated unambiguously determines the current-voltage characteristics of the single-molecule device. The diblock molecule exhibits pronounced rectification behaviour compared with its homologous symmetric block, with current flowing from the dipyrimidinyl to the diphenyl moieties. This behaviour is interpreted in terms of localization of the wave function of the hole ground state at one end of the diblock under the applied field. At large forward current, the molecular diode becomes unstable and quantum point contacts between the electrodes form.",2
Vesicular perylene dye nanocapsules as supramolecular fluorescent pH sensor systems.,"Water-soluble, self-assembled nanocapsules composed of a functional bilayer membrane and enclosed guest molecules can provide smart (that is, condition responsive) sensors for a variety of purposes. Owing to their outstanding optical and redox properties, perylene bisimide chromophores are interesting building blocks for a functional bilayer membrane in a water environment. Here, we report water-soluble perylene bisimide vesicles loaded with bispyrene-based energy donors in their aqueous interior. These loaded vesicles are stabilized by in situ photopolymerization to give nanocapsules that are stable over the entire aqueous pH range. On the basis of pH-tunable spectral overlap of donors and acceptors, the donor-loaded polymerized vesicles display pH-dependent fluorescence resonance energy transfer from the encapsulated donors to the bilayer dye membrane, providing ultrasensitive pH information on their aqueous environment with fluorescence colour changes covering the whole visible light range. At pH 9.0, quite exceptional white fluorescence could be observed for such water-soluble donor-loaded perylene vesicles.",2
Mechanically induced luminescence changes in molecular assemblies.,"Altering the shape and properties of a material through external factors such as heat, light, pressure, pH, electric or magnetic fields, or the introduction of a guest molecule, is an attractive prospect. In this Perspective, piezochromic luminescent materials - which change the colour of their luminescence in response to mechanical stimuli - are described. Such piezochromism has been observed for a few molecular materials that contain luminescent cores in liquid-crystalline and crystalline solid states, as well as for polymeric materials doped with dyes. These changes in photoluminescent colour can be activated by various types of mechanical pressure such as shearing, grinding or elongation, which can trigger different mechanisms of producing the colour. Such stimuli-responsive materials have potential for various applications, including sensors, memory and displays.",2
"Anefficient approach to chiral fullerene derivatives by catalytic enantioselective 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions.","Fullerene chirality is an important but undeveloped issue of paramount interest in fields such as materials science and medicinal chemistry. So far, enantiopure fullerene derivatives have been made from chiral starting materials or obtained by separating racemic mixtures. Here, we report the enantioselective catalytic synthesis of chiral pyrrolidinofullerenes (the most widely studied fullerene derivatives), which proceeds in high yields under very mild conditions at low temperatures. The combination of a particular metal catalyst-Ag(I) or Cu(II)-and a chiral ligand is able to direct the cycloaddition of buckminsterfullerene C(60), the first non-coordinating dipolarophile used in such reactions, to opposite enantiofaces of N-metallated azomethine ylides. This methodology has proven to be quite general, affording enantiomeric excesses of greater than 90%. Furthermore, well-defined chiral carbon atoms linked to the fullerene sphere are able to perturb the inherent symmetry of the fullerene pi-system as revealed by circular dichroism measurements.",2
Highly dynamic motion of crown ethers along oligolysine peptide chains.,"Molecular mobility has attracted considerable attention in supramolecular chemistry and biochemistry, but the simple question of whether a small molecule can move directly between different binding sites of a multitopic host without intermediate dissociation has not been addressed so far. To study such processes, we consider hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments on a model system comprising complexes formed between 18-crown-6 and oligolysine peptides. Because direct binding-site hopping is indistinguishable in solution from a dissociation/reassociation mechanism, here we show that the high vacuum of a mass spectrometer offers a unique environment for probing such processes. The highly dynamic motion of crown ethers along oligolysine peptide chains proceeds mechanistically by a simultaneous transfer of the crown ether from its ammonium ion binding site to a nearby amino group together with a proton. Furthermore, the exchange experiments unambiguously reveal the zwitterionic structure of the 18-crown-6/oligolysine complexes, highlighting the versatility and potential of gas-phase experiments for investigating non-covalent interactions.",2
Self-assembling nanoprobes that display off/on 19F nuclear magnetic resonance signals for protein detection and imaging.,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most promising techniques for the non-invasive visualization of biomarkers and biologically relevant species, both in vivo and ex vivo. Although (1)H MRI with paramagnetic contrast agents, such as Gd(3+) complexes and iron oxide, is widely used, it often suffers from low contrast because of the large background signals caused by the abundant distribution of protons in biological samples. Here we report the use of supramolecular organic nanoparticles to detect specific proteins by (19)F-based MRI in an off/on mode. In NMR spectroscopy these designed probes are silent when aggregated, but in the presence of a target protein they disassemble to produce a sharp signal. This 'turn-on' response allowed us to visualize clearly the protein within live cells by (19)F MRI and construct an in-cell inhibitor assay. This recognition-driven disassembly of nanoprobes for a turn-on (19)F signal is unprecedented and may extend the use of (19)F MRI for specific protein imaging.",2
Alloys of platinum and early transition metals as oxygen reduction electrocatalysts.,"The widespread use of low-temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells for mobile applications will require significant reductions in the amount of expensive Pt contained within their cathodes, which drive the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Although progress has been made in this respect, further reductions through the development of more active and stable electrocatalysts are still necessary. Here we describe a new set of ORR electrocatalysts consisting of Pd or Pt alloyed with early transition metals such as Sc or Y. They were identified using density functional theory calculations as being the most stable Pt- and Pd-based binary alloys with ORR activity likely to be better than Pt. Electrochemical measurements show that the activity of polycrystalline Pt(3)Sc and Pt(3)Y electrodes is enhanced relative to pure Pt by a factor of 1.5-1.8 and 6-10, respectively, in the range 0.9-0.87 V.",2
Total synthesis and study of 6-deoxyerythronolide B by late-stage C-H oxidation.,"Among the frontier challenges in chemistry in the twenty-first century are the interconnected goals of increasing synthetic efficiency and diversity in the construction of complex molecules. Oxidation reactions of C-H bonds, particularly when applied at late stages of complex molecule syntheses, hold special promise for achieving both these goals. Here we report a late-stage C-H oxidation strategy in the total synthesis of 6-deoxyerythronolide B (6-dEB), the aglycone precursor to the erythromycin antibiotics. An advanced intermediate is cyclized to give the 14-membered macrocyclic core of 6-dEB using a late-stage (step 19 of 22) C-H oxidative macrolactonization reaction that proceeds with high regio-, chemo- and diastereoselectivity (>40:1). A chelate-controlled model for macrolactonization predicted the stereochemical outcome of C-O bond formation and guided the discovery of conditions for synthesizing the first diastereomeric 13-epi-6-dEB precursor. Overall, this C-H oxidation strategy affords a highly efficient and stereochemically versatile synthesis of the erythromycin core.",2
Functional end groups for polymers prepared using ring-opening metathesis polymerization.,"The precise placement of functional groups on the chain-ends of macromolecules is a major focus of polymer research. Most common living polymerization techniques offer specific methods of end-functionalization governed by the active propagating species and the kinetics of the polymerization reaction. Ring-opening metathesis polymerization has established itself as one of the most functional-group-tolerant living polymerization techniques known, but this tolerance has limited the number of available functionalization reactions. Metathesis chemists have therefore been required to develop a variety of end-functionalizations, adapting each of them to the reactivity scheme of the particular catalysts used and the complexity of the group to be attached. This review presents an overview of the methods developed for different types and generations of metathesis catalysts that are typically used in such polymerizations. We also present a 'field guide' of functionalization methods highlighting the factors to be considered when choosing the most appropriate approach.",2
Ultrashort metal-metal distances and extreme bond orders.,"Chemical bonding is at the very heart of chemistry. Although main-group-element E-E' bond orders range up to triple bonds, higher formal bond orders are known between transition metals. Here we review recent developments related to the synthesis of formally quintuply bonded transition metals in coordination compounds, and their theoretical description. The quadruple bond fascinated chemists for about 40 years. Recently, a stable molecule containing a formal quintuple bond initiated a renaissance in synthesizing and understanding bonds with high bond orders. Ultrashort metal-metal distances as low as 1.73 A are one of the outcomes. First results indicate that the relevance of these bimetallic platforms to synthetic chemistry can be addressed through quintuple-bond reactivity studies. The theoretical description of the bonding situation in molecules with extreme bond orders has only just begun.",2
Decorated carbon nanotubes with unique oxygen sensitivity.,"The relatively simple and robust architecture of microelectronic devices based on carbon nanotubes, in conjunction with their environmental sensitivity, places them among the leading candidates for incorporation into ultraportable or wearable chemical analysis platforms. We used single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) networks to establish a mechanistic understanding of the solid-state oxygen sensitivity of a Eu(3+)-containing dendrimer complex. After illumination with 365 nm light, the SWNT networks decorated with the Eu(3+) dendrimer show bimodal (optical spectroscopic and electrical conductance) sensitivity towards oxygen gas at room temperature under ambient pressure. We investigated the mechanism of this unique oxygen sensitivity with time-resolved and steady-state optical spectroscopy, analysis of excited-state luminescence lifetimes and solid-state electrical transport measurements. We demonstrate a potential application of this system by showing a reversible and linear electrical response to oxygen gas in the tested range (5-27%).",2
Metal-free carbon-carbon bond-forming reductive coupling between boronic acids and tosylhydrazones.,"The formation of carbon-carbon bonds is a fundamental transformation in organic synthesis. In spite of the myriad methods available, advantageous methodologies in terms of selectivity, availability of starting materials, operational simplicity, functional-group tolerance, environmental sustainability and economy are in constant demand. In this context, the development of new cross-coupling reactions that use catalysts based on inexpensive and non-toxic metals is attracting increasing attention. Similarly, efficient processes that do not require a metal catalyst are of extraordinary interest. Here, we report a new and efficient metal-free carbon-carbon bond-forming coupling between tosylhydrazones and boronic acids. This reaction is very general and functional-group tolerant. As the required tosylhydrazones are easily generated from carbonyl compounds, it can be seen as a reductive coupling of carbonyls, a process of high synthetic relevance that requires several steps using other methodologies.",2
Cation-induced kinetic trapping and enhanced hydrogen adsorption in a modulated anionic metal-organic framework.,"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)--microporous materials constructed by bridging metal centres with organic ligands--show promise for applications in hydrogen storage, which is a key challenge in the development of the 'hydrogen economy'. Their adsorption capacities, however, have remained insufficient for practical applications, and thus strategies to enhance hydrogen-MOF interactions are required. Here we describe an anionic MOF material built from In(III) centres and tetracarboxylic acid ligands (H(4)L) in which kinetic trapping behaviour--where hydrogen is adsorbed at high pressures but not released immediately on lowering the pressure--is modulated by guest cations. With piperazinium dications in its pores, the framework exhibits hysteretic hydrogen adsorption. On exchange of these dications with lithium cations, no hysteresis is seen, but instead there is an enhanced adsorption capacity coupled to an increase in the isosteric heat of adsorption. This is rationalized by the different locations of the cations within the pores, determined with precision by X-ray crystallography.",2
The rational design of nitric oxide selectivity in single-walled carbon nanotube near-infrared fluorescence sensors for biological detection.,"A major challenge in the synthesis of nanotube or nanowire sensors is to impart selective analyte binding through means other than covalent linkages, which compromise electronic and optical properties. We synthesized a 3,4-diaminophenyl-functionalized dextran (DAP-dex) wrapping for single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) that imparts rapid and selective fluorescence detection of nitric oxide (NO), a messenger for biological signalling. The near-infrared (nIR) fluorescence of SWNT(DAP-dex) is immediately and directly bleached by NO, but not by other reactive nitrogen and oxygen species. This bleaching is reversible and shown to be caused by electron transfer from the top of the valence band of the SWNT to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of NO. The resulting optical sensor is capable of real-time and spatially resolved detection of NO produced by stimulating NO synthase in macrophage cells. We also demonstrate the potential of the optical sensor for in vivo detection of NO in a mouse model.",2
The role of non-covalent interactions in electrocatalytic fuel-cell reactions on platinum.,"The classic models of metal electrode-electrolyte interfaces generally focus on either covalent interactions between adsorbates and solid surfaces or on long-range electrolyte-metal electrostatic interactions. Here we demonstrate that these traditional models are insufficient. To understand electrocatalytic trends in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and the oxidation of methanol on platinum surfaces in alkaline electrolytes, non-covalent interactions must be considered. We find that non-covalent interactions between hydrated alkali metal cations M(+)(H(2)O)(x) and adsorbed OH (OH(ad)) species increase in the same order as the hydration energies of the corresponding cations (Li(+) >> Na(+) > K(+) > Cs(+)) and also correspond to an increase in the concentration of OH(ad)-M(+)(H(2)O)(x) clusters at the interface. These trends are inversely proportional to the activities of the ORR, the HOR and the oxidation of methanol on platinum (Cs(+) > K(+) > Na(+) >> Li(+)), which suggests that the clusters block the platinum active sites for electrocatalytic reactions.",2
The stabilization of fused-pentagon fullerene molecules.,"The isolated pentagon rule (IPR) is now widely accepted as a general rule for determining the stability of all-carbon fullerene cages composed of hexagons and pentagons. Fullerenes that violate this rule have been deemed too reactive to be synthesized. The stabilization of non-IPR endohedral fullerenes depends on charge transfer from the encapsulated metal clusters (endoclusters) to fullerene cages, the electronic properties of empty all-carbon cages, the matching size and geometries of fullerene and endocluster, as well as the strong coordination of the metal ions to fused pentagons. The stability of non-IPR exohedral fullerenes can be rationalized primarily by both the 'strain-relief' and 'local-aromaticity' principles. This Review focuses on recent work on stabilization of non-IPR fullerenes, including theoretical and empirical principles, experimental methods, and molecular structures of fused-pentagon fullerenes characterized so far. The special chemical properties of non-IPR fullerenes that distinguish them from IPR-satisfying ones are also emphasized.",2
Charge-shift bonding and its manifestations in chemistry.,"Electron-pair bonding is a central chemical paradigm. Here, we show that alongside the two classical covalent and ionic bond families, there exists a class of charge-shift (CS) bonds wherein the electron-pair fluctuation has the dominant role. Charge-shift bonding shows large covalent-ionic resonance interaction energy, and depleted charge densities, and features typical to repulsive interactions, albeit the bond itself may well be strong. This bonding type is rooted in a mechanism whereby the bond achieves equilibrium defined by the virial ratio. The CS bonding territory involves, for example, homopolar bonds of compact electronegative and/or lone-pair-rich elements, heteropolar bonds of these elements among themselves and with other atoms (for example, the metalloids, such as silicon and germanium), hypercoordinated molecules, and bonds whose covalent components are weakened by exchange-repulsion strain (as in [1.1.1]propellane). Here, we discuss experimental manifestations of CS bonding in chemistry, and outline new directions demonstrating the portability of the new concept.",2
Anion-tuning of supramolecular gel properties.,"The study of supramolecular gels has developed into a well-recognised field of materials science, pertaining to the general area of soft matter. The use of small molecules that aggregate through supramolecular interactions (such as hydrogen bonds, pi-pi interactions, coordination bonds and van der Waals interactions) has given materials scientists an alternative to polymeric compounds for the development of practical gels. There have been further attempts to functionalize, activate or control the physical properties of such gels by means of the reversibility of the interactions between the component molecules. Tuning of these characteristics has been accomplished by using mechanical, thermal, electrochemical, electromagnetic and chemical stimuli. The use of anions as a chemical stimulus has been a recent development and is the subject of this Perspective.",2
Visualizing and identifying single atoms using electron energy-loss spectroscopy with low accelerating voltage.,"Visualizing atoms and discriminating between those of different elements is a goal in many analytical techniques. The use of electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in such single-atom analyses is hampered by an inherent difficulty related to the damage caused to specimens by incident electrons. Here, we demonstrate the successful EELS single-atom spectroscopy of various metallofullerene-doped single-wall nanotubes (known as peapods) without massive structural destruction. This is achieved by using an incident electron probe with a low accelerating voltage (60 kV). Single calcium atoms inside the peapods were unambiguously identified for the first time using EELS. Elemental analyses of lanthanum, cerium and erbium atoms were also demonstrated, which shows that single atoms with adjacent atomic numbers can be successfully discriminated with this technique.",2
Drastic symmetry breaking in supramolecular organization of enantiomerically unbalanced monolayers at surfaces.,"There is considerable interest in skewing the transmission of chirality, or 'handedness', from the molecular to the supramolecular level so that single-handed superstructures are created from mixed enantiomer systems. One approach is to flip the chirality of all the molecular building blocks to the same handedness. However, manipulation of molecular chirality is not possible for non-interconvertible enantiomers, and mechanisms that skew such systems are unclear. Here, we track the molecule-to-supramolecular chiral transfer in such systems at the nanoscale by probing molecular monolayers at surfaces. Scanning tunnelling microscopy and theoretical modelling show that enantiomeric imbalances lead to nonlinear symmetry breaking in organization, driven by configurational entropy effects. Thus, the majority enantiomer readily organizes into its superstructure with the minority left fragmented and disorganized, and thus impeded from realizing its superstructure. Such effects promise new strategies in chiral separations and enantioselective processes, and may have contributed to the homochiral evolution of complex matter from prebiotic environments.",2
New insights into the structure and reduction of graphite oxide.,"Graphite oxide is one of the main precursors of graphene-based materials, which are highly promising for various technological applications because of their unusual electronic properties. Although epoxy and hydroxyl groups are widely accepted as its main functionalities, the complete structure of graphite oxide has remained elusive. By interpreting spectroscopic data in the context of the major functional groups believed to be present in graphite oxide, we now show evidence for the presence of five- and six-membered-ring lactols. On the basis of this chemical composition, we devised a complete reduction process through chemical conversion by sodium borohydride and sulfuric acid treatment, followed by thermal annealing. Only small amounts of impurities are present in the final product (less than 0.5 wt% of sulfur and nitrogen, compared with about 3 wt% with other chemical reductions). This method is particularly effective in the restoration of the pi-conjugated structure, and leads to highly soluble and conductive graphene materials.",2
Size-specific catalytic activity of platinum clusters enhances oxygen reduction reactions.,"Colloidal platinum nanoparticles with diameters of 2-5 nm on carbon supports are currently regarded as the best catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction. However, the particle size is limited by the conventional preparation methods that are used to synthesize small platinum particles; the inherent activity of ultrasmall nanoparticles has not yet been revealed. We present a practical synthesis for ultrafine subnanometre platinum clusters using a spherical macromolecular template with no disorder in molecular weight or structure. The template, a phenylazomethine dendrimer, offers control of the number of metal complexes in an assembly through stepwise complexation, allowing the complexes to accumulate in discrete nano-cages. Subsequent reduction of Pt(IV) chloride to Pt(0) results in the formation of platinum clusters composed of a defined number of atoms. As a result of exceptionally small particle size, the clusters exhibit very high catalytic activity for the four-electron reduction of oxygen molecules.",2
Metal-nucleic acid cages.,"Metal-nucleic acid cages are a promising new class of materials. Like metallo-supramolecular cages, these systems can use their metals for redox, photochemical, magnetic and catalytic control over encapsulated cargo. However, using DNA provides the potential to program pore size, geometry, chemistry and addressability, and the ability to symmetrically and asymmetrically position transition metals within the three-dimensional framework. Here we report the quantitative construction of metal-DNA cages, with the site-specific incorporation of a range of metals within a three-dimensional DNA architecture. Oligonucleotide strands containing specific environments suitable for transition-metal coordination were first organized into two DNA triangles. These triangles were then assembled into a DNA prism with linking strands. Metal centres were subsequently incorporated into the prisms at the pre-programmed locations. This unprecedented ability to position transition metals within a three-dimensional framework could lead to metal-DNA hosts with applications for the encapsulation, sensing, modification and release of biomolecules and nanomaterials.",2
A potential energy surface bifurcation in terpene biosynthesis.,"Terpenes comprise a class of natural products that includes molecules with thousands of distinct structurally and stereochemically complex molecular architectures. The core hydrocarbon frameworks of these molecules are constructed via carbocation rearrangements promoted by terpene synthase (cyclase) enzymes. Although many mechanistic details for such reactions have been uncovered, the factors that control which carbocation intermediates and transition-state structures form are not well understood. Here we show that rearrangement pathways that pass through particular transition-state structures can bifurcate after the transition state. The resulting pathways lead to terpenes with distinctly different skeletons from each other. Although these types of bifurcating pathways have been described previously for some small molecules, the possibility that they may have an important role in the production of complex molecules in nature has, to our knowledge, not previously been considered.",2
Sugar synthesis in a protocellular model leads to a cell signalling response in bacteria.,"The design of systems with life-like properties from simple chemical components may offer insights into biological processes, with the ultimate goal of creating an artificial chemical cell that would be considered to be alive. Most efforts to create artificial cells have concentrated on systems based on complex natural molecules such as DNA and RNA. Here we have constructed a lipid-bound protometabolism that synthesizes complex carbohydrates from simple feedstocks, which are capable of engaging the natural quorum sensing mechanism of the marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi and stimulating a proportional bioluminescent response. This encapsulated system may represent the first step towards the realization of a cellular 'mimic' and a starting point for 'bottom-up' designs of other chemical cells, which could perhaps display complex behaviours such as communication with natural cells.",2
Spin transition in a four-coordinate iron oxide.,"Spin transition has attracted the interest of researchers in various fields since the early 1930s, with thousands of examples now recognized, including those in minerals and biomolecules. However, so far the metal centres in which it has been found to occur are almost always octahedral six-coordinate 3d(4) to 3d(7) metals, such as Fe(II). A five-coordinate centre is only rarely seen. Here we report that under pressure SrFe(II)O(2), which features a four-fold square-planar coordination, exhibits a transition from high spin (S = 2) to intermediate spin (S = 1). This is accompanied by a transition from an antiferromagnetic insulating state to a ferromagnetic so-called half-metallic state: only half of the spin-down (d(xz),d(yz)) states are filled. These results highlight the square-planar coordinated iron oxides as a new class of magnetic and electric materials.",2
Molecular printing.,"Molecular printing techniques, which involve the direct transfer of molecules to a substrate with submicrometre resolution, have been extensively developed over the past decade and have enabled many applications. Arrays of features on this scale have been used to direct materials assembly, in nanoelectronics, and as tools for genetic analysis and disease detection. The past decade has witnessed the maturation of molecular printing led by two synergistic technologies: dip-pen nanolithography and soft lithography. Both are characterized by material and substrate flexibility, but dip-pen nanolithography has unlimited pattern design whereas soft lithography has limited pattern flexibility but is low in cost and has high throughput. Advances in DPN tip arrays and inking methods have increased the throughput and enabled applications such as multiplexed arrays. A new approach to molecular printing, polymer-pen lithography, achieves low-cost, high-throughput and pattern flexibility. This Perspective discusses the evolution and future directions of molecular printing.",2
Carboalumination of a chromium-chromium quintuple bond.,"Bonds are at the very heart of chemistry. Although the order of carbon-carbon bonds only extends to triple bonds, metal-metal bond orders of up to five are known for stable compounds, particularly between chromium atoms. Carbometallation and especially carboalumination reactions of carbon-carbon double and triple bonds are a well established synthetic protocol in organometallic chemistry and organic synthesis. We now extend these reactions to compounds containing chromium-chromium quintuple bonds. Analogous reactivity patterns indicate that such quintuple bonds are not as exotic as previously assumed. Yet the particularities of these reactions reflect the specific nature of the high metal-metal bond orders.",2
Bimetallic Pd(III) complexes in palladium-catalysed carbon-heteroatom bond formation.,"Palladium is a common transition metal for catalysis, and the fundamental organometallic reactivity of palladium in its 0, I, II and IV oxidation states is well established. The potential role of Pd(III) in catalysis has not been investigated because organometallic reactions that involve Pd(III) have not been reported previously. In this article we present the formation of carbon-heteroatom bonds from discrete bimetallic Pd(III) complexes and show the synergistic involvement of two palladium atoms of the bimetallic core during both oxidation and reductive elimination. Our results challenge the currently accepted mechanism for oxidative palladium catalysis via Pd(II)-Pd(IV) redox cycles and implicate bimetallic palladium complexes in redox catalysis. The new mechanistic insight provides an opportunity to explore rationally the potential of bimetallic palladium catalysis for synthesis.",2
Chemically blockable transformation and ultraselective low-pressure gas adsorption in a non-porous metal organic framework.,"Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are among the most exciting materials discovered recently, attracting particular attention for their gas-adsorption and -storage properties. Certain MOFs show considerable structural flexibility in response to various stimuli. Although there are several examples of 'breathing' MOFs, in which structural changes occur without any bond breaking, examples of transformations in which several bonds are broken and made are much rarer. In this paper we demonstrate how a flexible MOF, Cu2(OH)(C8H3O7S)(H2O)2H2O, can be synthesized by careful choice of the organic linker ligand. The flexibility can be controlled by addition of a supplementary coordinating molecule, which increases the thermal stability of the solid sufficiently for direct imaging with electron microscopy to be possible. We also demonstrate that the MOF shows unprecedented low-pressure selectivity towards nitric oxide through a coordination-driven gating mechanism. The chemical control over these behaviours offers new possibilities for the synthesis of MOFs with unusual and potentially exploitable properties.",2
Designer magnetic superatoms.,"The quantum states in metal clusters are grouped into bunches of close-lying eigenvalues, termed electronic shells, similar to those of atoms. Filling of the electronic shells with paired electrons results in local minima in energy to give stable species called magic clusters. This led to the realization that selected clusters mimic chemical properties of elemental atoms on the periodic table and can be classified as superatoms. So far the work on superatoms has focused on non-magnetic species. Here we propose a framework for magnetic superatoms by invoking systems that have both localized and delocalized electronic states, in which localized electrons stabilize magnetic moments and filled nearly-free electron shells lead to stable species. An isolated VCs(8) and a ligated MnAu(24)(SH)(18) are shown to be such magnetic superatoms. The magnetic superatoms' assemblies could be ideal for molecular electronic devices, as the coupling could be altered by charging or weak fields.",2
Coordination chemistry at carbon.,"Electron-rich allenes and heterocumulenes are commonly described by the regular notations of organic chemistry. Following on from published results and recent computational studies, we present here a host of crystallographic and reactivity data, as well as theoretical results, that indicate a highly non-canonical bonding situation in many members of this series. These must actually be interpreted as coordination compounds, in which carbon serves as a 'central atom' that interacts with its 'ligand sphere' via donor-acceptor bonds, even if these internal ligands themselves are carbon based. This captodative description is not limited to compounds that supposedly comprise a carbon(0) centre, a peculiar oxidation state that can be probed experimentally by geminal diauration. As the available data suggest that this unconventional interpretation of C-C and C-X bonds is more generally applicable than previously anticipated, it may well affect our understanding of organic chemistry in general.",2
Nanostructured functional materials prepared by atom transfer radical polymerization.,"Atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) is the most extensively studied controlled/living radical polymerization (CRP) method, with the interest originating primarily in its simplicity and broad applicability, and in the ability to prepare previously inaccessible well-defined nanostructured polymeric materials. This review illustrates the range of well-defined advanced functional materials that can be prepared by ATRP. We detail the precise synthesis of macromolecules with predetermined molecular weight, designed molecular weight distribution, controlled topology, composition and functionality. The materials include polymers with site-specific functionalities and novel architectures that are starting to find commercial application--such as stars, bottle brushes, block and gradient copolymers. This is followed by discussing their self-assembly into materials with nanoscale morphologies. These macromolecular engineering procedures provide new avenues to nanostructured functional materials for many high-value applications, for example as thermoplastic elastomers, coatings, surfactants, dispersants and as optoelectronic and biomedical materials.",2
"Metal-catalysed 1,2-diamination reactions.","The 1,2-diamine motif is present in a number of natural products with interesting biological activity and in many important pharmaceutical agents. Chiral 1,2-diamines are also widely used as the control elements in asymmetric synthesis and catalysis. Such compounds are thus an attractive target for the synthetic chemist. Although the diamination of an alkene seems an obvious route to these structures, far less research has been devoted to it than to the analogous dihydroxylation or aminohydroxylation reactions that are well-established processes in asymmetric synthesis. Here, we examine recent advances in metal-catalysed diamination reactions and their asymmetric variants. Given the prevalence of these structures, it seems likely that they will find extensive application in the construction of natural products and drug molecules in the near future.",2
Manipulating single-wall carbon nanotubes by chemical doping and charge transfer with perylene dyes.,"Single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are emerging as materials with much potential in several disciplines, in particular in electronics and photovoltaics. The combination of SWNTs with electron donors or acceptors generates active materials, which can produce electrical energy when irradiated. However, SWNTs are very elusive species when characterization of their metastable states is required. This problem mainly arises because of the polydispersive nature of SWNT samples and the inevitable presence of SWNTs in bundles of different sizes. Here, we report the complete and thorough characterization of an SWNT radical ion-pair state induced by complexation with a perylene dye, which combines excellent electron-accepting and -conducting features with a five-fused ring pi-system. At the same time, the perylene dye enables the dispersion of SWNTs by means of pi-pi interactions, which gives individual SWNTs in solution. This work clears a path towards electronic and optoelectronic devices in which regulated electrical transport properties are important.",2
Force-activated reactivity switch in a bimolecular chemical reaction.,"The effect of mechanical force on the free-energy surface that governs a chemical reaction is largely unknown. The combination of protein engineering with single-molecule force-clamp spectroscopy allows us to study the influence of mechanical force on the rate at which a protein disulfide bond is reduced by nucleophiles in a bimolecular substitution reaction (S(N)2). We found that cleavage of a protein disulfide bond by hydroxide anions exhibits an abrupt reactivity 'switch' at approximately 500 pN, after which the accelerating effect of force on the rate of an S(N)2 chemical reaction greatly diminishes. We propose that an abrupt force-induced conformational change of the protein disulfide bond shifts its ground state, drastically changing its reactivity in S(N)2 chemical reactions. Our experiments directly demonstrate the action of a force-activated switch in the chemical reactivity of a single molecule.",2
Chlorotrinitromethane and its exceptionally short carbon-chlorine bond.,"Compounds that deviate from the normal range of bonding can help to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the models currently used to describe chemical bonds. Furthermore, computer simulations of molecules require experimental data to describe accurately the energies and forces between interacting molecules. Compounds that contain the trinitromethyl group, with three nitro groups bonded to one carbon atom, show remarkable inter- and intramolecular effects. In this paper, we report the structural features of chlorotrinitromethane in the solid state and present the first reliable solid-state geometry parameters of an alpha-halogen derivative of the trinitromethyl pseudohalogen. We found several intriguing geometrical features in terms of intra- and intermolecular interactions, as well as an exceptionally short carbon-chlorine bond (1.694(1) A). Using a combined crystallographic and computational approach, we show that these effects can be described in terms of the computed electrostatic potential of the molecular surface.",2
Concise synthesis of ricciocarpin A and discovery of a more potent analogue.,"Cascade reactions enable the rapid build-up of molecular complexity from relatively simple starting materials. Both rapid construction and the ability to prepare related structures are crucial to the study of biological activities. Here, we report an efficient, highly enantioselective and diastereoselective total synthesis of ricciocarpin A. The key feature of the synthesis is a one-pot, three-step, organocatalytic reductive Michael-Tishchenko cascade. The conciseness and flexibility of this approach not only resulted in the synthesis of the natural product, but also of its antipode and four other structural analogues. A preliminary biological evaluation of these compounds identified an analogue with significantly improved molluscicidal activity.",2
Spongy chalcogels of non-platinum metals act as effective hydrodesulfurization catalysts.,"Aerogels are low-density porous materials, made mostly of air, for which hundreds of applications have been found in recent years. Inorganic oxide-based aerogels have been known for a long time, carbon aerogels were discovered in the early 1990s and sulfur- and selenium-based aerogels (chalcogels) are the most recent additions to this family. Here we present new aerogels made of Co(Ni)-Mo(W)-S networks with extremely large surface areas and porosity. These systems are formed by the coordinative reactions of (MoS(4))(2-) and (WS(4))(2-) with Co(2+) and Ni(2+) salts in non-aqueous solvents. We show that these low-density sponge-like networks can absorb conjugated organic molecules and mercury ions, and preferentially adsorb CO(2) over H(2), which illustrates their high potential as gas-separation media. The chalcogels are shown to be twice as active as the conventional sulfided Co-Mo/Al(2)O(3) catalyst for the hydrodesulfurization of thiophene.",2
Stellated polyhedral assembly of a topologically complicated Pd4L4 'Solomon cube'.,"Metallosupramolecular chemistry relies on self-assembly processes in which complicated species form through labile dative-covalent interactions. Two remarkable areas of this chemistry are the synthesis of topologically complicated threaded assemblies and of three-dimensional (3D) polyhedral assemblies. Very few polyhedral 3D metallosupramolecular assemblies show threaded motifs within them. Here we report an example of a new type of threaded 3D metallosupramolecular assembly built from four organic ligands and four palladium ions, a Pd(4)L(4) so-called 'Solomon's cube' in which interweaving and twisting of the ligands form both Solomon's links and figure-of-eight ring motifs. In the solid state, six of these Pd(4)L(4) tetramers assemble into a hollow spheroid that closely resembles a stellated truncated hexahedron.",2
Room-temperature molecular-resolution characterization of self-assembled organic monolayers on epitaxial graphene.,"Graphene, a two-dimensional sheet of carbon atoms, is a promising material for next-generation technology because of its advantageous electronic properties, such as extremely high carrier mobilities. However, chemical functionalization schemes are needed to integrate graphene with the diverse range of materials required for device applications. In this paper, we report self-assembled monolayers of the molecular semiconductor perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) formed on epitaxial graphene grown on the SiC(0001) surface. The molecules possess long-range order with a herringbone arrangement, as shown by ultra-high vacuum scanning tunnelling microscopy at room temperature. The molecular ordering is unperturbed by defects in the epitaxial graphene or atomic steps in the underlying SiC surface. Scanning tunnelling spectra of the PTCDA monolayer show distinct features that are not observed on pristine graphene. The demonstration of robust, uniform organic functionalization of epitaxial graphene presents opportunities for graphene-based molecular electronics and sensors.",2
Protecting-group-free synthesis as an opportunity for invention.,"The constant pressure to prepare compounds in a more efficient manner has placed the process by which traditional synthetic chemistry is conducted under scrutiny. Areas that have the potential to be improved must be highlighted and modified, so that we can approach the criterion of the 'ideal synthesis'. One area that offers this prospect is the minimization of the use of protecting groups in synthesis. A protection/deprotection event introduces at least two steps into a sequence, incurring costs from additional reagents and waste disposal, and generally leads to a reduced overall yield. Here we present relevant historical context and highlight recent (post-2004) total syntheses that have developed new chemistry in an effort to exclude protecting groups. The invention of chemoselective methodologies is crucial to the execution of 'protecting-group-free' synthesis, and recent advances in this area are also highlighted.",2
The rise of fragment-based drug discovery.,"The search for new drugs is plagued by high attrition rates at all stages in research and development. Chemists have an opportunity to tackle this problem because attrition can be traced back, in part, to the quality of the chemical leads. Fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) is a new approach, increasingly used in the pharmaceutical industry, for reducing attrition and providing leads for previously intractable biological targets. FBDD identifies low-molecular-weight ligands ( approximately 150 Da) that bind to biologically important macromolecules. The three-dimensional experimental binding mode of these fragments is determined using X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy, and is used to facilitate their optimization into potent molecules with drug-like properties. Compared with high-throughput-screening, the fragment approach requires fewer compounds to be screened, and, despite the lower initial potency of the screening hits, offers more efficient and fruitful optimization campaigns. Here, we review the rise of FBDD, including its application to discovering clinical candidates against targets for which other chemistry approaches have struggled.",2
Specific fluorogenic probes for ozone in biological and atmospheric samples.,"Ozone exposure is a growing global health problem, especially in urban areas. While ozone in the stratosphere protects the earth from harmful ultraviolet light, tropospheric or ground-level ozone is toxic and can damage the respiratory tract. It has recently been shown that ozone may be produced endogenously in inflammation and antibacterial responses of the immune system; however, these results have sparked controversy owing to the use of a non-specific colorimetric probe. Here we report the synthesis of fluorescent molecular probes able to unambiguously detect ozone in both biological and atmospheric samples. Unlike other ozone-detection methods, in which interference from different reactive oxygen species is often a problem, these probes are ozone specific. Such probes will prove useful for the study of ozone in environmental science and biology, and so possibly provide some insight into the role of ozone in cells.",2
Chiral imprinting of palladium with cinchona alkaloids.,"In the search for new materials and concepts in materials science, metallo-organic hybrids are attractive candidates; they can combine the rich diversity of organic molecules with the advantages of metals. Transition metals such as palladium are widely applied in catalysis, and small organic molecules such as those in the cinchona alkaloid family can control the stereochemistry of a number of organic reactions. Here, we show that reducing a metal salt in the presence of a cinchona alkaloid dopant gives a chirally imprinted metallo-organic hybrid material that is catalytically active and shows moderate enantioselectivity in hydrogenation. Furthermore, using photoelectron emission spectroscopy, we show that the metal retains some chiral character even after extraction of the dopant. This simple and effective methodology opens exciting opportunities for developing a variety of chiral composite materials.",2
Sequence-independent and rapid long-range charge transfer through DNA.,"Interest in using DNA as a building block for nanoelectronic sensors and devices stems from its efficient hole-conducting properties and the relative ease with which it can be organized into predictable nanometre-sized two- and three-dimensional structures. However, because a hole migrates along DNA through the highest occupied molecular orbital of the guanine bases, its conductivity decreases as the adenine-thymine base-pair content increases. This means that there are limitations on what sequences can be used to construct functional nanoelectronic circuits, particularly those rich in adenine-thymine pairs. Here we show that the charge-transfer efficiency can be dramatically increased in a manner independent of guanine-cytosine content by adjusting the highest occupied molecular orbital level of the adenine-thymine base pair to be closer to that of the guanine-cytosine pair. This is achieved by substituting the N7 nitrogen atom of adenine with a C-H group to give 7-deazaadenine, which does not disturb the complementary base pairing observed in DNA.",2
G-quadruplex self-assembly regulated by Coulombic interactions.,"Self-assembly offers the possibility to organize molecules in a given architecture through a subtle interplay between different noncovalent interactions. Although the kind of molecular association can often be predicted from information present in the individual molecules, the synthesis of supramolecular assemblies having a perfectly defined size and shape remains challenging. Here, we introduce the use of Coulombic interactions to control the supramolecular synthesis of finite, well-defined nanostructures. In particular, we demonstrate that the energy associated with the separation of ion pairs can regulate very precisely guanosine self-assembly into discrete G-quadruplexes. Assemblies comprising 8, 12, 16 or 24 guanosine molecules can be selectively and quantitatively obtained simply by tuning the stabilization of the dissociated anions in the solvent environment. Thus, factors such as solvent polarity, the nature of the anion and the cation-anion distance are shown to have a decisive role in the growth of G-quadruplexes.",2
Using small molecules to facilitate exchange of bicarbonate and chloride anions across liposomal membranes.,"Bicarbonate is involved in a wide range of biological processes, which include respiration, regulation of intracellular pH and fertilization. In this study we use a combination of NMR spectroscopy and ion-selective electrode techniques to show that the natural product prodigiosin, a tripyrrolic molecule produced by microorganisms such as Streptomyces and Serratia, facilitates chloride/bicarbonate exchange (antiport) across liposomal membranes. Higher concentrations of simple synthetic molecules based on a 4,6-dihydroxyisophthalamide core are also shown to facilitate this antiport process. Although it is well known that proteins regulate Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchange in cells, these results suggest that small molecules may also be able to regulate the concentration of these anions in biological systems.",2
Activating catalysts with mechanical force.,"Homogeneously catalysed reactions can be 'switched on' by activating latent catalysts. Usually, activation is brought about by heat or an external chemical agent. However, activation of homogeneous catalysts with a mechanical trigger has not been demonstrated. Here, we introduce a general method to activate latent catalysts by mechanically breaking bonds between a metal and one of its ligands. We have found that silver(I) complexes of polymer-functionalized N-heterocyclic carbenes, which are latent organocatalysts, catalyse a transesterification reaction when exposed to ultrasound in solution. Furthermore, ultrasonic activation of a ruthenium biscarbene complex with appended polymer chains results in catalysis of olefin metathesis reactions. In each case, the catalytic activity results from ligand dissociation, brought about by transfer of mechanical forces from the polymeric substituents to the coordination bond. Mechanochemical catalyst activation has potential applications in transduction and amplification of mechanical signals, and mechanically initiated polymerizations hold promise as a novel repair mechanism in self-healing materials.",2
A unique approach to aldol products for the creation of all-carbon quaternary stereocentres.,"Among the challenges facing asymmetric synthesis the selective construction of quaternary stereogenic centres, particularly those bearing all-carbon substituents, stands out. The aldol reaction has the potential to create such stereocentres, but, despite the many advances in this field, a highly selective and efficient procedure has remained elusive. Here we show that, by choosing an alternative retrosynthetic approach, such products can be prepared in a highly selective fashion. Through the consecutive addition of several organometallic derivatives, an allylzinc reagent is prepared and, on addition to an aldehyde, an aldol-type product is created. The one-pot operation involves the construction of three new carbon-carbon bonds and the formation of an all-carbon quaternary stereocentre. The products of the reaction are amenable to downstream modification, and the procedure should find applications in the fields of natural product synthesis and drug discovery.",2
A tri-continuous mesoporous material with a silica pore wall following a hexagonal minimal surface.,"Ordered porous materials with unique pore structures and pore sizes in the mesoporous range (2-50 nm) have many applications in catalysis, separation and drug delivery. Extensive research has resulted in mesoporous materials with one-dimensional, cage-like and bi-continuous pore structures. Three families of bi-continuous mesoporous materials have been made, with two interwoven but unconnected channels, corresponding to the liquid crystal phases used as templates. Here we report a three-dimensional hexagonal mesoporous silica, IBN-9, with a tri-continuous pore structure that is synthesized using a specially designed cationic surfactant template. IBN-9 consists of three identical continuous interpenetrating channels, which are separated by a silica wall that follows a hexagonal minimal surface. Such a tri-continuous mesostructure was predicted mathematically, but until now has not been observed in real materials.",2
Mobius aromaticity and antiaromaticity in expanded porphyrins.,"Aromaticity is a key concept in chemistry, dating back to Faraday's discovery of benzene in 1825 and Kekule's famous alternating-double-bond structure of 1865. In 1858, the Mobius strip was discovered by Mobius and Listing. The Huckel rules for predicting aromaticity, stating that [4n + 2] pi electrons result in an aromatic system, work for planar molecules. Although molecules with Mobius geometry are not found in nature, chemists have tried to synthesize such molecules since the first theoretical prediction by Heilbronner in 1964 and the prediction of Mobius aromaticity for suitable compounds with [4n] pi electrons. However, Mobius-aromatic molecules have proved difficult to synthesize, and sometimes even to identify. Here we summarize recent contributions of several research groups that have succeeded in synthesizing Mobius-type molecules. The results of this survey lead us to suggest that the generation of Mobius topologies in expanded porphyrins is easier than hitherto appreciated.",2
Compressed alkanes in reversible encapsulation complexes.,"Simple alkanes feature fully extended conformations as their lowest-energy shapes but can assume coiled, compressed conformations in small spaces. A series of normal alkanes, C(16) to C(19), were encapsulated in self-assembled, hydrogen-bonded complexes. Coiling of the longer alkanes was observed by NMR spectroscopy. The coiling exerts pressure on the interior; the hydrogen bonding seams are loosened, and rotation of the capsule's components occurs on the NMR timescale. The rotation results in interconversion of mirror-image capsule assemblies (racemization). The racemization rates were determined and shown to increase with the length of the alkane, the longer alkanes exerting more pressure. Free energies of activation for racemization were determined at the coalescence temperatures, and were DeltaGdouble dagger = 15.7, 16.7 and 17.2 kcal mol(-1) for C(19), C(18) and C(17), respectively. The shorter C(16) was encapsulated in its fully extended conformation, and does not seem to exert pressure inside the capsule.",2
Polymer nanofibre junctions of attolitre volume serve as zeptomole-scale chemical reactors.,"Methods allowing chemical reactions to be carried out on ultra-small scales in a controllable fashion are potentially important for a number of disciplines, including molecular electronics, photonics and molecular biology, and may provide fundamental insight into chemistry in confined spaces. Ultra-small-scale reactions also circumvent potential problems associated with reagent and product toxicity, and reduce energy consumption and waste generation. Here, we report a technique for performing chemical reactions on a zeptomole (10(-21) mol) scale. We show that electrospun polymer nanofibres with a diameter of 100-300 nm can be loaded with reactants, and that the junctions formed between crossed nanofibres can function as attolitre-volume reactors. Exposure to heat or solvent vapours fuses the fibres and initiates the reaction. The reaction products can be analysed directly within the nanofibre junctions by fluorescence measurements and mass spectrometry, and solvent extraction of multiple reactors allows product identification by common micromethods such as high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.",2
Halogen bonds as orthogonal molecular interactions to hydrogen bonds.,"Halogen bonds (X-bonds) are shown to be geometrically perpendicular to and energetically independent of hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) that share a common carbonyl oxygen acceptor. This orthogonal relationship is accommodated by the in-plane and out-of-plane electronegative potentials of the oxygen, which are differentially populated by H- and X-bonds. Furthermore, the local conformation of a peptide helps to define the geometry of the H-bond and thus the oxygen surface that is accessible for X-bonding. These electrostatic and steric forces conspire to impose a strong preference for the orthogonal geometry of X- and H-bonds. Thus, the optimum geometry of an X-bond can be predicted from the pattern of H-bonds in a folded protein, enabling X-bonds to be introduced to improve ligand affinities without disrupting these structurally important interactions. This concept of orthogonal molecular interactions can be exploited for the rational design of halogenated ligands as inhibitors and drugs, and in biomolecular engineering.",2
Imaging intracellular viscosity of a single cell during photoinduced cell death.,"Diffusion-mediated cellular processes, such as metabolism, signalling and transport, depend on the hydrodynamic properties of the intracellular matrix. Photodynamic therapy, used in the treatment of cancer, relies on the generation of short-lived cytotoxic agents within a cell on irradiation of a drug. The efficacy of this treatment depends on the viscosity of the medium through which the cytotoxic agent must diffuse. Here, spectrally resolved fluorescence measurements of a porphyrin-dimer-based molecular rotor are used to quantify intracellular viscosity changes in single cells. We show that there is a dramatic increase in the viscosity of the immediate environment of the rotor on photoinduced cell death. The effect of this viscosity increase is observed directly in the diffusion-dependent kinetics of the photosensitized formation and decay of a key cytotoxic agent, singlet molecular oxygen. Using these tools, we provide insight into the dynamics of diffusion in cells, which is pertinent to drug delivery, cell signalling and intracellular mass transport.",2
Catalytic behaviour of dense hot water.,"Water is known to exhibit fascinating physical properties at high pressure and temperature. Its remarkable structural and phase complexities suggest the possibility of exotic chemical reactivity under extreme conditions, although this remains largely unstudied. Detonations of high explosives containing oxygen and hydrogen produce water at thousands of kelvin and tens of gigapascals, similar to conditions in the interiors of giant planets. These systems thus provide a unique means of elucidating the chemistry of 'extreme water'. Here, we show that water has an unexpected role in catalysing complex explosive reactions--contrary to the current view that it is simply a stable detonation product. Using first-principles atomistic simulations of the detonation of the high explosive pentaerythritol tetranitrate, we discovered that H(2)O (source), H (reducer) and OH (oxidizer) act as a dynamic team that transports oxygen between reaction centres. Our finding suggests that water may catalyse reactions in other explosives and in planetary interiors.",2
Minimal nucleotide duplex formation in water through enclathration in self-assembled hosts.,"Short nucleotide fragments such as mono- and dinucleotides are generally unable to form stable hydrogen-bonded base pairs or duplexes in water. Within the hydrophobic pockets of enzymes, however, even short fragments form stable duplexes to transmit genetic information. Here, we demonstrate the efficient formation of hydrogen-bonded base pairs from mononucleotides in water through enclathration in the hydrophobic cavities of self-assembled cages. Crystallographic studies and 1H- and 15N-NMR spectroscopy clearly reveals pair-selective recognition of mononucleotides and the selective formation of an anti-Hoogsteen-type base pair in the cage's cavity. Within an analogous expanded cage, dinucleotides are also found to form a stable duplex in water. These results emphasize how hydrogen-bonded base pairing is amplified in a local hydrophobic area isolated from aqueous solution.",2
Spontaneous assembly and real-time growth of micrometre-scale tubular structures from polyoxometalate-based inorganic solids.,"We report the spontaneous and rapid growth of micrometre-scale tubes from crystals of a metal oxide-based inorganic solid when they are immersed in an aqueous solution containing a low concentration of an organic cation. A membrane immediately forms around the crystal, and this membrane then forms micrometre-scale tubes that grow with vast aspect ratios at controllable rates along the surface on which the crystal is placed. The tubes are composed of an amorphous mixture of polyoxometalate-based anions and organic cations. It is possible for liquid to flow through the tubes, and for the direction of growth and the overall tube diameter to be controlled. We demonstrate that tube growth is driven by osmotic pressure within the membrane sack around the crystal, which ruptures to release the pressure. These robust, self-growing, micrometre-scale tubes offer opportunities in many areas, including the growth of microfluidic devices and the self-assembly of metal oxide-based semipermeable membranes for diverse applications.",2
Towards the computational design of solid catalysts.,"Over the past decade the theoretical description of surface reactions has undergone a radical development. Advances in density functional theory mean it is now possible to describe catalytic reactions at surfaces with the detail and accuracy required for computational results to compare favourably with experiments. Theoretical methods can be used to describe surface chemical reactions in detail and to understand variations in catalytic activity from one catalyst to another. Here, we review the first steps towards using computational methods to design new catalysts. Examples include screening for catalysts with increased activity and catalysts with improved selectivity. We discuss how, in the future, such methods may be used to engineer the electronic structure of the active surface by changing its composition and structure.",2
The 'wired' universe of organic chemistry.,"The millions of reactions performed and compounds synthesized by organic chemists over the past two centuries connect to form a network larger than the metabolic networks of higher organisms and rivalling the complexity of the World Wide Web. Despite its apparent randomness, the network of chemistry has a well-defined, modular architecture. The network evolves in time according to trends that have not changed since the inception of the discipline, and thus project into chemistry's future. Analysis of organic chemistry using the tools of network theory enables the identification of most 'central' organic molecules, and for the prediction of which and how many molecules will be made in the future. Statistical analyses based on network connectivity are useful in optimizing parallel syntheses, in estimating chemical reactivity, and more.",2
Asymmetric total syntheses of (+)- and (-)-versicolamide B and biosynthetic implications.,"The Diels-Alder reaction is one of the most well-studied, synthetically useful organic transformations. While a significant number of naturally occurring substances are postulated to arise by biosynthetic Diels-Alder reactions, rigorous confirmation of a mechanistically distinct natural Diels-Alderase enzyme remains elusive. Within this context, several related fungi within the Aspergillus genus produce a number of metabolites of opposite absolute configuration including (+)- or (-)-versicolamide B. These alkaloids are hypothesized to arise via biosynthetic Diels-Alder reactions implying that each Aspergillus species possesses enantiomerically distinct Diels-Alderases. Herein, experimental validation of these biosynthetic proposals via deployment of the IMDA reaction as a key step in the asymmetric total syntheses of (+)- and (-)-versicolamide B is described. Laboratory validation of the proposed biosynthetic Diels-Alder construction, coupled with the secondary metabolite profile of the producing fungi, reveals that each Aspergillus species has evolved enantiomerically distinct indole oxidases, as well as enantiomerically distinct Diels-Alderases.",2
