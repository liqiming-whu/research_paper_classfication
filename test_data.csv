Autoubiquitination of the Hrd1 Ligase Triggers Protein Retrotranslocation in ERAD.,"Misfolded proteins of the ER are retrotranslocated to the cytosol, where they are polyubiquitinated, extracted from the membrane, and degraded by the proteasome. To investigate how the ER-associated Degradation (ERAD) machinery can accomplish retrotranslocation of a misfolded luminal protein domain across a lipid bilayer, we have reconstituted retrotranslocation with purified S. cerevisiae proteins, using proteoliposomes containing the multi-spanning ubiquitin ligase Hrd1. Retrotranslocation of the luminal domain of a membrane-spanning substrate is triggered by autoubiquitination of Hrd1. Substrate ubiquitination is a subsequent event, and the Cdc48 ATPase that completes substrate extraction from the membrane is not required for retrotranslocation. Ubiquitination of lysines in Hrd1's RING-finger domain is required for substrate retrotranslocation in vitro and for ERAD in vivo. Our results suggest that Hrd1 forms a ubiquitin-gated protein-conducting channel.",1
Origins of Allostery and Evolvability in Proteins: A Case Study.,"Proteins display the capacity for adaptation to new functions, a property critical for evolvability. But what structural principles underlie the capacity for adaptation? Here, we show that adaptation to a physiologically distinct class of ligand specificity in a PSD95, DLG1, ZO-1 (PDZ) domain preferentially occurs through class-bridging intermediate mutations located distant from the ligand-binding site. These mutations provide a functional link between ligand classes and demonstrate the principle of ""conditional neutrality"" in mediating evolutionary adaptation. Structures show that class-bridging mutations work allosterically to open up conformational plasticity at the active site, permitting novel functions while retaining existing function. More generally, the class-bridging phenotype arises from mutations in an evolutionarily conserved network of coevolving amino acids in the PDZ family (the sector) that connects the active site to distant surface sites. These findings introduce the concept that allostery in proteins could have its origins not in protein function but in the capacity to adapt.",1
SnapShot: Mechanosensing Matrix.,"Cells sense and respond to properties of their microenvironment that can affect cell morphology, protein levels and localization, gene expression, and even nuclear integrity. Tissue micro-stiffness, largely influenced by extracellular matrix, varies dramatically within an organism and can be a useful parameter to both clarify and organize a wide range of cell and molecular processes, such as genomic changes in cancer.",1
Microbial Reconstitution Reverses Maternal Diet-Induced Social and Synaptic Deficits in Offspring.,"Maternal obesity during pregnancy has been associated with increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), in offspring. Here, we report that maternal high-fat diet (MHFD) induces a shift in microbial ecology that negatively impacts offspring social behavior. Social deficits and gut microbiota dysbiosis in MHFD offspring are prevented by co-housing with offspring of mothers on a regular diet (MRD) and transferable to germ-free mice. In addition, social interaction induces synaptic potentiation (LTP) in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of MRD, but not MHFD offspring. Moreover, MHFD offspring had fewer oxytocin immunoreactive neurons in the hypothalamus. Using metagenomics and precision microbiota reconstitution, we identified a single commensal strain that corrects oxytocin levels, LTP, and social deficits in MHFD offspring. Our findings causally link maternal diet, gut microbial imbalance, VTA plasticity, and behavior and suggest that probiotic treatment may relieve specific behavioral abnormalities associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",1
Near-Perfect Synaptic Integration by Nav1.7 in Hypothalamic Neurons Regulates Body Weight.,"Neurons are well suited for computations on millisecond timescales, but some neuronal circuits set behavioral states over long time periods, such as those involved in energy homeostasis. We found that multiple types of hypothalamic neurons, including those that oppositely regulate body weight, are specialized as near-perfect synaptic integrators that summate inputs over extended timescales. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) are greatly prolonged, outlasting the neuronal membrane time-constant up to 10-fold. This is due to the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7 (Scn9a), previously associated with pain-sensation but not synaptic integration. Scn9a deletion in AGRP, POMC, or paraventricular hypothalamic neurons reduced EPSP duration, synaptic integration, and altered body weight in mice. In vivo whole-cell recordings in the hypothalamus confirmed near-perfect synaptic integration. These experiments show that integration of synaptic inputs over time by Nav1.7 is critical for body weight regulation and reveal a mechanism for synaptic control of circuits regulating long term homeostatic functions.",1
A Long Noncoding RNA lincRNA-EPS Acts as a Transcriptional Brake to Restrain Inflammation.,"Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression. Although lincRNAs are expressed in immune cells, their functions in immunity are largely unexplored. Here, we identify an immunoregulatory lincRNA, lincRNA-EPS, that is precisely regulated in macrophages to control the expression of immune response genes (IRGs). Transcriptome analysis of macrophages from lincRNA-EPS-deficient mice, combined with gain-of-function and rescue experiments, revealed a specific role for this lincRNA in restraining IRG expression. Consistently, lincRNA-EPS-deficient mice manifest enhanced inflammation and lethality following endotoxin challenge in vivo. lincRNA-EPS localizes at regulatory regions of IRGs to control nucleosome positioning and repress transcription. Further, lincRNA-EPS mediates these effects by interacting with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L via a CANACA motif located in its 3' end. Together, these findings identify lincRNA-EPS as a repressor of inflammatory responses, highlighting the importance of lincRNAs in the immune system.",1
The Extracellular Surface of the GLP-1 Receptor Is a Molecular Trigger for Biased Agonism.,"Ligand-directed signal bias offers opportunities for sculpting molecular events, with the promise of better, safer therapeutics. Critical to the exploitation of signal bias is an understanding of the molecular events coupling ligand binding to intracellular signaling. Activation of class B G protein-coupled receptors is driven by interaction of the peptide N terminus with the receptor core. To understand how this drives signaling, we have used advanced analytical methods that enable separation of effects on pathway-specific signaling from those that modify agonist affinity and mapped the functional consequence of receptor modification onto three-dimensional models of a receptor-ligand complex. This yields molecular insights into the initiation of receptor activation and the mechanistic basis for biased agonism. Our data reveal that peptide agonists can engage different elements of the receptor extracellular face to achieve effector coupling and biased signaling providing a foundation for rational design of biased agonists.",1
Engineered Bispecific Antibodies with Exquisite HIV-1-Neutralizing Activity.,"While the search for an efficacious HIV-1 vaccine remains elusive, emergence of a new generation of virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has re-ignited the field of passive immunization for HIV-1 prevention. However, the plasticity of HIV-1 demands additional improvements to these mAbs to better ensure their clinical utility. Here, we report engineered bispecific antibodies that are the most potent and broad HIV-neutralizing antibodies to date. One bispecific antibody, 10E8V2.0/iMab, neutralized 118 HIV-1 pseudotyped viruses tested with a mean 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.002 mug/mL. 10E8V2.0/iMab also potently neutralized 99% of viruses in a second panel of 200 HIV-1 isolates belonging to clade C, the dominant subtype accounting for approximately 50% of new infections worldwide. Importantly, 10E8V2.0/iMab reduced virus load substantially in HIV-1-infected humanized mice and also provided complete protection when administered prior to virus challenge. These bispecific antibodies hold promise as novel prophylactic and/or therapeutic agents in the fight against HIV-1.",1
Bispecific Anti-HIV-1 Antibodies with Enhanced Breadth and Potency.,"Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) suppress viremia in animal models of HIV-1 and humans. To achieve potent activity without the emergence of viral escape mutants, co-administration of different bNAbs is necessary to target distinct epitopes essential for viral fitness. Here, we report the development of bispecific anti-Env neutralizing antibodies (biNAbs) with potent activity. Synergistic activity of biNAbs was achieved by combining an engineered hinge domain of IgG3 to increase Fab domain flexibility necessary for hetero-bivalent binding to the Env trimer while retaining the functional properties of the IgG1-Fc. Compared to unmodified biNAbs, hinge domain variants exhibited substantially improved neutralization activity, with particular combinations showing evidence of synergistic neutralization potency in vitro and enhanced in vivo therapeutic activity in HIV-1-infected humanized mice. These findings suggest innovative strategies for generating biNAbs with enhanced neutralization breadth and potency, representing ideal candidate molecules for the control of HIV-1 infection.",1
The Molecular and Cellular Choreography of Appendage Regeneration.,"Recent advances in limb regeneration are revealing the molecular events that integrate growth control, cell fate programming, and positional information to yield the exquisite replacement of the amputated limb. Parallel progress in several invertebrate and vertebrate models has provided a broader context for understanding the mechanisms and the evolution of regeneration. Together, these discoveries provide a foundation for describing the principles underlying regeneration of complex, multi-tissue structures. As such these findings should provide a wealth of ideas for engineers seeking to reconstitute regeneration from constituent parts or to elicit full regeneration from partial regeneration events.",1
Modeling Development and Disease with Organoids.,"Recent advances in 3D culture technology allow embryonic and adult mammalian stem cells to exhibit their remarkable self-organizing properties, and the resulting organoids reflect key structural and functional properties of organs such as kidney, lung, gut, brain and retina. Organoid technology can therefore be used to model human organ development and various human pathologies 'in a dish."" Additionally, patient-derived organoids hold promise to predict drug response in a personalized fashion. Organoids open up new avenues for regenerative medicine and, in combination with editing technology, for gene therapy. The many potential applications of this technology are only beginning to be explored.",1
Stem Cells: A Renaissance in Human Biology Research.,"The understanding of human biology and how it relates to that of other species represents an ancient quest. Limited access to human material, particularly during early development, has restricted researchers to only scratching the surface of this inherently challenging subject. Recent technological innovations, such as single cell ""omics"" and human stem cell derivation, have now greatly accelerated our ability to gain insights into uniquely human biology. The opportunities afforded to delve molecularly into scarce material and to model human embryogenesis and pathophysiological processes are leading to new insights of human development and are changing our understanding of disease and choice of therapy options.",1
Catching the Brain in the Act.,"Understanding how genes within cells, and cells within circuits, function together to produce the extraordinary repertoire of animal behaviors is arguably one of the most challenging undertakings in neuroscience. Two papers in this issue move toward this goal via 3D imaging of active neurons across the entire mouse brain.",1
Slowly Building Excitement.,"While some neurons are tuned to integrate fast and precisely timed inputs, others set behavioral states on much slower timescales. In this issue of Cell, Branco et al. demonstrate that body weight is regulated by hypothalamic neurons using a highly effective form of slow synaptic integration, which is mediated by the voltage gated sodium channel Nav1.7.",1
Think You Know How Smell Works? Sniff Again.,"The sense of smell is mediated by GPCRs in the odorant receptor (OR) family. Greer et al. report a new family of odor detectors, MS4As, that have similar cellular localization and chemodetection ability as ORs but are not GPCRs and follow a strikingly different logic of odor coding at the periphery.",1
Colonic Crypts: Safe Haven from Microbial Products.,"The notion that the colon's deep crypt pockets provide a protected location that shields stem cells from potentially toxic substances is widely accepted. In this issue of Cell, Kaiko et al. reveal how a metabolite abundantly produced by the gut microbiota can inhibit stem cell proliferation but is blocked from doing so by crypt architecture.",1

Targeting Disease through Metabolism.,"The links between cellular and systemic metabolism and different pathologies, including cancer, are on the rise. Cell editor Lara Szewczak asked Doug Green, Ralph DeBerardinis, and Mark Febbraio about what the prospects are for being able to target metabolism therapeutically. An annotated excerpt of the conversation appears below, and the full conversation is available with the article online.",1
A BH3 Mimetic for Killing Cancer Cells.,"Venetoclax is a BH3 mimetic approved for treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Cancer cells are resistant to apoptosis but ""primed for death"" by elevated BCL-2, which binds to pro-apoptotic proteins and holds them in check. Venetoclax releases this antagonism and is the first approved drug to target a protein-protein interaction.",1
Breaking Out of the Academic Pipeline.,"For many graduate students, the academic path may not be the best fit, and with limited faculty positions available, many students are now looking to other career possibilities. University programs are helping students to explore and pursue alternative careers.",1
Discovery of an Active RAG Transposon Illuminates the Origins of V(D)J Recombination.,"Co-option of RAG1 and RAG2 for antigen receptor gene assembly by V(D)J recombination was a crucial event in the evolution of jawed vertebrate adaptive immunity. RAG1/2 are proposed to have arisen from a transposable element, but definitive evidence for this is lacking. Here, we report the discovery of ProtoRAG, a DNA transposon family from lancelets, the most basal extant chordates. A typical ProtoRAG is flanked by 5-bp target site duplications and a pair of terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) resembling V(D)J recombination signal sequences. Between the TIRs reside tail-to-tail-oriented, intron-containing RAG1-like and RAG2-like genes. We demonstrate that ProtoRAG was recently active in the lancelet germline and that the lancelet RAG1/2-like proteins can mediate TIR-dependent transposon excision, host DNA recombination, transposition, and low-efficiency TIR rejoining using reaction mechanisms similar to those used by vertebrate RAGs. We propose that ProtoRAG represents a molecular ""living fossil"" of the long-sought RAG transposon.",1
Enhancer Control of Transcriptional Bursting.,"Transcription is episodic, consisting of a series of discontinuous bursts. Using live-imaging methods and quantitative analysis, we examine transcriptional bursting in living Drosophila embryos. Different developmental enhancers positioned downstream of synthetic reporter genes produce transcriptional bursts with similar amplitudes and duration but generate very different bursting frequencies, with strong enhancers producing more bursts than weak enhancers. Insertion of an insulator reduces the number of bursts and the corresponding level of gene expression, suggesting that enhancer regulation of bursting frequency is a key parameter of gene control in development. We also show that linked reporter genes exhibit coordinated bursting profiles when regulated by a shared enhancer, challenging conventional models of enhancer-promoter looping.",1
Digestion of Chromatin in Apoptotic Cell Microparticles Prevents Autoimmunity.,"Antibodies to DNA and chromatin drive autoimmunity in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Null mutations and hypomorphic variants of the secreted deoxyribonuclease DNASE1L3 are linked to familial and sporadic SLE, respectively. We report that DNASE1L3-deficient mice rapidly develop autoantibodies to DNA and chromatin, followed by an SLE-like disease. Circulating DNASE1L3 is produced by dendritic cells and macrophages, and its levels inversely correlate with anti-DNA antibody response. DNASE1L3 is uniquely capable of digesting chromatin in microparticles released from apoptotic cells. Accordingly, DNASE1L3-deficient mice and human patients have elevated DNA levels in plasma, particularly in circulating microparticles. Murine and human autoantibody clones and serum antibodies from human SLE patients bind to DNASE1L3-sensitive chromatin on the surface of microparticles. Thus, extracellular microparticle-associated chromatin is a potential self-antigen normally digested by circulating DNASE1L3. The loss of this tolerance mechanism can contribute to SLE, and its restoration may represent a therapeutic opportunity in the disease.",1
Restricted Location of PSEN2/gamma-Secretase Determines Substrate Specificity and Generates an Intracellular Abeta Pool.,"gamma-Secretases are a family of intramembrane-cleaving proteases involved in various signaling pathways and diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cells co-express differing gamma-secretase complexes, including two homologous presenilins (PSENs). We examined the significance of this heterogeneity and identified a unique motif in PSEN2 that directs this gamma-secretase to late endosomes/lysosomes via a phosphorylation-dependent interaction with the AP-1 adaptor complex. Accordingly, PSEN2 selectively cleaves late endosomal/lysosomal localized substrates and generates the prominent pool of intracellular Abeta that contains longer Abeta; familial AD (FAD)-associated mutations in PSEN2 increased the levels of longer Abeta further. Moreover, a subset of FAD mutants in PSEN1, normally more broadly distributed in the cell, phenocopies PSEN2 and shifts its localization to late endosomes/lysosomes. Thus, localization of gamma-secretases determines substrate specificity, while FAD-causing mutations strongly enhance accumulation of aggregation-prone Abeta42 in intracellular acidic compartments. The findings reveal potentially important roles for specific intracellular, localized reactions contributing to AD pathogenesis.",1
Forces Driving Chaperone Action.,"It is still unclear what molecular forces drive chaperone-mediated protein folding. Here, we obtain a detailed mechanistic understanding of the forces that dictate the four key steps of chaperone-client interaction: initial binding, complex stabilization, folding, and release. Contrary to the common belief that chaperones recognize unfolding intermediates by their hydrophobic nature, we discover that the model chaperone Spy uses long-range electrostatic interactions to rapidly bind to its unfolded client protein Im7. Short-range hydrophobic interactions follow, which serve to stabilize the complex. Hydrophobic collapse of the client protein then drives its folding. By burying hydrophobic residues in its core, the client's affinity to Spy decreases, which causes client release. By allowing the client to fold itself, Spy circumvents the need for client-specific folding instructions. This mechanism might help explain how chaperones can facilitate the folding of various unrelated proteins.",1
Peripheral Mechanosensory Neuron Dysfunction Underlies Tactile and Behavioral Deficits in Mouse Models of ASDs.,"Patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) commonly experience aberrant tactile sensitivity, yet the neural alterations underlying somatosensory dysfunction and the extent to which tactile deficits contribute to ASD characteristics are unknown. We report that mice harboring mutations in Mecp2, Gabrb3, Shank3, and Fmr1 genes associated with ASDs in humans exhibit altered tactile discrimination and hypersensitivity to gentle touch. Deletion of Mecp2 or Gabrb3 in peripheral somatosensory neurons causes mechanosensory dysfunction through loss of GABAA receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition of inputs to the CNS. Remarkably, tactile defects resulting from Mecp2 or Gabrb3 deletion in somatosensory neurons during development, but not in adulthood, cause social interaction deficits and anxiety-like behavior. Restoring Mecp2 expression exclusively in the somatosensory neurons of Mecp2-null mice rescues tactile sensitivity, anxiety-like behavior, and social interaction deficits, but not lethality, memory, or motor deficits. Thus, mechanosensory processing defects contribute to anxiety-like behavior and social interaction deficits in ASD mouse models. PAPERCLIP.",1
"1,135 Genomes Reveal the Global Pattern of Polymorphism in Arabidopsis thaliana.","Arabidopsis thaliana serves as a model organism for the study of fundamental physiological, cellular, and molecular processes. It has also greatly advanced our understanding of intraspecific genome variation. We present a detailed map of variation in 1,135 high-quality re-sequenced natural inbred lines representing the native Eurasian and North African range and recently colonized North America. We identify relict populations that continue to inhabit ancestral habitats, primarily in the Iberian Peninsula. They have mixed with a lineage that has spread to northern latitudes from an unknown glacial refugium and is now found in a much broader spectrum of habitats. Insights into the history of the species and the fine-scale distribution of genetic diversity provide the basis for full exploitation of A. thaliana natural variation through integration of genomes and epigenomes with molecular and non-molecular phenotypes.",1
Mitochondrial Dynamics Controls T Cell Fate through Metabolic Programming.,"Activated effector T (TE) cells augment anabolic pathways of metabolism, such as aerobic glycolysis, while memory T (TM) cells engage catabolic pathways, like fatty acid oxidation (FAO). However, signals that drive these differences remain unclear. Mitochondria are metabolic organelles that actively transform their ultrastructure. Therefore, we questioned whether mitochondrial dynamics controls T cell metabolism. We show that TE cells have punctate mitochondria, while TM cells maintain fused networks. The fusion protein Opa1 is required for TM, but not TE cells after infection, and enforcing fusion in TE cells imposes TM cell characteristics and enhances antitumor function. Our data suggest that, by altering cristae morphology, fusion in TM cells configures electron transport chain (ETC) complex associations favoring oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and FAO, while fission in TE cells leads to cristae expansion, reducing ETC efficiency and promoting aerobic glycolysis. Thus, mitochondrial remodeling is a signaling mechanism that instructs T cell metabolic programming.",1
Subcellular Imaging of Voltage and Calcium Signals Reveals Neural Processing In Vivo.,"A mechanistic understanding of neural computation requires determining how information is processed as it passes through neurons and across synapses. However, it has been challenging to measure membrane potential changes in axons and dendrites in vivo. We use in vivo, two-photon imaging of novel genetically encoded voltage indicators, as well as calcium imaging, to measure sensory stimulus-evoked signals in the Drosophila visual system with subcellular resolution. Across synapses, we find major transformations in the kinetics, amplitude, and sign of voltage responses to light. We also describe distinct relationships between voltage and calcium signals in different neuronal compartments, a substrate for local computation. Finally, we demonstrate that ON and OFF selectivity, a key feature of visual processing across species, emerges through the transformation of membrane potential into intracellular calcium concentration. By imaging voltage and calcium signals to map information flow with subcellular resolution, we illuminate where and how critical computations arise.",1
Lifespan Control by Redox-Dependent Recruitment of Chaperones to Misfolded Proteins.,"Caloric restriction (CR) extends the lifespan of flies, worms, and yeast by counteracting age-related oxidation of H2O2-scavenging peroxiredoxins (Prxs). Here, we show that increased dosage of the major cytosolic Prx in yeast, Tsa1, extends lifespan in an Hsp70 chaperone-dependent and CR-independent manner without increasing H2O2 scavenging or genome stability. We found that Tsa1 and Hsp70 physically interact and that hyperoxidation of Tsa1 by H2O2 is required for the recruitment of the Hsp70 chaperones and the Hsp104 disaggregase to misfolded and aggregated proteins during aging, but not heat stress. Tsa1 counteracted the accumulation of ubiquitinated aggregates during aging and the reduction of hyperoxidized Tsa1 by sulfiredoxin facilitated clearance of H2O2-generated aggregates. The data reveal a conceptually new role for H2O2 signaling in proteostasis and lifespan control and shed new light on the selective benefits endowed to eukaryotic peroxiredoxins by their reversible hyperoxidation.",1
Morphomechanical Innovation Drives Explosive Seed Dispersal.,"How mechanical and biological processes are coordinated across cells, tissues, and organs to produce complex traits is a key question in biology. Cardamine hirsuta, a relative of Arabidopsis thaliana, uses an explosive mechanism to disperse its seeds. We show that this trait evolved through morphomechanical innovations at different spatial scales. At the organ scale, tension within the fruit wall generates the elastic energy required for explosion. This tension is produced by differential contraction of fruit wall tissues through an active mechanism involving turgor pressure, cell geometry, and wall properties of the epidermis. Explosive release of this tension is controlled at the cellular scale by asymmetric lignin deposition within endocarp b cells-a striking pattern that is strictly associated with explosive pod shatter across the Brassicaceae plant family. By bridging these different scales, we present an integrated mechanism for explosive seed dispersal that links evolutionary novelty with complex trait innovation. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",1
The Colonic Crypt Protects Stem Cells from Microbiota-Derived Metabolites.,"In the mammalian intestine, crypts of Leiberkuhn house intestinal epithelial stem/progenitor cells at their base. The mammalian intestine also harbors a diverse array of microbial metabolite compounds that potentially modulate stem/progenitor cell activity. Unbiased screening identified butyrate, a prominent bacterial metabolite, as a potent inhibitor of intestinal stem/progenitor proliferation at physiologic concentrations. During homeostasis, differentiated colonocytes metabolized butyrate likely preventing it from reaching proliferating epithelial stem/progenitor cells within the crypt. Exposure of stem/progenitor cells in vivo to butyrate through either mucosal injury or application to a naturally crypt-less host organism led to inhibition of proliferation and delayed wound repair. The mechanism of butyrate action depended on the transcription factor Foxo3. Our findings indicate that mammalian crypt architecture protects stem/progenitor cell proliferation in part through a metabolic barrier formed by differentiated colonocytes that consume butyrate and stimulate future studies on the interplay of host anatomy and microbiome metabolism.",1
Systematic Functional Dissection of Common Genetic Variation Affecting Red Blood Cell Traits.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified thousands of associations between common genetic variants and human disease phenotypes, but the majority of these variants are non-coding, often requiring genetic fine-mapping, epigenomic profiling, and individual reporter assays to delineate potential causal variants. We employ a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to simultaneously screen 2,756 variants in strong linkage disequilibrium with 75 sentinel variants associated with red blood cell traits. We show that this assay identifies elements with endogenous erythroid regulatory activity. Across 23 sentinel variants, we conservatively identified 32 MPRA functional variants (MFVs). We used targeted genome editing to demonstrate endogenous enhancer activity across 3 MFVs that predominantly affect the transcription of SMIM1, RBM38, and CD164. Functional follow-up of RBM38 delineates a key role for this gene in the alternative splicing program occurring during terminal erythropoiesis. Finally, we provide evidence for how common GWAS-nominated variants can disrupt cell-type-specific transcriptional regulatory pathways.",1
Direct Identification of Hundreds of Expression-Modulating Variants using a Multiplexed Reporter Assay.,"Although studies have identified hundreds of loci associated with human traits and diseases, pinpointing causal alleles remains difficult, particularly for non-coding variants. To address this challenge, we adapted the massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to identify variants that directly modulate gene expression. We applied it to 32,373 variants from 3,642 cis-expression quantitative trait loci and control regions. Detection by MPRA was strongly correlated with measures of regulatory function. We demonstrate MPRA's capabilities for pinpointing causal alleles, using it to identify 842 variants showing differential expression between alleles, including 53 well-annotated variants associated with diseases and traits. We investigated one in detail, a risk allele for ankylosing spondylitis, and provide direct evidence of a non-coding variant that alters expression of the prostaglandin EP4 receptor. These results create a resource of concrete leads and illustrate the promise of this approach for comprehensively interrogating how non-coding polymorphism shapes human biology.",1
Relative Rates of Surface and Volume Synthesis Set Bacterial Cell Size.,"Many studies have focused on the mechanisms underlying length and width determination in rod-shaped bacteria. Here, we focus instead on cell surface area to volume ratio (SA/V) and demonstrate that SA/V homeostasis underlies size determination. We propose a model whereby the instantaneous rates of surface and volume synthesis both scale with volume. This model predicts that these relative rates dictate SA/V and that cells approach a new steady-state SA/V exponentially, with a decay constant equal to the volume growth rate. To test this, we exposed diverse bacterial species to sublethal concentrations of a cell wall biosynthesis inhibitor and observed dose-dependent decreases in SA/V. Furthermore, this decrease was exponential and had the expected decay constant. The model also quantitatively describes SA/V alterations induced by other chemical, nutritional, and genetic perturbations. We additionally present evidence for a surface material accumulation threshold underlying division, sensitizing cell length to changes in SA/V requirements.",1
Dual RING E3 Architectures Regulate Multiubiquitination and Ubiquitin Chain Elongation by APC/C.,"Protein ubiquitination involves E1, E2, and E3 trienzyme cascades. E2 and RING E3 enzymes often collaborate to first prime a substrate with a single ubiquitin (UB) and then achieve different forms of polyubiquitination: multiubiquitination of several sites and elongation of linkage-specific UB chains. Here, cryo-EM and biochemistry show that the human E3 anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) and its two partner E2s, UBE2C (aka UBCH10) and UBE2S, adopt specialized catalytic architectures for these two distinct forms of polyubiquitination. The APC/C RING constrains UBE2C proximal to a substrate and simultaneously binds a substrate-linked UB to drive processive multiubiquitination. Alternatively, during UB chain elongation, the RING does not bind UBE2S but rather lures an evolving substrate-linked UB to UBE2S positioned through a cullin interaction to generate a Lys11-linked chain. Our findings define mechanisms of APC/C regulation, and establish principles by which specialized E3-E2-substrate-UB architectures control different forms of polyubiquitination.",1
Modulated Expression of Specific tRNAs Drives Gene Expression and Cancer Progression.,"Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are primarily viewed as static contributors to gene expression. By developing a high-throughput tRNA profiling method, we find that specific tRNAs are upregulated in human breast cancer cells as they gain metastatic activity. Through loss-of-function, gain-of-function, and clinical-association studies, we implicate tRNAGluUUC and tRNAArgCCG as promoters of breast cancer metastasis. Upregulation of these tRNAs enhances stability and ribosome occupancy of transcripts enriched for their cognate codons. Specifically, tRNAGluUUC promotes metastatic progression by directly enhancing EXOSC2 expression and enhancing GRIPAP1-constituting an ""inducible"" pathway driven by a tRNA. The cellular proteomic shift toward a pro-metastatic state mirrors global tRNA shifts, allowing for cell-state and cell-type transgene expression optimization through codon content quantification. TRNA modulation represents a mechanism by which cells achieve altered expression of specific transcripts and proteins. TRNAs are thus dynamic regulators of gene expression and the tRNA codon landscape can causally and specifically impact disease progression.",1
Establishing Chromatin Regulatory Landscape during Mouse Preimplantation Development.,"How the chromatin regulatory landscape in the inner cell mass cells is established from differentially packaged sperm and egg genomes during preimplantation development is unknown. Here, we develop a low-input DNase I sequencing (liDNase-seq) method that allows us to generate maps of DNase I-hypersensitive site (DHS) of mouse preimplantation embryos from 1-cell to morula stage. The DHS landscape is progressively established with a drastic increase at the 8-cell stage. Paternal chromatin accessibility is quickly reprogrammed after fertilization to the level similar to maternal chromatin, while imprinted genes exhibit allelic accessibility bias. We demonstrate that transcription factor Nfya contributes to zygotic genome activation and DHS formation at the 2-cell stage and that Oct4 contributes to the DHSs gained at the 8-cell stage. Our study reveals the dynamic chromatin regulatory landscape during early development and identifies key transcription factors important for DHS establishment in mammalian embryos.",1
Repression of the Antioxidant NRF2 Pathway in Premature Aging.,"Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare, invariably fatal premature aging disorder. The disease is caused by constitutive production of progerin, a mutant form of the nuclear architectural protein lamin A, leading, through unknown mechanisms, to diverse morphological, epigenetic, and genomic damage and to mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) attrition in vivo. Using a high-throughput siRNA screen, we identify the NRF2 antioxidant pathway as a driver mechanism in HGPS. Progerin sequesters NRF2 and thereby causes its subnuclear mislocalization, resulting in impaired NRF2 transcriptional activity and consequently increased chronic oxidative stress. Suppressed NRF2 activity or increased oxidative stress is sufficient to recapitulate HGPS aging defects, whereas reactivation of NRF2 activity in HGPS patient cells reverses progerin-associated nuclear aging defects and restores in vivo viability of MSCs in an animal model. These findings identify repression of the NRF2-mediated antioxidative response as a key contributor to the premature aging phenotype.",1
From Dietary Fiber to Host Physiology: Short-Chain Fatty Acids as Key Bacterial Metabolites.,"A compelling set of links between the composition of the gut microbiota, the host diet, and host physiology has emerged. Do these links reflect cause-and-effect relationships, and what might be their mechanistic basis? A growing body of work implicates microbially produced metabolites as crucial executors of diet-based microbial influence on the host. Here, we will review data supporting the diverse functional roles carried out by a major class of bacterial metabolites, the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). SCFAs can directly activate G-coupled-receptors, inhibit histone deacetylases, and serve as energy substrates. They thus affect various physiological processes and may contribute to health and disease.",1
Cooperative Microbial Tolerance Behaviors in Host-Microbiota Mutualism.,"Animal defense strategies against microbes are most often thought of as a function of the immune system, the primary function of which is to sense and kill microbes through the execution of resistance mechanisms. However, this antagonistic view creates complications for our understanding of beneficial host-microbe interactions. Pathogenic microbes are described as employing a few common behaviors that promote their fitness at the expense of host health and fitness. Here, a complementary framework is proposed to suggest that, in addition to pathogens, beneficial microbes have evolved behaviors to manipulate host processes in order to promote their own fitness and do so through the promotion of host health and fitness. In this Perspective, I explore the idea that patterns or behaviors traditionally ascribed to pathogenic microbes are also employed by beneficial microbes to promote host tolerance defense strategies. Such strategies would promote host health without having a negative impact on microbial fitness and would thereby yield cooperative evolutionary dynamics that are likely required to drive mutualistic co-evolution of hosts and microbes.",1
Leveraging Rules of Nonsense-Mediated mRNA Decay for Genome Engineering and Personalized Medicine.,"Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a eukaryotic mRNA quality control and regulatory process that plays direct roles in human health and disease. In this Minireview, we discuss how understanding the molecular events that trigger NMD can facilitate strategic targeting of genes via CRISPR/Cas9 technologies and also inform disease diagnostics and treatments.",1
A TOGgle for Tension at Kinetochores.,Differential stability of kinetochore-microtubule attachments at low versus high tension is critical for accurate chromosome segregation. Miller et al. find that a TOG domain microtubule-binding protein imparts intrinsic tension selectivity to kinetochore-microtubule attachments.,1
A Pro-metastatic tRNA Pathway.,"tRNAs are best known as basic modules for global regulation of protein synthesis. Goodarzi et al. now show that two tRNAs upregulated in metastatic breast cancer cells enhance stability and translation of transcripts enriched with these codons, leading to specific increase in production of pro-metastatic proteins.",1
Dangerous Entrapment for NRF2.,"Progerin, a mutated lamin A, causes the severe premature-aging syndrome Hutchinson-Gilford progeria (HGPS). Kubben et al. present a driving mechanism for HGPS involving trapping of NRF2 at the nuclear periphery by progerin. This local restriction results in impaired NRF2 signaling and chronic oxidative stress.",1
Do Flies Count Sheep or NMDA Receptors to Go to Sleep?,"The drive to sleep increases the longer that we stay awake, but this process is poorly understood at the cellular level. Now, Liu et al. show that the plasticity of a small group of neurons in the Drosophila central brain is a key component of the sleep homeostat.",1

A Family of non-GPCR Chemosensors Defines an Alternative Logic for Mammalian Olfaction.,"Odor perception in mammals is mediated by parallel sensory pathways that convey distinct information about the olfactory world. Multiple olfactory subsystems express characteristic seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in a one-receptor-per-neuron pattern that facilitates odor discrimination. Sensory neurons of the ""necklace"" subsystem are nestled within the recesses of the olfactory epithelium and detect diverse odorants; however, they do not express known GPCR odor receptors. Here, we report that members of the four-pass transmembrane MS4A protein family are chemosensors expressed within necklace sensory neurons. These receptors localize to sensory endings and confer responses to ethologically relevant ligands, including pheromones and fatty acids, in vitro and in vivo. Individual necklace neurons co-express many MS4A proteins and are activated by multiple MS4A ligands; this pooling of information suggests that the necklace is organized more like subsystems for taste than for smell. The MS4As therefore define a distinct mechanism and functional logic for mammalian olfaction.",1
"A Comprehensive, CRISPR-based Functional Analysis of Essential Genes in Bacteria.","Essential gene functions underpin the core reactions required for cell viability, but their contributions and relationships are poorly studied in vivo. Using CRISPR interference, we created knockdowns of every essential gene in Bacillus subtilis and probed their phenotypes. Our high-confidence essential gene network, established using chemical genomics, showed extensive interconnections among distantly related processes and identified modes of action for uncharacterized antibiotics. Importantly, mild knockdown of essential gene functions significantly reduced stationary-phase survival without affecting maximal growth rate, suggesting that essential protein levels are set to maximize outgrowth from stationary phase. Finally, high-throughput microscopy indicated that cell morphology is relatively insensitive to mild knockdown but profoundly affected by depletion of gene function, revealing intimate connections between cell growth and shape. Our results provide a framework for systematic investigation of essential gene functions in vivo broadly applicable to diverse microorganisms and amenable to comparative analysis.",1
Wiring and Molecular Features of Prefrontal Ensembles Representing Distinct Experiences.,"A major challenge in understanding the cellular diversity of the brain has been linking activity during behavior with standard cellular typology. For example, it has not been possible to determine whether principal neurons in prefrontal cortex active during distinct experiences represent separable cell types, and it is not known whether these differentially active cells exert distinct causal influences on behavior. Here, we develop quantitative hydrogel-based technologies to connect activity in cells reporting on behavioral experience with measures for both brain-wide wiring and molecular phenotype. We find that positive and negative-valence experiences in prefrontal cortex are represented by cell populations that differ in their causal impact on behavior, long-range wiring, and gene expression profiles, with the major discriminant being expression of the adaptation-linked gene NPAS4. These findings illuminate cellular logic of prefrontal cortex information processing and natural adaptive behavior and may point the way to cell-type-specific understanding and treatment of disease-associated states.",1
Mapping of Brain Activity by Automated Volume Analysis of Immediate Early Genes.,"Understanding how neural information is processed in physiological and pathological states would benefit from precise detection, localization, and quantification of the activity of all neurons across the entire brain, which has not, to date, been achieved in the mammalian brain. We introduce a pipeline for high-speed acquisition of brain activity at cellular resolution through profiling immediate early gene expression using immunostaining and light-sheet fluorescence imaging, followed by automated mapping and analysis of activity by an open-source software program we term ClearMap. We validate the pipeline first by analysis of brain regions activated in response to haloperidol. Next, we report new cortical regions downstream of whisker-evoked sensory processing during active exploration. Last, we combine activity mapping with axon tracing to uncover new brain regions differentially activated during parenting behavior. This pipeline is widely applicable to different experimental paradigms, including animal species for which transgenic activity reporters are not readily available.",1
Sensory Neurons that Detect Stretch and Nutrients in the Digestive System.,"Neural inputs from internal organs are essential for normal autonomic function. The vagus nerve is a key body-brain connection that monitors the digestive, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems. Within the gastrointestinal tract, vagal sensory neurons detect gut hormones and organ distension. Here, we investigate the molecular diversity of vagal sensory neurons and their roles in sensing gastrointestinal inputs. Genetic approaches allowed targeted investigation of gut-to-brain afferents involved in homeostatic responses to ingested nutrients (GPR65 neurons) and mechanical distension of the stomach and intestine (GLP1R neurons). Optogenetics, in vivo ganglion imaging, and genetically guided anatomical mapping provide direct links between neuron identity, peripheral anatomy, central anatomy, conduction velocity, response properties in vitro and in vivo, and physiological function. These studies clarify the roles of vagal afferents in mediating particular gut hormone responses. Moreover, genetic control over gut-to-brain neurons provides a molecular framework for understanding neural control of gastrointestinal physiology.",1
Breaking Cryo-EM Resolution Barriers to Facilitate Drug Discovery.,"Recent advances in single-particle cryoelecton microscopy (cryo-EM) are enabling generation of numerous near-atomic resolution structures for well-ordered protein complexes with sizes >/= approximately 200 kDa. Whether cryo-EM methods are equally useful for high-resolution structural analysis of smaller, dynamic protein complexes such as those involved in cellular metabolism remains an important question. Here, we present 3.8 A resolution cryo-EM structures of the cancer target isocitrate dehydrogenase (93 kDa) and identify the nature of conformational changes induced by binding of the allosteric small-molecule inhibitor ML309. We also report 2.8-A- and 1.8-A-resolution structures of lactate dehydrogenase (145 kDa) and glutamate dehydrogenase (334 kDa), respectively. With these results, two perceived barriers in single-particle cryo-EM are overcome: (1) crossing 2 A resolution and (2) obtaining structures of proteins with sizes < 100 kDa, demonstrating that cryo-EM can be used to investigate a broad spectrum of drug-target interactions and dynamic conformational states.",1
Circadian Amplitude Regulation via FBXW7-Targeted REV-ERBalpha Degradation.,"Defects in circadian rhythm influence physiology and behavior with implications for the treatment of sleep disorders, metabolic disease, and cancer. Although core regulatory components of clock rhythmicity have been defined, insight into the mechanisms underpinning amplitude is limited. Here, we show that REV-ERBalpha, a core inhibitory component of clock transcription, is targeted for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the F-box protein FBXW7. By relieving REV-ERBalpha-dependent repression, FBXW7 provides an unrecognized mechanism for enhancing the amplitude of clock gene transcription. Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1)-mediated phosphorylation of REV-ERBalpha is necessary for FBXW7 recognition. Moreover, targeted hepatic disruption of FBXW7 alters circadian expression of core clock genes and perturbs whole-body lipid and glucose levels. This CDK1-FBXW7 pathway controlling REV-ERBalpha repression defines an unexpected molecular mechanism for re-engaging the positive transcriptional arm of the clock, as well as a potential route to manipulate clock amplitude via small molecule CDK1 inhibition.",1
Structural Insights into the Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1)-Mediated Cholesterol Transfer and Ebola Infection.,"Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is associated with mutations in NPC1 and NPC2, whose gene products are key players in the endosomal/lysosomal egress of low-density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol. NPC1 is also the intracellular receptor for Ebola virus (EBOV). Here, we present a 4.4 A structure of full-length human NPC1 and a low-resolution reconstruction of NPC1 in complex with the cleaved glycoprotein (GPcl) of EBOV, both determined by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy. NPC1 contains 13 transmembrane segments (TMs) and three distinct lumenal domains A (also designated NTD), C, and I. TMs 2-13 exhibit a typical resistance-nodulation-cell division fold, among which TMs 3-7 constitute the sterol-sensing domain conserved in several proteins involved in cholesterol metabolism and signaling. A trimeric EBOV-GPcl binds to one NPC1 monomer through the domain C. Our structural and biochemical characterizations provide an important framework for mechanistic understanding of NPC1-mediated intracellular cholesterol trafficking and Ebola virus infection.",1
TMCO1 Is an ER Ca(2+) Load-Activated Ca(2+) Channel.,"Maintaining homeostasis of Ca(2+) stores in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is crucial for proper Ca(2+) signaling and key cellular functions. The Ca(2+)-release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channel is responsible for Ca(2+) influx and refilling after store depletion, but how cells cope with excess Ca(2+) when ER stores are overloaded is unclear. We show that TMCO1 is an ER transmembrane protein that actively prevents Ca(2+) stores from overfilling, acting as what we term a ""Ca(2+) load-activated Ca(2+) channel"" or ""CLAC"" channel. TMCO1 undergoes reversible homotetramerization in response to ER Ca(2+) overloading and disassembly upon Ca(2+) depletion and forms a Ca(2+)-selective ion channel on giant liposomes. TMCO1 knockout mice reproduce the main clinical features of human cerebrofaciothoracic (CFT) dysplasia spectrum, a developmental disorder linked to TMCO1 dysfunction, and exhibit severe mishandling of ER Ca(2+) in cells. Our findings indicate that TMCO1 provides a protective mechanism to prevent overfilling of ER stores with Ca(2+) ions.",1
Corpse Engulfment Generates a Molecular Memory that Primes the Macrophage Inflammatory Response.,"Macrophages are multifunctional cells that perform diverse roles in health and disease. Emerging evidence has suggested that these innate immune cells might also be capable of developing immunological memory, a trait previously associated with the adaptive system alone. While recent studies have focused on the dramatic macrophage reprogramming that follows infection and protects against secondary microbial attack, can macrophages also develop memory in response to other cues? Here, we show that apoptotic corpse engulfment by Drosophila macrophages is an essential primer for their inflammatory response to tissue damage and infection in vivo. Priming is triggered via calcium-induced JNK signaling, which leads to upregulation of the damage receptor Draper, thus providing a molecular memory that allows the cell to rapidly respond to subsequent injury or infection. This remarkable plasticity and capacity for memory places macrophages as key therapeutic targets for treatment of inflammatory disorders.",1
Sleep Drive Is Encoded by Neural Plastic Changes in a Dedicated Circuit.,"Prolonged wakefulness leads to an increased pressure for sleep, but how this homeostatic drive is generated and subsequently persists is unclear. Here, from a neural circuit screen in Drosophila, we identify a subset of ellipsoid body (EB) neurons whose activation generates sleep drive. Patch-clamp analysis indicates these EB neurons are highly sensitive to sleep loss, switching from spiking to burst-firing modes. Functional imaging and translational profiling experiments reveal that elevated sleep need triggers reversible increases in cytosolic Ca(2+) levels, NMDA receptor expression, and structural markers of synaptic strength, suggesting these EB neurons undergo ""sleep-need""-dependent plasticity. Strikingly, the synaptic plasticity of these EB neurons is both necessary and sufficient for generating sleep drive, indicating that sleep pressure is encoded by plastic changes within this circuit. These studies define an integrator circuit for sleep homeostasis and provide a mechanism explaining the generation and persistence of sleep drive.",1
Coexisting Liquid Phases Underlie Nucleolar Subcompartments.,"The nucleolus and other ribonucleoprotein (RNP) bodies are membrane-less organelles that appear to assemble through phase separation of their molecular components. However, many such RNP bodies contain internal subcompartments, and the mechanism of their formation remains unclear. Here, we combine in vivo and in vitro studies, together with computational modeling, to show that subcompartments within the nucleolus represent distinct, coexisting liquid phases. Consistent with their in vivo immiscibility, purified nucleolar proteins phase separate into droplets containing distinct non-coalescing phases that are remarkably similar to nucleoli in vivo. This layered droplet organization is caused by differences in the biophysical properties of the phases-particularly droplet surface tension-which arises from sequence-encoded features of their macromolecular components. These results suggest that phase separation can give rise to multilayered liquids that may facilitate sequential RNA processing reactions in a variety of RNP bodies. PAPERCLIP.",1
Acquired Tissue-Specific Promoter Bivalency Is a Basis for PRC2 Necessity in Adult Cells.,"Bivalent promoters in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) carry methylation marks on two lysine residues, K4 and K27, in histone3 (H3). K4me2/3 is generally considered to promote transcription, and Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) places K27me3, which is erased at lineage-restricted genes when ESCs differentiate in culture. Molecular defects in various PRC2 null adult tissues lack a unifying explanation. We found that epigenomes in adult mouse intestine and other self-renewing tissues show fewer and distinct bivalent promoters compared to ESCs. Groups of tissue-specific genes that carry bivalent marks are repressed, despite the presence of promoter H3K4me2/3. These are the predominant genes de-repressed in PRC2-deficient adult cells, where aberrant expression is proportional to the H3K4me2/3 levels observed at their promoters in wild-type cells. Thus, in adult animals, PRC2 specifically represses genes with acquired, tissue-restricted promoter bivalency. These findings provide new insights into specificity in chromatin-based gene regulation.",1
Root Regeneration Triggers an Embryo-like Sequence Guided by Hormonal Interactions.,"Plant roots can regenerate after excision of their tip, including the stem cell niche. To determine which developmental program mediates such repair, we applied a combination of lineage tracing, single-cell RNA sequencing, and marker analysis to test different models of tissue reassembly. We show that multiple cell types can reconstitute stem cells, demonstrating the latent potential of untreated plant cells. The transcriptome of regenerating cells prior to stem cell activation resembles that of an embryonic root progenitor. Regeneration defects are more severe in embryonic than in adult root mutants. Furthermore, the signaling domains of the hormones auxin and cytokinin mirror their embryonic dynamics and manipulation of both hormones alters the position of new tissues and stem cell niche markers. Our findings suggest that plant root regeneration follows, on a larger scale, the developmental stages of embryonic patterning and is guided by spatial information provided by complementary hormone domains.",1
SnapShot: Microglia in Disease.,"The development and maintenance of the central nervous system is dependent upon regulated, homeostatic actions of microglia, which sculpt and refine neuronal circuitry. By contrast, dysregulation of microglia contributes to the pathology of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders; neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease; and schizophrenia and chronic neuropathic pain.",1
Cistrome and Epicistrome Features Shape the Regulatory DNA Landscape.,"The cistrome is the complete set of transcription factor (TF) binding sites (cis-elements) in an organism, while an epicistrome incorporates tissue-specific DNA chemical modifications and TF-specific chemical sensitivities into these binding profiles. Robust methods to construct comprehensive cistrome and epicistrome maps are critical for elucidating complex transcriptional networks that underlie growth, behavior, and disease. Here, we describe DNA affinity purification sequencing (DAP-seq), a high-throughput TF binding site discovery method that interrogates genomic DNA with in-vitro-expressed TFs. Using DAP-seq, we defined the Arabidopsis cistrome by resolving motifs and peaks for 529 TFs. Because genomic DNA used in DAP-seq retains 5-methylcytosines, we determined that >75% (248/327) of Arabidopsis TFs surveyed were methylation sensitive, a property that strongly impacts the epicistrome landscape. DAP-seq datasets also yielded insight into the biology and binding site architecture of numerous TFs, demonstrating the value of DAP-seq for cost-effective cistromic and epicistromic annotation in any organism.",1
The Cell Nucleus Serves as a Mechanotransducer of Tissue Damage-Induced Inflammation.,"Tissue damage activates cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), releasing arachidonic acid (AA), which is oxidized to proinflammatory eicosanoids by 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) on the nuclear envelope. How tissue damage is sensed to activate cPLA2 is unknown. We investigated this by live imaging in wounded zebrafish larvae, where damage of the fin tissue causes osmotic cell swelling at the wound margin and the generation of a chemotactic eicosanoid signal. Osmotic swelling of cells and their nuclei activates cPla2 by translocating it from the nucleoplasm to the nuclear envelope. Elevated cytosolic Ca(2+) was necessary but not sufficient for cPla2 translocation, and nuclear swelling was required in parallel. cPla2 translocation upon nuclear swelling was reconstituted in isolated nuclei and appears to be a simple physical process mediated by tension in the nuclear envelope. Our data suggest that the nucleus plays a mechanosensory role in inflammation by transducing cell swelling and lysis into proinflammatory eicosanoid signaling.",1
Mechanisms and Consequences of Macromolecular Phase Separation.,"Over a century ago, colloidal phase separation of matter into non-membranous bodies was recognized as a fundamental organizing principal of cell ""protoplasm."" Recent insights into the molecular properties of such phase-separated bodies present challenges to our understanding of cellular protein interaction networks, as well as opportunities for interpreting and understanding of native and pathological genetic and molecular interactions. Here, we briefly review examples of and discuss physical principles of phase-separated cellular bodies and then reflect on how knowledge of these principles may direct future research on their functions.",1
"The Structure and Dynamics of Higher-Order Assemblies: Amyloids, Signalosomes, and Granules.","We here attempt to achieve an integrated understanding of the structure and dynamics of a number of higher-order assemblies, including amyloids, various kinds of signalosomes, and cellular granules. We propose that the synergy between folded domains, linear motifs, and intrinsically disordered regions regulates the formation and intrinsic fuzziness of all higher-order assemblies, creating a structural and dynamic continuum. We describe how such regulatory mechanisms could be influenced under pathological conditions.",1
Mitochondria: Masters of Epigenetics.,"Accumulating evidence argues that aging exerts a profound influence on epigenetics, and vice versa. A pair of studies by Merkwirth et al. and Tian et al. now provide insights on how mitochondrial stress experienced by C. elegans larvae propagates a specific and persistent epigenetic response that protects adult cells and extends lifespan.",1
Swollen Nuclei Signal from the Grave.,"Eicosanoid signaling plays key pro-inflammatory roles during tissue damage. Now, Enyedi et al. show that swelling of nuclei in cell corpses activates eicosanoid signaling to recruit leukocytes to sites of tissue damage. The enhanced membrane tension in swollen nuclei directly promotes calcium-dependent translocation and activation of enzymes involved in eicosanoid biosynthesis.",1
Tension-Time Integrals and Genetic Cardiomyopathy: The Force Is with You.,"Hundreds of different mutations in genes encoding a few dozen sarcomeric proteins cause two reciprocal human disease phenotypes, hypertrophic or dilated cardiomyopathy. How molecular dysfunction evokes different patterns of cardiac remodeling is unclear. Davis et al. describe a biophysical metric of cardiomyocyte function, the force-time integral, which predicts disease phenotype.",1
Lessons from a Recovering Academic.,"The conversion of basic biology into new therapeutics requires scientific activities in both academia and industry.

PCSK9 Inhibitors.,"Alirocumab and evolocumab are monoclonal antibodies that block proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a circulating protein that degrades low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors. These therapies increase LDL receptors on the cell surface and reduce plasma LDL cholesterol. Both therapies are approved to lower LDL cholesterol, a causative agent for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.",1
"High-Throughput, High-Resolution Mapping of Protein Localization in Mammalian Brain by In Vivo Genome Editing.","A scalable and high-throughput method to identify precise subcellular localization of endogenous proteins is essential for integrative understanding of a cell at the molecular level. Here, we developed a simple and generalizable technique to image endogenous proteins with high specificity, resolution, and contrast in single cells in mammalian brain tissue. The technique, single-cell labeling of endogenous proteins by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair (SLENDR), uses in vivo genome editing to insert a sequence encoding an epitope tag or a fluorescent protein to a gene of interest by CRISPR-Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair (HDR). Single-cell, HDR-mediated genome editing was achieved by delivering the editing machinery to dividing neuronal progenitors through in utero electroporation. We demonstrate that SLENDR allows rapid determination of the localization and dynamics of many endogenous proteins in various cell types, regions, and ages in the brain. Thus, SLENDR provides a high-throughput platform to map the subcellular localization of endogenous proteins with the resolution of micro- to nanometers in the brain.",1
A Mechanogenetic Toolkit for Interrogating Cell Signaling in Space and Time.,"Tools capable of imaging and perturbing mechanical signaling pathways with fine spatiotemporal resolution have been elusive, despite their importance in diverse cellular processes. The challenge in developing a mechanogenetic toolkit (i.e., selective and quantitative activation of genetically encoded mechanoreceptors) stems from the fact that many mechanically activated processes are localized in space and time yet additionally require mechanical loading to become activated. To address this challenge, we synthesized magnetoplasmonic nanoparticles that can image, localize, and mechanically load targeted proteins with high spatiotemporal resolution. We demonstrate their utility by investigating the cell-surface activation of two mechanoreceptors: Notch and E-cadherin. By measuring cellular responses to a spectrum of spatial, chemical, temporal, and mechanical inputs at the single-molecule and single-cell levels, we reveal how spatial segregation and mechanical force cooperate to direct receptor activation dynamics. This generalizable technique can be used to control and understand diverse mechanosensitive processes in cell signaling. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",1
SIRT6 Suppresses Pancreatic Cancer through Control of Lin28b.,"Chromatin remodeling proteins are frequently dysregulated in human cancer, yet little is known about how they control tumorigenesis. Here, we uncover an epigenetic program mediated by the NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylase Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) that is critical for suppression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), one of the most lethal malignancies. SIRT6 inactivation accelerates PDAC progression and metastasis via upregulation of Lin28b, a negative regulator of the let-7 microRNA. SIRT6 loss results in histone hyperacetylation at the Lin28b promoter, Myc recruitment, and pronounced induction of Lin28b and downstream let-7 target genes, HMGA2, IGF2BP1, and IGF2BP3. This epigenetic program defines a distinct subset with a poor prognosis, representing 30%-40% of human PDAC, characterized by reduced SIRT6 expression and an exquisite dependence on Lin28b for tumor growth. Thus, we identify SIRT6 as an important PDAC tumor suppressor and uncover the Lin28b pathway as a potential therapeutic target in a molecularly defined PDAC subset. PAPERCLIP.",1
RNA Duplex Map in Living Cells Reveals Higher-Order Transcriptome Structure.,"RNA has the intrinsic property to base pair, forming complex structures fundamental to its diverse functions. Here, we develop PARIS, a method based on reversible psoralen crosslinking for global mapping of RNA duplexes with near base-pair resolution in living cells. PARIS analysis in three human and mouse cell types reveals frequent long-range structures, higher-order architectures, and RNA-RNA interactions in trans across the transcriptome. PARIS determines base-pairing interactions on an individual-molecule level, revealing pervasive alternative conformations. We used PARIS-determined helices to guide phylogenetic analysis of RNA structures and discovered conserved long-range and alternative structures. XIST, a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) essential for X chromosome inactivation, folds into evolutionarily conserved RNA structural domains that span many kilobases. XIST A-repeat forms complex inter-repeat duplexes that nucleate higher-order assembly of the key epigenetic silencing protein SPEN. PARIS is a generally applicable and versatile method that provides novel insights into the RNA structurome and interactome. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",1
Sterol-Rich Membrane Domains Define Fission Yeast Cell Polarity.,"Cell polarization is crucial for the functioning of all organisms. The cytoskeleton is central to the process but its role in symmetry breaking is poorly understood. We study cell polarization when fission yeast cells exit starvation. We show that the basis of polarity generation is de novo sterol biosynthesis, cell surface delivery of sterols, and their recruitment to the cell poles. This involves four phases occurring independent of the polarity factor cdc42p. Initially, multiple, randomly distributed sterol-rich membrane (SRM) domains form at the plasma membrane, independent of the cytoskeleton and cell growth. These domains provide platforms on which the growth and polarity machinery assembles. SRM domains are then polarized by the microtubule-dependent polarity factor tea1p, which prepares for monopolar growth initiation and later switching to bipolar growth. SRM polarization requires F-actin but not the F-actin organizing polarity factors for3p and bud6p. We conclude that SRMs are key to cell polarization.",1
Zika Virus Infection during Pregnancy in Mice Causes Placental Damage and Fetal Demise.,"Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in pregnant women causes intrauterine growth restriction, spontaneous abortion, and microcephaly. Here, we describe two mouse models of placental and fetal disease associated with in utero transmission of ZIKV. Female mice lacking type I interferon signaling (Ifnar1(-/-)) crossed to wild-type (WT) males produced heterozygous fetuses resembling the immune status of human fetuses. Maternal inoculation at embryonic day 6.5 (E6.5) or E7.5 resulted in fetal demise that was associated with ZIKV infection of the placenta and fetal brain. We identified ZIKV within trophoblasts of the maternal and fetal placenta, consistent with a trans-placental infection route. Antibody blockade of Ifnar1 signaling in WT pregnant mice enhanced ZIKV trans-placental infection although it did not result in fetal death. These models will facilitate the study of ZIKV pathogenesis, in utero transmission, and testing of therapies and vaccines to prevent congenital malformations.",1
"Rapid, Low-Cost Detection of Zika Virus Using Programmable Biomolecular Components.","The recent Zika virus outbreak highlights the need for low-cost diagnostics that can be rapidly developed for distribution and use in pandemic regions. Here, we report a pipeline for the rapid design, assembly, and validation of cell-free, paper-based sensors for the detection of the Zika virus RNA genome. By linking isothermal RNA amplification to toehold switch RNA sensors, we detect clinically relevant concentrations of Zika virus sequences and demonstrate specificity against closely related Dengue virus sequences. When coupled with a novel CRISPR/Cas9-based module, our sensors can discriminate between viral strains with single-base resolution. We successfully demonstrate a simple, field-ready sample-processing workflow and detect Zika virus from the plasma of a viremic macaque. Our freeze-dried biomolecular platform resolves important practical limitations to the deployment of molecular diagnostics in the field and demonstrates how synthetic biology can be used to develop diagnostic tools for confronting global health crises.

Distinct Gene Regulatory Pathways for Human Innate versus Adaptive Lymphoid Cells.,"Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) serve as sentinels in mucosal tissues, sensing release of soluble inflammatory mediators, rapidly communicating danger via cytokine secretion, and functioning as guardians of tissue homeostasis. Although ILCs have been extensively studied in model organisms, little is known about these ""first responders"" in humans, especially their lineage and functional kinships to cytokine-secreting T helper (Th) cell counterparts. Here, we report gene regulatory circuitries for four human ILC-Th counterparts derived from mucosal environments, revealing that each ILC subset diverges as a distinct lineage from Th and circulating natural killer cells but shares circuitry devoted to functional polarization with their Th counterparts. Super-enhancers demarcate cohorts of cell-identity genes in each lineage, uncovering new modes of regulation for signature cytokines, new molecules that likely impart important functions to ILCs, and potential mechanisms for autoimmune disease SNP associations within ILC-Th subsets.",1
Developmental Acquisition of Regulomes Underlies Innate Lymphoid Cell Functionality.,"Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) play key roles in host defense, barrier integrity, and homeostasis and mirror adaptive CD4(+) T helper (Th) cell subtypes in both usage of effector molecules and transcription factors. To better understand the relationship between ILC subsets and their Th cell counterparts, we measured genome-wide chromatin accessibility. We find that chromatin in proximity to effector genes is selectively accessible in ILCs prior to high-level transcription upon activation. Accessibility of these regions is acquired in a stepwise manner during development and changes little after in vitro or in vivo activation. Conversely, dramatic chromatin remodeling occurs in naive CD4(+) T cells during Th cell differentiation using a type-2-infection model. This alteration results in a substantial convergence of Th2 cells toward ILC2 regulomes. Our data indicate extensive sharing of regulatory circuitry across the innate and adaptive compartments of the immune system, in spite of their divergent developing pathways.",1
Active Yeast Telomerase Shares Subunits with Ribonucleoproteins RNase P and RNase MRP.,"Telomerase is the ribonucleoprotein enzyme that replenishes telomeric DNA and maintains genome integrity. Minimally, telomerase activity requires a templating RNA and a catalytic protein. Additional proteins are required for activity on telomeres in vivo. Here, we report that the Pop1, Pop6, and Pop7 proteins, known components of RNase P and RNase MRP, bind to yeast telomerase RNA and are essential constituents of the telomerase holoenzyme. Pop1/Pop6/Pop7 binding is specific and involves an RNA domain highly similar to a protein-binding domain in the RNAs of RNase P/MRP. The results also show that Pop1/Pop6/Pop7 function to maintain the essential components Est1 and Est2 on the RNA in vivo. Consistently, addition of Pop1 allows for telomerase activity reconstitution with wild-type telomerase RNA in vitro. Thus, the same chaperoning module has allowed the evolution of functionally and, remarkably, structurally distinct RNPs, telomerase, and RNases P/MRP from unrelated progenitor RNAs.",1
Bacterial Outer Membrane Vesicles Mediate Cytosolic Localization of LPS and Caspase-11 Activation.,"Sensing of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the cytosol triggers caspase-11 activation and is central to host defense against Gram-negative bacterial infections and to the pathogenesis of sepsis. Most Gram-negative bacteria that activate caspase-11, however, are not cytosolic, and the mechanism by which LPS from these bacteria gains access to caspase-11 in the cytosol remains elusive. Here, we identify outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) produced by Gram-negative bacteria as a vehicle that delivers LPS into the cytosol triggering caspase-11-dependent effector responses in vitro and in vivo. OMVs are internalized via endocytosis, and LPS is released into the cytosol from early endosomes. The use of hypovesiculating bacterial mutants, compromised in their ability to generate OMVs, reveals the importance of OMVs in mediating the cytosolic localization of LPS. Collectively, these findings demonstrate a critical role for OMVs in enabling the cytosolic entry of LPS and, consequently, caspase-11 activation during Gram-negative bacterial infections.",1
A TOG Protein Confers Tension Sensitivity to Kinetochore-Microtubule Attachments.,"The development and survival of all organisms depends on equal partitioning of their genomes during cell division. Accurate chromosome segregation requires selective stabilization of kinetochore-microtubule attachments that come under tension due to opposing pulling forces exerted on sister kinetochores by dynamic microtubule tips. Here, we show that the XMAP215 family member, Stu2, makes a major contribution to kinetochore-microtubule coupling. Stu2 and its human ortholog, ch-TOG, exhibit a conserved interaction with the Ndc80 kinetochore complex that strengthens its attachment to microtubule tips. Strikingly, Stu2 can either stabilize or destabilize kinetochore attachments, depending on the level of kinetochore tension and whether the microtubule tip is assembling or disassembling. These dichotomous effects of Stu2 are independent of its previously studied regulation of microtubule dynamics. Altogether, our results demonstrate how a kinetochore-associated factor can confer opposing, tension-dependent effects to selectively stabilize tension-bearing attachments, providing mechanistic insight into the basis for accuracy during chromosome segregation.",1
SnapShot: Mechanical Forces in Development II.,"The forces shaping an organism are not exclusively produced by actin/myosin II networks. In part II of this SnapShot, we present various alternative mechanisms. In addition to driving morphogenesis, cells use mechanical forces to sense and react to the specific mechanical properties of their environment. Also, we present a selection of experimental tools commonly used in force analysis.",1
Real-Time Imaging of Translation on Single mRNA Transcripts in Live Cells.,"Translation is under tight spatial and temporal controls to ensure protein production in the right time and place in cells. Methods that allow real-time, high-resolution visualization of translation in live cells are essential for understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of translation regulation. Based on multivalent fluorescence amplification of the nascent polypeptide signal, we develop a method to image translation on individual mRNA molecules in real time in live cells, allowing direct visualization of translation events at the translation sites. Using this approach, we monitor transient changes of translation dynamics in responses to environmental stresses, capture distinct mobilities of individual polysomes in different subcellular compartments, and detect 3' UTR-dependent local translation and active transport of polysomes in dendrites of primary neurons.",1
Dynamics of Translation of Single mRNA Molecules In Vivo.,"Regulation of mRNA translation, the process by which ribosomes decode mRNAs into polypeptides, is used to tune cellular protein levels. Currently, methods for observing the complete process of translation from single mRNAs in vivo are unavailable. Here, we report the long-term (>1 hr) imaging of single mRNAs undergoing hundreds of rounds of translation in live cells, enabling quantitative measurements of ribosome initiation, elongation, and stalling. This approach reveals a surprising heterogeneity in the translation of individual mRNAs within the same cell, including rapid and reversible transitions between a translating and non-translating state. Applying this method to the cell-cycle gene Emi1, we find strong overall repression of translation initiation by specific 5' UTR sequences, but individual mRNA molecules in the same cell can exhibit dramatically different translational efficiencies. The ability to observe translation of single mRNA molecules in live cells provides a powerful tool to study translation regulation.",1
Lung Adenocarcinoma Distally Rewires Hepatic Circadian Homeostasis.,"The circadian clock controls metabolic and physiological processes through finely tuned molecular mechanisms. The clock is remarkably plastic and adapts to exogenous ""zeitgebers,"" such as light and nutrition. How a pathological condition in a given tissue influences systemic circadian homeostasis in other tissues remains an unanswered question of conceptual and biomedical importance. Here, we show that lung adenocarcinoma operates as an endogenous reorganizer of circadian metabolism. High-throughput transcriptomics and metabolomics revealed unique signatures of transcripts and metabolites cycling exclusively in livers of tumor-bearing mice. Remarkably, lung cancer has no effect on the core clock but rather reprograms hepatic metabolism through altered pro-inflammatory response via the STAT3-Socs3 pathway. This results in disruption of AKT, AMPK, and SREBP signaling, leading to altered insulin, glucose, and lipid metabolism. Thus, lung adenocarcinoma functions as a potent endogenous circadian organizer (ECO), which rewires the pathophysiological dimension of a distal tissue such as the liver. PAPERCLIP.",1
Temporal Stability of the Human Skin Microbiome.,"Biogeography and individuality shape the structural and functional composition of the human skin microbiome. To explore these factors' contribution to skin microbial community stability, we generated metagenomic sequence data from longitudinal samples collected over months and years. Analyzing these samples using a multi-kingdom, reference-based approach, we found that despite the skin's exposure to the external environment, its bacterial, fungal, and viral communities were largely stable over time. Site, individuality, and phylogeny were all determinants of stability. Foot sites exhibited the most variability; individuals differed in stability; and transience was a particular characteristic of eukaryotic viruses, which showed little site-specificity in colonization. Strain and single-nucleotide variant-level analysis showed that individuals maintain, rather than reacquire, prevalent microbes from the environment. Longitudinal stability of skin microbial communities generates hypotheses about colonization resistance and empowers clinical studies exploring alterations observed in disease states.",1
Maternal IgG and IgA Antibodies Dampen Mucosal T Helper Cell Responses in Early Life.,"To maintain a symbiotic relationship between the host and its resident intestinal microbiota, appropriate mucosal T cell responses to commensal antigens must be established. Mice acquire both IgG and IgA maternally; the former has primarily been implicated in passive immunity to pathogens while the latter mediates host-commensal mutualism. Here, we report the surprising observation that mice generate T cell-independent and largely Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent IgG2b and IgG3 antibody responses against their gut microbiota. We demonstrate that maternal acquisition of these antibodies dampens mucosal T follicular helper responses and subsequent germinal center B cell responses following birth. This work reveals a feedback loop whereby T cell-independent, TLR-dependent antibodies limit mucosal adaptive immune responses to newly acquired commensal antigens and uncovers a broader function for maternal IgG.",1
Neuro-Immune Interactions at Barrier Surfaces.,"Multidirectional interactions between the nervous and immune systems have been documented in homeostasis and pathologies ranging from multiple sclerosis to autism, and from leukemia to acute and chronic inflammation. Recent studies have addressed this crosstalk using cell-specific targeting, novel sequencing, imaging, and analytical tools, shedding light on unappreciated mechanisms of neuro-immune regulation. This Review focuses on neuro-immune interactions at barrier surfaces-mostly the gut, but also including the skin and the airways, areas densely populated by neurons and immune cells that constantly sense and adapt to tissue-specific environmental challenges.",1
Inflammasome Complexes: Emerging Mechanisms and Effector Functions.,"Canonical activation of the inflammasome is critical to promote caspase-1-dependent maturation of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and IL-18, as well as to induce pyroptotic cell death in response to pathogens and endogenous danger signals. Recent discoveries, however, are beginning to unveil new components of the inflammasome machinery as well as the full spectrum of inflammasome functions, extending their influence beyond canonical functions to regulation of eicosanoid storm, autophagy, and metabolism. In addition, the receptor components of the inflammasome can also regulate diverse biological processes, such as cellular proliferation, gene transcription, and tumorigenesis, all of which are independent of their inflammasome complex-forming capabilities. Here, we review these recent advances that are shaping our understanding of the complex biology of the inflammasome and its constituents.",1
"Mass Cytometry: Single Cells, Many Features.","Technology development in biological research often aims to either increase the number of cellular features that can be surveyed simultaneously or enhance the resolution at which such observations are possible. For decades, flow cytometry has balanced these goals to fill a critical need by enabling the measurement of multiple features in single cells, commonly to examine complex or hierarchical cellular systems. Recently, a format for flow cytometry has been developed that leverages the precision of mass spectrometry. This fusion of the two technologies, termed mass cytometry, provides measurement of over 40 simultaneous cellular parameters at single-cell resolution, significantly augmenting the ability of cytometry to evaluate complex cellular systems and processes. In this Primer, we review the current state of mass cytometry, providing an overview of the instrumentation, its present capabilities, and methods of data analysis, as well as thoughts on future developments and applications.",1
Transcriptome Encyclopedia of Early Human Development.,"Our understanding of human pre-implantation development is limited by the availability of human embryos and cannot completely rely on mouse studies. Petropoulos et al. now provide an extensive transcriptome analysis of a large number of human pre-implantation embryos at single-cell resolution, revealing previously unrecognized features unique to early human development.",1
Glia Get Neurons in Shape.,"Glial cells are essential components of the nervous system. In this issue, Singhvi et al. uncover cellular and molecular mechanisms through which C. elegans glia shape sensory neuron terminals and thus control animal thermosensing behaviors.",1
Thoughts on Obesity and Brain Glucose.,"Homeostatic control of brain metabolism is essential for neuronal activity. Jais et al., (2016) report that reduced brain glucose uptake elicited by a high-fat diet self-corrects by the recruitment of peripheral, VEGF-producing macrophages to the blood-brain barrier. Their findings further suggest that restoring brain glucose availability might help protect from cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease.",1
Microbial Skin Inhabitants: Friends Forever.,"To gain insight into the stability of the microbial communities that inhabit our skin, Oh et al., in a tour-de-force effort, map the human skin metagenomes over time. Remarkably, their data indicate that the individual, not the environment, primarily drives the composition of skin microbial communities.",1
Rescuing the Lost in Translation.,"The translation of medically relevant academic inventions that could transform public health has been notoriously difficult, stemming largely from cultural differences been academia and industry. New initiatives to kindle academic entrepreneurship and establish stronger public/private partnerships are helping to align these differences and accelerating the translation of promising new therapies.",1
Myeloid-Cell-Derived VEGF Maintains Brain Glucose Uptake and Limits Cognitive Impairment in Obesity.,"High-fat diet (HFD) feeding induces rapid reprogramming of systemic metabolism. Here, we demonstrate that HFD feeding of mice downregulates glucose transporter (GLUT)-1 expression in blood-brain barrier (BBB) vascular endothelial cells (BECs) and reduces brain glucose uptake. Upon prolonged HFD feeding, GLUT1 expression is restored, which is paralleled by increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in macrophages at the BBB. In turn, inducible reduction of GLUT1 expression specifically in BECs reduces brain glucose uptake and increases VEGF serum concentrations in lean mice. Conversely, myeloid-cell-specific deletion of VEGF in VEGF(Deltamyel) mice impairs BBB-GLUT1 expression, brain glucose uptake, and memory formation in obese, but not in lean mice. Moreover, obese VEGF(Deltamyel) mice exhibit exaggerated progression of cognitive decline and neuroinflammation on an Alzheimer's disease background. These experiments reveal that transient, HFD-elicited reduction of brain glucose uptake initiates a compensatory increase of VEGF production and assign obesity-associated macrophage activation a homeostatic role to restore cerebral glucose metabolism, preserve cognitive function, and limit neurodegeneration in obesity.",1
Two Conserved Histone Demethylases Regulate Mitochondrial Stress-Induced Longevity.,"Across eukaryotic species, mild mitochondrial stress can have beneficial effects on the lifespan of organisms. Mitochondrial dysfunction activates an unfolded protein response (UPR(mt)), a stress signaling mechanism designed to ensure mitochondrial homeostasis. Perturbation of mitochondria during larval development in C. elegans not only delays aging but also maintains UPR(mt) signaling, suggesting an epigenetic mechanism that modulates both longevity and mitochondrial proteostasis throughout life. We identify the conserved histone lysine demethylases jmjd-1.2/PHF8 and jmjd-3.1/JMJD3 as positive regulators of lifespan in response to mitochondrial dysfunction across species. Reduction of function of the demethylases potently suppresses longevity and UPR(mt) induction, while gain of function is sufficient to extend lifespan in a UPR(mt)-dependent manner. A systems genetics approach in the BXD mouse reference population further indicates conserved roles of the mammalian orthologs in longevity and UPR(mt) signaling. These findings illustrate an evolutionary conserved epigenetic mechanism that determines the rate of aging downstream of mitochondrial perturbations.",1
Variation in Microbiome LPS Immunogenicity Contributes to Autoimmunity in Humans.,"According to the hygiene hypothesis, the increasing incidence of autoimmune diseases in western countries may be explained by changes in early microbial exposure, leading to altered immune maturation. We followed gut microbiome development from birth until age three in 222 infants in Northern Europe, where early-onset autoimmune diseases are common in Finland and Estonia but are less prevalent in Russia. We found that Bacteroides species are lowly abundant in Russians but dominate in Finnish and Estonian infants. Therefore, their lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposures arose primarily from Bacteroides rather than from Escherichia coli, which is a potent innate immune activator. We show that Bacteroides LPS is structurally distinct from E. coli LPS and inhibits innate immune signaling and endotoxin tolerance; furthermore, unlike LPS from E. coli, B. dorei LPS does not decrease incidence of autoimmune diabetes in non-obese diabetic mice. Early colonization by immunologically silencing microbiota may thus preclude aspects of immune education.",1
Mitochondrial Stress Induces Chromatin Reorganization to Promote Longevity and UPR(mt).,"Organisms respond to mitochondrial stress through the upregulation of an array of protective genes, often perpetuating an early response to metabolic dysfunction across a lifetime. We find that mitochondrial stress causes widespread changes in chromatin structure through histone H3K9 di-methylation marks traditionally associated with gene silencing. Mitochondrial stress response activation requires the di-methylation of histone H3K9 through the activity of the histone methyltransferase met-2 and the nuclear co-factor lin-65. While globally the chromatin becomes silenced by these marks, remaining portions of the chromatin open up, at which point the binding of canonical stress responsive factors such as DVE-1 occurs. Thus, a metabolic stress response is established and propagated into adulthood of animals through specific epigenetic modifications that allow for selective gene expression and lifespan extension.",1
Effector T Cells Abrogate Stroma-Mediated Chemoresistance in Ovarian Cancer.,"Effector T cells and fibroblasts are major components in the tumor microenvironment. The means through which these cellular interactions affect chemoresistance is unclear. Here, we show that fibroblasts diminish nuclear accumulation of platinum in ovarian cancer cells, resulting in resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy. We demonstrate that glutathione and cysteine released by fibroblasts contribute to this resistance. CD8(+) T cells abolish the resistance by altering glutathione and cystine metabolism in fibroblasts. CD8(+) T-cell-derived interferon (IFN)gamma controls fibroblast glutathione and cysteine through upregulation of gamma-glutamyltransferases and transcriptional repression of system xc(-) cystine and glutamate antiporter via the JAK/STAT1 pathway. The presence of stromal fibroblasts and CD8(+) T cells is negatively and positively associated with ovarian cancer patient survival, respectively. Thus, our work uncovers a mode of action for effector T cells: they abrogate stromal-mediated chemoresistance. Capitalizing upon the interplay between chemotherapy and immunotherapy holds high potential for cancer treatment.",1
Fanconi Anemia Proteins Function in Mitophagy and Immunity.,"Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway genes are important tumor suppressors whose best-characterized function is repair of damaged nuclear DNA. Here, we describe an essential role for FA genes in two forms of selective autophagy. Genetic deletion of Fancc blocks the autophagic clearance of viruses (virophagy) and increases susceptibility to lethal viral encephalitis. Fanconi anemia complementation group C (FANCC) protein interacts with Parkin, is required in vitro and in vivo for clearance of damaged mitochondria, and decreases mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and inflammasome activation. The mitophagy function of FANCC is genetically distinct from its role in genomic DNA damage repair. Moreover, additional genes in the FA pathway, including FANCA, FANCF, FANCL, FANCD2, BRCA1, and BRCA2, are required for mitophagy. Thus, members of the FA pathway represent a previously undescribed class of selective autophagy genes that function in immunity and organellar homeostasis. These findings have implications for understanding the pathogenesis of FA and cancers associated with mutations in FA genes.",1
Brain-Region-Specific Organoids Using Mini-bioreactors for Modeling ZIKV Exposure.,"Cerebral organoids, three-dimensional cultures that model organogenesis, provide a new platform to investigate human brain development. High cost, variability, and tissue heterogeneity limit their broad applications. Here, we developed a miniaturized spinning bioreactor (SpinOmega) to generate forebrain-specific organoids from human iPSCs. These organoids recapitulate key features of human cortical development, including progenitor zone organization, neurogenesis, gene expression, and, notably, a distinct human-specific outer radial glia cell layer. We also developed protocols for midbrain and hypothalamic organoids. Finally, we employed the forebrain organoid platform to model Zika virus (ZIKV) exposure. Quantitative analyses revealed preferential, productive infection of neural progenitors with either African or Asian ZIKV strains. ZIKV infection leads to increased cell death and reduced proliferation, resulting in decreased neuronal cell-layer volume resembling microcephaly. Together, our brain-region-specific organoids and SpinOmega provide an accessible and versatile platform for modeling human brain development and disease and for compound testing, including potential ZIKV antiviral drugs.",1
Crystal Structure of Cpf1 in Complex with Guide RNA and Target DNA.,"Cpf1 is an RNA-guided endonuclease of a type V CRISPR-Cas system that has been recently harnessed for genome editing. Here, we report the crystal structure of Acidaminococcus sp. Cpf1 (AsCpf1) in complex with the guide RNA and its target DNA at 2.8 A resolution. AsCpf1 adopts a bilobed architecture, with the RNA-DNA heteroduplex bound inside the central channel. The structural comparison of AsCpf1 with Cas9, a type II CRISPR-Cas nuclease, reveals both striking similarity and major differences, thereby explaining their distinct functionalities. AsCpf1 contains the RuvC domain and a putative novel nuclease domain, which are responsible for cleaving the non-target and target strands, respectively, and for jointly generating staggered DNA double-strand breaks. AsCpf1 recognizes the 5'-TTTN-3' protospacer adjacent motif by base and shape readout mechanisms. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into RNA-guided DNA cleavage by Cpf1 and establish a framework for rational engineering of the CRISPR-Cpf1 toolbox.",1
Whole-Genome Sequencing of a Healthy Aging Cohort.,"Studies of long-lived individuals have revealed few genetic mechanisms for protection against age-associated disease. Therefore, we pursued genome sequencing of a related phenotype-healthy aging-to understand the genetics of disease-free aging without medical intervention. In contrast with studies of exceptional longevity, usually focused on centenarians, healthy aging is not associated with known longevity variants, but is associated with reduced genetic susceptibility to Alzheimer and coronary artery disease. Additionally, healthy aging is not associated with a decreased rate of rare pathogenic variants, potentially indicating the presence of disease-resistance factors. In keeping with this possibility, we identify suggestive common and rare variant genetic associations implying that protection against cognitive decline is a genetic component of healthy aging. These findings, based on a relatively small cohort, require independent replication. Overall, our results suggest healthy aging is an overlapping but distinct phenotype from exceptional longevity that may be enriched with disease-protective genetic factors. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",1
The Dynamic Regulatory Genome of Capsaspora and the Origin of Animal Multicellularity.,"The unicellular ancestor of animals had a complex repertoire of genes linked to multicellular processes. This suggests that changes in the regulatory genome, rather than in gene innovation, were key to the origin of animals. Here, we carry out multiple functional genomic assays in Capsaspora owczarzaki, the unicellular relative of animals with the largest known gene repertoire for transcriptional regulation. We show that changing chromatin states, differential lincRNA expression, and dynamic cis-regulatory sites are associated with life cycle transitions in Capsaspora. Moreover, we demonstrate conservation of animal developmental transcription-factor networks and extensive network interconnection in this premetazoan organism. In contrast, however, Capsaspora lacks animal promoter types, and its regulatory sites are small, proximal, and lack signatures of animal enhancers. Overall, our results indicate that the emergence of animal multicellularity was linked to a major shift in genome cis-regulatory complexity, most notably the appearance of distal enhancer regulation.",1
A Tension-Based Model Distinguishes Hypertrophic versus Dilated Cardiomyopathy.,"The heart either hypertrophies or dilates in response to familial mutations in genes encoding sarcomeric proteins, which are responsible for contraction and pumping. These mutations typically alter calcium-dependent tension generation within the sarcomeres, but how this translates into the spectrum of hypertrophic versus dilated cardiomyopathy is unknown. By generating a series of cardiac-specific mouse models that permit the systematic tuning of sarcomeric tension generation and calcium fluxing, we identify a significant relationship between the magnitude of tension developed over time and heart growth. When formulated into a computational model, the integral of myofilament tension development predicts hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies in mice associated with essentially any sarcomeric gene mutations, but also accurately predicts human cardiac phenotypes from data generated in induced-pluripotent-stem-cell-derived myocytes from familial cardiomyopathy patients. This tension-based model also has the potential to inform pharmacologic treatment options in cardiomyopathy patients.",1
"Trimeric HIV-1-Env Structures Define Glycan Shields from Clades A, B, and G.","The HIV-1-envelope (Env) trimer is covered by a glycan shield of approximately 90 N-linked oligosaccharides, which comprises roughly half its mass and is a key component of HIV evasion from humoral immunity. To understand how antibodies can overcome the barriers imposed by the glycan shield, we crystallized fully glycosylated Env trimers from clades A, B, and G, visualizing the shield at 3.4-3.7 A resolution. These structures reveal the HIV-1-glycan shield to comprise a network of interlocking oligosaccharides, substantially ordered by glycan crowding, that encase the protein component of Env and enable HIV-1 to avoid most antibody-mediated neutralization. The revealed features delineate a taxonomy of N-linked glycan-glycan interactions. Crowded and dispersed glycans are differently ordered, conserved, processed, and recognized by antibody. The structures, along with glycan-array binding and molecular dynamics, reveal a diversity in oligosaccharide affinity and a requirement for accommodating glycans among known broadly neutralizing antibodies that target the glycan-shielded trimer.",1
Progranulin Deficiency Promotes Circuit-Specific Synaptic Pruning by Microglia via Complement Activation.,"Microglia maintain homeostasis in the brain, but whether aberrant microglial activation can cause neurodegeneration remains controversial. Here, we use transcriptome profiling to demonstrate that deficiency in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) gene progranulin (Grn) leads to an age-dependent, progressive upregulation of lysosomal and innate immunity genes, increased complement production, and enhanced synaptic pruning in microglia. During aging, Grn(-/-) mice show profound microglia infiltration and preferential elimination of inhibitory synapses in the ventral thalamus, which lead to hyperexcitability in the thalamocortical circuits and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)-like grooming behaviors. Remarkably, deleting C1qa gene significantly reduces synaptic pruning by Grn(-/-) microglia and mitigates neurodegeneration, behavioral phenotypes, and premature mortality in Grn(-/-) mice. Together, our results uncover a previously unrecognized role of progranulin in suppressing aberrant microglia activation during aging. These results represent an important conceptual advance that complement activation and microglia-mediated synaptic pruning are major drivers, rather than consequences, of neurodegeneration caused by progranulin deficiency.",1
SnapShot: Mechanical Forces in Development I.,"Cell-type-specific F-actin structures and myosin motors are key generators of the forces that drive tissue morphogenesis in developing organisms. These cytoskeletal elements mediate defined cell deformation and control the arrangement of cell-cell contacts. This SnapShot presents a selection of morphogenetic processes, the analysis of which has pioneered specific types of F-actin/myosin-mediated force generation in development.",1
A Small Molecule RAS-Mimetic Disrupts RAS Association with Effector Proteins to Block Signaling.,"Oncogenic activation of RAS genes via point mutations occurs in 20%-30% of human cancers. The development of effective RAS inhibitors has been challenging, necessitating new approaches to inhibit this oncogenic protein. Functional studies have shown that the switch region of RAS interacts with a large number of effector proteins containing a common RAS-binding domain (RBD). Because RBD-mediated interactions are essential for RAS signaling, blocking RBD association with small molecules constitutes an attractive therapeutic approach. Here, we present evidence that rigosertib, a styryl-benzyl sulfone, acts as a RAS-mimetic and interacts with the RBDs of RAF kinases, resulting in their inability to bind to RAS, disruption of RAF activation, and inhibition of the RAS-RAF-MEK pathway. We also find that ribosertib binds to the RBDs of Ral-GDS and PI3Ks. These results suggest that targeting of RBDs across multiple signaling pathways by rigosertib may represent an effective strategy for inactivation of RAS signaling.",1
Collective Space-Sensing Coordinates Pattern Scaling in Engineered Bacteria.,"Scale invariance refers to the maintenance of a constant ratio of developing organ size to body size. Although common, its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we examined scaling in engineered Escherichia coli that can form self-organized core-ring patterns in colonies. We found that the ring width exhibits perfect scale invariance to the colony size. Our analysis revealed a collective space-sensing mechanism, which entails sequential actions of an integral feedback loop and an incoherent feedforward loop. The integral feedback is implemented by the accumulation of a diffusive chemical produced by a colony. This accumulation, combined with nutrient consumption, sets the timing for ring initiation. The incoherent feedforward is implemented by the opposing effects of the domain size on the rate and duration of ring maturation. This mechanism emphasizes a role of timing control in achieving robust pattern scaling and provides a new perspective in examining the phenomenon in natural systems.",1
Rbfox Proteins Regulate Splicing as Part of a Large Multiprotein Complex LASR.,"Rbfox proteins control alternative splicing and posttranscriptional regulation in mammalian brain and are implicated in neurological disease. These proteins recognize the RNA sequence (U)GCAUG, but their structures and diverse roles imply a variety of protein-protein interactions. We find that nuclear Rbfox proteins are bound within a large assembly of splicing regulators (LASR), a multimeric complex containing the proteins hnRNP M, hnRNP H, hnRNP C, Matrin3, NF110/NFAR-2, NF45, and DDX5, all approximately equimolar to Rbfox. We show that splicing repression mediated by hnRNP M is stimulated by Rbfox. Virtually all the intron-bound Rbfox is associated with LASR, and hnRNP M motifs are enriched adjacent to Rbfox crosslinking sites in vivo. These findings demonstrate that Rbfox proteins bind RNA with a defined set of cofactors and affect a broader set of exons than previously recognized. The function of this multimeric LASR complex has implications for deciphering the regulatory codes controlling splicing networks.",1
On the Dependency of Cellular Protein Levels on mRNA Abundance.,"The question of how genomic information is expressed to determine phenotypes is of central importance for basic and translational life science research and has been studied by transcriptomic and proteomic profiling. Here, we review the relationship between protein and mRNA levels under various scenarios, such as steady state, long-term state changes, and short-term adaptation, demonstrating the complexity of gene expression regulation, especially during dynamic transitions. The spatial and temporal variations of mRNAs, as well as the local availability of resources for protein biosynthesis, strongly influence the relationship between protein levels and their coding transcripts. We further discuss the buffering of mRNA fluctuations at the level of protein concentrations. We conclude that transcript levels by themselves are not sufficient to predict protein levels in many scenarios and to thus explain genotype-phenotype relationships and that high-quality data quantifying different levels of gene expression are indispensable for the complete understanding of biological processes.",1
Targeting Neural Circuits.,"Optogenetic methodology enables direct targeting of specific neural circuit elements for inhibition or excitation while spanning timescales from the acute (milliseconds) to the chronic (many days or more). Although the impact of this temporal versatility and cellular specificity has been greater for basic science than clinical research, it is natural to ask whether the dynamic patterns of neural circuit activity discovered to be causal in adaptive or maladaptive behaviors could become targets for treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases. Here, we consider the landscape of ideas related to therapeutic targeting of circuit dynamics. Specifically, we highlight optical, ultrasonic, and magnetic concepts for the targeted control of neural activity, preclinical/clinical discovery opportunities, and recently reported optogenetically guided clinical outcomes.",1
Multimodal Signal Integration for Feeding Control.,"Feeding is arguably one of the most well-conserved and important adaptive behaviors across all species. In this issue of Cell, Yapici et al. use a novel real-time feeding assay in Drosophila flies to identify a neural circuit that integrates gustatory input and hunger state to modulate food ingestion.",1
A New Pillar in Pilus Assembly.,"Pilus assembly in bacteria typically occurs by one of four pathways. In the study by Xu et al., the structures of 20 pilin subunits of human oral and gut Bacteroidales are elucidated, revealing a new pilin superfamily, assembled into pili by a distinct fifth pathway.",1
Wormhole Travel for Macrophages.,"Leukocyte recruitment is generally achieved by rapid migration of inflammatory cells out of circulation, through modified blood vessels, and into affected tissues. Now, Wang and Kubes show that macrophages can be rapidly recruited from body cavities to the liver, via a non-vascular route, where they help to coordinate tissue repair.",1
Engineering Models to Scale.,"Developing organisms can regulate and scale patterns to achieve consistent proportions despite immense changes in size. In this issue, Cao et al. build a model system, using engineered E. coli, to understand how regulatory dynamics can produce pattern scaling without the need for a morphogen gradient.",1
Partnering with Big Pharma-What Academics Need to Know.,"Knowledge of the parameters of drug development can greatly aid academic scientists hoping to partner with pharmaceutical companies. Here, we discuss the three major pillars of drug development-pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity studies-which, in addition to pre-clinical efficacy, are critical for partnering with Big Pharma to produce novel therapeutics.",1
Humanized Anti-IL-5 Antibody Therapy.,"Eosinophils are suppressed by a new class of drugs targeting Interleukin-5 (IL-5), an eosinophil growth, activation, and survival factor. Humanized anti-IL-5 antibodies are effective in treating asthma patients with the severe eosinophilic form of the disease and are the first new class of asthma drugs approved in 12 years.",1
Pooled ChIP-Seq Links Variation in Transcription Factor Binding to Complex Disease Risk.,"Cis-regulatory elements such as transcription factor (TF) binding sites can be identified genome-wide, but it remains far more challenging to pinpoint genetic variants affecting TF binding. Here, we introduce a pooling-based approach to mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for molecular-level traits. Applying this to five TFs and a histone modification, we mapped thousands of cis-acting QTLs, with over 25-fold lower cost compared to standard QTL mapping. We found that single genetic variants frequently affect binding of multiple TFs, and CTCF can recruit all five TFs to its binding sites. These QTLs often affect local chromatin and transcription but can also influence long-range chromosomal contacts, demonstrating a role for natural genetic variation in chromosomal architecture. Thousands of these QTLs have been implicated in genome-wide association studies, providing candidate molecular mechanisms for many disease risk loci and suggesting that TF binding variation may underlie a large fraction of human phenotypic variation.",1
Oncogenic KRAS Regulates Tumor Cell Signaling via Stromal Reciprocation.,"Oncogenic mutations regulate signaling within both tumor cells and adjacent stromal cells. Here, we show that oncogenic KRAS (KRAS(G12D)) also regulates tumor cell signaling via stromal cells. By combining cell-specific proteome labeling with multivariate phosphoproteomics, we analyzed heterocellular KRAS(G12D) signaling in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) cells. Tumor cell KRAS(G12D) engages heterotypic fibroblasts, which subsequently instigate reciprocal signaling in the tumor cells. Reciprocal signaling employs additional kinases and doubles the number of regulated signaling nodes from cell-autonomous KRAS(G12D). Consequently, reciprocal KRAS(G12D) produces a tumor cell phosphoproteome and total proteome that is distinct from cell-autonomous KRAS(G12D) alone. Reciprocal signaling regulates tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis and increases mitochondrial capacity via an IGF1R/AXL-AKT axis. These results demonstrate that oncogene signaling should be viewed as a heterocellular process and that our existing cell-autonomous perspective underrepresents the extent of oncogene signaling in cancer. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",1
"Asprosin, a Fasting-Induced Glucogenic Protein Hormone.","Hepatic glucose release into the circulation is vital for brain function and survival during periods of fasting and is modulated by an array of hormones that precisely regulate plasma glucose levels. We have identified a fasting-induced protein hormone that modulates hepatic glucose release. It is the C-terminal cleavage product of profibrillin, and we name it Asprosin. Asprosin is secreted by white adipose, circulates at nanomolar levels, and is recruited to the liver, where it activates the G protein-cAMP-PKA pathway, resulting in rapid glucose release into the circulation. Humans and mice with insulin resistance show pathologically elevated plasma asprosin, and its loss of function via immunologic or genetic means has a profound glucose- and insulin-lowering effect secondary to reduced hepatic glucose release. Asprosin represents a glucogenic protein hormone, and therapeutically targeting it may be beneficial in type II diabetes and metabolic syndrome.",1
3D RNA and Functional Interactions from Evolutionary Couplings.,"Non-coding RNAs are ubiquitous, but the discovery of new RNA gene sequences far outpaces the research on the structure and functional interactions of these RNA gene sequences. We mine the evolutionary sequence record to derive precise information about the function and structure of RNAs and RNA-protein complexes. As in protein structure prediction, we use maximum entropy global probability models of sequence co-variation to infer evolutionarily constrained nucleotide-nucleotide interactions within RNA molecules and nucleotide-amino acid interactions in RNA-protein complexes. The predicted contacts allow all-atom blinded 3D structure prediction at good accuracy for several known RNA structures and RNA-protein complexes. For unknown structures, we predict contacts in 160 non-coding RNA families. Beyond 3D structure prediction, evolutionary couplings help identify important functional interactions-e.g., at switch points in riboswitches and at a complex nucleation site in HIV. Aided by increasing sequence accumulation, evolutionary coupling analysis can accelerate the discovery of functional interactions and 3D structures involving RNA.",1
Rapid Inflammasome Activation following Mucosal SIV Infection of Rhesus Monkeys.,"The earliest events following mucosal HIV-1 infection, prior to measurable viremia, remain poorly understood. Here, by detailed necropsy studies, we show that the virus can rapidly disseminate following mucosal SIV infection of rhesus monkeys and trigger components of the inflammasome, both at the site of inoculation and at early sites of distal virus spread. By 24 hr following inoculation, a proinflammatory signature that lacked antiviral restriction factors was observed in viral RNA-positive tissues. The early innate response included expression of NLRX1, which inhibits antiviral responses, and activation of the TGF-beta pathway, which negatively regulates adaptive immune responses. These data suggest a model in which the virus triggers specific host mechanisms that suppress the generation of antiviral innate and adaptive immune responses in the first few days of infection, thus facilitating its own replication. These findings have important implications for the development of vaccines and other strategies to prevent infection.",1
Transcriptional Regulators Compete with Nucleosomes Post-replication.,"Every nucleosome across the genome must be disrupted and reformed when the replication fork passes, but how chromatin organization is re-established following replication is unknown. To address this problem, we have developed Mapping In vivo Nascent Chromatin with EdU and sequencing (MINCE-seq) to characterize the genome-wide location of nucleosomes and other chromatin proteins behind replication forks at high temporal and spatial resolution. We find that the characteristic chromatin landscape at Drosophila promoters and enhancers is lost upon replication. The most conspicuous changes are at promoters that have high levels of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) stalling and DNA accessibility and show specific enrichment for the BRM remodeler. Enhancer chromatin is also disrupted during replication, suggesting a role for transcription factor (TF) competition in nucleosome re-establishment. Thus, the characteristic nucleosome landscape emerges from a uniformly packaged genome by the action of TFs, RNAPII, and remodelers minutes after replication fork passage.",1
Cell-to-Cell Variation in p53 Dynamics Leads to Fractional Killing.,"Many chemotherapeutic drugs kill only a fraction of cancer cells, limiting their efficacy. We used live-cell imaging to investigate the role of p53 dynamics in fractional killing of colon cancer cells in response to chemotherapy. We found that both surviving and dying cells reach similar levels of p53, indicating that cell death is not determined by a fixed p53 threshold. Instead, a cell's probability of death depends on the time and levels of p53. Cells must reach a threshold level of p53 to execute apoptosis, and this threshold increases with time. The increase in p53 apoptotic threshold is due to drug-dependent induction of anti-apoptotic genes, predominantly in the inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) family. Our study underlines the importance of measuring the dynamics of key players in response to chemotherapy to determine mechanisms of resistance and optimize the timing of combination therapy.",1
Mechanism of NMDA Receptor Inhibition and Activation.,"N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are glutamate-gated, calcium-permeable ion channels that mediate synaptic transmission and underpin learning and memory. NMDAR dysfunction is directly implicated in diseases ranging from seizure to ischemia. Despite its fundamental importance, little is known about how the NMDAR transitions between inactive and active states and how small molecules inhibit or activate ion channel gating. Here, we report electron cryo-microscopy structures of the GluN1-GluN2B NMDA receptor in an ensemble of competitive antagonist-bound states, an agonist-bound form, and a state bound with agonists and the allosteric inhibitor Ro25-6981. Together with double electron-electron resonance experiments, we show how competitive antagonists rupture the ligand binding domain (LBD) gating ""ring,"" how agonists retain the ring in a dimer-of-dimers configuration, and how allosteric inhibitors, acting within the amino terminal domain, further stabilize the LBD layer. These studies illuminate how the LBD gating ring is fundamental to signal transduction and gating in NMDARs.",1
A Reservoir of Mature Cavity Macrophages that Can Rapidly Invade Visceral Organs to Affect Tissue Repair.,"A key feature of inflammation is the timely recruitment of leukocytes, including monocytes, from blood into tissues, the latter maturing into macrophages over a period of 2-3 days. Using multi-channel spinning disk microscopy, we identified a rapid pathway of macrophage recruitment into an injured organ via a non-vascular route requiring no maturation from monocytes. In response to a sterile injury in liver, a reservoir of fully mature F4/80(hi)GATA6(+) peritoneal cavity macrophages rapidly invaded into afflicted tissue via direct recruitment across the mesothelium. The invasion was dependent on CD44 and DAMP molecule ATP and resulted in rapid replication and switching of macrophage toward an alternatively activated phenotype. These macrophages dismantled the nuclei of necrotic cells releasing DNA and forming a cover across the injury site. Rapid invasion of mature macrophages from body cavity with capacity for induction of reparative phenotype may impact altered tissues ranging from trauma to infections to cancer. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",1
A Distinct Type of Pilus from the Human Microbiome.,"Pili are proteinaceous polymers of linked pilins that protrude from the cell surface of many bacteria and often mediate adherence and virulence. We investigated a set of 20 Bacteroidia pilins from the human microbiome whose structures and mechanism of assembly were unknown. Crystal structures and biochemical data revealed a diverse protein superfamily with a common Greek-key beta sandwich fold with two transthyretin-like repeats that polymerize into a pilus through a strand-exchange mechanism. The assembly mechanism of the central, structural pilins involves proteinase-assisted removal of their N-terminal beta strand, creating an extended hydrophobic groove that binds the C-terminal donor strands of the incoming pilin. Accessory pilins at the tip and base have unique structural features specific to their location, allowing initiation or termination of the assembly. The Bacteroidia pilus, therefore, has a biogenesis mechanism that is distinct from other known pili and likely represents a different type of bacterial pilus.",1
Steroid Receptors Reprogram FoxA1 Occupancy through Dynamic Chromatin Transitions.,"The estrogen receptor (ER), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and forkhead box protein 1 (FoxA1) are significant factors in breast cancer progression. FoxA1 has been implicated in establishing ER-binding patterns though its unique ability to serve as a pioneer factor. However, the molecular interplay between ER, GR, and FoxA1 requires further investigation. Here we show that ER and GR both have the ability to alter the genomic distribution of the FoxA1 pioneer factor. Single-molecule tracking experiments in live cells reveal a highly dynamic interaction of FoxA1 with chromatin in vivo. Furthermore, the FoxA1 factor is not associated with detectable footprints at its binding sites throughout the genome. These findings support a model wherein interactions between transcription factors and pioneer factors are highly dynamic. Moreover, at a subset of genomic sites, the role of pioneer can be reversed, with the steroid receptors serving to enhance binding of FoxA1.",1
Single-Cell RNA-Seq Reveals Lineage and X Chromosome Dynamics in Human Preimplantation Embryos.,"Mouse studies have been instrumental in forming our current understanding of early cell-lineage decisions; however, similar insights into the early human development are severely limited. Here, we present a comprehensive transcriptional map of human embryo development, including the sequenced transcriptomes of 1,529 individual cells from 88 human preimplantation embryos. These data show that cells undergo an intermediate state of co-expression of lineage-specific genes, followed by a concurrent establishment of the trophectoderm, epiblast, and primitive endoderm lineages, which coincide with blastocyst formation. Female cells of all three lineages achieve dosage compensation of X chromosome RNA levels prior to implantation. However, in contrast to the mouse, XIST is transcribed from both alleles throughout the progression of this expression dampening, and X chromosome genes maintain biallelic expression while dosage compensation proceeds. We envision broad utility of this transcriptional atlas in future studies on human development as well as in stem cell research.",1
A Glial K/Cl Transporter Controls Neuronal Receptive Ending Shape by Chloride Inhibition of an rGC.,"Neurons receive input from the outside world or from other neurons through neuronal receptive endings (NREs). Glia envelop NREs to create specialized microenvironments; however, glial functions at these sites are poorly understood. Here, we report a molecular mechanism by which glia control NRE shape and associated animal behavior. The C. elegans AMsh glial cell ensheathes the NREs of 12 neurons, including the thermosensory neuron AFD. KCC-3, a K/Cl transporter, localizes specifically to a glial microdomain surrounding AFD receptive ending microvilli, where it regulates K(+) and Cl(-) levels. We find that Cl(-) ions function as direct inhibitors of an NRE-localized receptor-guanylyl-cyclase, GCY-8, which synthesizes cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). High cGMP mediates the effects of glial KCC-3 on AFD shape by antagonizing the actin regulator WSP-1/NWASP. Components of this pathway are broadly expressed throughout the nervous system, suggesting that ionic regulation of the NRE microenvironment may be a conserved mechanism by which glia control neuron shape and function.",1
The CDK-APC/C Oscillator Predominantly Entrains Periodic Cell-Cycle Transcription.,"Throughout cell-cycle progression, the expression of multiple transcripts oscillate, and whether these are under the centralized control of the CDK-APC/C proteins or can be driven by a de-centralized transcription factor (TF) cascade is a fundamental question for understanding cell-cycle regulation. In budding yeast, we find that the transcription of nearly all genes, as assessed by RNA-seq or fluorescence microscopy in single cells, is dictated by CDK-APC/C. Three exceptional genes are transcribed in a pulsatile pattern in a variety of CDK-APC/C arrests. Pursuing one of these transcripts, the SIC1 inhibitor of B-type cyclins, we use a combination of mathematical modeling and experimentation to provide evidence that, counter-intuitively, Sic1 provides a failsafe mechanism promoting nuclear division when levels of mitotic cyclins are low.",1
RNA Polymerase II Regulates Topoisomerase 1 Activity to Favor Efficient Transcription.,"We report a mechanism through which the transcription machinery directly controls topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) activity to adjust DNA topology throughout the transcription cycle. By comparing TOP1 occupancy using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) versus TOP1 activity using topoisomerase 1 sequencing (TOP1-seq), a method reported here to map catalytically engaged TOP1, TOP1 bound at promoters was discovered to become fully active only after pause-release. This transition coupled the phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal-domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) with stimulation of TOP1 above its basal rate, enhancing its processivity. TOP1 stimulation is strongly dependent on the kinase activity of BRD4, a protein that phosphorylates Ser2-CTD and regulates RNAPII pause-release. Thus the coordinated action of BRD4 and TOP1 overcame the torsional stress opposing transcription as RNAPII commenced elongation but preserved negative supercoiling that assists promoter melting at start sites. This nexus between transcription and DNA topology promises to elicit new strategies to intercept pathological gene expression.",1
Suppression of Enhancer Overactivation by a RACK7-Histone Demethylase Complex.,"Regulation of enhancer activity is important for controlling gene expression programs. Here, we report that a biochemical complex containing a potential chromatin reader, RACK7, and the histone lysine 4 tri-methyl (H3K4me3)-specific demethylase KDM5C occupies many active enhancers, including almost all super-enhancers. Loss of RACK7 or KDM5C results in overactivation of enhancers, characterized by the deposition of H3K4me3 and H3K27Ac, together with increased transcription of eRNAs and nearby genes. Furthermore, loss of RACK7 or KDM5C leads to de-repression of S100A oncogenes and various cancer-related phenotypes. Our findings reveal a RACK7/KDM5C-regulated, dynamic interchange between histone H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 at active enhancers, representing an additional layer of regulation of enhancer activity. We propose that RACK7/KDM5C functions as an enhancer ""brake"" to ensure appropriate enhancer activity, which, when compromised, could contribute to tumorigenesis.",1
A Vulnerability of a Subset of Colon Cancers with Potential Clinical Utility.,"BRAF(V600E) mutant colon cancers (CCs) have a characteristic gene expression signature that is also found in some tumors lacking this mutation. Collectively, they are referred to as ""BRAF-like"" tumors and represent some 20% of CCs. We used a shRNA-based genetic screen focused on genes upregulated in BRAF(V600E) CCs to identify vulnerabilities of this tumor subtype that might be exploited therapeutically. Here, we identify RANBP2 (also known as NUP358) as essential for survival of BRAF-like, but not for non-BRAF-like, CC cells. Suppression of RANBP2 results in mitotic defects only in BRAF-like CC cells, leading to cell death. Mechanistically, RANBP2 silencing reduces microtubule outgrowth from the kinetochores, thereby inducing spindle perturbations, providing an explanation for the observed mitotic defects. We find that BRAF-like CCs display far greater sensitivity to the microtubule poison vinorelbine both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that vinorelbine is a potential tailored treatment for BRAF-like CCs.",1
Core Circadian Clock Genes Regulate Leukemia Stem Cells in AML.,"Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) have the capacity to self-renew and propagate disease upon serial transplantation in animal models, and elimination of this cell population is required for curative therapies. Here, we describe a series of pooled, in vivo RNAi screens to identify essential transcription factors (TFs) in a murine model of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with genetically and phenotypically defined LSCs. These screens reveal the heterodimeric, circadian rhythm TFs Clock and Bmal1 as genes required for the growth of AML cells in vitro and in vivo. Disruption of canonical circadian pathway components produces anti-leukemic effects, including impaired proliferation, enhanced myeloid differentiation, and depletion of LSCs. We find that both normal and malignant hematopoietic cells harbor an intact clock with robust circadian oscillations, and genetic knockout models reveal a leukemia-specific dependence on the pathway. Our findings establish a role for the core circadian clock genes in AML.",1
Microbiome and Anticancer Immunosurveillance.,"Anticancer immune responses can be considered a desirable form of autoimmunity that may be profoundly shaped by the microbiome. Here, we discuss evidence for the microbiome's influence on anti-tumor immunosurveillance, including those that are indirect and can act at a distance, and we put forward hypotheses regarding mechanisms of how these effects are implemented. These may involve cross-reactivity between microbial and tumor antigens shaping T cell repertoires and/or microbial products stimulating pattern recognition receptors that influence the type and intensity of immune responses. Understanding how the microbiome impacts natural cancer immunosurveillance as well as treatment-induced immune responses will pave the way for more effective therapies and prophylactics.",1
Combination Cancer Therapies with Immune Checkpoint Blockade: Convergence on Interferon Signaling.,"Improving efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade for cancer can be facilitated by combining these agents with each other and/or with other conventional or targeted therapies. Interferon and innate immune signaling pathways in immune and tumor cells have emerged as intriguing determinants of response and resistance, often in complex and seemingly paradoxical ways.",1
A Friend in Need (of Nutrients) Is a....,"Endophytic fungi are found within the roots of healthy plants, but their function is poorly understood. In this issue, Hiruma et al. demonstrate that, under phosphate-limiting conditions, the endophytic fungus, Colletotrichum tofieldiae, provides growth-promoting and fitness benefits to Arabidopsis, but the plant must restrict fungal growth or risk pathogenesis.",1
CSR-1 Slices a Balance.,"CSR-1 is a germline-expressed C. elegans Argonaute protein essential for viability. In this issue of Cell, Gerson-Gurwitz et al. now demonstrate a role for CSR-1 and its slicer activity in downregulating the levels of maternally deposited mRNAs to fine-tune the expression of proteins with critical roles in embryonic cell divisions.",1
SMITten by the Speed of Splicing.,"Splicing occurs co-transcriptionally, but relative rates of splicing and transcription that might reveal mechanisms of their coordinated control have remained mysterious. Now, Carrillo Oesterreich et al. show that the fastest introns are gone nearly as soon as the 3' splice site is transcribed and that introns have distinct splicing kinetics with respect to polymerase progression along the gene.",1
Insulin Signaling in a Bit of a Jam.,"In this issue of Cell, Okin and Medzhitov report that sustained inflammation promotes hyperglycemia by targeting the mevalonate pathway. This represents an important step forward in understanding the mechanisms underlying the association between chronic low-grade inflammation and disruption of normal tissue functions in metabolic diseases.",1
A Time Bomb for Leukemia.,"Alterations of the circadian clock have been linked to cancer development. Puram et al. (in this issue) now uncover differential requirements between healthy hematopoietic and diseased leukemic stem cells for core circadian transcription factors, wherein leukemic cells depend on the clock machinery for survival and growth.",1
A Guide to Packing Your DNA.,"Genetic material is not randomly organized within the nucleus of a cell. How this organization occurs and why it matters are questions that Cell editor Marta Koch posed to Mitchell Guttman, Job Dekker, and Stavros Lomvardas. Excerpts from this Conversation are presented below, and an audio file of the full discussion is available with the article online.",1
The Antagonistic Gene Paralogs Upf3a and Upf3b Govern Nonsense-Mediated RNA Decay.,"Gene duplication is a major evolutionary force driving adaptation and speciation, as it allows for the acquisition of new functions and can augment or diversify existing functions. Here, we report a gene duplication event that yielded another outcome--the generation of antagonistic functions. One product of this duplication event--UPF3B--is critical for the nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) pathway, while its autosomal counterpart--UPF3A--encodes an enigmatic protein previously shown to have trace NMD activity. Using loss-of-function approaches in vitro and in vivo, we discovered that UPF3A acts primarily as a potent NMD inhibitor that stabilizes hundreds of transcripts. Evidence suggests that UPF3A acquired repressor activity through simple impairment of a critical domain, a rapid mechanism that may have been widely used in evolution. Mice conditionally lacking UPF3A exhibit ""hyper"" NMD and display defects in embryogenesis and gametogenesis. Our results support a model in which UPF3A serves as a molecular rheostat that directs developmental events.",1
TRIBE: Hijacking an RNA-Editing Enzyme to Identify Cell-Specific Targets of RNA-Binding Proteins.,"RNA transcripts are bound and regulated by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Current methods for identifying in vivo targets of an RBP are imperfect and not amenable to examining small numbers of cells. To address these issues, we developed TRIBE (targets of RNA-binding proteins identified by editing), a technique that couples an RBP to the catalytic domain of the Drosophila RNA-editing enzyme ADAR and expresses the fusion protein in vivo. RBP targets are marked with novel RNA editing events and identified by sequencing RNA. We have used TRIBE to identify the targets of three RBPs (Hrp48, dFMR1, and NonA). TRIBE compares favorably to other methods, including CLIP, and we have identified RBP targets from as little as 150 specific fly neurons. TRIBE can be performed without an antibody and in small numbers of specific cells.",1
Personalized Immunomonitoring Uncovers Molecular Networks that Stratify Lupus Patients.,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by loss of tolerance to nucleic acids and highly diverse clinical manifestations. To assess its molecular heterogeneity, we longitudinally profiled the blood transcriptome of 158 pediatric patients. Using mixed models accounting for repeated measurements, demographics, treatment, disease activity (DA), and nephritis class, we confirmed a prevalent IFN signature and identified a plasmablast signature as the most robust biomarker of DA. We detected gradual enrichment of neutrophil transcripts during progression to active nephritis and distinct signatures in response to treatment in different nephritis subclasses. Importantly, personalized immunomonitoring uncovered individual correlates of disease activity that enabled patient stratification into seven groups, supported by patient genotypes. Our study uncovers the molecular heterogeneity of SLE and provides an explanation for the failure of clinical trials. This approach may improve trial design and implementation of tailored therapies in genetically and clinically complex autoimmune diseases. PAPERCLIP.",1
Oncogenic Role of Fusion-circRNAs Derived from Cancer-Associated Chromosomal Translocations.,"Chromosomal translocations encode oncogenic fusion proteins that have been proven to be causally involved in tumorigenesis. Our understanding of whether such genomic alterations also affect non-coding RNAs is limited, and their impact on circular RNAs (circRNAs) has not been explored. Here, we show that well-established cancer-associated chromosomal translocations give rise to fusion circRNAs (f-circRNA) that are produced from transcribed exons of distinct genes affected by the translocations. F-circRNAs contribute to cellular transformation, promote cell viability and resistance upon therapy, and have tumor-promoting properties in in vivo models. Our work expands the current knowledge regarding molecular mechanisms involved in cancer onset and progression, with potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications.",1
A Taste Circuit that Regulates Ingestion by Integrating Food and Hunger Signals.,"Ingestion is a highly regulated behavior that integrates taste and hunger cues to balance food intake with metabolic needs. To study the dynamics of ingestion in the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster, we developed Expresso, an automated feeding assay that measures individual meal-bouts with high temporal resolution at nanoliter scale. Flies showed discrete, temporally precise ingestion that was regulated by hunger state and sucrose concentration. We identify 12 cholinergic local interneurons (IN1, for ""ingestion neurons"") necessary for this behavior. Sucrose ingestion caused a rapid and persistent increase in IN1 interneuron activity in fasted flies that decreased proportionally in response to subsequent feeding bouts. Sucrose responses of IN1 interneurons in fed flies were significantly smaller and lacked persistent activity. We propose that IN1 neurons monitor ingestion by connecting sugar-sensitive taste neurons in the pharynx to neural circuits that control the drive to ingest. Similar mechanisms for monitoring and regulating ingestion may exist in vertebrates.",1
Innate Lymphocyte/Ly6C(hi) Monocyte Crosstalk Promotes Klebsiella Pneumoniae Clearance.,"Increasing antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens has rendered some infections untreatable with available antibiotics. Klebsiella pneumoniae, a bacterial pathogen that has acquired high-level antibiotic resistance, is a common cause of pulmonary infections. Optimal clearance of K. pneumoniae from the host lung requires TNF and IL-17A. Herein, we demonstrate that inflammatory monocytes are rapidly recruited to the lungs of K. pneumoniae-infected mice and produce TNF, which markedly increases the frequency of IL-17-producing innate lymphoid cells. While pulmonary clearance of K. pneumoniae is preserved in neutrophil-depleted mice, monocyte depletion or TNF deficiency impairs IL-17A-dependent resolution of pneumonia. Monocyte-mediated bacterial uptake and killing is enhanced by ILC production of IL-17A, indicating that innate lymphocytes engage in a positive-feedback loop with monocytes that promotes clearance of pneumonia. Innate immune defense against a highly antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogen depends on crosstalk between inflammatory monocytes and innate lymphocytes that is mediated by TNF and IL-17A.",1
Splicing of Nascent RNA Coincides with Intron Exit from RNA Polymerase II.,"Protein-coding genes in eukaryotes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and introns are removed from pre-mRNA by the spliceosome. Understanding the time lag between Pol II progression and splicing could provide mechanistic insights into the regulation of gene expression. Here, we present two single-molecule nascent RNA sequencing methods that directly determine the progress of splicing catalysis as a function of Pol II position. Endogenous genes were analyzed on a global scale in budding yeast. We show that splicing is 50% complete when Pol II is only 45 nt downstream of introns, with the first spliced products observed as introns emerge from Pol II. Perturbations that slow the rate of spliceosome assembly or speed up the rate of transcription caused splicing delays, showing that regulation of both processes determines in vivo splicing profiles. We propose that matched rates streamline the gene expression pathway, while allowing regulation through kinetic competition.",1
Primary Cilium-Autophagy-Nrf2 (PAN) Axis Activation Commits Human Embryonic Stem Cells to a Neuroectoderm Fate.,"Under defined differentiation conditions, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can be directed toward a mesendoderm (ME) or neuroectoderm (NE) fate, the first decision during hESC differentiation. Coupled with lineage-specific G1 lengthening, a divergent ciliation pattern emerged within the first 24 hr of induced lineage specification, and these changes heralded a neuroectoderm decision before any neural precursor markers were expressed. By day 2, increased ciliation in NE precursors induced autophagy that resulted in the inactivation of Nrf2 and thereby relieved transcriptional activation of OCT4 and NANOG. Nrf2 binds directly to upstream regions of these pluripotency genes to promote their expression and repress NE derivation. Nrf2 suppression was sufficient to rescue poorly neurogenic iPSC lines. Only after these events had been initiated did neural precursor markers get expressed at day 4. Thus, we have identified a primary cilium-autophagy-Nrf2 (PAN) control axis coupled to cell-cycle progression that directs hESCs toward NE.",1
A Small RNA-Catalytic Argonaute Pathway Tunes Germline Transcript Levels to Ensure Embryonic Divisions.,"Multiple division cycles without growth are a characteristic feature of early embryogenesis. The female germline loads proteins and RNAs into oocytes to support these divisions, which lack many quality control mechanisms operating in somatic cells undergoing growth. Here, we describe a small RNA-Argonaute pathway that ensures early embryonic divisions in C. elegans by employing catalytic slicing activity to broadly tune, instead of silence, germline gene expression. Misregulation of one target, a kinesin-13 microtubule depolymerase, underlies a major phenotype associated with pathway loss. Tuning of target transcript levels is guided by the density of homologous small RNAs, whose generation must ultimately be related to target sequence. Thus, the tuning action of a small RNA-catalytic Argonaute pathway generates oocytes capable of supporting embryogenesis. We speculate that the specialized nature of germline chromatin led to the emergence of small RNA-catalytic Argonaute pathways in the female germline as a post-transcriptional control layer to optimize oocyte composition.",1
Types of Ubiquitin Ligases.,"Ubiquitination is a post-translational modification of proteins involved in a variety of cellular processes. Ubiquitination requires the sequential action of three enzymes: E1 (ubiquitin-activating enzymes), E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes), and E3 (ubiquitin ligases). This SnapShot highlights the main types of E3 ubiquitin ligases, which can be classified in three families depending on the presence of characteristic domains and on the mechanism of ubiquitin transfer to the substrate protein.",1
The Fuzzy Logic of Network Connectivity in Mouse Visual Thalamus.,"In an attempt to chart parallel sensory streams passing through the visual thalamus, we acquired a 100-trillion-voxel electron microscopy (EM) dataset and identified cohorts of retinal ganglion cell axons (RGCs) that innervated each of a diverse group of postsynaptic thalamocortical neurons (TCs). Tracing branches of these axons revealed the set of TCs innervated by each RGC cohort. Instead of finding separate sensory pathways, we found a single large network that could not be easily subdivided because individual RGCs innervated different kinds of TCs and different kinds of RGCs co-innervated individual TCs. We did find conspicuous network subdivisions organized on the basis of dendritic rather than neuronal properties. This work argues that, in the thalamus, neural circuits are not based on a canonical set of connections between intrinsically different neuronal types but, rather, may arise by experience-based mixing of different kinds of inputs onto individual postsynaptic cells.",1
Lysosomal Disorders Drive Susceptibility to Tuberculosis by Compromising Macrophage Migration.,"A zebrafish genetic screen for determinants of susceptibility to Mycobacterium marinum identified a hypersusceptible mutant deficient in lysosomal cysteine cathepsins that manifests hallmarks of human lysosomal storage diseases. Under homeostatic conditions, mutant macrophages accumulate undigested lysosomal material, which disrupts endocytic recycling and impairs their migration to, and thus engulfment of, dying cells. This causes a buildup of unengulfed cell debris. During mycobacterial infection, macrophages with lysosomal storage cannot migrate toward infected macrophages undergoing apoptosis in the tuberculous granuloma. The unengulfed apoptotic macrophages undergo secondary necrosis, causing granuloma breakdown and increased mycobacterial growth. Macrophage lysosomal storage similarly impairs migration to newly infecting mycobacteria. This phenotype is recapitulated in human smokers, who are at increased risk for tuberculosis. A majority of their alveolar macrophages exhibit lysosomal accumulations of tobacco smoke particulates and do not migrate to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The incapacitation of highly microbicidal first-responding macrophages may contribute to smokers' susceptibility to tuberculosis.",1
AgRP Neurons Control Systemic Insulin Sensitivity via Myostatin Expression in Brown Adipose Tissue.,"Activation of Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons potently promotes feeding, and chronically altering their activity also affects peripheral glucose homeostasis. We demonstrate that acute activation of AgRP neurons causes insulin resistance through impairment of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake into brown adipose tissue (BAT). AgRP neuron activation acutely reprograms gene expression in BAT toward a myogenic signature, including increased expression of myostatin. Interference with myostatin activity improves insulin sensitivity that was impaired by AgRP neurons activation. Optogenetic circuitry mapping reveals that feeding and insulin sensitivity are controlled by both distinct and overlapping projections. Stimulation of AgRP --> LHA projections impairs insulin sensitivity and promotes feeding while activation of AgRP --> anterior bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (aBNST)vl projections, distinct from AgRP --> aBNSTdm projections controlling feeding, mediate the effect of AgRP neuron activation on BAT-myostatin expression and insulin sensitivity. Collectively, our results suggest that AgRP neurons in mice induce not only eating, but also insulin resistance by stimulating expression of muscle-related genes in BAT, revealing a mechanism by which these neurons rapidly coordinate hunger states with glucose homeostasis.",1
A Tunable Mechanism Determines the Duration of the Transgenerational Small RNA Inheritance in C. elegans.,"In C. elegans, small RNAs enable transmission of epigenetic responses across multiple generations. While RNAi inheritance mechanisms that enable ""memorization"" of ancestral responses are being elucidated, the mechanisms that determine the duration of inherited silencing and the ability to forget the inherited epigenetic effects are not known. We now show that exposure to dsRNA activates a feedback loop whereby gene-specific RNAi responses dictate the transgenerational duration of RNAi responses mounted against unrelated genes, elicited separately in previous generations. RNA-sequencing analysis reveals that, aside from silencing of genes with complementary sequences, dsRNA-induced RNAi affects the production of heritable endogenous small RNAs, which regulate the expression of RNAi factors. Manipulating genes in this feedback pathway changes the duration of heritable silencing. Such active control of transgenerational effects could be adaptive, since ancestral responses would be detrimental if the environments of the progeny and the ancestors were different.",1
Long-Lived Binding of Sox2 to DNA Predicts Cell Fate in the Four-Cell Mouse Embryo.,"Transcription factor (TF) binding to DNA is fundamental for gene regulation. However, it remains unknown how the dynamics of TF-DNA interactions change during cell-fate determination in vivo. Here, we use photo-activatable FCS to quantify TF-DNA binding in single cells of developing mouse embryos. In blastocysts, the TFs Oct4 and Sox2, which control pluripotency, bind DNA more stably in pluripotent than in extraembryonic cells. By contrast, in the four-cell embryo, Sox2 engages in more long-lived interactions than does Oct4. Sox2 long-lived binding varies between blastomeres and is regulated by H3R26 methylation. Live-cell tracking demonstrates that those blastomeres with more long-lived binding contribute more pluripotent progeny, and reducing H3R26 methylation decreases long-lived binding, Sox2 target expression, and pluripotent cell numbers. Therefore, Sox2-DNA binding predicts mammalian cell fate as early as the four-cell stage. More generally, we reveal the dynamic repartitioning of TFs between DNA sites driven by physiological epigenetic changes. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",1
Heterogeneity in Oct4 and Sox2 Targets Biases Cell Fate in 4-Cell Mouse Embryos.,"The major and essential objective of pre-implantation development is to establish embryonic and extra-embryonic cell fates. To address when and how this fundamental process is initiated in mammals, we characterize transcriptomes of all individual cells throughout mouse pre-implantation development. This identifies targets of master pluripotency regulators Oct4 and Sox2 as being highly heterogeneously expressed between blastomeres of the 4-cell embryo, with Sox21 showing one of the most heterogeneous expression profiles. Live-cell tracking demonstrates that cells with decreased Sox21 yield more extra-embryonic than pluripotent progeny. Consistently, decreasing Sox21 results in premature upregulation of the differentiation regulator Cdx2, suggesting that Sox21 helps safeguard pluripotency. Furthermore, Sox21 is elevated following increased expression of the histone H3R26-methylase CARM1 and is lowered following CARM1 inhibition, indicating the importance of epigenetic regulation. Therefore, our results indicate that heterogeneous gene expression, as early as the 4-cell stage, initiates cell-fate decisions by modulating the balance of pluripotency and differentiation.",1
Metastatic Latency and Immune Evasion through Autocrine Inhibition of WNT.,"Metastasis frequently develops years after the removal of a primary tumor, from a minority of disseminated cancer cells that survived as latent entities through unknown mechanisms. We isolated latency competent cancer (LCC) cells from early stage human lung and breast carcinoma cell lines and defined the mechanisms that suppress outgrowth, support long-term survival, and maintain tumor-initiating potential in these cells during the latent metastasis stage. LCC cells show stem-cell-like characteristics and express SOX2 and SOX9 transcription factors, which are essential for their survival in host organs under immune surveillance and for metastatic outgrowth under permissive conditions. Through expression of the WNT inhibitor DKK1, LCC cells self-impose a slow-cycling state with broad downregulation of ULBP ligands for NK cells and evasion of NK-cell-mediated clearance. By expressing a Sox-dependent stem-like state and actively silencing WNT signaling, LCC cells can enter quiescence and evade innate immunity to remain latent for extended periods.",1
Ribosome Footprint Profiling of Translation throughout the Genome.,"Ribosome profiling has emerged as a technique for measuring translation comprehensively and quantitatively by deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments. By identifying the precise positions of ribosomes, footprinting experiments have unveiled key insights into the composition and regulation of the expressed proteome, including delineating potentially functional micropeptides, revealing pervasive translation on cytosolic RNAs, and identifying differences in elongation rates driven by codon usage or other factors. This Primer looks at important experimental and analytical concerns for executing ribosome profiling experiments and surveys recent examples where the approach was developed to explore protein biogenesis and homeostasis.",1
Untangling the Web between Eye and Brain.,"How is the picture of the visual scene that the eye encodes represented by neural circuits in the brain?

From the Beauty of Genomic Landscapes to the Strength of Transcriptional Mechanisms.,Genomic analyses are commonly used to infer trends and broad rules underlying transcriptional control. The innovative approach by Tong et al. to interrogate genomic datasets allows extracting mechanistic information on the specific regulation of individual genes.,1
CASTORing New Light on Amino Acid Sensing.,"The activation state of mTORC1, a master regulator of cell growth, is particularly sensitive to changes in the intracellular levels of the amino acid arginine, but the sensing mechanisms are poorly understood. In this issue of Cell, Chantranupong et al. identify CASTOR1 as a direct arginine sensor that acts through the GATOR2 complex to regulate mTORC1.",1
The Molecular Harbingers of Early Mammalian Embryo Patterning.,"Random or not, the mechanisms at play during the first cell-fate determination in mammalian embryos have been debated for years. Studies by Goolam et al. and White et al. shed new light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the intrinsic biases that lead to non-random lineage segregation in early mammalian development.",1
Capturing the Value of Biomedical Research.,"Assessing the real-world impact of biomedical research is notoriously difficult. Here, we present the framework for building a prospective science-centered information system from scratch that has been afforded by the Sidra Medical and Research Center in Qatar. This experiment is part of the global conversation on maximizing returns on research investment.",1
Root Endophyte Colletotrichum tofieldiae Confers Plant Fitness Benefits that Are Phosphate Status Dependent.,"A staggering diversity of endophytic fungi associate with healthy plants in nature, but it is usually unclear whether these represent stochastic encounters or provide host fitness benefits. Although most characterized species of the fungal genus Colletotrichum are destructive pathogens, we show here that C. tofieldiae (Ct) is an endemic endophyte in natural Arabidopsis thaliana populations in central Spain. Colonization by Ct initiates in roots but can also spread systemically into shoots. Ct transfers the macronutrient phosphorus to shoots, promotes plant growth, and increases fertility only under phosphorus-deficient conditions, a nutrient status that might have facilitated the transition from pathogenic to beneficial lifestyles. The host's phosphate starvation response (PSR) system controls Ct root colonization and is needed for plant growth promotion (PGP). PGP also requires PEN2-dependent indole glucosinolate metabolism, a component of innate immune responses, indicating a functional link between innate immunity and the PSR system during beneficial interactions with Ct.",1
Kv3.3 Channels Bind Hax-1 and Arp2/3 to Assemble a Stable Local Actin Network that Regulates Channel Gating.,"Mutations in the Kv3.3 potassium channel (KCNC3) cause cerebellar neurodegeneration and impair auditory processing. The cytoplasmic C terminus of Kv3.3 contains a proline-rich domain conserved in proteins that activate actin nucleation through Arp2/3. We found that Kv3.3 recruits Arp2/3 to the plasma membrane, resulting in formation of a relatively stable cortical actin filament network resistant to cytochalasin D that inhibits fast barbed end actin assembly. These Kv3.3-associated actin structures are required to prevent very rapid N-type channel inactivation during short depolarizations of the plasma membrane. The effects of Kv3.3 on the actin cytoskeleton are mediated by the binding of the cytoplasmic C terminus of Kv3.3 to Hax-1, an anti-apoptotic protein that regulates actin nucleation through Arp2/3. A human Kv3.3 mutation within a conserved proline-rich domain produces channels that bind Hax-1 but are impaired in recruiting Arp2/3 to the plasma membrane, resulting in growth cones with deficient actin veils in stem cell-derived neurons.",1
The Effect of Sustained Inflammation on Hepatic Mevalonate Pathway Results in Hyperglycemia.,"Control of plasma glucose level is essential to organismal survival. Sustained inflammation has been implicated in control of glucose homeostasis in cases of infection, obesity, and type 2 diabetes; however, the precise role of inflammation in these complex disease states remains poorly understood. Here, we find that sustained inflammation results in elevated plasma glucose due to increased hepatic glucose production. We find that sustained inflammation suppresses CYP7A1, leading to accumulation of intermediate metabolites at the branch point of the mevalonate pathway. This results in prenylation of RHOC, which is concomitantly induced by inflammatory cytokines. Subsequent activation of RHO-associated protein kinase results in elevated plasma glucose. These findings uncover an unexpected mechanism by which sustained inflammation alters glucose homeostasis.",1
Programmable RNA Tracking in Live Cells with CRISPR/Cas9.,"RNA-programmed genome editing using CRISPR/Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes has enabled rapid and accessible alteration of specific genomic loci in many organisms. A flexible means to target RNA would allow alteration and imaging of endogenous RNA transcripts analogous to CRISPR/Cas-based genomic tools, but most RNA targeting methods rely on incorporation of exogenous tags. Here, we demonstrate that nuclease-inactive S. pyogenes CRISPR/Cas9 can bind RNA in a nucleic-acid-programmed manner and allow endogenous RNA tracking in living cells. We show that nuclear-localized RNA-targeting Cas9 (RCas9) is exported to the cytoplasm only in the presence of sgRNAs targeting mRNA and observe accumulation of ACTB, CCNA2, and TFRC mRNAs in RNA granules that correlate with fluorescence in situ hybridization. We also demonstrate time-resolved measurements of ACTB mRNA trafficking to stress granules. Our results establish RCas9 as a means to track RNA in living cells in a programmable manner without genetically encoded tags.",1
Neuronal Firing Rate Homeostasis Is Inhibited by Sleep and Promoted by Wake.,"Homeostatic mechanisms stabilize neural circuit function by keeping firing rates within a set-point range, but whether this process is gated by brain state is unknown. Here, we monitored firing rate homeostasis in individual visual cortical neurons in freely behaving rats as they cycled between sleep and wake states. When neuronal firing rates were perturbed by visual deprivation, they gradually returned to a precise, cell-autonomous set point during periods of active wake, with lengthening of the wake period enhancing firing rate rebound. Unexpectedly, this resetting of neuronal firing was suppressed during sleep. This raises the possibility that memory consolidation or other sleep-dependent processes are vulnerable to interference from homeostatic plasticity mechanisms. PAPERCLIP.",1
Genomic and Transcriptomic Features of Response to Anti-PD-1 Therapy in Metastatic Melanoma.,"PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade provides significant clinical benefits for melanoma patients. We analyzed the somatic mutanomes and transcriptomes of pretreatment melanoma biopsies to identify factors that may influence innate sensitivity or resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. We find that overall high mutational loads associate with improved survival, and tumors from responding patients are enriched for mutations in the DNA repair gene BRCA2. Innately resistant tumors display a transcriptional signature (referred to as the IPRES, or innate anti-PD-1 resistance), indicating concurrent up-expression of genes involved in the regulation of mesenchymal transition, cell adhesion, extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis, and wound healing. Notably, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-targeted therapy (MAPK inhibitor) induces similar signatures in melanoma, suggesting that a non-genomic form of MAPK inhibitor resistance mediates cross-resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. Validation of the IPRES in other independent tumor cohorts defines a transcriptomic subset across distinct types of advanced cancer. These findings suggest that attenuating the biological processes that underlie IPRES may improve anti-PD-1 response in melanoma and other cancer types.",1
The CASTOR Proteins Are Arginine Sensors for the mTORC1 Pathway.,"Amino acids signal to the mTOR complex I (mTORC1) growth pathway through the Rag GTPases. Multiple distinct complexes regulate the Rags, including GATOR1, a GTPase activating protein (GAP), and GATOR2, a positive regulator of unknown molecular function. Arginine stimulation of cells activates mTORC1, but how it is sensed is not well understood. Recently, SLC38A9 was identified as a putative lysosomal arginine sensor required for arginine to activate mTORC1 but how arginine deprivation represses mTORC1 is unknown. Here, we show that CASTOR1, a previously uncharacterized protein, interacts with GATOR2 and is required for arginine deprivation to inhibit mTORC1. CASTOR1 homodimerizes and can also heterodimerize with the related protein, CASTOR2. Arginine disrupts the CASTOR1-GATOR2 complex by binding to CASTOR1 with a dissociation constant of ~30 muM, and its arginine-binding capacity is required for arginine to activate mTORC1 in cells. Collectively, these results establish CASTOR1 as an arginine sensor for the mTORC1 pathway.",1
Gut Microbial Metabolite TMAO Enhances Platelet Hyperreactivity and Thrombosis Risk.,"Normal platelet function is critical to blood hemostasis and maintenance of a closed circulatory system. Heightened platelet reactivity, however, is associated with cardiometabolic diseases and enhanced potential for thrombotic events. We now show gut microbes, through generation of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), directly contribute to platelet hyperreactivity and enhanced thrombosis potential. Plasma TMAO levels in subjects (n > 4,000) independently predicted incident (3 years) thrombosis (heart attack, stroke) risk. Direct exposure of platelets to TMAO enhanced sub-maximal stimulus-dependent platelet activation from multiple agonists through augmented Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores. Animal model studies employing dietary choline or TMAO, germ-free mice, and microbial transplantation collectively confirm a role for gut microbiota and TMAO in modulating platelet hyperresponsiveness and thrombosis potential and identify microbial taxa associated with plasma TMAO and thrombosis potential. Collectively, the present results reveal a previously unrecognized mechanistic link between specific dietary nutrients, gut microbes, platelet function, and thrombosis risk.",1
Signaling in Host-Associated Microbial Communities.,"Human-associated microbiota form and stabilize communities based on interspecies interactions. We review how these microbe-microbe and microbe-host interactions are communicated to shape communities over a human's lifespan, including periods of health and disease. Modeling and dissecting signaling in host-associated communities is crucial to understand their function and will open the door to therapies that prevent or correct microbial community dysfunction to promote health and treat disease.",1
Ecology and Evolution of Communication in Social Insects.,"Insect life strategies comprise all levels of sociality from solitary to eusocial, in which individuals form persistent groups and divide labor. With increasing social complexity, the need to communicate a greater diversity of messages arose to coordinate division of labor, group cohesion, and concerted actions. Here we summarize the knowledge on prominent messages in social insects that inform about reproduction, group membership, resource locations, and threats and discuss potential evolutionary trajectories of each message in the context of social complexity.",1
Insights into the Neural and Genetic Basis of Vocal Communication.,"The use of vocalizations to communicate information and elaborate social bonds is an adaptation seen in many vertebrate species. Human speech is an extreme version of this pervasive form of communication. Unlike the vocalizations exhibited by the majority of land vertebrates, speech is a learned behavior requiring early sensory exposure and auditory feedback for its development and maintenance. Studies in humans and a small number of other species have provided insights into the neural and genetic basis for learned vocal communication and are helping to delineate the roles of brain circuits across the cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum in generating vocal behaviors. This Review provides an outline of the current knowledge about these circuits and the genes implicated in vocal communication, as well as a perspective on future research directions in this field.",1
Information Integration and Communication in Plant Growth Regulation.,"Plants are equipped with the capacity to respond to a large number of diverse signals, both internal ones and those emanating from the environment, that are critical to their survival and adaption as sessile organisms. These signals need to be integrated through highly structured intracellular networks to ensure coherent cellular responses, and in addition, spatiotemporal actions of hormones and peptides both orchestrate local cell differentiation and coordinate growth and physiology over long distances. Further, signal interactions and signaling outputs vary significantly with developmental context. This review discusses our current understanding of the integrated intracellular and intercellular signaling networks that control plant growth.",1
Bone and Muscle Endocrine Functions: Unexpected Paradigms of Inter-organ Communication.,"Most physiological functions originate with the communication between organs. Mouse genetics has revived this holistic view of physiology through the identification of inter-organ communications that are unanticipated, functionally important, and would have been difficult to uncover otherwise. This Review highlights this point by showing how two tissues usually not seen as endocrine ones, bone and striated muscles, influence several physiological processes in a significant manner.",1
The Basis of Oncoimmunology.,"Cancer heterogeneity, a hallmark enabling clonal survival and therapy resistance, is shaped by active immune responses. Antigen-specific T cells can control cancer, as revealed clinically by immunotherapeutics such as adoptive T-cell transfer and checkpoint blockade. The host immune system is thus a powerful tool that, if better harnessed, could significantly enhance the efficacy of cytotoxic therapy and improve outcomes for cancer sufferers. To realize this vision, however, a number of research frontiers must be tackled. These include developing strategies for neutralizing tumor-promoting inflammation, broadening T-cell repertoires (via vaccination), and elucidating the mechanisms by which immune cells organize tumor microenvironments to regulate T-cell activity. Such efforts will pave the way for identifying new targets for combination therapies that overcome resistance to current treatments and promote long-term cancer control.",1
Communication by Extracellular Vesicles: Where We Are and Where We Need to Go.,"In multicellular organisms, distant cells can exchange information by sending out signals composed of single molecules or, as increasingly exemplified in the literature, via complex packets stuffed with a selection of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, called extracellular vesicles (EVs; also known as exosomes and microvesicles, among other names). This Review covers some of the most striking functions described for EV secretion but also presents the limitations on our knowledge of their physiological roles. While there are initial indications that EV-mediated pathways operate in vivo, the actual nature of the EVs involved in these effects still needs to be clarified. Here, we focus on the context of tumor cells and their microenvironment, but similar results and challenges apply to all patho/physiological systems in which EV-mediated communication is proposed to take place.",1
Hardwiring Stem Cell Communication through Tissue Structure.,"Adult stem cells across diverse organs self-renew and differentiate to maintain tissue homeostasis. How stem cells receive input to preserve tissue structure and function largely relies on their communication with surrounding cellular and non-cellular elements. As such, how tissues are organized and patterned not only reflects organ function, but also inherently hardwires networks of communication between stem cells and their environment to direct tissue homeostasis and injury repair. This review highlights how different methods of stem cell communication reflect the unique organization and function of diverse tissues.",1
Hallmarks of Tissue-Resident Lymphocytes.,"Although they are classically viewed as continuously recirculating through the lymphoid organs and blood, lymphocytes also establish residency in non-lymphoid tissues, most prominently at barrier sites, including the mucosal surfaces and skin. These specialized tissue-resident lymphocyte subsets span the innate-adaptive continuum and include innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), unconventional T cells (e.g., NKT, MAIT, gammadelta T cells, and CD8alphaalpha(+) IELs), and tissue-resident memory T (T(RM)) cells. Although these diverse cell types differ in the particulars of their biology, they nonetheless exhibit important shared features, including a role in the preservation of tissue integrity and function during homeostasis, infection, and non-infectious perturbations. In this Review, we discuss the hallmarks of tissue-resident innate, innate-like, and adaptive lymphocytes, as well as their potential functions in non-lymphoid organs.",1
Engineering Cellular Metabolism.,"Metabolic engineering is the science of rewiring the metabolism of cells to enhance production of native metabolites or to endow cells with the ability to produce new products. The potential applications of such efforts are wide ranging, including the generation of fuels, chemicals, foods, feeds, and pharmaceuticals. However, making cells into efficient factories is challenging because cells have evolved robust metabolic networks with hard-wired, tightly regulated lines of communication between molecular pathways that resist efforts to divert resources. Here, we will review the current status and challenges of metabolic engineering and will discuss how new technologies can enable metabolic engineering to be scaled up to the industrial level, either by cutting off the lines of control for endogenous metabolism or by infiltrating the system with disruptive, heterologous pathways that overcome cellular regulation.",1
The Dark Side of Cell Signaling: Positive Roles for Negative Regulators.,"Cell signaling is dominated by analyzing positive responses to stimuli. Signal activation is balanced by negative regulators that are generally considered to terminate signaling. Rather than exerting only negative effects, however, many such regulators play important roles in enhancing cell-signaling control. Considering responses downstream of selected cell-surface receptors, we discuss how receptor internalization affects signaling specificity and how rapid kinase/phosphatase and GTP/GDP cycles increase responsiveness and allow kinetic proofreading in receptor signaling. We highlight the blurring of distinctions between positive and negative signals, recasting signal termination as the response to a switch-like transition into a new cellular state.",1
The Nuclear Pore Complex as a Flexible and Dynamic Gate.,"Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) perforate the nuclear envelope and serve as the primary transport gates for molecular exchange between nucleus and cytoplasm. Stripping the megadalton complex down to its most essential organizational elements, one can divide the NPC into scaffold components and the disordered elements attached to them that generate a selective barrier between compartments. These structural elements exhibit flexibility, which may hold a clue in understanding NPC assembly and function. Here we review the current status of NPC research with a focus on the functional implications of its structural and compositional heterogeneity.",1
Passive Noise Filtering by Cellular Compartmentalization.,"Chemical reactions contain an inherent element of randomness, which presents itself as noise that interferes with cellular processes and communication. Here we discuss the ability of the spatial partitioning of molecular systems to filter and, thus, remove noise, while preserving regulated and predictable differences between single living cells. In contrast to active noise filtering by network motifs, cellular compartmentalization is highly effective and easily scales to numerous systems without requiring a substantial usage of cellular energy. We will use passive noise filtering by the eukaryotic cell nucleus as an example of how this increases predictability of transcriptional output, with possible implications for the evolution of complex multicellularity.",1
"Communication in Neural Circuits: Tools, Opportunities, and Challenges.","Communication, the effective delivery of information, is fundamental to life across all scales and species. Nervous systems (by necessity) may be most specifically adapted among biological tissues for high rate and complexity of information transmitted, and thus, the properties of neural tissue and principles of its organization into circuits may illuminate capabilities and limitations of biological communication. Here, we consider recent developments in tools for studying neural circuits with particular attention to defining neuronal cell types by input and output information streams--i.e., by how they communicate. Complementing approaches that define cell types by virtue of genetic promoter/enhancer properties, this communication-based approach to defining cell types operationally by input/output (I/O) relationships links structure and function, resolves difficulties associated with single-genetic-feature definitions, leverages technology for observing and testing significance of precisely these I/O relationships in intact brains, and maps onto processes through which behavior may be adapted during development, experience, and evolution.",1
Movement: How the Brain Communicates with the World.,"Voluntary movement is a result of signals transmitted through a communication channel that links the internal world in our minds to the physical world around us. Intention can be considered the desire to effect change on our environment, and this is contained in the signals from the brain, passed through the nervous system to converge on muscles that generate displacements and forces on our surroundings. The resulting changes in the world act to generate sensations that feed back to the nervous system, closing the control loop. This Perspective discusses the experimental and theoretical underpinnings of current models of movement generation and the way they are modulated by external information. Movement systems embody intentionality and prediction, two factors that are propelling a revolution in engineering. Development of movement models that include the complexities of the external world may allow a better understanding of the neuronal populations regulating these processes, as well as the development of solutions for autonomous vehicles and robots, and neural prostheses for those who are motor impaired.",1
The 3D Genome as Moderator of Chromosomal Communication.,"Proper expression of genes requires communication with their regulatory elements that can be located elsewhere along the chromosome. The physics of chromatin fibers imposes a range of constraints on such communication. The molecular and biophysical mechanisms by which chromosomal communication is established, or prevented, have become a topic of intense study, and important roles for the spatial organization of chromosomes are being discovered. Here we present a view of the interphase 3D genome characterized by extensive physical compartmentalization and insulation on the one hand and facilitated long-range interactions on the other. We propose the existence of topological machines dedicated to set up and to exploit a 3D genome organization to both promote and censor communication along and between chromosomes.",1
Reverse Engineering Human Pathophysiology with Organs-on-Chips.,"While studies of cultured cells have led to new insights into biological control, greater understanding of human pathophysiology requires the development of experimental systems that permit analysis of intercellular communications and tissue-tissue interactions in a more relevant organ context. Human organs-on-chips offer a potentially powerful new approach to confront this long-standing problem.",1
"Communication in Drug Development: ""Translating"" Scientific Discovery.","The discovery and development of new medicines that promote human health and potentially extend natural life remains a remarkably challenging endeavor. In this Commentary, we identify key elements of communication required to successfully translate promising biological findings to novel approved drug therapies and discuss the attendant challenges and opportunities.",1
"You, Me, and We: Biolabs for the 21st Century.","Twenty-first century biomedical research is advantaged by institutional infrastructures that foster a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach.

Staying Afloat in the Rising Tide of Science.,New York Times columnist and science writer Carl Zimmer discusses the challenges of effectively communicating with the public about science.,1
When Biology Doesn't Add Up.,"Physical models are increasingly used to inform our understanding of biology. Where such models still run into limits was the question that Cell's Robert Kruger posed to Julie Theriot, K.C. Huang, and Mark Goulian. Annotated excerpts from this conversation are presented below, and the full conversation is available with the article online.",1
Bayesian Sparse Regression Analysis Documents the Diversity of Spinal Inhibitory Interneurons.,"Documenting the extent of cellular diversity is a critical step in defining the functional organization of tissues and organs. To infer cell-type diversity from partial or incomplete transcription factor expression data, we devised a sparse Bayesian framework that is able to handle estimation uncertainty and can incorporate diverse cellular characteristics to optimize experimental design. Focusing on spinal V1 inhibitory interneurons, for which the spatial expression of 19 transcription factors has been mapped, we infer the existence of ~50 candidate V1 neuronal types, many of which localize in compact spatial domains in the ventral spinal cord. We have validated the existence of inferred cell types by direct experimental measurement, establishing this Bayesian framework as an effective platform for cell-type characterization in the nervous system and elsewhere.",1
Maturation Pathway from Germline to Broad HIV-1 Neutralizer of a CD4-Mimic Antibody.,"Antibodies with ontogenies from VH1-2 or VH1-46-germline genes dominate the broadly neutralizing response against the CD4-binding site (CD4bs) on HIV-1. Here, we define with longitudinal sampling from time-of-infection the development of a VH1-46-derived antibody lineage that matured to neutralize 90% of HIV-1 isolates. Structures of lineage antibodies CH235 (week 41 from time-of-infection, 18% breadth), CH235.9 (week 152, 77%), and CH235.12 (week 323, 90%) demonstrated the maturing epitope to focus on the conformationally invariant portion of the CD4bs. Similarities between CH235 lineage and five unrelated CD4bs lineages in epitope focusing, length-of-time to develop breadth, and extraordinary level of somatic hypermutation suggested commonalities in maturation among all CD4bs antibodies. Fortunately, the required CH235-lineage hypermutation appeared substantially guided by the intrinsic mutability of the VH1-46 gene, which closely resembled VH1-2. We integrated our CH235-lineage findings with a second broadly neutralizing lineage and HIV-1 co-evolution to suggest a vaccination strategy for inducing both lineages.",1
BOK Is a Non-canonical BCL-2 Family Effector of Apoptosis Regulated by ER-Associated Degradation.,"The mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis is initiated by mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). The BCL-2 family effectors BAX and BAK are thought to be absolutely required for this process. Here, we report that BCL-2 ovarian killer (BOK) is a bona fide yet unconventional effector of MOMP that can trigger apoptosis in the absence of both BAX and BAK. However, unlike the canonical effectors, BOK appears to be constitutively active and unresponsive to antagonistic effects of the antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins. Rather, BOK is controlled at the level of protein stability by components of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation pathway. BOK is ubiquitylated by the AMFR/gp78 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and targeted for proteasomal degradation in a VCP/p97-dependent manner, which allows survival of the cell. When proteasome function, VCP, or gp78 activity is compromised, BOK is stabilized to induce MOMP and apoptosis independently of other BCL-2 proteins.",1
Spinal Inhibitory Interneuron Diversity Delineates Variant Motor Microcircuits.,"Animals generate movement by engaging spinal circuits that direct precise sequences of muscle contraction, but the identity and organizational logic of local interneurons that lie at the core of these circuits remain unresolved. Here, we show that V1 interneurons, a major inhibitory population that controls motor output, fractionate into highly diverse subsets on the basis of the expression of 19 transcription factors. Transcriptionally defined V1 subsets exhibit distinct physiological signatures and highly structured spatial distributions with mediolateral and dorsoventral positional biases. These positional distinctions constrain patterns of input from sensory and motor neurons and, as such, suggest that interneuron position is a determinant of microcircuit organization. Moreover, V1 diversity indicates that different inhibitory microcircuits exist for motor pools controlling hip, ankle, and foot muscles, revealing a variable circuit architecture for interneurons that control limb movement.",1
Exploiting Temporal Collateral Sensitivity in Tumor Clonal Evolution.,"The prevailing approach to addressing secondary drug resistance in cancer focuses on treating the resistance mechanisms at relapse. However, the dynamic nature of clonal evolution, along with potential fitness costs and cost compensations, may present exploitable vulnerabilities-a notion that we term ""temporal collateral sensitivity."" Using a combined pharmacological screen and drug resistance selection approach in a murine model of Ph(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia, we indeed find that temporal and/or persistent collateral sensitivity to non-classical BCR-ABL1 drugs arises in emergent tumor subpopulations during the evolution of resistance toward initial treatment with BCR-ABL1-targeted inhibitors. We determined the sensitization mechanism via genotypic, phenotypic, signaling, and binding measurements in combination with computational models and demonstrated significant overall survival extension in mice. Additional stochastic mathematical models and small-molecule screens extended our insights, indicating the value of focusing on evolutionary trajectories and pharmacological profiles to identify new strategies to treat dynamic tumor vulnerabilities.",1
Cytotoxic T Cells Use Mechanical Force to Potentiate Target Cell Killing.,"The immunological synapse formed between a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and an infected or transformed target cell is a physically active structure capable of exerting mechanical force. Here, we investigated whether synaptic forces promote the destruction of target cells. CTLs kill by secreting toxic proteases and the pore forming protein perforin into the synapse. Biophysical experiments revealed a striking correlation between the magnitude of force exertion across the synapse and the speed of perforin pore formation on the target cell, implying that force potentiates cytotoxicity by enhancing perforin activity. Consistent with this interpretation, we found that increasing target cell tension augmented pore formation by perforin and killing by CTLs. Our data also indicate that CTLs coordinate perforin release and force exertion in space and time. These results reveal an unappreciated physical dimension to lymphocyte function and demonstrate that cells use mechanical forces to control the activity of outgoing chemical signals.",1
A Stringent Systems Approach Uncovers Gene-Specific Mechanisms Regulating Inflammation.,"Much has been learned about transcriptional cascades and networks from large-scale systems analyses of high-throughput datasets. However, analysis methods that optimize statistical power through simultaneous evaluation of thousands of ChIP-seq peaks or differentially expressed genes possess substantial limitations in their ability to uncover mechanistic principles of transcriptional control. By examining nascent transcript RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and binding motif datasets from lipid A-stimulated macrophages with increased attention to the quantitative distribution of signals, we identified unexpected relationships between the in vivo binding properties of inducible transcription factors, motif strength, and transcription. Furthermore, rather than emphasizing common features of large clusters of co-regulated genes, our results highlight the extent to which unique mechanisms regulate individual genes with key biological functions. Our findings demonstrate the mechanistic value of stringent interrogation of well-defined sets of genes as a complement to broader systems analyses of transcriptional cascades and networks.",1
New Brain Tumor Entities Emerge from Molecular Classification of CNS-PNETs.,"Primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the central nervous system (CNS-PNETs) are highly aggressive, poorly differentiated embryonal tumors occurring predominantly in young children but also affecting adolescents and adults. Herein, we demonstrate that a significant proportion of institutionally diagnosed CNS-PNETs display molecular profiles indistinguishable from those of various other well-defined CNS tumor entities, facilitating diagnosis and appropriate therapy for patients with these tumors. From the remaining fraction of CNS-PNETs, we identify four new CNS tumor entities, each associated with a recurrent genetic alteration and distinct histopathological and clinical features. These new molecular entities, designated ""CNS neuroblastoma with FOXR2 activation (CNS NB-FOXR2),"" ""CNS Ewing sarcoma family tumor with CIC alteration (CNS EFT-CIC),"" ""CNS high-grade neuroepithelial tumor with MN1 alteration (CNS HGNET-MN1),"" and ""CNS high-grade neuroepithelial tumor with BCOR alteration (CNS HGNET-BCOR),"" will enable meaningful clinical trials and the development of therapeutic strategies for patients affected by poorly differentiated CNS tumors.",1
Parallel Transformation of Tactile Signals in Central Circuits of Drosophila.,"To distinguish between complex somatosensory stimuli, central circuits must combine signals from multiple peripheral mechanoreceptor types, as well as mechanoreceptors at different sites in the body. Here, we investigate the first stages of somatosensory integration in Drosophila using in vivo recordings from genetically labeled central neurons in combination with mechanical and optogenetic stimulation of specific mechanoreceptor types. We identify three classes of central neurons that process touch: one compares touch signals on different parts of the same limb, one compares touch signals on right and left limbs, and the third compares touch and proprioceptive signals. Each class encodes distinct features of somatosensory stimuli. The axon of an individual touch receptor neuron can diverge to synapse onto all three classes, meaning that these computations occur in parallel, not hierarchically. Representing a stimulus as a set of parallel comparisons is a fast and efficient way to deliver somatosensory signals to motor circuits.",1
Spliceosomal DEAH-Box ATPases Remodel Pre-mRNA to Activate Alternative Splice Sites.,"During pre-mRNA splicing, a central step in the expression and regulation of eukaryotic genes, the spliceosome selects splice sites for intron excision and exon ligation. In doing so, the spliceosome must distinguish optimal from suboptimal splice sites. At the catalytic stage of splicing, suboptimal splice sites are repressed by the DEAH-box ATPases Prp16 and Prp22. Here, using budding yeast, we show that these ATPases function further by enabling the spliceosome to search for and utilize alternative branch sites and 3' splice sites. The ATPases facilitate this search by remodeling the splicing substrate to disengage candidate splice sites. Our data support a mechanism involving 3' to 5' translocation of the ATPases along substrate RNA and toward a candidate site, but, surprisingly, not across the site. Thus, our data implicate DEAH-box ATPases in acting at a distance by pulling substrate RNA from the catalytic core of the spliceosome.",1
The RNase PARN-1 Trims piRNA 3' Ends to Promote Transcriptome Surveillance in C. elegans.,"Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) engage Piwi proteins to suppress transposons and are essential for fertility in diverse organisms. An interesting feature of piRNAs is that, while piRNA lengths are stereotypical within a species, they can differ widely between species. For example, piRNAs are mainly 29 and 30 nucleotides in humans, 24 to 30 nucleotides in D. melanogaster, and uniformly 21 nucleotides in C. elegans. However, how piRNA length is determined and whether length impacts function remains unknown. Here, we show that C. elegans deficient for PARN-1, a conserved RNase, accumulate untrimmed piRNAs with 3' extensions. Surprisingly, these longer piRNAs are stable and associate with the Piwi protein PRG-1 but fail to robustly recruit downstream silencing factors. Our findings identify PARN-1 as a key regulator of piRNA length in C. elegans and suggest that length is regulated to promote efficient transcriptome surveillance.",1
Identification and Functional Analysis of the Pre-piRNA 3' Trimmer in Silkworms.,"PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) play a crucial role in transposon silencing in animal germ cells. In piRNA biogenesis, single-stranded piRNA intermediates are loaded into PIWI-clade proteins and cleaved by Zucchini/MitoPLD, yielding precursor piRNAs (pre-piRNAs). Pre-piRNAs that are longer than the mature piRNA length are then trimmed at their 3' ends. Although recent studies implicated the Tudor domain protein Papi/Tdrkh in pre-piRNA trimming, the identity of Trimmer and its relationship with Papi/Tdrkh remain unknown. Here, we identified PNLDC1, an uncharacterized 3'-5' exonuclease, as Trimmer in silkworms. Trimmer is enriched in the mitochondrial fraction and binds to Papi/Tdrkh. Depletion of Trimmer and Papi/Tdrkh additively inhibits trimming, causing accumulation of approximately 35-40-nt pre-piRNAs that are impaired for target cleavage and prone to degradation. Our results highlight the cooperative action of Trimmer and Papi/Tdrkh in piRNA maturation.",1
A Non-canonical Voltage-Sensing Mechanism Controls Gating in K2P K(+) Channels.,"Two-pore domain (K2P) K(+) channels are major regulators of excitability that endow cells with an outwardly rectifying background ""leak"" conductance. In some K2P channels, strong voltage-dependent activation has been observed, but the mechanism remains unresolved because they lack a canonical voltage-sensing domain. Here, we show voltage-dependent gating is common to most K2P channels and that this voltage sensitivity originates from the movement of three to four ions into the high electric field of an inactive selectivity filter. Overall, this ion-flux gating mechanism generates a one-way ""check valve"" within the filter because outward movement of K(+) induces filter opening, whereas inward movement promotes inactivation. Furthermore, many physiological stimuli switch off this flux gating mode to convert K2P channels into a leak conductance. These findings provide insight into the functional plasticity of a K(+)-selective filter and also refine our understanding of K2P channels and the mechanisms by which ion channels can sense voltage.",1
Unfolding of a Temperature-Sensitive Domain Controls Voltage-Gated Channel Activation.,"Voltage-gated ion channels (VGICs) are outfitted with diverse cytoplasmic domains that impact function. To examine how such elements may affect VGIC behavior, we addressed how the bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel (BacNa(V)) C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (CTD) affects function. Our studies show that the BacNa(V) CTD exerts a profound influence on gating through a temperature-dependent unfolding transition in a discrete cytoplasmic domain, the neck domain, proximal to the pore. Structural and functional studies establish that the BacNa(V) CTD comprises a bi-partite four-helix bundle that bears an unusual hydrophilic core whose integrity is central to the unfolding mechanism and that couples directly to the channel activation gate. Together, our findings define a general principle for how the widespread four-helix bundle cytoplasmic domain architecture can control VGIC responses, uncover a mechanism underlying the diverse BacNa(V) voltage dependencies, and demonstrate that a discrete domain can encode the temperature-dependent response of a channel.",1
NF-kappaB Restricts Inflammasome Activation via Elimination of Damaged Mitochondria.,"Nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), a key activator of inflammation, primes the NLRP3-inflammasome for activation by inducing pro-IL-1beta and NLRP3 expression. NF-kappaB, however, also prevents excessive inflammation and restrains NLRP3-inflammasome activation through a poorly defined mechanism. We now show that NF-kappaB exerts its anti-inflammatory activity by inducing delayed accumulation of the autophagy receptor p62/SQSTM1. External NLRP3-activating stimuli trigger a form of mitochondrial (mt) damage that is caspase-1- and NLRP3-independent and causes release of direct NLRP3-inflammasome activators, including mtDNA and mtROS. Damaged mitochondria undergo Parkin-dependent ubiquitin conjugation and are specifically recognized by p62, which induces their mitophagic clearance. Macrophage-specific p62 ablation causes pronounced accumulation of damaged mitochondria and excessive IL-1beta-dependent inflammation, enhancing macrophage death. Therefore, the ""NF-kappaB-p62-mitophagy"" pathway is a macrophage-intrinsic regulatory loop through which NF-kappaB restrains its own inflammation-promoting activity and orchestrates a self-limiting host response that maintains homeostasis and favors tissue repair.",1
EGLN1 Inhibition and Rerouting of alpha-Ketoglutarate Suffice for Remote Ischemic Protection.,"Ischemic preconditioning is the phenomenon whereby brief periods of sublethal ischemia protect against a subsequent, more prolonged, ischemic insult. In remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC), ischemia to one organ protects others organs at a distance. We created mouse models to ask if inhibition of the alpha-ketoglutarate (alphaKG)-dependent dioxygenase Egln1, which senses oxygen and regulates the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) transcription factor, could suffice to mediate local and remote ischemic preconditioning. Using somatic gene deletion and a pharmacological inhibitor, we found that inhibiting Egln1 systemically or in skeletal muscles protects mice against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Parabiosis experiments confirmed that RIPC in this latter model was mediated by a secreted factor. Egln1 loss causes accumulation of circulating alphaKG, which drives hepatic production and secretion of kynurenic acid (KYNA) that is necessary and sufficient to mediate cardiac ischemic protection in this setting.",1
UCP2 Regulates Mitochondrial Fission and Ventromedial Nucleus Control of Glucose Responsiveness.,"The ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) plays a critical role in regulating systemic glucose homeostasis. How neurons in this brain area adapt to the changing metabolic environment to regulate circulating glucose levels is ill defined. Here, we show that glucose load results in mitochondrial fission and reduced reactive oxygen species in VMH neurons mediated by dynamin-related peptide 1 (DRP1) under the control of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2). Probed by genetic manipulations and chemical-genetic control of VMH neuronal circuitry, we unmasked that this mitochondrial adaptation determines the size of the pool of glucose-excited neurons in the VMH and that this process regulates systemic glucose homeostasis. Thus, our data unmasked a critical cellular biological process controlled by mitochondrial dynamics in VMH regulation of systemic glucose homeostasis.",1
Condensin-Based Chromosome Organization from Bacteria to Vertebrates.,"Condensins are large protein complexes that play a central role in chromosome organization and segregation in the three domains of life. They display highly characteristic, rod-shaped structures with SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes) ATPases as their core subunits and organize large-scale chromosome structure through active mechanisms. Most eukaryotic species have two distinct condensin complexes whose balanced usage is adapted flexibly to different organisms and cell types. Studies of bacterial condensins provide deep insights into the fundamental mechanisms of chromosome segregation. This Review surveys both conserved features and rich variations of condensin-based chromosome organization and discusses their evolutionary implications.",1
Revisiting Management of Pediatric Brain Tumors with New Molecular Insights.,"Pediatric central nervous system primitive neuro-ectodermal brain tumors (CNS-PNETs) are rare tumors with ill-defined biological features. In this issue of Cell, Sturm et al. used state-of-the-art methods to interrogate these tumors' biology. Their integrated molecular analyses led them to propose a new molecular classification, with four new entities identified, that should get oncologists' attention.",1
Ground Control to Major Tom: The Cell Body Signals Axon Degeneration.,"Axon degeneration in response to trophic deprivation was thought to be locally restricted to the axon. However, increasing evidence points to a requirement for the cell body in the degenerative program. Now, Simon et al. identify the pro-apoptotic protein Puma as a key factor in this cell body-derived signal.",1
EMT: Matter of Life or Death?,"TGF-beta is long considered a ""protean"" cytokine in cancer, changing its role from anti- to pro-tumorigenic in a context-dependent manner. In this issue of Cell, David et al. use mouse models of pancreatic cancer to shed light on the mechanistic basis of how TGF-beta-induced EMT is coupled to either apoptosis or tumor progression.",1
A Happy 3' Ending to the piRNA Maturation Story.,"For a decade, mystery has surrounded the mechanisms by which piRNA biogenesis yields distinct size classes of small RNAs within individual PIWI proteins. In this issue of Cell, two studies shed light on this process, identifying conserved PARN-family exonucleases that trim piRNAs to their mature size in silkworms and C. elegans.",1
Getting a Grip on Microtubules.,"Posttranslational modifications control microtubule behavior, yet assigning roles to particular signals was hampered by lack of defined in vitro systems. In this issue of Cell, Valenstein and Roll-Mecak establish a biochemical platform to interrogate consequences of microtubule polyglutamylation, thereby providing important insights into the specificity and quantitative nature of cellular information transfer.",1
Going Germline: Mitochondrial Replacement as a Guide to Genome Editing.,"Mitochondrial replacement (MR) serves as a crucial test case and learning guide for the scientific, ethical, and regulatory challenges of future reproductive breakthroughs. The lessons learned from the regulatory review process of MR over the last decade promise to enrich the emerging dialog over genome editing.",1
Hedgehog Pathway Inhibition.,"The hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is aberrantly activated in a majority of basal cell carcinomas (BCC). Vismodegib and sonidegib are targeted inhibitors of Smoothened (SMO). Both drugs are approved for use in locally advanced BCC (laBCC), with vismodegib also approved for metastatic BCC (mBCC).",1
TGF-beta Tumor Suppression through a Lethal EMT.,"TGF-beta signaling can be pro-tumorigenic or tumor suppressive. We investigated this duality in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), which, with other gastrointestinal cancers, exhibits frequent inactivation of the TGF-beta mediator Smad4. We show that TGF-beta induces an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), generally considered a pro-tumorigenic event. However, in TGF-beta-sensitive PDA cells, EMT becomes lethal by converting TGF-beta-induced Sox4 from an enforcer of tumorigenesis into a promoter of apoptosis. This is the result of an EMT-linked remodeling of the cellular transcription factor landscape, including the repression of the gastrointestinal lineage-master regulator Klf5. Klf5 cooperates with Sox4 in oncogenesis and prevents Sox4-induced apoptosis. Smad4 is required for EMT but dispensable for Sox4 induction by TGF-beta. TGF-beta-induced Sox4 is thus geared to bolster progenitor identity, whereas simultaneous Smad4-dependent EMT strips Sox4 of an essential partner in oncogenesis. Our work demonstrates that TGF-beta tumor suppression functions through an EMT-mediated disruption of a lineage-specific transcriptional network.",1
Axon Degeneration Gated by Retrograde Activation of Somatic Pro-apoptotic Signaling.,"During development, sensory axons compete for limiting neurotrophic support, and local neurotrophin insufficiency triggers caspase-dependent axon degeneration. The signaling driving axon degeneration upon local deprivation is proposed to reside within axons. Our results instead support a model in which, despite the apoptotic machinery being present in axons, the cell body is an active participant in gating axonal caspase activation and axon degeneration. Loss of trophic support in axons initiates retrograde activation of a somatic pro-apoptotic pathway, which, in turn, is required for distal axon degeneration via an anterograde pro-degenerative factor. At a molecular level, the cell body is the convergence point of two signaling pathways whose integrated action drives upregulation of pro-apoptotic Puma, which, unexpectedly, is confined to the cell body. Puma then overcomes inhibition by pro-survival Bcl-xL and Bcl-w and initiates the anterograde pro-degenerative program, highlighting the role of the cell body as an arbiter of large-scale axon removal.",1
Sialylated Milk Oligosaccharides Promote Microbiota-Dependent Growth in Models of Infant Undernutrition.,"Identifying interventions that more effectively promote healthy growth of children with undernutrition is a pressing global health goal. Analysis of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) from 6-month-postpartum mothers in two Malawian birth cohorts revealed that sialylated HMOs are significantly less abundant in those with severely stunted infants. To explore this association, we colonized young germ-free mice with a consortium of bacterial strains cultured from the fecal microbiota of a 6-month-old stunted Malawian infant and fed recipient animals a prototypic Malawian diet with or without purified sialylated bovine milk oligosaccharides (S-BMO). S-BMO produced a microbiota-dependent augmentation of lean body mass gain, changed bone morphology, and altered liver, muscle, and brain metabolism in ways indicative of a greater ability to utilize nutrients for anabolism. These effects were also documented in gnotobiotic piglets using the same consortium and Malawian diet. These preclinical models indicate a causal, microbiota-dependent relationship between S-BMO and growth promotion.",1
Structure and Engineering of Francisella novicida Cas9.,"The RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 cleaves double-stranded DNA targets complementary to the guide RNA and has been applied to programmable genome editing. Cas9-mediated cleavage requires a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) juxtaposed with the DNA target sequence, thus constricting the range of targetable sites. Here, we report the 1.7 A resolution crystal structures of Cas9 from Francisella novicida (FnCas9), one of the largest Cas9 orthologs, in complex with a guide RNA and its PAM-containing DNA targets. A structural comparison of FnCas9 with other Cas9 orthologs revealed striking conserved and divergent features among distantly related CRISPR-Cas9 systems. We found that FnCas9 recognizes the 5'-NGG-3' PAM, and used the structural information to create a variant that can recognize the more relaxed 5'-YG-3' PAM. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the FnCas9-ribonucleoprotein complex can be microinjected into mouse zygotes to edit endogenous sites with the 5'-YG-3' PAM, thus expanding the target space of the CRISPR-Cas9 toolbox.",1
Graded Control of Microtubule Severing by Tubulin Glutamylation.,"Microtubule-severing enzymes are critical for the biogenesis and maintenance of complex microtubule arrays in axons, spindles, and cilia where tubulin detyrosination, acetylation, and glutamylation are abundant. These modifications exhibit stereotyped patterns suggesting spatial and temporal control of microtubule functions. Using human-engineered and differentially modified microtubules we find that glutamylation is the main regulator of the hereditary spastic paraplegia microtubule severing enzyme spastin. Glutamylation acts as a rheostat and tunes microtubule severing as a function of glutamate number added per tubulin. Unexpectedly, glutamylation is a non-linear biphasic tuner and becomes inhibitory beyond a threshold. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of localized glutamylation propagates across neighboring microtubules, modulating severing in trans. Our work provides the first quantitative evidence for a graded response to a tubulin posttranslational modification and a biochemical link between tubulin glutamylation and complex architectures of microtubule arrays such as those in neurons where spastin deficiency causes disease.",1
Complex Interdependence Regulates Heterotypic Transcription Factor Distribution and Coordinates Cardiogenesis.,"Transcription factors (TFs) are thought to function with partners to achieve specificity and precise quantitative outputs. In the developing heart, heterotypic TF interactions, such as between the T-box TF TBX5 and the homeodomain TF NKX2-5, have been proposed as a mechanism for human congenital heart defects. We report extensive and complex interdependent genomic occupancy of TBX5, NKX2-5, and the zinc finger TF GATA4 coordinately controlling cardiac gene expression, differentiation, and morphogenesis. Interdependent binding serves not only to co-regulate gene expression but also to prevent TFs from distributing to ectopic loci and activate lineage-inappropriate genes. We define preferential motif arrangements for TBX5 and NKX2-5 cooperative binding sites, supported at the atomic level by their co-crystal structure bound to DNA, revealing a direct interaction between the two factors and induced DNA bending. Complex interdependent binding mechanisms reveal tightly regulated TF genomic distribution and define a combinatorial logic for heterotypic TF regulation of differentiation.",1

Widespread Expansion of Protein Interaction Capabilities by Alternative Splicing.,"While alternative splicing is known to diversify the functional characteristics of some genes, the extent to which protein isoforms globally contribute to functional complexity on a proteomic scale remains unknown. To address this systematically, we cloned full-length open reading frames of alternatively spliced transcripts for a large number of human genes and used protein-protein interaction profiling to functionally compare hundreds of protein isoform pairs. The majority of isoform pairs share less than 50% of their interactions. In the global context of interactome network maps, alternative isoforms tend to behave like distinct proteins rather than minor variants of each other. Interaction partners specific to alternative isoforms tend to be expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner and belong to distinct functional modules. Our strategy, applicable to other functional characteristics, reveals a widespread expansion of protein interaction capabilities through alternative splicing and suggests that many alternative ""isoforms"" are functionally divergent (i.e., ""functional alloforms"").",1
Multiplexed Intact-Tissue Transcriptional Analysis at Cellular Resolution.,"In recently developed approaches for high-resolution imaging within intact tissue, molecular characterization over large volumes has been largely restricted to labeling of proteins. But volumetric nucleic acid labeling may represent a far greater scientific and clinical opportunity, enabling detection of not only diverse coding RNA variants but also non-coding RNAs. Moreover, scaling immunohistochemical detection to large tissue volumes has limitations due to high cost, limited renewability/availability, and restricted multiplexing capability of antibody labels. With the goal of versatile, high-content, and scalable molecular phenotyping of intact tissues, we developed a method using carbodiimide-based chemistry to stably retain RNAs in clarified tissue, coupled with amplification tools for multiplexed detection. The resulting technology enables robust measurement of activity-dependent transcriptional signatures, cell-identity markers, and diverse non-coding RNAs in rodent and human tissue volumes. The growing set of validated probes is deposited in an online resource for nucleating related developments from across the scientific community.",1
Redefining the Translational Status of 80S Monosomes.,"Fully assembled ribosomes exist in two populations: polysomes and monosomes. While the former has been studied extensively, to what extent translation occurs on monosomes and its importance for overall translational output remain controversial. Here, we used ribosome profiling to examine the translational status of 80S monosomes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that the vast majority of 80S monosomes are elongating, not initiating. Further, most mRNAs exhibit some degree of monosome occupancy, with monosomes predominating on nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) targets, upstream open reading frames (uORFs), canonical ORFs shorter than approximately 590 nt, and ORFs for which the total time required to complete elongation is substantially shorter than that required for initiation. Importantly, mRNAs encoding low-abundance regulatory proteins tend to be enriched in the monosome fraction. Our data highlight the importance of monosomes for the translation of highly regulated mRNAs.",1
Cryo-EM Structures of the Magnesium Channel CorA Reveal Symmetry Break upon Gating.,"CorA, the major Mg(2+) uptake system in prokaryotes, is gated by intracellular Mg(2+) (KD approximately 1-2 mM). X-ray crystallographic studies of CorA show similar conformations under Mg(2+)-bound and Mg(2+)-free conditions, but EPR spectroscopic studies reveal large Mg(2+)-driven quaternary conformational changes. Here, we determined cryo-EM structures of CorA in the Mg(2+)-bound closed conformation and in two open Mg(2+)-free states at resolutions of 3.8, 7.1, and 7.1 A, respectively. In the absence of bound Mg(2+), four of the five subunits are displaced to variable extents ( approximately 10-25 A) by hinge-like motions as large as approximately 35 degrees at the stalk helix. The transition between a single 5-fold symmetric closed state and an ensemble of low Mg(2+), open, asymmetric conformational states is, thus, the key structural signature of CorA gating. This mechanism is likely to apply to other structurally similar divalent ion channels.",1
Shelterin Protects Chromosome Ends by Compacting Telomeric Chromatin.,"Telomeres, repetitive DNA sequences at chromosome ends, are shielded against the DNA damage response (DDR) by the shelterin complex. To understand how shelterin protects telomere ends, we investigated the structural organization of telomeric chromatin in human cells using super-resolution microscopy. We found that telomeres form compact globular structures through a complex network of interactions between shelterin subunits and telomeric DNA, but not by DNA methylation, histone deacetylation, or histone trimethylation at telomeres and subtelomeric regions. Mutations that abrogate shelterin assembly or removal of individual subunits from telomeres cause up to a 10-fold increase in telomere volume. Decompacted telomeres accumulate DDR signals and become more accessible to telomere-associated proteins. Recompaction of telomeric chromatin using an orthogonal method displaces DDR signals from telomeres. These results reveal the chromatin remodeling activity of shelterin and demonstrate that shelterin-mediated compaction of telomeric chromatin provides robust protection of chromosome ends against the DDR machinery.",1
Myc Depletion Induces a Pluripotent Dormant State Mimicking Diapause.,"Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are maintained in a naive ground state of pluripotency in the presence of MEK and GSK3 inhibitors. Here, we show that ground-state ESCs express low Myc levels. Deletion of both c-myc and N-myc (dKO) or pharmacological inhibition of Myc activity strongly decreases transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis, leading to proliferation arrest. This process is reversible and occurs without affecting pluripotency, suggesting that Myc-depleted stem cells enter a state of dormancy similar to embryonic diapause. Indeed, c-Myc is depleted in diapaused blastocysts, and the differential expression signatures of dKO ESCs and diapaused epiblasts are remarkably similar. Following Myc inhibition, pre-implantation blastocysts enter biosynthetic dormancy but can progress through their normal developmental program after transfer into pseudo-pregnant recipients. Our study shows that Myc controls the biosynthetic machinery of stem cells without affecting their potency, thus regulating their entry and exit from the dormant state.",1
Self-Organization of Embryonic Genetic Oscillators into Spatiotemporal Wave Patterns.,"In vertebrate embryos, somites, the precursor of vertebrae, form from the presomitic mesoderm (PSM), which is composed of cells displaying signaling oscillations. Cellular oscillatory activity leads to periodic wave patterns in the PSM. Here, we address the origin of such complex wave patterns. We employed an in vitro randomization and real-time imaging strategy to probe for the ability of cells to generate order from disorder. We found that, after randomization, PSM cells self-organized into several miniature emergent PSM structures (ePSM). Our results show an ordered macroscopic spatial arrangement of ePSM with evidence of an intrinsic length scale. Furthermore, cells actively synchronize oscillations in a Notch-signaling-dependent manner, re-establishing wave-like patterns of gene activity. We demonstrate that PSM cells self-organize by tuning oscillation dynamics in response to surrounding cells, leading to collective synchronization with an average frequency. These findings reveal emergent properties within an ensemble of coupled genetic oscillators.",1
Long Neural Genes Harbor Recurrent DNA Break Clusters in Neural Stem/Progenitor Cells.,"Repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by non-homologous end joining is critical for neural development, and brain cells frequently contain somatic genomic variations that might involve DSB intermediates. We now use an unbiased, high-throughput approach to identify genomic regions harboring recurrent DSBs in primary neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs). We identify 27 recurrent DSB clusters (RDCs), and remarkably, all occur within gene bodies. Most of these NSPC RDCs were detected only upon mild, aphidicolin-induced replication stress, providing a nucleotide-resolution view of replication-associated genomic fragile sites. The vast majority of RDCs occur in long, transcribed, and late-replicating genes. Moreover, almost 90% of identified RDC-containing genes are involved in synapse function and/or neural cell adhesion, with a substantial fraction also implicated in tumor suppression and/or mental disorders. Our characterization of NSPC RDCs reveals a basis of gene fragility and suggests potential impacts of DNA breaks on neurodevelopment and neural functions.",1
Distinct Circuits for the Formation and Retrieval of an Imprinted Olfactory Memory.,"Memories formed early in life are particularly stable and influential, representing privileged experiences that shape enduring behaviors. We show that exposing newly hatched C. elegans to pathogenic bacteria results in persistent aversion to those bacterial odors, whereas adult exposure generates only transient aversive memory. Long-lasting imprinted aversion has a critical period in the first larval stage and is specific to the experienced pathogen. Distinct groups of neurons are required during formation (AIB, RIM) and retrieval (AIY, RIA) of the imprinted memory. RIM synthesizes the neuromodulator tyramine, which is required in the L1 stage for learning. AIY memory retrieval neurons sense tyramine via the SER-2 receptor, which is essential for imprinted, but not for adult-learned, aversion. Odor responses in several neurons, most notably RIA, are altered in imprinted animals. These findings provide insight into neuronal substrates of different forms of memory, and lay a foundation for further understanding of early learning.",1
Dorsal Raphe Dopamine Neurons Represent the Experience of Social Isolation.,"The motivation to seek social contact may arise from either positive or negative emotional states, as social interaction can be rewarding and social isolation can be aversive. While ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons may mediate social reward, a cellular substrate for the negative affective state of loneliness has remained elusive. Here, we identify a functional role for DA neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), in which we observe synaptic changes following acute social isolation. DRN DA neurons show increased activity upon social contact following isolation, revealed by in vivo calcium imaging. Optogenetic activation of DRN DA neurons increases social preference but causes place avoidance. Furthermore, these neurons are necessary for promoting rebound sociability following an acute period of isolation. Finally, the degree to which these neurons modulate behavior is predicted by social rank, together supporting a role for DRN dopamine neurons in mediating a loneliness-like state. PAPERCLIP.",1
The Cellular Phase of Alzheimer's Disease.,"The amyloid hypothesis for Alzheimer's disease (AD) posits a neuron-centric, linear cascade initiated by Abeta and leading to dementia. This direct causality is incompatible with clinical observations. We review evidence supporting a long, complex cellular phase consisting of feedback and feedforward responses of astrocytes, microglia, and vasculature. The field must incorporate this holistic view and take advantage of advances in single-cell approaches to resolve the critical junctures at which perturbations initially amenable to compensatory feedback transform into irreversible, progressive neurodegeneration.",1
A New Way to Diversify Antibodies by DNA Transposition.,"While searching for new therapeutics against malaria, Lanzavecchia and colleagues discovered that antibodies can be diversified by DNA sequences encoded outside of antibody genes.",1
A Receptor for All Occasions.,"Cells communicate with their environment, in part, through cell surface receptors. Engineering receptors that both sense arbitrary inputs and provide outputs orthogonal to endogenous signaling pathways has been a challenge. Now, Lim and colleagues report a system based on synthetic Notch receptors that allows independent control of both inputs and outputs in diverse cell types.",1
"Let It Go and Open Up, an Ensemble of Ion Channel Active States.","Ligand binding usually moves the target protein from an ensemble of inactive states to a well-defined active conformation. Matthies et al. flip this scheme around, finding that, for the magnesium channel CorA, loss of ligand binding induces an ensemble of conformations that turn the channel on.",1
Pluripotency without Proliferation.,"Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) are capable of unlimited proliferation without losing pluripotency. Scognamiglio et al. now reveal that Myc depletion shifts mESCs into a dormant state reminiscent of embryonic diapause in which pluripotency remains fully preserved, thus decoupling pluripotency from proliferative programs.",1
A Mechanism for Somatic Brain Mosaicism.,"Double-strand break repair is required for neural development, and brain cells contain somatic genomic variations. Now, Wei et al. demonstrate that neural stem and progenitor cells undergo very frequent DNA breaks in a very restricted set of genes involved in neural cell adhesion and synapse function.",1
Degradation of Phage Transcripts by CRISPR-Associated RNases Enables Type III CRISPR-Cas Immunity.,"Type III-A CRISPR-Cas systems defend prokaryotes against viral infection using CRISPR RNA (crRNA)-guided nucleases that perform co-transcriptional cleavage of the viral target DNA and its transcripts. Whereas DNA cleavage is essential for immunity, the function of RNA targeting is unknown. Here, we show that transcription-dependent targeting results in a sharp increase of viral genomes in the host cell when the target is located in a late-expressed phage gene. In this targeting condition, mutations in the active sites of the type III-A RNases Csm3 and Csm6 lead to the accumulation of the target phage mRNA and abrogate immunity. Csm6 is also required to provide defense in the presence of mutated phage targets, when DNA cleavage efficiency is reduced. Our results show that the degradation of phage transcripts by CRISPR-associated RNases ensures robust immunity in situations that lead to a slow clearance of the target DNA.",1
Metabolic Heterogeneity in Human Lung Tumors.,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is heterogeneous in the genetic and environmental parameters that influence cell metabolism in culture. Here, we assessed the impact of these factors on human NSCLC metabolism in vivo using intraoperative (13)C-glucose infusions in nine NSCLC patients to compare metabolism between tumors and benign lung. While enhanced glycolysis and glucose oxidation were common among these tumors, we observed evidence for oxidation of multiple nutrients in each of them, including lactate as a potential carbon source. Moreover, metabolically heterogeneous regions were identified within and between tumors, and surprisingly, our data suggested potential contributions of non-glucose nutrients in well-perfused tumor areas. Our findings not only demonstrate the heterogeneity in tumor metabolism in vivo but also highlight the strong influence of the microenvironment on this feature.",1
Dynein Clusters into Lipid Microdomains on Phagosomes to Drive Rapid Transport toward Lysosomes.,"Diverse cellular processes are driven by motor proteins that are recruited to and generate force on lipid membranes. Surprisingly little is known about how membranes control the force from motors and how this may impact specific cellular functions. Here, we show that dynein motors physically cluster into microdomains on the membrane of a phagosome as it matures inside cells. Such geometrical reorganization allows many dyneins within a cluster to generate cooperative force on a single microtubule. This results in rapid directed transport of the phagosome toward microtubule minus ends, likely promoting phagolysosome fusion and pathogen degradation. We show that lipophosphoglycan, the major molecule implicated in immune evasion of Leishmania donovani, inhibits phagosome motion by disrupting the clustering and therefore the cooperative force generation of dynein. These findings appear relevant to several pathogens that prevent phagosome-lysosome fusion by targeting lipid microdomains on phagosomes.",1
Precision Tumor Recognition by T Cells With Combinatorial Antigen-Sensing Circuits.,"T cells can be re-directed to kill cancer cells using chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) or T cell receptors (TCRs). This approach, however, is constrained by the rarity of tumor-specific single antigens. Targeting antigens also found on bystander tissues can cause life-threatening adverse effects. A powerful way to enhance ON-target activity of therapeutic T cells is to engineer them to require combinatorial antigens. Here, we engineer a combinatorially activated T cell circuit in which a synthetic Notch receptor for one antigen induces the expression of a CAR for a second antigen. These dual-receptor AND-gate T cells are only armed and activated in the presence of dual antigen tumor cells. These T cells show precise therapeutic discrimination in vivo-sparing single antigen ""bystander"" tumors while efficiently clearing combinatorial antigen ""disease"" tumors. This type of precision dual-receptor circuit opens the door to immune recognition of a wider range of tumors. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",1
Engineering Customized Cell Sensing and Response Behaviors Using Synthetic Notch Receptors.,"The Notch protein is one of the most mechanistically direct transmembrane receptors-the intracellular domain contains a transcriptional regulator that is released from the membrane when engagement of the cognate extracellular ligand induces intramembrane proteolysis. We find that chimeric forms of Notch, in which both the extracellular sensor module and the intracellular transcriptional module are replaced with heterologous protein domains, can serve as a general platform for generating novel cell-cell contact signaling pathways. Synthetic Notch (synNotch) pathways can drive user-defined functional responses in diverse mammalian cell types. Because individual synNotch pathways do not share common signaling intermediates, the pathways are functionally orthogonal. Thus, multiple synNotch receptors can be used in the same cell to achieve combinatorial integration of environmental cues, including Boolean response programs, multi-cellular signaling cascades, and self-organized cellular patterns. SynNotch receptors provide extraordinary flexibility in engineering cells with customized sensing/response behaviors to user-specified extracellular cues.",1
Actin Dynamics Regulates Dendritic Cell-Mediated Transfer of HIV-1 to T Cells.,"Whereas human dendritic cells (DCs) are largely resistant to productive infection with HIV-1, they have a unique ability to take up the virus and transmit it efficiently to T lymphocytes through a process of trans-infection or trans-enhancement. To elucidate the molecular and cell biological mechanism for trans-enhancement, we performed an shRNA screen of several hundred genes involved in organelle and membrane trafficking in immature human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs). We identified TSPAN7 and DNM2, which control actin nucleation and stabilization, as having important and distinct roles in limiting HIV-1 endocytosis and in maintaining virus particles on dendrites, which is required for efficient transfer to T lymphocytes. Further characterization of this process may provide insights not only into the role of DCs in transmission and dissemination of HIV-1 but also more broadly into mechanisms controlling capture and internalization of pathogens.",1
Timeline: iPSCs--The First Decade.,"Research into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has expanded at a remarkable pace in the decade since Shinya Yamanaka and Kazutoshi Takahashi first reported their groundbreaking discovery in 2006. This Timeline highlights the key events in the development of this field, including basic insights into the production of iPSCs and how they have been applied to improve our understanding and treatment of human disease.",1
Parsing the Interferon Transcriptional Network and Its Disease Associations.,"Type 1 interferon (IFN) is a key mediator of organismal responses to pathogens, eliciting prototypical ""interferon signature genes"" that encode antiviral and inflammatory mediators. For a global view of IFN signatures and regulatory pathways, we performed gene expression and chromatin analyses of the IFN-induced response across a range of immunocyte lineages. These distinguished ISGs by cell-type specificity, kinetics, and sensitivity to tonic IFN and revealed underlying changes in chromatin configuration. We combined 1,398 human and mouse datasets to computationally infer ISG modules and their regulators, validated by genetic analysis in both species. Some ISGs are controlled by Stat1/2 and Irf9 and the ISRE DNA motif, but others appeared dependent on non-canonical factors. This regulatory framework helped to interpret JAK1 blockade pharmacology, different clusters being affected under tonic or IFN-stimulated conditions, and the IFN signatures previously associated with human diseases, revealing unrecognized subtleties in disease footprints, as affected by human ancestry.",1
Molecular Profiling Reveals Biologically Discrete Subsets and Pathways of Progression in Diffuse Glioma.,"Therapy development for adult diffuse glioma is hindered by incomplete knowledge of somatic glioma driving alterations and suboptimal disease classification. We defined the complete set of genes associated with 1,122 diffuse grade II-III-IV gliomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas and used molecular profiles to improve disease classification, identify molecular correlations, and provide insights into the progression from low- to high-grade disease. Whole-genome sequencing data analysis determined that ATRX but not TERT promoter mutations are associated with increased telomere length. Recent advances in glioma classification based on IDH mutation and 1p/19q co-deletion status were recapitulated through analysis of DNA methylation profiles, which identified clinically relevant molecular subsets. A subtype of IDH mutant glioma was associated with DNA demethylation and poor outcome; a group of IDH-wild-type diffuse glioma showed molecular similarity to pilocytic astrocytoma and relatively favorable survival. Understanding of cohesive disease groups may aid improved clinical outcomes.",1
Cell-Type-Specific Control of Brainstem Locomotor Circuits by Basal Ganglia.,"The basal ganglia (BG) are critical for adaptive motor control, but the circuit principles underlying their pathway-specific modulation of target regions are not well understood. Here, we dissect the mechanisms underlying BG direct and indirect pathway-mediated control of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR), a brainstem target of BG that is critical for locomotion. We optogenetically dissect the locomotor function of the three neurochemically distinct cell types within the MLR: glutamatergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic neurons. We find that the glutamatergic subpopulation encodes locomotor state and speed, is necessary and sufficient for locomotion, and is selectively innervated by BG. We further show activation and suppression, respectively, of MLR glutamatergic neurons by direct and indirect pathways, which is required for bidirectional control of locomotion by BG circuits. These findings provide a fundamental understanding of how BG can initiate or suppress a motor program through cell-type-specific regulation of neurons linked to specific actions.",1
Muscle-type Identity of Proprioceptors Specified by Spatially Restricted Signals from Limb Mesenchyme.,"The selectivity with which proprioceptive sensory neurons innervate their central and peripheral targets implies that they exhibit distinctions in muscle-type identity. The molecular correlates of proprioceptor identity and its origins remain largely unknown, however. In screens to define muscle-type proprioceptor character, we find all-or-none differences in gene expression for proprioceptors that control antagonistic muscles at a single hindlimb joint. Analysis of three of these genes, cadherin13 (cdh13), semaphorin5a (sema5a), and cartilage-acidic protein-1 (crtac1), reveals expression in proprioceptor subsets that supply muscle groups located at restricted dorsoventral and proximodistal domains of the limb. Genetically altering the dorsoventral character of the limb mesenchyme elicits a change in the profile of proprioceptor cdh13, sema5a, and crtac1 expression. These findings indicate that proprioceptors acquire aspects of their muscle-type identity in response to mesenchymal signals expressed in restricted proximodistal and dorsoventral domains of the developing limb.",1
LRRC8 Proteins Form Volume-Regulated Anion Channels that Sense Ionic Strength.,"The volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) is activated when a cell swells, and it plays a central role in maintaining cell volume in response to osmotic challenges. SWELL1 (LRRC8A) was recently identified as an essential component of VRAC. However, the identity of the pore-forming subunits of VRAC and how the channel is gated by cell swelling are unknown. Here, we show that SWELL1 and up to four other LRRC8 subunits assemble into heterogeneous complexes of approximately 800 kDa. When reconstituted into bilayers, LRRC8 complexes are sufficient to form anion channels activated by osmolality gradients. In bilayers, as well as in cells, the single-channel conductance of the complexes depends on the LRRC8 composition. Finally, low ionic strength (Gamma) in the absence of an osmotic gradient activates the complexes in bilayers. These data demonstrate that LRRC8 proteins together constitute the VRAC pore and that hypotonic stress can activate VRAC through a decrease in cytoplasmic Gamma.",1
Post-translational Control of the Temporal Dynamics of Transcription Factor Activity Regulates Neurogenesis.,"Neurogenesis is initiated by the transient expression of the highly conserved proneural proteins, bHLH transcriptional regulators. Here, we discover a conserved post-translational switch governing the duration of proneural protein activity that is required for proper neuronal development. Phosphorylation of a single Serine at the same position in Scute and Atonal proneural proteins governs the transition from active to inactive forms by regulating DNA binding. The equivalent Neurogenin2 Threonine also regulates DNA binding and proneural activity in the developing mammalian neocortex. Using genome editing in Drosophila, we show that Atonal outlives its mRNA but is inactivated by phosphorylation. Inhibiting the phosphorylation of the conserved proneural Serine causes quantitative changes in expression dynamics and target gene expression resulting in neuronal number and fate defects. Strikingly, even a subtle change from Serine to Threonine appears to shift the duration of Atonal activity in vivo, resulting in neuronal fate defects.",1
Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Regulates Glycolysis through Mobilization of Aldolase from the Actin Cytoskeleton.,"The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway regulates multiple steps in glucose metabolism and also cytoskeletal functions, such as cell movement and attachment. Here, we show that PI3K directly coordinates glycolysis with cytoskeletal dynamics in an AKT-independent manner. Growth factors or insulin stimulate the PI3K-dependent activation of Rac, leading to disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, release of filamentous actin-bound aldolase A, and an increase in aldolase activity. Consistently, PI3K inhibitors, but not AKT, SGK, or mTOR inhibitors, cause a significant decrease in glycolysis at the step catalyzed by aldolase, while activating PIK3CA mutations have the opposite effect. These results point toward a master regulatory function of PI3K that integrates an epithelial cell's metabolism and its form, shape, and function, coordinating glycolysis with the energy-intensive dynamics of actin remodeling.",1
Electron Transport Chain Remodeling by GSK3 during Oogenesis Connects Nutrient State to Reproduction.,"Reproduction is heavily influenced by nutrition and metabolic state. Many common reproductive disorders in humans are associated with diabetes and metabolic syndrome. We characterized the metabolic mechanisms that support oogenesis and found that mitochondria in mature Drosophila oocytes enter a low-activity state of respiratory quiescence by remodeling the electron transport chain (ETC). This shift in mitochondrial function leads to extensive glycogen accumulation late in oogenesis and is required for the developmental competence of the oocyte. Decreased insulin signaling initiates ETC remodeling and mitochondrial respiratory quiescence through glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). Intriguingly, we observed similar ETC remodeling and glycogen uptake in maturing Xenopus oocytes, suggesting that these processes are evolutionarily conserved aspects of oocyte development. Our studies reveal an important link between metabolism and oocyte maturation.",1
Toll Receptor-Mediated Hippo Signaling Controls Innate Immunity in Drosophila.,"The Hippo signaling pathway functions through Yorkie to control tissue growth and homeostasis. How this pathway regulates non-developmental processes remains largely unexplored. Here, we report an essential role for Hippo signaling in innate immunity whereby Yorkie directly regulates the transcription of the Drosophila IkappaB homolog, Cactus, in Toll receptor-mediated antimicrobial response. Loss of Hippo pathway tumor suppressors or activation of Yorkie in fat bodies, the Drosophila immune organ, leads to elevated cactus mRNA levels, decreased expression of antimicrobial peptides, and vulnerability to infection by Gram-positive bacteria. Furthermore, Gram-positive bacteria acutely activate Hippo-Yorkie signaling in fat bodies via the Toll-Myd88-Pelle cascade through Pelle-mediated phosphorylation and degradation of the Cka subunit of the Hippo-inhibitory STRIPAK PP2A complex. Our studies elucidate a Toll-mediated Hippo signaling pathway in antimicrobial response, highlight the importance of regulating IkappaB/Cactus transcription in innate immunity, and identify Gram-positive bacteria as extracellular stimuli of Hippo signaling under physiological settings.",1
Trim28 Haploinsufficiency Triggers Bi-stable Epigenetic Obesity.,"More than one-half billion people are obese, and despite progress in genetic research, much of the heritability of obesity remains enigmatic. Here, we identify a Trim28-dependent network capable of triggering obesity in a non-Mendelian, ""on/off"" manner. Trim28(+/D9) mutant mice exhibit a bi-modal body-weight distribution, with isogenic animals randomly emerging as either normal or obese and few intermediates. We find that the obese-""on"" state is characterized by reduced expression of an imprinted gene network including Nnat, Peg3, Cdkn1c, and Plagl1 and that independent targeting of these alleles recapitulates the stochastic bi-stable disease phenotype. Adipose tissue transcriptome analyses in children indicate that humans too cluster into distinct sub-populations, stratifying according to Trim28 expression, transcriptome organization, and obesity-associated imprinted gene dysregulation. These data provide evidence of discrete polyphenism in mouse and man and thus carry important implications for complex trait genetics, evolution, and medicine.",1
Alpha and Beta Type 1 Interferon Signaling: Passage for Diverse Biologic Outcomes.,"Type I interferon (IFN-I) elicits a complex cascade of events in response to microbial infection. Here, we review recent developments illuminating the large number of IFN-I species and describing their unique biologic functions.",1
The Importance of Timing.,"Building a nervous system requires a precise sequence of genetic transitions, mediated in part by the temporal and spatial regulation of transcription factors. Quan et al. add to our understanding of this regulation by describing an evolutionarily conserved post-translational mechanism that rapidly extinguishes proneural protein activity in neural precursors.",1
Flexible Ion Barrier.,"The central vasculature of plant roots is protected by a hydrophobic ring of endodermal cells that are enclosed by lamellae of suberin. Barberon et al. demonstrate that endodermal suberization plasticity facilitates ion homeostasis, with antithetical regulation of suberin deposition and degradation by the phytohormones abscisic acid and ethylene.",1
Reflexes in Immunity.,"Simple reflex circuits provide crucial infrastructure for the neurological control of organ systems--even the immune system. Now, Gabanyi et al. reveal a reflex mechanism in gut activated by the presence of pathogens that forces macrophages into a tissue protective phenotype.",1
Epigenetic ON/OFF Switches for Obesity.,Heritable epigenetic mechanisms might contribute to the worldwide increase in the prevalence of obesity. Dalgaard et al. identify an epigenetic molecular switch that controls body weight control. The discovery suggests the existence of mammalian polyphenism in energy metabolism and might have implications for strategies to limit the obesity epidemic.,1
Are We Really Vastly Outnumbered? Revisiting the Ratio of Bacterial to Host Cells in Humans.,"It is often presented as common knowledge that, in the human body, bacteria outnumber human cells by a ratio of at least 10:1. Revisiting the question, we find that the ratio is much closer to 1:1.",1
Cancer Immunosurveillance by Tissue-Resident Innate Lymphoid Cells and Innate-like T Cells.,"Malignancy can be suppressed by the immune system in a process termed immunosurveillance. However, to what extent immunosurveillance occurs in spontaneous cancers and the composition of participating cell types remains obscure. Here, we show that cell transformation triggers a tissue-resident lymphocyte response in oncogene-induced murine cancer models. Non-circulating cytotoxic lymphocytes, derived from innate, T cell receptor (TCR)alphabeta, and TCRgammadelta lineages, expand in early tumors. Characterized by high expression of NK1.1, CD49a, and CD103, these cells share a gene-expression signature distinct from those of conventional NK cells, T cells, and invariant NKT cells. Generation of these lymphocytes is dependent on the cytokine IL-15, but not the transcription factor Nfil3 that is required for the differentiation of tumor-infiltrating NK cells, and IL-15 deficiency, but not Nfil3 deficiency, results in accelerated tumor growth. These findings reveal a tumor-elicited immunosurveillance mechanism that engages unconventional type-1-like innate lymphoid cells and type 1 innate-like T cells.",1
Mutational Strand Asymmetries in Cancer Genomes Reveal Mechanisms of DNA Damage and Repair.,"Mutational processes constantly shape the somatic genome, leading to immunity, aging, cancer, and other diseases. When cancer is the outcome, we are afforded a glimpse into these processes by the clonal expansion of the malignant cell. Here, we characterize a less explored layer of the mutational landscape of cancer: mutational asymmetries between the two DNA strands. Analyzing whole-genome sequences of 590 tumors from 14 different cancer types, we reveal widespread asymmetries across mutagenic processes, with transcriptional (""T-class"") asymmetry dominating UV-, smoking-, and liver-cancer-associated mutations and replicative (""R-class"") asymmetry dominating POLE-, APOBEC-, and MSI-associated mutations. We report a striking phenomenon of transcription-coupled damage (TCD) on the non-transcribed DNA strand and provide evidence that APOBEC mutagenesis occurs on the lagging-strand template during DNA replication. As more genomes are sequenced, studying and classifying their asymmetries will illuminate the underlying biological mechanisms of DNA damage and repair.",1
Cross-Reactive and Potent Neutralizing Antibody Responses in Human Survivors of Natural Ebolavirus Infection.,"Recent studies have suggested that antibody-mediated protection against the Ebolaviruses may be achievable, but little is known about whether or not antibodies can confer cross-reactive protection against viruses belonging to diverse Ebolavirus species, such as Ebola virus (EBOV), Sudan virus (SUDV), and Bundibugyo virus (BDBV). We isolated a large panel of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against BDBV glycoprotein (GP) using peripheral blood B cells from survivors of the 2007 BDBV outbreak in Uganda. We determined that a large proportion of mAbs with potent neutralizing activity against BDBV bind to the glycan cap and recognize diverse epitopes within this major antigenic site. We identified several glycan cap-specific mAbs that neutralized multiple ebolaviruses, including SUDV, and a cross-reactive mAb that completely protected guinea pigs from the lethal challenge with heterologous EBOV. Our results provide a roadmap to develop a single antibody-based treatment effective against multiple Ebolavirus infections.",1
De Novo Evolutionary Emergence of a Symmetrical Protein Is Shaped by Folding Constraints.,"Molecular evolution has focused on the divergence of molecular functions, yet we know little about how structurally distinct protein folds emerge de novo. We characterized the evolutionary trajectories and selection forces underlying emergence of beta-propeller proteins, a globular and symmetric fold group with diverse functions. The identification of short propeller-like motifs (<50 amino acids) in natural genomes indicated that they expanded via tandem duplications to form extant propellers. We phylogenetically reconstructed 47-residue ancestral motifs that form five-bladed lectin propellers via oligomeric assembly. We demonstrate a functional trajectory of tandem duplications of these motifs leading to monomeric lectins. Foldability, i.e., higher efficiency of folding, was the main parameter leading to improved functionality along the entire evolutionary trajectory. However, folding constraints changed along the trajectory: initially, conflicts between monomer folding and oligomer assembly dominated, whereas subsequently, upon tandem duplication, tradeoffs between monomer stability and foldability took precedence.",1
ATPase-Modulated Stress Granules Contain a Diverse Proteome and Substructure.,"Stress granules are mRNA-protein granules that form when translation initiation is limited, and they are related to pathological granules in various neurodegenerative diseases. Super-resolution microscopy reveals stable substructures, referred to as cores, within stress granules that can be purified. Proteomic analysis of stress granule cores reveals a dense network of protein-protein interactions and links between stress granules and human diseases and identifies ATP-dependent helicases and protein remodelers as conserved stress granule components. ATP is required for stress granule assembly and dynamics. Moreover, multiple ATP-driven machines affect stress granules differently, with the CCT complex inhibiting stress granule assembly, while the MCM and RVB complexes promote stress granule persistence. Our observations suggest that stress granules contain a stable core structure surrounded by a dynamic shell with assembly, disassembly, and transitions between the core and shell modulated by numerous protein and RNA remodeling complexes.",1
Neuro-immune Interactions Drive Tissue Programming in Intestinal Macrophages.,"Proper adaptation to environmental perturbations is essential for tissue homeostasis. In the intestine, diverse environmental cues can be sensed by immune cells, which must balance resistance to microorganisms with tolerance, avoiding excess tissue damage. By applying imaging and transcriptional profiling tools, we interrogated how distinct microenvironments in the gut regulate resident macrophages. We discovered that macrophages exhibit a high degree of gene-expression specialization dependent on their proximity to the gut lumen. Lamina propria macrophages (LpMs) preferentially expressed a pro-inflammatory phenotype when compared to muscularis macrophages (MMs), which displayed a tissue-protective phenotype. Upon luminal bacterial infection, MMs further enhanced tissue-protective programs, and this was attributed to swift activation of extrinsic sympathetic neurons innervating the gut muscularis and norepinephrine signaling to beta2 adrenergic receptors on MMs. Our results reveal unique intra-tissue macrophage specialization and identify neuro-immune communication between enteric neurons and macrophages that induces rapid tissue-protective responses to distal perturbations.",1
Adaptation of Root Function by Nutrient-Induced Plasticity of Endodermal Differentiation.,"Plant roots forage the soil for minerals whose concentrations can be orders of magnitude away from those required for plant cell function. Selective uptake in multicellular organisms critically requires epithelia with extracellular diffusion barriers. In plants, such a barrier is provided by the endodermis and its Casparian strips--cell wall impregnations analogous to animal tight and adherens junctions. Interestingly, the endodermis undergoes secondary differentiation, becoming coated with hydrophobic suberin, presumably switching from an actively absorbing to a protective epithelium. Here, we show that suberization responds to a wide range of nutrient stresses, mediated by the stress hormones abscisic acid and ethylene. We reveal a striking ability of the root to not only regulate synthesis of suberin, but also selectively degrade it in response to ethylene. Finally, we demonstrate that changes in suberization constitute physiologically relevant, adaptive responses, pointing to a pivotal role of the endodermal membrane in nutrient homeostasis.",1
Evolving New Skeletal Traits by cis-Regulatory Changes in Bone Morphogenetic Proteins.,"Changes in bone size and shape are defining features of many vertebrates. Here we use genetic crosses and comparative genomics to identify specific regulatory DNA alterations controlling skeletal evolution. Armor bone-size differences in sticklebacks map to a major effect locus overlapping BMP family member GDF6. Freshwater fish express more GDF6 due in part to a transposon insertion, and transgenic overexpression of GDF6 phenocopies evolutionary changes in armor-plate size. The human GDF6 locus also has undergone distinctive regulatory evolution, including complete loss of an enhancer that is otherwise highly conserved between chimps and other mammals. Functional tests show that the ancestral enhancer drives expression in hindlimbs but not forelimbs, in locations that have been specifically modified during the human transition to bipedalism. Both gain and loss of regulatory elements can localize BMP changes to specific anatomical locations, providing a flexible regulatory basis for evolving species-specific changes in skeletal form.",1
Regulation of T Cell Receptor Signaling by DENND1B in TH2 Cells and Allergic Disease.,"The DENN domain is an evolutionary conserved protein module found in all eukaryotes and serves as an exchange factor for Rab-GTPases to regulate diverse cellular functions. Variants in DENND1B are associated with development of childhood asthma and other immune disorders. To understand how DENND1B may contribute to human disease, Dennd1b(-/-) mice were generated and exhibit hyper-allergic responses following antigen challenge. Dennd1b(-/-) TH2, but not other TH cells, exhibit delayed receptor-induced T cell receptor (TCR) downmodulation, enhanced TCR signaling, and increased production of effector cytokines. As DENND1B interacts with AP-2 and Rab35, TH2 cells deficient in AP-2 or Rab35 also exhibit enhanced TCR-mediated effector functions. Moreover, human TH2 cells carrying asthma-associated DENND1B variants express less DENND1B and phenocopy Dennd1b(-/-) TH2 cells. These results provide a molecular basis for how DENND1B, a previously unrecognized regulator of TCR downmodulation in TH2 cells, contributes to asthma pathogenesis and how DENN-domain-containing proteins may contribute to other human disorders.",1

A Proteome-wide Fission Yeast Interactome Reveals Network Evolution Principles from Yeasts to Human.,"Here, we present FissionNet, a proteome-wide binary protein interactome for S. pombe, comprising 2,278 high-quality interactions, of which approximately 50% were previously not reported in any species. FissionNet unravels previously unreported interactions implicated in processes such as gene silencing and pre-mRNA splicing. We developed a rigorous network comparison framework that accounts for assay sensitivity and specificity, revealing extensive species-specific network rewiring between fission yeast, budding yeast, and human. Surprisingly, although genes are better conserved between the yeasts, S. pombe interactions are significantly better conserved in human than in S. cerevisiae. Our framework also reveals that different modes of gene duplication influence the extent to which paralogous proteins are functionally repurposed. Finally, cross-species interactome mapping demonstrates that coevolution of interacting proteins is remarkably prevalent, a result with important implications for studying human disease in model organisms. Overall, FissionNet is a valuable resource for understanding protein functions and their evolution.",1
"Functional Genomic Landscape of Human Breast Cancer Drivers, Vulnerabilities, and Resistance.","Large-scale genomic studies have identified multiple somatic aberrations in breast cancer, including copy number alterations and point mutations. Still, identifying causal variants and emergent vulnerabilities that arise as a consequence of genetic alterations remain major challenges. We performed whole-genome small hairpin RNA (shRNA) ""dropout screens"" on 77 breast cancer cell lines. Using a hierarchical linear regression algorithm to score our screen results and integrate them with accompanying detailed genetic and proteomic information, we identify vulnerabilities in breast cancer, including candidate ""drivers,"" and reveal general functional genomic properties of cancer cells. Comparisons of gene essentiality with drug sensitivity data suggest potential resistance mechanisms, effects of existing anti-cancer drugs, and opportunities for combination therapy. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of this large dataset by identifying BRD4 as a potential target in luminal breast cancer and PIK3CA mutations as a resistance determinant for BET-inhibitors.",1
Generation and Application of Mouse-Rat Allodiploid Embryonic Stem Cells.,"Mammalian interspecific hybrids provide unique advantages for mechanistic studies of speciation, gene expression regulation, and X chromosome inactivation (XCI) but are constrained by their limited natural resources. Previous artificially generated mammalian interspecific hybrid cells are usually tetraploids with unstable genomes and limited developmental abilities. Here, we report the generation of mouse-rat allodiploid embryonic stem cells (AdESCs) by fusing haploid ESCs of the two species. The AdESCs have a stable allodiploid genome and are capable of differentiating into all three germ layers and early-stage germ cells. Both the mouse and rat alleles have comparable contributions to the expression of most genes. We have proven AdESCs as a powerful tool to study the mechanisms regulating X chromosome inactivation and to identify X inactivation-escaping genes, as well as to efficiently identify genes regulating phenotypic differences between species. A similar method could be used to create hybrid AdESCs of other distantly related species.",1
Ebola Viral Glycoprotein Bound to Its Endosomal Receptor Niemann-Pick C1.,"Filoviruses, including Ebola and Marburg, cause fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and primates. Understanding how these viruses enter host cells could help to develop effective therapeutics. An endosomal protein, Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), has been identified as a necessary entry receptor for this process, and priming of the viral glycoprotein (GP) to a fusion-competent state is a prerequisite for NPC1 binding. Here, we have determined the crystal structure of the primed GP (GPcl) of Ebola virus bound to domain C of NPC1 (NPC1-C) at a resolution of 2.3 A. NPC1-C utilizes two protruding loops to engage a hydrophobic cavity on head of GPcl. Upon enzymatic cleavage and NPC1-C binding, conformational change in the GPcl further affects the state of the internal fusion loop, triggering membrane fusion. Our data therefore provide structural insights into filovirus entry in the late endosome and the molecular basis for design of therapeutic inhibitors of viral entry.",1
Extracellular Vesicles from Trypanosoma brucei Mediate Virulence Factor Transfer and Cause Host Anemia.,"Intercellular communication between parasites and with host cells provides mechanisms for parasite development, immune evasion, and disease pathology. Bloodstream African trypanosomes produce membranous nanotubes that originate from the flagellar membrane and disassociate into free extracellular vesicles (EVs). Trypanosome EVs contain several flagellar proteins that contribute to virulence, and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense EVs contain the serum resistance-associated protein (SRA) necessary for human infectivity. T. b. rhodesiense EVs transfer SRA to non-human infectious trypanosomes, allowing evasion of human innate immunity. Trypanosome EVs can also fuse with mammalian erythrocytes, resulting in rapid erythrocyte clearance and anemia. These data indicate that trypanosome EVs are organelles mediating non-hereditary virulence factor transfer and causing host erythrocyte remodeling, inducing anemia.",1
Restoration of Visual Function by Enhancing Conduction in Regenerated Axons.,"Although a number of repair strategies have been shown to promote axon outgrowth following neuronal injury in the mammalian CNS, it remains unclear whether regenerated axons establish functional synapses and support behavior. Here, in both juvenile and adult mice, we show that either PTEN and SOCS3 co-deletion, or co-overexpression of osteopontin (OPN)/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1)/ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), induces regrowth of retinal axons and formation of functional synapses in the superior colliculus (SC) but not significant recovery of visual function. Further analyses suggest that regenerated axons fail to conduct action potentials from the eye to the SC due to lack of myelination. Consistent with this idea, administration of voltage-gated potassium channel blockers restores conduction and results in increased visual acuity. Thus, enhancing both regeneration and conduction effectively improves function after retinal axon injury.",1
Prefrontal Parvalbumin Neurons in Control of Attention.,"While signatures of attention have been extensively studied in sensory systems, the neural sources and computations responsible for top-down control of attention are largely unknown. Using chronic recordings in mice, we found that fast-spiking parvalbumin (FS-PV) interneurons in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) uniformly show increased and sustained firing during goal-driven attentional processing, correlating to the level of attention. Elevated activity of FS-PV neurons on the timescale of seconds predicted successful execution of behavior. Successful allocation of attention was characterized by strong synchronization of FS-PV neurons, increased gamma oscillations, and phase locking of pyramidal firing. Phase-locked pyramidal neurons showed gamma-phase-dependent rate modulation during successful attentional processing. Optogenetic silencing of FS-PV neurons deteriorated attentional processing, while optogenetic synchronization of FS-PV neurons at gamma frequencies had pro-cognitive effects and improved goal-directed behavior. FS-PV neurons thus act as a functional unit coordinating the activity in the local mPFC circuit during goal-driven attentional processing.",1
Astrocytes Assemble Thalamocortical Synapses by Bridging NRX1alpha and NL1 via Hevin.,"Proper establishment of synapses is critical for constructing functional circuits. Interactions between presynaptic neurexins and postsynaptic neuroligins coordinate the formation of synaptic adhesions. An isoform code determines the direct interactions of neurexins and neuroligins across the synapse. However, whether extracellular linker proteins can expand such a code is unknown. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches, we found that hevin, an astrocyte-secreted synaptogenic protein, assembles glutamatergic synapses by bridging neurexin-1alpha and neuroligin-1B, two isoforms that do not interact with each other. Bridging of neurexin-1alpha and neuroligin-1B via hevin is critical for the formation and plasticity of thalamocortical connections in the developing visual cortex. These results show that astrocytes promote the formation of synapses by modulating neurexin/neuroligin adhesions through hevin secretion. Our findings also provide an important mechanistic insight into how mutations in these genes may lead to circuit dysfunction in diseases such as autism.",1
Nitric Oxide as a Switching Mechanism between Axon Degeneration and Regrowth during Developmental Remodeling.,"During development, neurons switch among growth states, such as initial axon outgrowth, axon pruning, and regrowth. By studying the stereotypic remodeling of the Drosophila mushroom body (MB), we found that the heme-binding nuclear receptor E75 is dispensable for initial axon outgrowth of MB gamma neurons but is required for their developmental regrowth. Genetic experiments and pharmacological manipulations on ex-vivo-cultured brains indicate that neuronally generated nitric oxide (NO) promotes pruning but inhibits regrowth. We found that high NO levels inhibit the physical interaction between the E75 and UNF nuclear receptors, likely accounting for its repression of regrowth. Additionally, NO synthase (NOS) activity is downregulated at the onset of regrowth, at least partially, by short inhibitory NOS isoforms encoded within the NOS locus, indicating how NO production could be developmentally regulated. Taken together, these results suggest that NO signaling provides a switching mechanism between the degenerative and regenerative states of neuronal remodeling.",1
WNT-SHH Antagonism Specifies and Expands Stem Cells prior to Niche Formation.,"Adult stem cell (SC) maintenance and differentiation are known to depend on signals received from the niche. Here, however, we demonstrate a mechanism for SC specification and regulation that is niche independent. Using immunofluorescence, live imaging, genetics, cell-cycle analyses, in utero lentiviral transduction, and lineage-tracing, we show that in developing hair buds, SCs are born from asymmetric divisions that differentially display WNT and SHH signaling. Displaced WNT(lo) suprabasal daughters become SCs that respond to paracrine SHH and symmetrically expand. By contrast, basal daughters remain WNT(hi). They express but do not respond to SHH and hence maintain slow-cycling, asymmetric divisions. Over time, they become short-lived progenitors, generating differentiating daughters rather than SCs. Thus, in contrast to an established niche that harbors a fixed SC pool whose expelled progeny differentiate, asymmetric divisions first specify and displace early SCs into an environment conducive to expansion and later restrict their numbers by switching asymmetric fates.",1
Integrins Form an Expanding Diffusional Barrier that Coordinates Phagocytosis.,"Phagocytosis is initiated by lateral clustering of receptors, which in turn activates Src-family kinases (SFKs). Activation of SFKs requires depletion of tyrosine phosphatases from the area of particle engagement. We investigated how the major phosphatase CD45 is excluded from contact sites, using single-molecule tracking. The mobility of CD45 increased markedly upon engagement of Fcgamma receptors. While individual CD45 molecules moved randomly, they were displaced from the advancing phagocytic cup by an expanding diffusional barrier. By micropatterning IgG, the ligand of Fcgamma receptors, we found that the barrier extended well beyond the perimeter of the receptor-ligand engagement zone. Second messengers generated by Fcgamma receptors activated integrins, which formed an actin-tethered diffusion barrier that excluded CD45. The expanding integrin wave facilitates the zippering of Fcgamma receptors onto the target and integrates the information from sparse receptor-ligand complexes, coordinating the progression and ultimate closure of the phagocytic cup.",1
Force Feedback Controls Motor Activity and Mechanical Properties of Self-Assembling Branched Actin Networks.,"Branched actin networks--created by the Arp2/3 complex, capping protein, and a nucleation promoting factor--generate and transmit forces required for many cellular processes, but their response to force is poorly understood. To address this, we assembled branched actin networks in vitro from purified components and used simultaneous fluorescence and atomic force microscopy to quantify their molecular composition and material properties under various forces. Remarkably, mechanical loading of these self-assembling materials increases their density, power, and efficiency. Microscopically, increased density reflects increased filament number and altered geometry but no change in average length. Macroscopically, increased density enhances network stiffness and resistance to mechanical failure beyond those of isotropic actin networks. These effects endow branched actin networks with memory of their mechanical history that shapes their material properties and motor activity. This work reveals intrinsic force feedback mechanisms by which mechanical resistance makes self-assembling actin networks stiffer, stronger, and more powerful.",1
The Protease Ste24 Clears Clogged Translocons.,"Translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the first step in the biogenesis of thousands of eukaryotic endomembrane proteins. Although functional ER translocation has been avidly studied, little is known about the quality control mechanisms that resolve faulty translocational states. One such faulty state is translocon clogging, in which the substrate fails to properly translocate and obstructs the translocon pore. To shed light on the machinery required to resolve clogging, we carried out a systematic screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that highlighted a role for the ER metalloprotease Ste24. We could demonstrate that Ste24 approaches the translocon upon clogging, and it interacts with and generates cleavage fragments of the clogged protein. Importantly, these functions are conserved in the human homolog, ZMPSTE24, although disease-associated mutant forms of ZMPSTE24 fail to clear the translocon. These results shed light on a new and critical task of Ste24, which safeguards the essential process of translocation.",1
Cell-free DNA Comprises an In Vivo Nucleosome Footprint that Informs Its Tissues-Of-Origin.,"Nucleosome positioning varies between cell types. By deep sequencing cell-free DNA (cfDNA), isolated from circulating blood plasma, we generated maps of genome-wide in vivo nucleosome occupancy and found that short cfDNA fragments harbor footprints of transcription factors. The cfDNA nucleosome occupancies correlate well with the nuclear architecture, gene structure, and expression observed in cells, suggesting that they could inform the cell type of origin. Nucleosome spacing inferred from cfDNA in healthy individuals correlates most strongly with epigenetic features of lymphoid and myeloid cells, consistent with hematopoietic cell death as the normal source of cfDNA. We build on this observation to show how nucleosome footprints can be used to infer cell types contributing to cfDNA in pathological states such as cancer. Since this strategy does not rely on genetic differences to distinguish between contributing tissues, it may enable the noninvasive monitoring of a much broader set of clinical conditions than currently possible.",1
Biology and Applications of CRISPR Systems: Harnessing Nature's Toolbox for Genome Engineering.,"Bacteria and archaea possess a range of defense mechanisms to combat plasmids and viral infections. Unique among these are the CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR associated) systems, which provide adaptive immunity against foreign nucleic acids. CRISPR systems function by acquiring genetic records of invaders to facilitate robust interference upon reinfection. In this Review, we discuss recent advances in understanding the diverse mechanisms by which Cas proteins respond to foreign nucleic acids and how these systems have been harnessed for precision genome manipulation in a wide array of organisms.",1
The Heroes of CRISPR.,"Three years ago, scientists reported that CRISPR technology can enable precise and efficient genome editing in living eukaryotic cells. Since then, the method has taken the scientific community by storm, with thousands of labs using it for applications from biomedicine to agriculture. Yet, the preceding 20-year journey--the discovery of a strange microbial repeat sequence; its recognition as an adaptive immune system; its biological characterization; and its repurposing for genome engineering--remains little known. This Perspective aims to fill in this backstory--the history of ideas and the stories of pioneers--and draw lessons about the remarkable ecosystem underlying scientific discovery.",1
Shadow on the Plant: A Strategy to Exit.,"The light spectrum perceived by plants is affected by crowding, which results in the shade avoidance syndrome (SAS). Findings presented by Pedmale et al. bring cryptochromes to the forefront of SAS and elucidate a fascinating molecular crosstalk between photoreceptor systems operating in different wavebands.",1
Street View of the Cognitive Map.,"To understand the origins of spatial navigational signals, Acharya et al. record the activity of hippocampal neurons in rats running in open two-dimensional environments in both the real world and in virtual reality. They find that a subset of hippocampal neurons have directional tuning that persists in virtual reality, where vestibular cues are absent.",1
Anion Transport with Pnictogen Bonds in Direct Comparison with Chalcogen and Halogen Bonds.,"In this Communication, we introduce transmembrane anion transport with pnictogen-bonding compounds and compare their characteristics with chalcogen- and halogen-bonding analogues. Tellurium-centered chalcogen bonds are at least as active as antimony-centered pnictogen bonds, whereas iodine-centered halogen bonds are 3 orders of magnitude less active. Irregular voltage-dependent single-channel currents, high gating charges, and efficient dye leakage support for the formation of bulky, membrane-disruptive supramolecular amphiphiles due to ""too strong"" binding of anions to tris(perfluorophenyl)stibanes. In contrast, the chalcogen-bonding bis(perfluorophenyl)tellanes do not cause leakage and excel as carriers with nanomolar activity, with P(Cl/Na) = 10.4 for anion/cation selectivity and P(Cl/NO3) = 4.5 for anion selectivity. The selectivities are lower with pnictogen-bonding carriers because their membrane-disturbing 3D structure also affects weaker binders ( P(Cl/Na) = 2.1, P(Cl/NO3) = 2.5). Their 2D structure, directionality, hydrophobicity, and support from proximal anion-pi interactions are suggested to contribute to the unique power of chalcogen bonds to transport anions across lipid bilayer membranes.",2
Few-Nanometer-Sized alpha-CsPbI3 Quantum Dots Enabled by Strontium Substitution and Iodide Passivation for Efficient Red-Light Emitting Diodes.,"Cubic phase CsPbI3 quantum dots (alpha-CsPbI3 QDs) as a newly emerging type of semiconducting QDs hold tremendous promise for fundamental research and optoelectronic device applications. However, stable and sub-5 nm-sized alpha-CsPbI3 QDs have rarely been demonstrated so far due to their highly labile ionic structure and low phase stability. Here, we report a novel strontium-substitution along with iodide passivation strategy to stabilize the cubic phase of CsPbI3, achieving the facile synthesis of alpha-CsPbI3 QDs with a series of controllable sizes down to sub-5 nm. We demonstrate that the incorporation of strontium ions can significantly increase the formation energies of alpha-CsPbI3 QDs and hence reduce the structure distortion to stabilize the cubic phase at the few-nanometer size. The size ranging from 15 down to sub-5 nm of as-prepared stable alpha-CsPbI3 QDs allowed us to investigate their unique size-dependent optical properties. Strikingly, the few-nanometer-sized alpha-CsPbI3 QDs turned out to retain high photoluminescence and highly close packing in solid state thin films, and the fabricated red light emitting diodes exhibited high brightness (1250 cd m(-2) at 9.2 V) and good operational stability (L50 > 2 h driven by 6 V). The developed cation-substitution strategy will provide an alternative method to prepare uniform and finely size-controlled colloidal lead halide perovskite QDs for various optoelectronic applications.",2
Acid Responsive Hydrogen-Bonded Organic Frameworks.,"A porous hydrogen-bonded organic framework (HOF) responsive to acid was constructed from a hexaazatrinaphthylene derivative with carboxyphenyl groups (CPHATN). Precise structures of both 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene solvate [CPHATN-1(TCB)] and activated HOF with permanent porosity (CPHATN-1a) were successfully determined by single-crystalline X-ray diffraction analysis. Permanent porosity of CPHATN-1a was evaluated by gas sorption experiments at low temperature. CPHATN-1a also shows significant thermal stability up to 633 K. Its crystals exhibit a rich photochemistry thanks to intramolecular charge-transfer and interunit proton-transfer reactions. Femtosecond (fs) experiments on crystals demonstrate that these events occur in </=200 fs and 1.2 ps, respectively. Moreover, single-crystal fluorescence microscopy reveals a shift of the emission spectra most probably as a result of defects and a high anisotropic behavior, reflecting an ordered crystalline structure with a preferential orientation of the molecular dipole moments. Remarkably, CPHATN-1a, as a result of the protonation of pyradyl nitrogen atoms embedded in its pi-conjugated core, shows reversible vapor acid-induced color changes from yellow to reddish-brown, which can be also followed by an ON/OFF of its emission. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first HOF that exhibits acid-responsive color changes. The present work provides new findings for developing stimuli responsive HOFs.",2
Direct Observation of the Orientational Anisotropy of Buried Hydroxyl Groups inside Muscovite Mica.,"Muscovite mica (001) is a widely used model surface for controlling molecular assembly and a common substrate for environmental adsorption processes. The mica (001) surface displays near-trigonal symmetry, but many molecular adsorbates-including water-exhibit unequal probabilities of alignment along its three nominally equivalent lattice directions. Buried hydroxyl groups within the muscovite structure are speculated to be responsible, but direct evidence is lacking. Here, we utilize vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy (vSFG) to characterize the orientation and hydrogen-bonding environment of near-surface hydroxyls inside mica. Multiple distinct peaks are detected in the O-H stretch region, which we attribute to Si/Al substitution in the SiO4 tetrahedron and K(+) ion adsorption above the hydroxyls based on density functional theory simulations. Our findings demonstrate that vSFG can identify the absolute orientation of -OH groups and, hence, the surface termination at a mica surface, providing a means to investigate how -OH groups influence molecular adsorption and better understand mica stacking-sequences and physical behavior.",2
Directional Intermolecular Interactions for Precise Molecular Design of a High- Tc Multiaxial Molecular Ferroelectric.,"Quasi-spherical molecules have recently been developed as promising building blocks for constructing high-performance molecular ferroelectrics. However, although the modification of spherical molecules into quasi-spherical ones can efficiently lower the crystal symmetry, it is still a challenge to precisely arouse a low-symmetric polar crystal structure. Here, by introducing directional hydrogen-bonding interactions in the molecular modification, we successfully reduced the cubic centrosymmetric Pm3 m space group of [quinuclidinium]ClO4 at room temperature to the orthorhombic polar Pna21 space group of [3-oxoquinuclidinium]ClO4. Different from the substituent groups of -OH, -CH3, and horizontal lineCH2, the addition of a horizontal lineO group with H-acceptor to [quinuclidinium](+) forms directionally N-H...O horizontal lineC hydrogen-bonded chains, which plays a critical role in the generation of polar structure in [3-oxoquinuclidinium]ClO4. Systematic characterization indicates that [3-oxoquinuclidinium]ClO4 is an excellent molecular ferroelectric with a high Curie temperature of 457 K, a large saturate polarization of 6.7 muC/cm(2), and a multiaxial feature of 6 equiv ferroelectric axes. This work demonstrates that the strategy of combining quasi-spherical molecule building blocks with directional intermolecular interactions provides an efficient route to precisely design new eminent molecular ferroelectrics.",2
Translation of a Polar Biogenesis Proposal into a Radical Synthetic Approach: Synthesis of Pleurocin A/Matsutakone and Pleurocin B.,"A synthetic approach to recently reported and structurally unique 11(9-->7) abeo-steroids pleurocin A/matsutakone (1) and pleurocin B (2) was developed by reconsidering the originally suggested polar transformations of their biogenesis. An intricate radical cyclization of a late stage intermediate followed by an oxidative quench was used instead and forged the abeo-framework, while the 9,11-seco-motif was obtained by conversion of ergosterol into a 9,11-secoenol ether employing a mercury-free desaturation of the Treibs type, an oxidative bond scission preluding a dioxa-[4+2]-cycloaddition of an aldehyde to an enone and a combined transacetalization/elimination followed by an ionic hydrogenation.",2
Highly Efficient Enantioselective Synthesis of Chiral Sulfones by Rh-Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation.,"A highly efficient and enantioselective Rh-( R, R)-f-spiroPhos complex catalyzed hydrogenation of a series of unsaturated sulfones has been developed. With Rh-( R, R)-f-spiroPhos catalyst under mild conditions, not only the asymmetric hydrogenation of both the 3,3-diaryl and exocyclic alpha,beta-unsaturated sulfones was first realized with up to 99.9% ee but also 3-alkyl-3-aryl and benzo[ b]thiophene-1,1-dioxides were successfully hydrogenated to the corresponding chiral sulfones with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99.4% ee) regardless of the steric hindrance, electronic property, and geometry of the substrates. Moreover, this reaction offers a route to ( S)-(+)- ar-turmerone as a spice flavor, which is an important synthetic intermediate of pharmaceuticals.",2
Protein Hydration Waters Are Susceptible to Unfavorable Perturbations.,"The interactions of a protein, its phase behavior, and, ultimately, its ability to function are all influenced by the interactions between the protein and its hydration waters. Here, we study proteins with a variety of sizes, shapes, chemistries, and biological functions and characterize their interactions with their hydration waters using molecular simulations and enhanced sampling techniques. We find that, akin to extended hydrophobic surfaces, proteins situate their hydration waters at the edge of a dewetting transition, making them susceptible to unfavorable perturbations. We also find that the strength of the unfavorable potential needed to trigger dewetting is roughly the same for all proteins studied here and depends primarily on the width of the hydration shell being perturbed. Our findings establish a framework for systematically classifying protein patches according to how favorably they interact with water.",2
Rhodium-Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydroamination of Allyl Amines.,"A Rh-catalyzed enantioselective hydroamination of allylamines using a chiral BIPHEP-type ligand is reported. Enantioenriched 1,2-diamines are formed in good yields and with excellent enantioselectivities. A diverse array of nucleophiles and amine directing groups are demonstrated, including deprotectable motifs. Finally, the methodology was demonstrated toward the rapid synthesis of 2-methyl-moclobemide.",2
Molecular Upconversion in Water in Heteropolynuclear Supramolecular Tb/Yb Assemblies.,"Piling up excited states to reach upconversion (UC) is severely restricted by vibrational quenching mechanisms, especially when one looks at discrete molecular entities in solution. By carefully controlling the supramolecular assembly processes resulting from the strong electrostatic interactions between negatively charged Yb complexes and Tb(3+) cations in aqueous solutions, we engineered the formation of heteropolynuclear complexes of [(YbL)2Tb x] compositions ( x = 1 and 2). These edifices display a phenomenon of cooperative photosensitization UC with green emission of the Tb cations upon NIR excitation at 980 nm in the Yb absorption band. The photophysical properties of the complexes were carefully investigated by steady-state and time-resolved luminescence experiments in D2O, allowing one to quantify the impact of the composition and pD of the solution on the emission intensity as well as clarifying the exact cooperative photosensitization upconversion mechanism. Using optimized conditions, the energy transfer UC process could be observed for the first time in nondeuterated water with discrete molecular compounds.",2
Hydrogen-Bond-Assisted Symmetry Breaking in a Network of Chiral Metal-Organic Assemblies.,"Herein we elucidate the interplay of chiral, chelate, solvent, and hydrogen-bonding information in the self-assembly of a series of new three-dimensional metal-organic architectures. Enantiopure ligands, each containing H-bond donors and acceptors, form different structures, depending on the ratio in which they are combined: enantiopure components form M4L4 assemblies, whereas racemic mixtures form M3L3 stacks. Chiral amplification within M3L3 enantiomers was observed when a 2:1 ratio of R and S subcomponent enantiomers was employed. Simply switching the solvent (from MeCN to MeOH) or chelating unit (from bidentate to tridentate) increased the diversity of structures that can be generated from these building blocks, leading to the selective formation of novel M2L2 and M3L2 assemblies. The addition of achiral ligand building blocks resulted in the formation of further structures: When an achiral subcomponent was combined with its R and S chiral congeners, a three-layer heteroleptic architecture was generated, with the achiral unit sitting at the top of the stack. When combined with the S enantiomer only, however, the achiral unit assembled in the center of the structure, thus demonstrating the selective placement of achiral units within chiral systems. Further sorting experiments revealed that combining R and S stereocenters within a single ligand led to diastereoselective product generation. These results show how geometric complementarity between different ligands impacts upon the degree of hydrogen-bonding within the assembly, stabilizing specific low-symmetry architectures from among many possible structural outcomes.",2
"Effect of MnO2 Crystal Structure on Aerobic Oxidation of 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5-Furandicarboxylic Acid.","Aerobic oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) as a bioplastics monomer is efficiently promoted by a simple system based on a nonprecious-metal catalyst of MnO2 and NaHCO3. Kinetic studies indicate that the oxidation of 5-formyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (FFCA) to FDCA is the slowest step for the aerobic oxidation of HMF to FDCA over activated MnO2. We demonstrate through combined computational and experimental studies that HMF oxidation to FDCA is largely dependent on the MnO2 crystal structure. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that vacancy formation energies at the planar oxygen sites in alpha- and gamma-MnO2 are higher than those at the bent oxygen sites. beta- and lambda-MnO2 consist of only planar and bent oxygen sites, respectively, with lower vacancy formation energies. Consequently, beta- and lambda-MnO2 are likely to be good candidates as oxidation catalysts. On the other hand, experimental studies reveal that the reaction rates per surface area for the slowest step (FFCA oxidation to FDCA) decrease in the order of beta-MnO2 > lambda-MnO2 > gamma-MnO2 approximately alpha-MnO2 > delta-MnO2 > epsilon-MnO2; the catalytic activity of beta-MnO2 exceeds that of the previously reported activated MnO2 by three times. The order is in good agreement not only with the DFT calculation results, but also with the reduction rates per surface area determined by the H2-temperature-programmed reduction measurements for MnO2 catalysts. The successful synthesis of high-surface-area beta-MnO2 significantly improves the catalytic activity for the aerobic oxidation of HMF to FDCA.",2
"Mechanistic Characterization of (Xantphos)Ni(I)-Mediated Alkyl Bromide Activation: Oxidative Addition, Electron Transfer, or Halogen-Atom Abstraction.","Ni(I)-mediated single-electron oxidative activation of alkyl halides has been extensively proposed as a key step in Ni-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions to generate radical intermediates. There are four mechanisms through which this step could take place: oxidative addition, outer-sphere electron transfer, inner-sphere electron transfer, and concerted halogen-atom abstraction. Despite considerable computational studies, there is no experimental study to evaluate all four pathways for Ni(I)-mediated alkyl radical formation. Herein, we report the isolation of a series of (Xantphos)Ni(I)-Ar complexes that selectively activate alkyl halides over aryl halides to eject radicals and form Ni(II) complexes. This observation allows the application of kinetic studies on the steric, electronic, and solvent effects, in combination with DFT calculations, to systematically assess the four possible pathways. Our data reveal that (Xantphos)Ni(I)-mediated alkyl halide activation proceeds via a concerted halogen-atom abstraction mechanism. This result corroborates previous DFT studies on (terpy)Ni(I)- and (py)Ni(I)-mediated alkyl radical formation, and contrasts with the outer-sphere electron transfer pathway observed for (PPh3)4Ni(0)-mediated aryl halide activation. This study of a model system provides insight into the overall mechanism of Ni-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions and offers a basis for differentiating electrophiles in cross-electrophile coupling reactions.",2
Guest Vapor-Induced State Change of Structural Liquid Pillar[6]arene.,"State change is a key phenomenon in materials science. We report the first observation of vapor-responsive reversible structural liquid-to-solid and solid-to-structural liquid state changes. We observed that a macrocyclic compound, a pillar[6]arene derivative bearing 12 n-hexyl substituents, is a room temperature structural liquid with unique properties. Formation of a host-guest complex between the pillar[6]arene cavity and the n-hexyl substituent results in a structural liquid with nanoscale structural heterogeneities. The structural liquid solidifies when exposed to competitive cyclohexane guest vapor, whereupon cyclohexane replaces the n-hexyl substituents in the pillar[6]arene cavity and the n-hexyl substituents located outside of the cavity crystallize into distinct nanolayer assemblies. The solid reverts back to the structural liquid when the cyclohexane guest is removed through heating under reduced pressure because of rethreading of the n-hexyl substituents into the cavity. The structural liquid-to-solid and solid-to-structural liquid changes are reversible through the uptake and release of cyclohexane guest vapor.",2
Ligand-Dependent Colloidal Stability Controls the Growth of Aluminum Nanocrystals.,"The precise size- and shape-controlled synthesis of monodisperse Al nanocrystals remains an open challenge, limiting their utility for numerous applications that would take advantage of their size and shape-dependent optical properties. Here we pursue a molecular-level understanding of the formation of Al nanocrystals by titanium(IV) isopropoxide-catalyzed decomposition of AlH3 in Lewis base solvents. As determined by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy of intermediates, the reaction begins with the formation of Ti(3+)-AlH3 complexes. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy indicates isopropoxy ligands are removed from Ti by Al, producing aluminum(III) isopropoxide and low-valent Ti(3+) catalysts. These Ti(3+) species catalyze elimination of H2 from AlH3 inducing the polymerization of AlH3 into colloidally unstable low-valent aluminum hydride clusters. These clusters coalesce and grow while expelling H2 to form colloidally stable Al nanocrystals. The colloidal stability of the Al nanocrystals and their size is determined by the molecular structure and density of coordinating atoms in the reaction, which is controlled by choice of solvent composition.",2
Genome-Mined Diels-Alderase Catalyzes Formation of the cis-Octahydrodecalins of Varicidin A and B.,"Pericyclases are an emerging family of enzymes catalyzing pericyclic reactions. A class of lipocalin-like enzymes recently characterized as Diels-Alderases (DAses) catalyze decalin formation through intramolecular Diels-Alder (IMDA) reactions between electron-rich dienes and electron-deficient dienophiles. Using this class of enzyme as a beacon for genome mining, we discovered a biosynthetic gene cluster from Penicillium variabile and identified that it encodes for the biosynthesis of varicidin A (1), a new antifungal natural product containing a cis-octahydrodecalin core. Biochemical analysis reveals a carboxylative deactivation strategy used in varicidin biosynthesis to suppress the nonenzymatic IMDA reaction of an early acyclic intermediate that favors trans-decalin formation. A P450 oxidizes the reactive intermediate to yield a relatively unreactive combination of an electron-deficient diene and an electron-deficient dienophile. The DAse PvhB catalyzes the final stage IMDA on the carboxylated intermediate to form the cis-decalin that is important for the antifungal activity.",2
Polyoxometalate-Cyclodextrin Metal-Organic Frameworks: From Tunable Structure to Customized Storage Functionality.,"Self-assembly allows structures to organize themselves into regular patterns by using local forces to find the lowest-energy configuration. However, assembling organic and inorganic building blocks in an ordered framework remains challenging due to difficulties in rationally interfacing two dissimilar materials. Herein, the ensemble of polyoxometalates (POMs) and cyclodextrins (CDs) as molecular building blocks (MBBs) has yielded two unprecedented POM-CD-MOFs, namely [PW12O40](3-) and alpha-CD MOF (POT-CD) as well as [P10Pd15.5O50](19-) and gamma-CD MOF (POP-CD), with distinct properties not shared by their isolated parent MBBs. Markedly, the POT-CD features a nontraditional enhanced Li storage behavior by virtue of a unique ""amorphization and pulverization"" process. This opens the door to a new generation of hybrid materials with tuned structures and customized functionalities.",2
Flexible Polymer-Assisted Mesoscale Self-Assembly of Colloidal CsPbBr3 Perovskite Nanocrystals into Higher Order Superstructures with Strong Inter-Nanocrystal Electronic Coupling.,"Surface-passivating ligands, although ubiquitous to colloidal nanocrystal (NC) syntheses, play a role in assembling NCs into higher order structures and hierarchical superstructures, which has not been demonstrated yet for colloidal CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) NCs. In this work, we report that functional poly(ethylene glycols) (PEG6-Y, Y = -COOH and -NH2) represent unique surface-passivating ligands enabling the synthesis of near-uniform CsPbBr3 NCs with diameters of 3.0 nm. The synthesized NCs are assembled into individual pearl necklaces, bundled pearl necklaces, lamellar, and nanorice superstructures, in situ. It is believed a variety of forces, including van der Waals attractions between hydrophilic PEG tails in a nonpolar solvent and dipole-dipole attraction between NCs, drive mesoscale assembly to form superstructures. Furthermore, postsynthetic ligand treatment strengthens the argument for polymer-assisted mesoscale assembly as pearl necklace assemblies can be successfully converted into either lamellar or nanorice structures. We observe an approximately 240 meV bathochromic shift in the lowest energy absorption peak of CsPbBr3 NCs when they are present in the lamellar and nanorice assemblies, representing strong inter-NC electronic coupling. Moreover, pearl necklace structures are spontaneously assembled into micrometer length scale twisted ribbon hierarchical superstructures during storage of colloidal CsPbBr3 NCs. The results show that the self-assembled superstructures of CsPbBr3 NCs are now feasible to prepare via template-free synthesis, as self-assembled structures emerge in the bulk solvent, a process that mimics biological systems except for the use of nonbiological surface ligands (PEG6-Y). Taken together, emergent optoelectronic properties and higher order superstructures of CsPbBr3 NCs should aid their potential use in solid-state devices and simplify scalable manufacturing.",2
Amorphous-Phase-Mediated Crystallization of Ni Nanocrystals Revealed by High-Resolution Liquid-Phase Electron Microscopy.,"Nonclassical features of crystallization in solution have been recently identified both experimentally and theoretically. In particular, an amorphous-phase-mediated pathway is found in various crystallization systems as an important route, different from the classical nucleation and growth model. Here, we utilize high-resolution in situ transmission electron microscopy with graphene liquid cells to study amorphous-phase-mediated formation of Ni nanocrystals. An amorphous phase is precipitated in the initial stage of the reaction. Within the amorphous particles, crystalline domains nucleate and eventually form nanocrystals. In addition, unique crystallization behaviors, such as formation of multiple domains and dislocation relaxation, are observed in amorphous-phase-mediated crystallization. Theoretical calculations confirm that surface interactions can induce amorphous precipitation of metal precursors, which is analogous to the surface-induced amorphous-to-crystalline transformation occurring in biomineralization. Our results imply that an unexplored nonclassical growth mechanism is important for the formation of nanocrystals.",2
"Coordination-Driven Self-Assembled Metallacycles Incorporating Pyrene: Fluorescence Mutability, Tunability, and Aromatic Amine Sensing.","Constructing polycyclic aromatics-based, highly emissive fluorophores with good solubility and tunable aggregated structures and properties is of great importance for film fabrication, solution processing, and relevant functionality studies. Herein, we describe a general strategy to endow conventional organic fluorophores with enhanced solubility and modulated fluorescent properties via their incorporation into coordination-driven self-assembled metallacycles. A widely used fluorophore, pyrene, was decorated with two pyridyl groups to yield functionalized pyrene 4. Mixing 4 with three aromatic dicarboxylates with different lengths and a 90 degrees Pt(II) metal acceptor in a 2:2:4 stoichiometric ratio resulted in the formation of three metallacycles, 1, 2, and 3. The metallacycles display good solubility in polar organic solvents, highly aggregation-dependent fluorescence, and size-dependent emissions at higher concentrations. Moreover, metallacycle 2-based, silica-gel-supported film as fabricated not only is more emissive than the ligand 4-based one but also displays much improved sensing properties for amines in the vapor state, as demonstrated by significantly increased response speed and decreased recovery time. The enhanced solubility, unique fluorescence behavior, and multi-factor modulation character show that coordination-driven self-assembly can be utilized for the development of new fluorophores through simple modification of conventional fluorophores. The fluorophores synthesized this way possess not only complex topological structures but also good modularity and tunability in fluorescence behavior, which are important for grafting multi-stage energy-transfer systems necessary for the development of high-performance sensing materials.",2
Toward Long-Term Stability: Single-Crystal Alloys of Cesium-Containing Mixed Cation and Mixed Halide Perovskite.,"Perovskite solar cells are strong competitors for silicon-based ones, but suffer from poor long-term stability, for which the intrinsic stability of perovskite materials is of primary concern. Herein, we prepared a series of well-defined cesium-containing mixed cation and mixed halide perovskite single-crystal alloys, which enabled systematic investigations on their structural stabilities against light, heat, water, and oxygen. Two potential phase separation processes are evidenced for the alloys as the cesium content increases to 10% and/or bromide to 15%. Eventually, a highly stable new composition, (FAPbI3)0.9(MAPbBr3)0.05(CsPbBr3)0.05, emerges with a carrier lifetime of 16 mus. It remains stable during at least 10000 h water-oxygen and 1000 h light stability tests, which is very promising for long-term stable devices with high efficiency. The mechanism for the enhanced stability is elucidated through detailed single-crystal structure analysis. Our work provides a single-crystal-based paradigm for stability investigation, leading to the discovery of stable new perovskite materials.",2
Two-Dimensional PC6 with Direct Band Gap and Anisotropic Carrier Mobility.,"Graphene and phosphorene are two major types of atomically thin two-dimensional materials under extensive investigation. However, the zero band gap of graphene and the instability of phosphorene greatly restrict their applications. Here, we make first-principle unbiased structure search calculations to identify a new buckled graphene-like PC6 monolayer with a number of desirable functional properties. The PC6 monolayer is a direct-gap semiconductor with a band gap of 0.84 eV, and it has an extremely high intrinsic conductivity with anisotropic character (i.e., its electron mobility is 2.94 x 10(5) cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) along the armchair direction, whereas the hole mobility reaches 1.64 x 10(5) cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) along the zigzag direction), which is comparable to that of graphene. On the other hand, PC6 shows a high absorption coefficient (10(5) cm(-1)) in a broad band, from 300 to 2000 nm. Additionally, its direct band gap character can remain within a biaxial strain of 5%. All these appealing properties make the predicted PC6 monolayer a promising candidate for applications in electronic and photovoltaic devices.",2
Genetically Encoded Cholesterol-Modified Polypeptides.,"Biological systems use post-translational modifications (PTMs) to control the structure, location, and function of proteins after expression. Despite the ubiquity of PTMs in biology, their use to create genetically encoded recombinant biomaterials is limited. We have utilized a natural lipidation PTM (hedgehog-mediated cholesterol modification of proteins) to create a class of hybrid biomaterials called cholesterol-modified polypeptides (CHaMPs) that exhibit programmable self-assembly at the nanoscale. To demonstrate the biomedical utility of CHaMPs, we used this approach to append cholesterol to biologically active peptide exendin-4 that is an approved drug for the treatment of type II diabetes. The exendin-cholesterol conjugate self-assembled into micelles, and these micelles activate the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor with a potency comparable to that of current gold standard treatments.",2
Switchable Schottky Contacts: Simultaneously Enhanced Output Current and Reduced Leakage Current.,"Metal-semiconductor contacts are key components of nanoelectronics and atomic-scale integrated circuits. In these components Schottky diodes provide a low forward voltage and a very fast switching rate but suffer the drawback of a high reverse leakage current. Improvement of the reverse bias characteristics without degrading performance of the diode at positive voltages is deemed physically impossible for conventional silicon-based Schottky diodes. However, in this work we propose that this design challenge can be overcome in the organic-based diodes by utilizing reversible transitions between distinct adsorption states of organic molecules on metal surfaces. Motivated by previous experimental observations of controllable adsorption conformations of anthradithiophene on Cu(111), herein we use density functional theory simulations to demonstrate the distinct Schottky barrier heights of the two adsorption states. The higher Schottky barrier of the reverse bias induced by a chemisorbed state results in low leakage current, while the lower barrier of the forward bias induced by a physisorbed state yields a larger output current. The rectifying behaviors are further supported by nonequilibrium Green's function transport calculations.",2
Neighboring Protonation Unveils Lewis Acidity in the B3NO2 Heterocycle.,"Boron serves a distinctive role in a broad range of chemistry disciplines. The utility of the element lies in its Lewis acidity, and thus, it is crucial to understand the properties of the boron atom in chemically different contexts. Herein, a combination of experiments and computations reveals the nuanced nature of boron in direct amidation reactions catalyzed by recently disclosed 1,3-dioxa-5-aza-2,4,6-triborinanes (DATBs). The most active DATB catalyst has been shown to bear an azaborine ring in its structure, thus having four boron atoms in a single molecule. Three chemically distinct boron atoms in the catalyst framework have been shown to serve different roles in the catalytic cycle, depending on their innate Lewis acidity. More specifically, the most Lewis acidic boron interacts with the amine, whereas the two boron atoms in the B-N-B substructure acquire Lewis acidity only upon protonation of the center nitrogen atom. Furthermore, although the least acidic boron atom in the azaborine ring did not act as a Lewis acid, it still plays an important role in the catalytic cycle by forming a hydrogen bond between carboxylic acid and the B-OH moiety. The mechanistic insights obtained from this study not only extend the knowledge on catalytic direct amidation but also provide a guiding principle for the further exploration of multi-boron compounds.",2
Isotope Labeling Reveals Fast Atomic and Molecular Exchange in Mechanochemical Milling Reactions.,"Using tandem in situ monitoring and isotope-labeled solids, we reveal that mechanochemical ball-milling overcomes inherently slow solid-state diffusion through continuous comminution and growth of milled particles. This process occurs with or without a net chemical reaction and also occurs between solids and liquid additives that can be practically used for highly efficient deuterium labeling of solids. The presented findings reveal a fundamental aspect of milling reactions and also delineate a methodology that should be considered in the study of mechanochemical reaction mechanisms.",2
Germanium Fluoride Nanocages as Optically Transparent n-Type Materials and Their Endohedral Metallofullerene Derivatives.,"Carbon- and silicon-based n-type materials tend to suffer from instability of the corresponding radical anions. With DFT calculations, we explore a promising route to overcome such challenges with molecular nanocages which utilize the heavier element Ge. The addition of fluorine substituents creates large electron affinities in the range 2.5-5.5 eV and HOMO-LUMO gaps between 1.6 and 3.2 eV. The LUMOs envelop the surfaces of these structures, suggesting extensive delocalization of injected electrons, analogous to fullerene acceptors. Moreover, these Ge nF n inorganic cages are found to be transparent in the UV-visible region as probed with their excited states. Their capacitance, linear polarizabilities, and dielectric constants are computed and found to be on the same order of magnitude as saturated oligomers and some extended pi-organics (azobenzenes). Furthermore, we explore fullerene-type endohedral isomers, i.e., cages with internal substituents or guest atoms, and find them to be more stable than the parent exohedral isomers by up to -206.45 kcal mol(-1). We also consider the addition of Li, He, Cs, and Bi, to probe the utility of the exo/ endo cages as host-guest systems. The endohedral He/Li@F8@Ge60F52 cages are significantly more stable than their parent exohedral isomers He/Li@Ge60F52 by -182.46 and -49.22 kcal mol(-1), respectively. The energy of formation of endohedral He@F8@Ge60F52 is exothermic by -10.4 kcal mol(-1), while Cs and Bi guests are too large to be accommodated but are stable in the exohedral parent cages. Conceivable applications of these materials include n-type semiconductors and transparent electrodes, with potential for novel energy storage modalities.",2
Facile Synthesis of Stable and Highly Luminescent Methylammonium Lead Halide Nanocrystals for Efficient Light Emitting Devices.,"Metal halide perovskites are promising candidates for use in light emitting diodes (LEDs), due to their potential for color tunable and high luminescence efficiency. While recent advances in perovskite-based light emitting diodes have resulted in external quantum efficiencies exceeding 12.4% for the green emitters, and infrared emitters based on 3 D/2D mixed dimensional perovskites have exceeded 20%, the external quantum efficiencies of the red and blue emitters still lag behind. A critical issue to date is creating highly emissive and stable perovskite emitters with the desirable emission band gap to achieve full-color displays and white LEDs. Herein, we report the preparation and characterization of a highly luminescent and stable suspension of cubic-shaped methylammonium lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3) perovskite nanocrystals, where we synthesize the nanocrystals via a ligand-assisted reprecipitation technique, using an acetonitrile/methylamine compound solvent system to solvate the ions and toluene as the antisolvent to induce crystallization. Through tuning the ratio of the ligands, the ligand to toluene ratio, and the temperature of the toluene, we obtain a solution of CH3NH3PbI3 nanocrystals with a photoluminescence quantum yield exceeding 93% and tunable emission between 660 and 705 nm. We also achieved red emission at 635 nm by blending the nanocrystals with bromide salt and obtained perovskite-based light emitting diodes with maximum electroluminescent external quantum efficiency of 2.75%.",2
Statistical Analysis of Nonuniform Volume Distributions for Droplet-Based Digital PCR Assays.,"We present a method to determine the concentration of nucleic acids in a sample by partitioning it into droplets with a nonuniform volume distribution. This digital PCR method requires no special equipment for partitioning, unlike other methods that require nearly identical volumes. Droplets are generated by vortexing a sample in an immiscible oil to create an emulsion. PCR is performed, and droplets in the emulsion are imaged. Droplets with one or more copies of a nucleic acid are identified, and the nucleic acid concentration of the sample is determined. Numerical simulations of droplet distributions were used to estimate measurement error and dynamic range and to examine the effects of the total volume of droplets imaged and the shape of the droplet size distribution on measurement accuracy. The ability of the method to resolve 1.5- and 3-fold differences in concentration was assessed by using simulations of statistical power. The method was validated experimentally; droplet shrinkage and fusion during amplification were also assessed experimentally and showed negligible effects on measured concentration.",2
"High-Precision Electrochemical Measurements of the Guanine-, Mismatch-, and Length-Dependence of Electron Transfer from Electrode-Bound DNA Are Consistent with a Contact-Mediated Mechanism.","Despite 25 years' effort, serious questions remain regarding the mechanism(s) underlying electron transfer through (or from) electrode-bound double-stranded DNA. In part this is because a control experiment regarding the putatively critical role of guanine bases in the most widely proposed transport mechanism (hopping from guanine to guanine through the pi-stack) appears to be lacking from the prior literature. In response, we have employed chronoamperometry, which allows for high-precision determination of electron transfer rates, to characterize transfer to a redox reporter appended onto electrode-bound DNA duplexes. Specifically, we have measured the effects of guanines and base mismatches on the electron transfer rate associated with such constructs. Upon doing so, we find that, counter to prior reports, the transfer rate is, to within relatively tight experimental confidence intervals, unaffected by either. Parallel studies of the dependence of the electron transfer rate on the length of the DNA suggest that transfer from this system obeys a ""collision"" mechanism in which the redox reporter physically contacts the electrode surface prior to the exchange of electrons.",2
Direct Carbon Isotope Exchange through Decarboxylative Carboxylation.,A two-step degradation-reconstruction approach to the carbon-14 radiolabeling of alkyl carboxylic acids is presented. Simple activation via redox-active ester formation was followed by nickel-mediated decarboxylative carboxylation to afford a range of complex compounds with ample isotopic incorporations for drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic studies. The practicality and operational simplicity of the protocol were demonstrated by its use in an industrial carbon-14 radiolabeling setting.,2
Generalized Preparation of Two-Dimensional Quasi-nanosheets via Self-assembly of Nanoparticles.,"Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials are attracting increasing research interest because of their unique properties and promising applications. Here, we report a facile method to manipulate the assembly of nanoparticles (NPs) to fabricate free-standing 2D quasi-nanosheets. The as-generated 2D products are composed of few-layer NPs; that is, their thicknesses are only tens of nanometers but lateral dimensions could be up to several micrometers. Therefore, the novel structure was denoted as 2D ""quasi-nanosheets (QNS)"". Specifically, several types of building blocks could be assembled into 2D unary, binary, ternary, and even quaternary QNS by a universal procedure. The entire assembly process is carried out in solution and mediated simply by tuning the concentration of ligands surrounding the NPs. In contrast to traditional assembly techniques, even without any substrate or template, these QNS showed exceptionally high stability. They can remain intact for several days without any disassembly regardless of the solvent environment (e.g., water, ethanol, methanol, and hexane). In general, our method has effectively tackled several limitations associated with traditional assembly techniques and allows more freedom in manipulating assembly of NPs, which may hold great potential for future fabrication of 2D devices with rich functionalities.",2
Flexizyme-Enabled Benchtop Biosynthesis of Thiopeptides.,"Thiopeptides are natural antibiotics that are fashioned from short peptides by multiple layers of post-translational modification. Their biosynthesis, in particular the pyridine synthases that form the macrocyclic antibiotic core, has attracted intensive research but is complicated by the challenges of reconstituting multiple-pathway enzymes. By combining select RiPP enzymes with cell free expression and flexizyme-based codon reprogramming, we have developed a benchtop biosynthesis of thiopeptide scaffolds. This strategy side-steps several challenges related to the investigation of thiopeptide enzymes and allows access to analytical quantities of new thiopeptide analogs. We further demonstrate that this strategy can be used to validate the activity of new pyridine synthases without the need to reconstitute the cognate prior pathway enzymes.",2
Lead-Halide Perovskites for Photocatalytic alpha-Alkylation of Aldehydes.,"Cost-effective and efficient photocatalysis are highly desirable in chemical synthesis. Here we demonstrate that readily prepared suspensions of APbBr3 (A = Cs or methylammonium (MA)) type perovskite colloids (ca. 2-100 nm) can selectively photocatalyze carbon-carbon bond formation reactions, i.e., alpha-alkylations. Specifically, we demonstrate alpha-alkylation of aldehydes with a turnover number (TON) of over 52,000 under visible light illumination. Hybrid organic/inorganic perovskites are revolutionizing photovoltaic research and are now impacting other research fields, but their exploration in organic synthesis is rare. Our low-cost, easy-to-process, highly efficient and bandedge-tunable perovskite photocatalyst is expected to bring new insights in chemical synthesis.",2
Molecular Characteristics of DNA-Alkylating PI Polyamides Targeting RUNX Transcription Factors.,"The runt-related transcription factor (RUNX) family has been associated with cancer development. The binding of RUNX family members to specific DNA sequences is hypothesized to promote the expression of downstream genes and cause cancer proliferation. On the basis of this proposed mechanism of cancer growth, we developed conjugate 1, which inhibits the binding of RUNX to its target DNA. Conjugate 1 is a DNA-alkylating pyrrole-imidazole (PI) polyamide conjugate containing chlorambucil as an anticancer agent. Conjugate 1 was reported to have a marked anticancer effect in mouse models of acute myeloid leukemia. Although the effectiveness of 1 has been demonstrated in vivo, the detailed mechanism by which it alkylates DNA is unknown. Here, we chemically elucidated the molecular characteristics of conjugate 1 to confirm its potential as a RUNX-inhibiting drug. We also generated an alternative conjugate 2, which targets the same DNA sequence, by replacing one pyrrole with beta-alanine. Comparison of the characteristics of conjugates 1 and 2 suggested that reaction selectivity and binding affinity to the RUNX-binding sequence were improved by the introduction of beta-alanine. These findings indicate the possibility of DNA-alkylating PI polyamides as candidates for cancer chemotherapeutics.",2
Mechanistic Study of Ruthenium-Catalyzed C-H Hydroxylation Reveals an Unexpected Pathway for Catalyst Arrest.,"We have recently disclosed [(dtbpy)2RuCl2] as an effective precatalyst for chemoselective C-H hydroxylation of C(sp(3))-H bonds and have noted a marked disparity in reaction performance between 4,4'-di- tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine (dtbpy)- and 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy)-derived complexes. A desire to understand the origin of this difference and to further advance this catalytic method has motivated the comprehensive mechanistic investigation described herein. Details of this reaction have been unveiled through evaluation of ligand structure-activity relationships, electrochemical and kinetic studies, and pressurized sample infusion high-resolution mass spectrometry (PSI-MS). Salient findings from this investigation include the identification of more than one active oxidant and three disparate mechanisms for catalyst decomposition/arrest. Catalyst efficiency, as measured by turnover number, has a strong inverse correlation with the rate and extent of ligand dissociation, which is dependent on the identity of bipyridyl 4,4'-substituent groups. Dissociated bipyridyl ligand is oxidized to mono- and bis- N-oxide species under the reaction conditions, the former of which is found to act as a potent catalyst poison, yielding a catalytically inactive tris-ligated [Ru(dtbpy)2(dtbpy N-oxide)](2+) complex. Insights gained through this work highlight the power of PSI-MS for studies of complex reaction processes and are guiding ongoing efforts to develop high-performance, next-generation catalyst systems for C-H hydroxylation.",2
Structural Determination and Nonlinear Optical Properties of New 1T'''-Type MoS2 Compound.,"Noncentrosymmetric MoS2 semiconductors (1H, 3R) possess not only novel electronic structures of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and valley polarization but also remarkable nonlinear optical effects. A more interesting noncentrosymmetric structure, the so-called 1T'''-MoS2 layers, was predicted to be built up from [MoS6] octahedral motifs by theoreticians, but the bulk 1T''' MoS2 or its single crystal structure has not been reported yet. Here, we have successfully harvested 1T''' MoS2 single crystals by a topochemical method. The new layered structure is determined from single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The crystal crystallizes in space group P31m with a cell of a = b = 5.580(2) A and c = 5.957(2) A, which is a radical3 a x radical3 a superstructure of 1T MoS2 with corner-sharing Mo3 triangular trimers observed by the STEM. 1T''' MoS2 is verified to be semiconducting and possesses a band gap of 0.65 eV, different from metallic nature of 1T or 1T' MoS2. More surprisingly, the 1T''' MoS2 does show strong optical second-harmonic generation signals. This work provides the first layered noncentrosymmetric semiconductor of edge-sharing MoS6 octahedra for the research of nonlinear optics.",2
Biocatalytic N-Alkylation of Amines Using Either Primary Alcohols or Carboxylic Acids via Reductive Aminase Cascades.,"The alkylation of amines with either alcohols or carboxylic acids represents a mild and safe alternative to the use of genotoxic alkyl halides and sulfonate esters. Here we report two complementary one-pot systems in which the reductive aminase (RedAm) from Aspergillus oryzae is combined with either (i) a 1 degrees alcohol/alcohol oxidase (AO) or (ii) carboxylic acid/carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) to affect N-alkylation reactions. The application of both approaches has been exemplified with respect to substrate scope and also preparative scale synthesis. These new biocatalytic methods address issues facing alternative traditional synthetic protocols such as harsh conditions, overalkylation and complicated workup procedures.",2
Nitrosyl Linkage Isomers: NO Coupling to N2O at a Mononuclear Site.,"Linkage isomers of reduced metal-nitrosyl complexes serve as key species in nitric oxide (NO) reduction at monometallic sites to produce nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas. While factors leading to extremely rare side-on nitrosyls are unclear, we describe a pair of nickel-nitrosyl linkage isomers through controlled tuning of noncovalent interactions between the nitrosyl ligands and differently encapsulated potassium cations. Furthermore, these reduced metal-nitrosyl species with N-centered spin density undergo radical coupling with free NO and provide a N-N coupled cis-hyponitrite intermediate whose protonation triggers the release of N2O. This report outlines a stepwise molecular mechanism of NO reduction to form N2O at a mononuclear metal site that provides insight into the related biological reduction of NO to N2O.",2
DNA Intercalation Facilitates Efficient DNA-Targeted Covalent Binding of Phenanthriplatin.,"Phenanthriplatin, a monofunctional anticancer agent derived from cisplatin, shows significantly more rapid DNA covalent-binding activity compared to its parent complex. To understand the underlying molecular mechanism, we used single-molecule studies with optical tweezers to probe the kinetics of DNA-phenanthriplatin binding as well as DNA binding to several control complexes. The time-dependent extensions of single lambda-DNA molecules were monitored at constant applied forces and compound concentrations, followed by rinsing with a compound-free solution. DNA-phenanthriplatin association consisted of fast and reversible DNA lengthening with time constant tau approximately 10 s, followed by slow and irreversible DNA elongation that reached equilibrium in approximately 30 min. In contrast, only reversible fast DNA elongation occured for its stereoisomer trans-phenanthriplatin, suggesting that the distinct two-rate kinetics of phenanthriplatin is sensitive to the geometric conformation of the complex. Furthermore, no DNA unwinding was observed for pyriplatin, in which the phenanthridine ligand of phenanthriplatin is replaced by the smaller pyridine molecule, indicating that the size of the aromatic group is responsible for the rapid DNA elongation. These findings suggest that the mechanism of binding of phenanthriplatin to DNA involves rapid, partial intercalation of the phenanthridine ring followed by slower substitution of the adjacent chloride ligand by, most likely, the N7 atom of a purine base. The cis isomer affords the proper stereochemistry at the metal center to facilitate essentially irreversible DNA covalent binding, a geometric advantage not afforded by trans-phenanthriplatin. This study demonstrates that reversible DNA intercalation provides a robust transition state that is efficiently converted to an irreversible DNA-Pt bound state.",2
Investigating the Role of Ligand Electronics on Stabilizing Electrocatalytically Relevant Low-Valent Co(I) Intermediates.,"Cobalt complexes have shown great promise as electrocatalysts in applications ranging from hydrogen evolution to C-H functionalization. However, the use of such complexes often requires polydentate, bulky ligands to stabilize the catalytically active Co(I) oxidation state from deleterious disproportionation reactions to enable the desired reactivity. Herein, we describe the use of bidentate electronically asymmetric ligands as an alternative approach to stabilizing transient Co(I) species. Using disproportionation rates of electrochemically generated Co(I) complexes as a model for stability, we measured the relative stability of complexes prepared with a series of N, N-bidentate ligands. While the stability of Co(I)Cl complexes demonstrates a correlation with experimentally measured thermodynamic properties, consistent with an outer-sphere electron transfer process, the set of ligated Co(I)Br complexes evaluated was found to be preferentially stabilized by electronically asymmetric ligands, demonstrating an alternative disproportionation mechanism. These results allow a greater understanding of the fundamental processes involved in the disproportionation of organometallic complexes and have allowed the identification of cobalt complexes that show promise for the development of novel electrocatalytic reactions.",2
Highly Ordered Polypeptide with UCST Phase Separation Behavior.,"Manipulating phase separation structures of thermoresponsive polymers will enhance the usefulness of structure-controllable materials in fields such as drug delivery and tissue engineering. However, behaviors of upper critical solution temperature (UCST) have been less investigated so far, despite the importance of UCST. Here, we examined two citrulline-based polypeptides, poly(d-ornithine- co-d-citrulline) (PdOC) and poly(dl-ornithine- co-dl-citrulline) (PdlOC), to investigate how stereoregularity of the polypeptides influences UCST behavior, in addition to poly(l-ornithine- co-l-citrulline) (PlOC) previously studied. Homochiral PlOC and PdOC showed phase separation temperatures ( Tps) higher than that of racemic PdlOC. Moreover, PdlOC underwent liquid to coacervate phase separation at Tp, whereas PlOC and PdOC underwent liquid to solid-like aggregation transitions. From a structural point of view, circular dichroism and small-angle X-ray scattering measurements revealed that homochiral PlOC and PdOC polypeptides formed alpha-helical structures and assembled into a regular hexagonal lattice upon phase separation. Interactions between the pendent ureido groups of homochiral POCs appear to play pivotal roles in helical folding and assembly into the hexagonal structure. In addition, Tp change in response to biodegradation was confirmed for both PlOC and PdlOC. The biodegradability was considerably influenced by phase-separated structures. These findings of UCST-type POCs in this study would provide important insights into structure-controllable and thermoresponsive biomaterials.",2
"Welding Metallophthalocyanines into Bimetallic Molecular Meshes for Ultrasensitive, Low-Power Chemiresistive Detection of Gases.","This paper describes the first demonstration of using a series of isoreticular nickel phthalocyanine- and nickel naphthalocyanine-based bimetallic conductive two-dimensional (2D) metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as active materials in chemiresistive sensing of gases. Devices achieve exceptional sensitivity at sub-part-per-million (ppm) to part-per-billion (ppb) detection limits toward NH3 (0.31-0.33 ppm), H2S (19-32 ppb), and NO (1.0-1.1 ppb) at low driving voltages (0.01-1.0 V) within 1.5 min of exposure. The devices maintain their performance in the presence of humidity (5000 ppm of H2O). The isoreticular analogs enable modular control over selectivity and sensitivity in gas sensing through different combinations of linkers and metal nodes. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies suggest that the chemiresistive response of the MOFs involves charge transfer interactions triggered by the analytes adsorbed on MOFs.",2
Catalytic Carbonyl-Olefin Metathesis of Aliphatic Ketones: Iron(III) Homo-Dimers as Lewis Acidic Superelectrophiles.,"Catalytic carbonyl-olefin metathesis reactions have recently been developed as a powerful tool for carbon-carbon bond formation. However, currently available synthetic protocols rely exclusively on aryl ketone substrates while the corresponding aliphatic analogs remain elusive. We herein report the development of Lewis acid-catalyzed carbonyl-olefin ring-closing metathesis reactions for aliphatic ketones. Mechanistic investigations are consistent with a distinct mode of activation relying on the in situ formation of a homobimetallic singly bridged iron(III)-dimer as the postulated active catalytic species. These ""superelectrophiles"" function as more powerful Lewis acid catalysts that form upon association of individual iron(III)-monomers. While this mode of Lewis acid activation has previously been postulated to exist, it has not yet been applied in a catalytic setting. The insights presented are expected to enable further advancement in Lewis acid catalysis by building upon the activation principle of ""superelectrophiles"" and to broaden the current scope of catalytic carbonyl-olefin metathesis reactions.",2
Neutral Au1-Doped Cluster Catalysts AuTi2O3-6 for CO Oxidation by O2.,"Oxide supported gold catalysts (e.g., Au/TiO2) are of great significance in heterogeneous catalysis owing to their extraordinary catalytic activity. Study of heteronuclear metal oxide clusters (HMOCs, e.g., Au xTi yO z (q)) is an important way to uncover the molecular-level mechanisms of gold catalysis in the related heterogeneous catalytic systems. However, the current studies of HMOCs are focused on charged clusters with little attention paid to neutral species. The reactivity study of neutral HMOCs is vital to have a comprehensive understanding of heterogeneous catalysis, but it is experimentally challenging because of the difficulty of cluster ionization and detection without fragmentation. Herein, benefiting from a homemade time-of-flight mass spectrometer coupled with a vacuum ultraviolet laser system, the reactivity of neutral Au1-doped titanium oxide clusters AuTi2O3-6 in catalytic CO oxidation by O2 has been successfully identified. The mechanistic details of the catalysis have been elucidated by quantum chemistry calculations. The crucial roles of the mobile AuCO species that can facilitate not only the process of CO oxidation but also the process of O2 activation have been discovered in the cluster catalysis. The fascinating results are of substantial importance to understand the mechanisms of CO oxidation over Au/TiO2, one type of the best studied gold catalysts.",2
Supramolecular Control of Azobenzene Switching on Nanoparticles.,"The reversible photoisomerization of azobenzene has been utilized to construct a plethora of systems in which optical, electronic, catalytic, and other properties can be controlled by light. However, owing to azobenzene's hydrophobic nature, most of these examples have been realized only in organic solvents, and systems operating in water are relatively scarce. Here, we show that by coadsorbing the inherently hydrophobic azobenzenes with water-solubilizing ligands on the same nanoparticulate platforms, it is possible to render them essentially water-soluble. To this end, we developed a modified nanoparticle functionalization procedure allowing us to precisely fine-tune the amount of azobenzene on the functionalized nanoparticles. Molecular dynamics simulations helped us to identify two distinct supramolecular architectures (depending on the length of the background ligand) on these nanoparticles, which can explain their excellent aqueous solubilities. Azobenzenes adsorbed on these water-soluble nanoparticles exhibit highly reversible photoisomerization upon exposure to UV and visible light. Importantly, the mixed-monolayer approach allowed us to systematically investigate how the background ligand affects the switching properties of azobenzene. We found that the nature of the background ligand has a profound effect on the kinetics of azobenzene switching. For example, a hydroxy-terminated background ligand is capable of accelerating the back-isomerization reaction by more than 6000-fold. These results pave the way toward the development of novel light-responsive nanomaterials operating in aqueous media and, in the long run, in biological environments.",2
"Exploring the Cytotoxicity, Uptake, Cellular Response, and Proteomics of Mono- and Dinuclear DNA Light-Switch Complexes.","Drug resistance to platinum chemotherapeutics targeting DNA often involves abrogation of apoptosis and has emerged as a significant challenge in modern, non-targeted chemotherapy. Consequently, there is great interest in the anti-cancer properties of metal complexes-particularly those that interact with DNA-and mechanisms of consequent cell death. Herein we compare a parent cytotoxic complex, [Ru(phen)2(tpphz)](2+) [phen = 1,10-phenanthroline, tpphz = tetrapyridyl[3,2- a:2',3'- c:3'',2''- h:2''',3'''- j]phenazine], with a mononuclear analogue with a modified intercalating ligand, [Ru(phen)2(taptp)](2+) [taptp = 4,5,9,18-tetraazaphenanthreno[9,10- b] triphenylene], and two structurally related dinuclear, tpphz-bridged, heterometallic complexes, RuRe and RuPt. All three of these structural changes result in a switch from intercalation to groove-binding DNA interaction and concomitant reduction in cytotoxic potency, but no significant change in relative cytotoxicity toward platinum-resistant A2780CIS cancer cells, indicating that the DNA interaction mode is not critical for the mechanism of platinum resistance. All variants exhibited a light-switch effect, which for the first time was exploited to investigate timing of cell death by live-cell microscopy. Surprisingly, cell death occurred rapidly as a consequence of oncosis, characterized by loss of cytoplasmic volume control, absence of significant mitochondrial membrane potential loss, and lack of activation of apoptotic cell death markers. Importantly, a novel, quantitative proteomic analysis of the A2780 cell genome following exposure of the cells to either mononuclear complex reveals changes in protein expression associated with global cell responses to oxidative stress and DNA replication/repair cellular pathways. This combination of multiple targeting modalities and induction of a non-apoptotic death mechanism makes these complexes highly promising chemotherapeutic cytotoxicity leads.",2
Chemical Formation and Multiple Applications of Organic-Inorganic Hybrid Perovskite Materials.,"Lead halide based organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite (HPVK) materials combine the advantages of solution processing, high absorption coefficient, long charge diffusion length, and high mobility of inorganic framework. The recent interest in this field is mainly focused on solution-processable HPVK for energy conversion and different types of optoelectronics. The performance of HPVK optoelectronics is rivaling now that of conventional devices, but the stability of the HPVK device is now a major challenge in the field where chemists are expected to play more active roles. This Perspective summarizes the progress in the understanding of mechanism of the HPVK formation, and various applications in different fields such as solar cells, light-emitting diodes, lasers, photodetectors, and field-effect transistors. A personal view of the past developments and future challenges is also provided.",2
Chemistry for Covalent Modification of Endogenous/Native Proteins: From Test Tubes to Complex Biological Systems.,"Chemical modification of proteins provides powerful tools to realize a broad range of exciting biological applications, including the development of new classes of biopharmaceuticals and functional studies of individual proteins in complex biological systems. Numerous strategies for linking desired chemical probes with target proteins have been developed in the last two decades, with most exploiting genetic protein engineering and/or bio-orthogonal chemistry that utilizes unnatural amino acids incorporated into proteins. Modification of native proteins in test tubes and biological contexts by site-specific and target-selective approaches remains challenging because appropriate organic chemistry to carry out such modifications is currently limited. Nonetheless, a variety of promising strategies have appeared recently that address this grand challenge in chemical biology. These new chemistries yield native protein-based well-defined bioconjugations, specific labeling of endogenous proteins in various biological crude milieus, and the establishment of chemical proteomics as a new research area in protein science. In this Perspective, we focus on recent remarkable progress in chemistry for native protein modification. We survey chemical characteristics of the methods and describe briefly these advanced applications to address unsolved biological issues. Current limitations and future directions of this research field are also discussed.",2
Strong Phonon-Phonon Interactions Securing Extraordinary Thermoelectric Ge1- xSb xTe with Zn-Alloying-Induced Band Alignment.,"The ability of substitution atoms to decrease thermal conductivity is usually ascribed to the enhanced phonon-impurity scattering by assuming the original phonon dispersion relations. In this study, we find that 10% SbGe alloying in GeTe modifies the phonon dispersions significantly, closes the acoustic-optical phonon band gap, increases the phonon-phonon scattering rates, and reduces the phonon group velocities. These changes, together with grain boundaries, nanoprecipitates, and planar vacancies, lead to a significant decrease in the lattice thermal conductivity. In addition, an extra 2-6% Zn alloying decreases the energy offset between valence band edges at L and Sigma points in Ge1- xSb xTe that is found to be induced by the Ge 4s(2) lone pairs. Since Zn is free of s(2) lone pair electrons, substituting Ge with Zn atoms can consequently diminish the Ge 4s(2) lone-pair characters and reduce the energy offset, resulting in two energetically merged valence band maxima. The refined band structures render a power factor up to 40 muW cm(-1) K(-2) in Ge0.86Sb0.1Zn0.04Te. Ultimately, a superhigh zT of 2.2 is achieved. This study clarifies the impacts of high-concentration substitutional atoms on phonon band structure, phonon-phonon scattering rates, and the convergence of electron valence band edges, which could provide guidelines for developing high-performance thermoelectric materials.",2
Quantitative Evaluation of the Effect of the Hydrophobicity of the Environment Surrounding Bronsted Acid Sites on Their Catalytic Activity for the Hydrolysis of Organic Molecules.,"Sulfo-functionalized siloxane gels with a variety of surface hydrophobicities were fabricated to elucidate the effect of the environment surrounding the Bronsted acid site on their catalytic activity for the hydrolysis of organic molecules. A detailed structural analysis of these siloxane gels by elemental analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier-transformed infrared (FT-IR), and (29)Si MAS NMR revealed the formation of gel catalysts with a highly condensed siloxane network, which enabled us to quantitatively evaluate the hydrophobicity of the environment surrounding the catalytically active sulfo-functionality. A sulfo group in a highly hydrophobic environment exhibited excellent catalytic turnover frequency for the hydrolysis of acetate esters with a long alkyl chain, whereas not only conventional solid acid catalysts but also liquid acids showed quite low catalytic activity. Detailed kinetic studies corroborated that the adsorption of oleophilic esters at the Bronsted acid site was facilitated by the surrounding hydrophobic environment, thus significantly promoting hydrolysis under aqueous conditions. Furthermore, sulfo-functionalized siloxane gels with a highly hydrophobic surface showed excellent catalytic activity for the hydrolytic deprotection of silyl ethers.",2
Chemical Synthesis Enables Structural Reengineering of Aglaroxin C Leading to Inhibition Bias for Hepatitis C Viral Infection.,"As a unique rocaglate (flavagline) natural product, aglaroxin C displays intriguing biological activity by inhibiting hepatitis C viral entry. To further elucidate structure-activity relationships and diversify the pyrimidinone scaffold, we report a concise synthesis of aglaroxin C utilizing a highly regioselective pyrimidinone condensation. We have prepared more than 40 aglaroxin C analogues utilizing various amidine condensation partners. Through biological evaluation of analogues, we have discovered two lead compounds, CMLD012043 and CMLD012044, which show preferential bias for the inhibition of hepatitis C viral entry vs translation inhibition. Overall, the study demonstrates the power of chemical synthesis to produce natural product variants with both target inhibition bias and improved therapeutic indexes.",2
Catalytic Transfer Hydration of Cyanohydrins to alpha-Hydroxyamides.,"We report the palladium(II)-catalyzed transfer hydration of cyanohydrins to alpha -hydroxyamides by using carboxamides as water donors. This method enables selective hydration of various aldehyde- and ketone-derived cyanohydrins to afford alpha-mono- and alpha,alpha-disubstituted-alpha -hydroxyamides, respectively, under mild conditions (50 degrees C, 10 min). The direct conversion of fenofibrate, a drug bearing a benzophenone moiety, into a functionalized alpha,alpha-diaryl-alpha -hydroxyamide was achieved by means of a hydrocyanation-transfer hydration sequence. Preliminary kinetic studies and the synthesis of a site-specifically (18)O-labeled alpha -hydroxyamide demonstrated the carbonyl oxygen transfer from the carboxamide reagent into the alpha -hydroxyamide product.",2
Enzymatic Reconstitution and Biosynthetic Investigation of the Lasso Peptide Fusilassin.,"Lasso peptides are a class of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified natural product which possess a unique lariat knot conformation. The low entropy ""threaded"" conformation endows lasso peptides with considerable resistance to heat and proteolytic degradation, which are attractive properties for the development of peptide-based therapeutics. Despite their discovery nearly 30 years ago, the molecular mechanism underlying lasso peptide biosynthesis remains poorly characterized due to the low stability of the purified biosynthetic enzymes. Here, we report the biosynthetic reconstitution of a lasso peptide derived from Thermobifida fusca, termed fusilassin. Beyond robust catalytic activity, the fusilassin enzymes demonstrate extraordinary substrate tolerance during heterologous expression in E. coli and upon purification in cell-free biosynthetic reconstitution reactions. We provide evidence that the fusilassin biosynthetic enzymes are not capable of forming branched-cyclic products but can produce entirely unrelated lasso peptides. Finally, we leveraged our bioinformatic survey of all lasso peptides identified in GenBank to perform coevolutionary analysis of two requisite biosynthetic proteins. This effort correctly identified residues governing an important protein-protein interaction, illustrating how genomic insight can accelerate the characterization of natural product biosynthetic pathways. The fusilassin enzymes described within represent a model system for both designing future lasso peptides of biomedical importance and also for elucidating the molecular mechanisms that govern lasso peptide biosynthesis.",2
Apoferritin Protein Amyloid Fibrils with Tunable Chirality and Polymorphism.,"Ferritin, a soluble and highly robust protein with subunits packed into well-defined helices, is a key component of the iron regulatory system in the brain and thus is widely recognized as a crucial protein for iron metabolism, but may also bear possible implications in some neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we present evidence of how human recombinant apoferritin can convert into an unusual structure from its folded native state; that is, amyloid fibrils analogue to those found in pathological disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. An extensive combination of advanced microscopy, spectroscopy and scattering techniques concur to reveal that apoferritin fibrils possess a common double stranded twisted ribbon structure which can result in a mesoscopic right-handed chirality. We highlight a direct connection between the chirality and morphology of the resulting amyloid fibrils, and the initial protein subunits composition, advancing our understanding on the possible role of misfolding in some ferritin-related pathologies and posing new bases for the design of chiral 1D functional nanostructures.",2
"1,3-Chlorine Shift to a Vinyl Cation: A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Investigation of the E-Selective Gold(I)-Catalyzed Dimerization of Chloroacetylenes.","Metal-catalyzed dimerization reactions of terminal acetylenes are well known in the literature. However, only a few examples of the dimerization of halogen-substituted acetylenes are described. The products of the latter metal-catalyzed dimerization are the branched head-to-tail enynes. The formation of the corresponding linear head-to-head enynes has not been reported yet. Herein, we demonstrate by means of quantum chemical methods and experiments that the head-to-head dimerization of chloroarylacetylenes can be achieved via mono gold catalysis. Under the optimized conditions, a clean and complete conversion of the starting materials is observed and the dimeric products are obtained up to 75% NMR yield. A mechanistic investigation of the dimerization reaction reveals that the branched head-to-tail vinyl cation is energetically more stable than the corresponding linear head-to-head cation. However, the latter can rearrange by an unusual 1,3-chlorine shift, resulting in the highly stereoselective formation of the trans product, which corresponds to the gold complex of the head-to-head E-enyne. The activation barrier for this rearrangement is extremely low (ca. 2 kcal/mol). As the mono gold-catalyzed dimerization can be conducted in a preparative scale, this simple synthesis of trans-1,2-dichloroenynes makes the gold(I)-catalyzed head-to-head dimerization of chloroarylacetylenes an attractive method en route to more complex conjugated enyne systems and their congeners.",2
Site-Specifically Initiated Controlled/Living Branching Radical Polymerization: A Synthetic Route toward Hierarchically Branched Architectures.,"Controlled/living radical polymerization was developed to synthesize branched polyacrylates and polystyrene with tunable degrees of branching and low dispersities. This method is based on a polymerization-induced branching process that occurs when n-butyl alpha-bromoacrylate is copolymerized under atom transfer radical polymerization conditions. This novel branching polymerization demonstrates excellent synthetic versatility, enabling the preparation of complex macromolecular architectures constructed from branched-polymer building blocks.",2
Mechanism and Kinetics of Propane Dehydrogenation and Cracking over Ga/H-MFI Prepared via Vapor-Phase Exchange of H-MFI with GaCl3.,"In this study, the mechanism and kinetics of C3H8 dehydrogenation and cracking are examined over Ga/H-MFI catalysts prepared via vapor-phase exchange of H-MFI with GaCl3. The present study demonstrates that [GaH](2+) cations are the active centers for C3H8 dehydrogenation and cracking, independent of the Ga/Al ratio. For identical reaction conditions, [GaH](2+) cations in Ga/H-MFI exhibit a turnover frequency for C3H8 dehydrogenation that is 2 orders of magnitude higher and for C3H8 cracking, that is 1 order of magnitude higher than the corresponding turnover frequencies over H-MFI. C3H8 dehydrogenation and cracking exhibit first-order kinetics with respect to C3H8 over H-MFI, but both reactions exhibit first-order kinetics over Ga/H-MFI only at very low C3H8 partial pressures and zero-order kinetics at higher C3H8 partial pressures. H2 inhibits both reactions over Ga/H-MFI. It is also found that the ratio of the rate of dehydrogenation to the rate of cracking over Ga/H-MFI is independent of C3H8 and H2 partial pressures but weakly dependent on temperature. Measured activation enthalpies together with theoretical analysis are consistent with a mechanism in which both the dehydrogenation and cracking of C3H8 proceed over Ga/H-MFI via reversible, heterolytic dissociation of C3H8 at [GaH](2+) sites to form [C3H7-GaH](+)-H(+) cation pairs. The rate-determining step for dehydrogenation is the beta-hydride elimination of C3H6 and H2 from the C3H7 fragment. The rate-determining step for cracking is C-C bond attack of the same propyl fragment by the proximal Bronsted acid O-H group. H2 inhibits both dehydrogenation and cracking over Ga/H-MFI via reaction with [GaH](2+) cations to form [GaH2](+)-H(+) cation pairs.",2
Tip-Enhanced Raman Imaging of Single-Stranded DNA with Single Base Resolution.,"Tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) is a promising optical and analytical technique for chemical imaging and sensing at single molecule resolution. In particular, TERS signals generated by a gap-mode configuration where a silver tip is coupled with a gold substrate can resolve a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecule with a spatial resolution below 1 nm. To demonstrate the proof of subnanometer resolution, we show direct nucleic acid sequencing using TERS of a phage ssDNA (M13mp18). M13mp18 provides a known sequence and, through our deposition strategy, can be stretched (uncoiled) and attached to the substrate by its phosphate groups, while exposing its nucleobases to the tip. After deposition, we scan the silver tip along the ssDNA and collect TERS signals with a step of 0.5 nm, comparable to the bond length between two adjacent DNA bases. By demonstrating the real-time profiling of a ssDNA configuration and furthermore, with unique TERS signals of monomeric units of other biopolymers, we anticipate that this technique can be extended to the high-resolution imaging of various nanostructures as well as the direct sequencing of other important biopolymers including RNA, polysaccharides, and polypeptides.",2
Dynamic Carbon Isotope Exchange of Pharmaceuticals with Labeled CO2.,"A copper-catalyzed procedure enabling dynamic carbon isotope exchange is described. Utilizing the universal precursor [(14)C]CO2, this protocol allows to insert, in one single step, the desired carbon tag into carboxylic acids with no need of structural modifications. Reducing synthetic costs and limiting the generation of radioactive waste, this procedure will facilitate the access to carboxylic acids containing drugs and accelerate early (14)C-based ADME studies supporting drug development.",2
Acetyl Group Migration across the Saccharide Units in Oligomannoside Model Compound.,"Acetylated oligosaccharides are common in nature. While they are involved in several biochemical and biological processes, the role of the acetyl groups and the complexity of their migration has largely gone unnoticed. In this work, by combination of organic synthesis, NMR spectroscopy and quantum chemical modeling, we show that acetyl group migration is a much more complex phenomenon than previously known. By use of synthetic oligomannoside model compounds, we demonstrate, for the first time, that the migration of acetyl groups in oligosaccharides and polysaccharides may not be limited to transfer within a single monosaccharide moiety, but may also involve migration over a glycosidic bond between two different saccharide units. The observed phenomenon is not only interesting from the chemical point of view, but it also raises new questions about the potential biological role of acylated carbohydrates in nature.",2
Chemical Additives Enable Native Mass Spectrometry Measurement of Membrane Protein Oligomeric State within Intact Nanodiscs.,"Membrane proteins play critical biochemical roles but remain challenging to study. Recently, native or nondenaturing mass spectrometry (MS) has made great strides in characterizing membrane protein interactions. However, conventional native MS relies on detergent micelles, which may disrupt natural interactions. Lipoprotein nanodiscs provide a platform to present membrane proteins for native MS within a lipid bilayer environment, but previous native MS of membrane proteins in nanodiscs has been limited by the intermediate stability of nanodiscs. It is difficult to eject membrane proteins from nanodiscs for native MS but also difficult to retain intact nanodisc complexes with membrane proteins inside. Here, we employed chemical reagents that modulate the charge acquired during electrospray ionization (ESI). By modulating ESI conditions, we could either eject the membrane protein complex with few bound lipids or capture the intact membrane protein nanodisc complex-allowing measurement of the membrane protein oligomeric state within an intact lipid bilayer environment. The dramatic differences in the stability of nanodiscs under different ESI conditions opens new applications for native MS of nanodiscs.",2
Rh(III)-Catalyzed meta-C-H Alkenylation with Alkynes.,"Rh(III)-catalyzed meta-C-H functionalization reactions are still rare. Herein, we report the first example of Rh(III)-catalyzed meta-C-H alkenylation with disubstituted alkynes directed by a U-shaped nitrile template. Exclusive regio-selectivity has been achieved using unsymmetrical aryl and alkyl-disubstituted alkynes to afford synthetically valuable trisubstituted olefins. Propargyl alcohols are also compatible, affording complex allylic alcohols. Notably, transition metal-catalyzed meta-alkenylation with alkynes has not been successful with Pd catalysts.",2
Dramatic Electronic Perturbations of CuA Centers via Subtle Geometric Changes.,"CuA is a binuclear copper site acting as electron entry port in terminal heme-copper oxidases. In the oxidized form, CuA is a mixed valence pair whose electronic structure can be described using a potential energy surface with two minima, sigmau* and piu, that are variably populated at room temperature. We report that mutations in the first and second coordination spheres of the binuclear metallocofactor can be combined in an additive manner to tune the energy gap and, thus, the relative populations of the two lowest-lying states. A series of designed mutants span sigmau*/piu energy gaps ranging from 900 to 13 cm(-1). The smallest gap corresponds to a variant with an effectively degenerate ground state. All engineered sites preserve the mixed-valence character of this metal center and the electron transfer functionality. An increase of the Cu-Cu distance less than 0.06 A modifies the sigmau*/piu energy gap by almost 2 orders of magnitude, with longer distances eliciting a larger population of the piu state. This scenario offers a stark contrast to synthetic systems, as model compounds require a lengthening of 0.5 A in the Cu-Cu distance to stabilize the piu state. These findings show that the tight control of the protein environment allows drastic perturbations in the electronic structure of CuA sites with minor geometric changes.",2
Mechanical Properties of a Metal-Organic Framework formed by Covalent Cross-Linking of Metal-Organic Polyhedra.,"Overcoming the brittleness of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is a challenge for industrial applications. To increase the mechanical strength, MOFs have been blended with polymers to form composites. However, this also brings challenges, such as integration and integrity of MOF in the composite, which can hamper the selectivity of gas separations. In this report, an ""all MOF"" material with mechanical flexibility has been prepared by covalent cross-linking of metal-organic polyhedra (MOPs). The ubiquitous Cu24 isophthalate MOP has been decorated with a long alkyl chain having terminal alkene functionalities so that MOPs can be cross-linked via olefin metathesis using Grubbs second generation catalyst. Different degrees of cross-linked MOP materials have been obtained by varying the amount of catalyst in the reaction. Rheology of these structures with varying number of cross-links was performed to assess the cross-link density and its homogeneity throughout the sample. The mechanical properties were further investigated by the nanoindentation method, which showed increasing hardness with higher cross-link density. Thus, this strategy of cross-linking MOPs with covalent flexible units allows us to create MOFs of increasing mechanical strength while retaining the MOP cavities.",2
Mechanical Properties and Processing Techniques of Bulk Metal-Organic Framework Glasses.,"Melt quenched metal-organic framework (MOF) glasses define a new category of glass, distinct from metallic, organic, and inorganic glasses, owing to the dominant role of metal-ligand coordination bonding. The mechanical properties of glasses in general are important given their application in protective coatings and display technologies, though little is known about MOF glasses in this respect. The experimental elucidation of key properties such as their scratch resistance has been limited by the lack of processing methodologies capable of producing bulk glass samples. Here, nanoindentation was used to investigate the Young's modulus and hardness of four melt-quenched glasses formed from zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF): agZIF-4, agZIF-62, agZIF-76, and agZIF-76-mbIm. The creep resistance of the melt-quenched glasses was studied via strain-rate jump (SRJ) tests and through constant load and hold (CLH) indentation creep experiments. Values for the strain-rate sensitivity were found to be close to those for other glassy polymers and Se-rich GeSe chalcogenide glasses. Vacuum hot-pressing of agZIF-62 resulted in an inhomogeneous bulk sample containing the glass and amorphous non-melt-quenched aZIF-62. Remelting and annealing, however, resulted in the fabrication of a transparent, bubble-free bulk specimen, which allowed the first scratch testing experiments to be performed on an MOF glass.",2
"Catalytic, Enantioselective Synthesis of Cyclic Carbamates from Dialkyl Amines by CO2-Capture: Discovery, Development, and Mechanism.","Cyclic carbamates are a common feature of small-molecule therapeutics, offering a constrained hydrogen bond acceptor that is both polar and sterically small. Methods for their preparation most often focus first on amino alcohol synthesis and then reaction with phosgene or its equivalent. This report describes an enantioselective synthesis of cyclic carbamates in which carbon dioxide engages an unsaturated basic amine, facilitated by a bifunctional organocatalyst designed to stabilize a carbamic acid intermediate while activating it toward subsequent enantioselective carbon-oxygen bond formation. Six-membered cyclic carbamates are prepared in good yield with high levels of enantioselection, as constrained 1,3-amino alcohols featuring a chiral tertiary alcohol carbon. Spectroscopic analysis (NMR, DOSY) of various substrate-reagent combinations provides insight into the dominant species under the reaction conditions. Two peculiar requirements were identified to achieve highest consistency: a ""Goldilocks"" amount of water and the use of a noncrystalline form of the ligand. These atypical features of the final protocol notwithstanding, a diverse range of products could be prepared. Their functionalizations illustrate the versatility of the carbamates as precursors to enantioenriched small molecules.",2
Stepwise Expansion of Layered Metal-Organic Frameworks for Nonstochastic Exfoliation into Porous Nanosheets.,"A layered metal-organic framework (MOF) with a porous kagome lattice, kgm(SMe), was synthesized by complexation of 5-methylthioisophthalate (SMe-ip) with Cu(2+) in MeOH. As observed by powder XRD, kgm(SMe) (state I), when immersed in aprotic polar solvents such as THF, underwent stepwise interlayer expansion into a monolayer-expanded state (state III) through a bilayer-expanded state (state II). We successfully obtained the single-crystal structures of states I-III. Of interest, when further immersed in appropriate solvents, state II and III crystals preferentially exfoliated into bilayer and monolayer MOF nanosheets, respectively. The stepwise expansion followed by exfoliation, thus developed, may enable a nonstochastic approach to the selective synthesis of ultrathin porous nanosheets from layered MOF crystals.",2
Mimicking Microbial Rhodopsin Isomerization in a Single Crystal.,"Bacteriorhodopsin represents the simplest, and possibly most abundant, phototropic system requiring only a retinal-bound transmembrane protein to convert photons of light to an energy-generating proton gradient. The creation and interrogation of a microbial rhodopsin mimic, based on an orthogonal protein system, would illuminate the design elements required to generate new photoactive proteins with novel function. We describe a microbial rhodopsin mimic, created using a small soluble protein as a template, that specifically photoisomerizes all- trans to 13- cis retinal followed by thermal relaxation to the all- trans isomer, mimicking the bacteriorhodopsin photocycle, in a single crystal. The key element for selective isomerization is a tuned steric interaction between the chromophore and protein, similar to that seen in the microbial rhodopsins. It is further demonstrated that a single mutation converts the system to a protein photoswitch without chromophore photoisomerization or conformational change.",2
Realizing Two-Dimensional Magnetic Semiconductors with Enhanced Curie Temperature by Antiaromatic Ring Based Organometallic Frameworks.,"Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic semiconductors with room-temperature ferromagnetism are very desirable. Despite the great progress made recently, the Curie temperature is still very low ( approximately 45 K), originating from the weak ferromagnetic superexchange interaction. Here, based on first-principles calculations, we propose a general route to achieve 2D magnetic semiconductors with enhanced Curie temperature in organometallic frameworks by incorporating antiaromatic rings as organic linkers. Antiaromatic rings usually possess low-energy multiple spin states, which can be easily induced by adjacent magnetic moments of transition metals and subsequently coupled with them through the strong d-p direct exchange interaction, producing high-temperature ferrimagnetic ordering. The design of 2D organometallic frameworks with typical antiaromatic rings such as pentalene, which show Curie temperatures well above room temperature from classic Heisenberg model Monte Carlo simulations, confirms our proposal.",2
Redox Reactivity of a Mononuclear Manganese-Oxo Complex Binding Calcium Ion and Other Redox-Inactive Metal Ions.,"Mononuclear nonheme manganese(IV)-oxo complexes binding calcium ion and other redox-inactive metal ions, [(dpaq)Mn(IV)(O)](+)-M (n+) (1-M(n+), M (n+) = Ca(2+), Mg(2+), Zn(2+), Lu(3+), Y(3+), Al(3+), and Sc(3+)) (dpaq = 2-[bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)]amino- N-quinolin-8-yl-acetamidate), were synthesized by reacting a hydroxomanganese(III) complex, [(dpaq)Mn(III)(OH)](+), with iodosylbenzene (PhIO) in the presence of redox-inactive metal ions (M (n+)). The Mn(IV)-oxo complexes were characterized using various spectroscopic techniques. In reactivity studies, we observed contrasting effects of M (n+) on the reactivity of 1-M (n+) in redox reactions such as electron-transfer (ET), oxygen atom transfer (OAT), and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions. In the OAT and ET reactions, the reactivity order of 1-M (n+), such as 1-Sc(3+) approximately 1-Al(3+) > 1-Y(3+) > 1-Lu(3+) > 1-Zn(2+) > 1-Mg(2+) > 1-Ca(2+), follows the Lewis acidity of M (n+) bound to the Mn-O moiety; that is, the stronger the Lewis acidity of M (n+), the higher the reactivity of 1-M (n+) becomes. In sharp contrast, the reactivity of 1-M (n+) in the HAT reaction was reversed, giving the reactivity order 1-Ca(2+) > 1-Mg(2+) > 1-Zn(2+) > 1-Lu(3+)> 1-Y(3+)> 1-Al(3+) approximately 1-Sc(3+); that is, the higher is Lewis acidity of M (n+), the lower the reactivity of 1-M (n+) in the HAT reaction. The latter result implies that the Lewis acidity of M (n+) bound to the Mn-O moiety can modulate the basicity of the metal-oxo moiety, thus influencing the HAT reactivity of 1-M (n+); cytochrome P450 utilizes the axial thiolate ligand to increase the basicity of the iron-oxo moiety, which enhances the reactivity of compound I in C-H bond activation reactions.",2
Cooking Chemistry Transforms Proteins into High-Strength Adhesives.,"In prior generations, proteins were taken from horses and other animals to make glues. Petroleum-derived polymers including epoxies and cyanoacrylates have since replaced proteins owing to improved performance. These modern materials come at a cost of toxicity as well as being derived from limited resources. Ideally, replacement adhesives will be made from benign, cheap, and renewable feedstocks. Such a transition to biobased materials, however, will not occur until similar or improved performance can be achieved. We have discovered that coupling of proteins and sugars gives rise to strong adhesives. An unexpected connection was made between adhesion and Maillard chemistry, known to be at the heart of cooking foods. Cross-linked proteins bonded metal and wood with high strengths, in some cases showing forces exceeding those withstood by the substrates themselves. Simple cooking chemistry may provide a route to future high-performance materials derived from low-cost, environmentally benign components.",2
Accumulation of Glassy Poly(ethylene oxide) Anchored in a Covalent Organic Framework as a Solid-State Li(+) Electrolyte.,"Design of molecular structures showing fast ion conductive/transport pathways in the solid state has been a significant challenge. The amorphous or glassy phase in organic polymers works well for fast ion conductivity because of their dynamic and random structure. However, the main issue with these polymers has been the difficulty in elucidating the mechanisms of ion conduction and thus low designability. Furthermore, the amorphous or glassy state of ion conductive polymers often confronts the problems of structural/mechanical stabilities. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are an emerging class of crystalline organic polymers with periodic structure and tunable functionality, which exhibit potential as a unique ion conductor/transporter. Here, we describe the use of a COF as a medium for all-solid-state Li(+) conductivity. A bottom-up self-assembly approach was applied to covalently reticulate the flexible, bulky, and glassy poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) moieties that can solvate Li(+) for fast transport by their segmental motion in the rigid two-dimensional COF architectures. Temperature-dependent powder X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis showed that the periodic structures are intact even above 300 degrees C, and differential scanning calorimetry and solid-state NMR revealed that the accumulated PEO chains are highly dynamic and exhibit a glassy state. Li(+) conductivity was found to depend on the dynamics and length of PEO chains in the crystalline states, and solid-state Li(+) conductivity of 1.33 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) was achieved at 200 degrees C after LiTFSI doping. The high conductivity at the specified temperature remains intact for extended periods of time as a result of the structure's robustness. Furthermore, we demonstrated the first application of a COF electrolyte in an all-solid-state Li battery at 100 degrees C.",2
"Enantioselective Redox-Neutral Coupling of Aldehydes and Alkenes by an Iron-Catalyzed ""Catch-Release"" Tethering Approach.","The reductive coupling of aldehydes and alkenes is an emerging technology that holds the potential to reinvent carbonyl addition chemistry. However, existing enantioselective methods are limited to form ""branched"" products. Herein, we present a directed enantio- and diastereoselective alkylation of aldehydes with simple olefins to selectively yield linear coupling products. This is achieved by redox-neutral remote functionalization, whereby a tethering ""catch-release"" strategy decisively solves the key problems of reactivity and selectivity.",2
Concise Total Synthesis of Herqulines B and C.,"A simple total synthesis of herqulines B and C is reported, modeled on the reductive biosynthesis reported previously by other researchers. Commencing from tyrosine, these alkaloids were fashioned through a dimerization, macrocyclization, and four consecutive reductions. Emerging from these studies are strategic insights on the synthesis of these strained alkaloids, as well as mild conditions for the exhaustive reduction of diketopiperizines.",2
Chemistry of Singlet Oxygen with a Cadmium-Sulfur Cluster: Physical Quenching versus Photooxidation.,"We investigated the chemistry of singlet oxygen with a cadmium-sulfur cluster, (Me4N)2[Cd4(SPh)10]. This cluster was used as a model for cadmium-sulfur nanoparticles. Such nanoparticles are often used in conjunction with photosensitizers (for singlet oxygen generation or dye-sensitized solar cells), and hence, it is important to determine if cadmium-sulfur moieties physically quench and/or chemically react with singlet oxygen. We found that (Me4N)2[Cd4(SPh)10] is indeed a very strong quencher of singlet oxygen with total rate constants for (1)O2 removal of (5.8 +/- 1.3) x 10(8) M(-1) s(-1) in acetonitrile and (1.2 +/- 0.5) x 10(8) M(-1) s(-1) in CD3OD. Physical quenching predominates, but chemical reaction leading to decomposition of the cluster and formation of sulfinate is also significant, with a rate constant of (4.1 +/- 0.6) x 10(6) M(-1) s(-1) in methanol. Commercially available cadmium-sulfur quantum dots (""lumidots"") show similar singlet oxygen quenching rate constants, based on the molar concentration of the quantum dots.",2
Total Synthesis of (-)-Sinulariadiolide. A Transannular Approach.,"The constrained tricyclic skeleton of the nor-cembranoid sinulariadiolide (1) with a nine-membered nexus was obtained by a cascade of transannular Michael reaction, carbonate elimination, butenolide formation, and spontaneous oxa-Michael addition of MeOH. The required macrocyclic precursor was prepared by ring-closing alkyne metathesis followed by trans-hydrostannation/carbonylation.",2
Nonresonant Photons Catalyze Photodissociation of Phenol.,"Phenol represents an ideal polyatomic system for demonstrating photon catalysis because of its large polarizability, well-characterized excited-state potential energy surfaces, and nonadiabatic dissociation dynamics. A nonresonant IR pulse (1064 nm) supplies a strong electric field (4 x 10(7) V/cm) during the photolysis of isolated phenol (C6H5OH) molecules to yield C6H5O + H near two known energetic thresholds: the S1/S2 conical intersection and the S1 - S0 origin. H-atom speed distributions show marked changes in the relative contributions of dissociative pathways in both cases, compared to the absence of the nonresonant IR pulse. Results indicate that nonresonant photons lower the activation barrier for some pathways relative to others by dynamically Stark shifting the excited-state potential energy surfaces rather than aligning molecules in the strong electric field. Theoretical calculations offer support for the experimental interpretation.",2
Zn-Mediated Fragmentation of Tertiary Alkyl Oxalates Enabling Formation of Alkylated and Arylated Quaternary Carbon Centers.,"Zn-mediated reduction of readily accessible dialkyl oxalates derived from tertiary alcohols provides an efficient approach to C-O bond fragmentation and alkyl radical formation. With MgCl2 as the indispensable additive and Ni as the promoter, trapping the radical with activated alkenes and aryl-Ni intermediates allows for the generation of alkylated and arylated all-carbon quaternary centers.",2
Heterotetrametallic Re-Zn-Zn-Re Complex Generated by an Anionic Rhenium(I) beta-Diketiminate.,"We report the synthesis of an anionic rhenium(I) compound, Na[Re(eta(5)-Cp)(BDI)] (1; Cp = cyclopentadienide, BDI = N, N'-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-3,5-dimethyl-beta-diketiminate) and initial investigations of its use as a strong chemical reductant and metalloligand. Chemical oxidation of 1 gives a rare example of a rhenium(II) compound Re(eta(5)-Cp)(BDI) (2), while protonation of 1 yields the rhenium(III) hydride complex Re(H)(eta(5)-Cp)(BDI) (3). The reaction of 1 with ZnCl2 generated both 2 and the zinc(I) compound [ZnRe(eta(5)-Cp)(BDI)]2 (4), which features a linear, tetrametallic Re(I)-Zn(I)-Zn(I)-Re(I) core. Computational studies of 4 were performed to characterize the metal-metal bonding interactions; the results indicate a dative interaction from rhenium to zinc and covalent bonding between the two zinc centers. One-electron oxidation of 4 yielded both 2 and the triflate-bridged zinc(II) complex [(mu-OTf)ZnRe(eta(5)-Cp)(BDI)]2 (5, OTf = trifluoromethanesulfonate).",2
Wafer-Sized Ultrathin Gallium and Indium Nitride Nanosheets through the Ammonolysis of Liquid Metal Derived Oxides.,"We report the synthesis of centimeter sized ultrathin GaN and InN. The synthesis relies on the ammonolysis of liquid metal derived two-dimensional (2D) oxide sheets that were squeeze-transferred onto desired substrates. Wurtzite GaN nanosheets featured typical thicknesses of 1.3 nm, an optical bandgap of 3.5 eV and a carrier mobility of 21.5 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1), while the InN featured a thickness of 2.0 nm. The deposited nanosheets were highly crystalline, grew along the (001) direction and featured a thickness of only three unit cells. The method provides a scalable approach for the integration of 2D morphologies of industrially important semiconductors into emerging electronics and optical devices.",2
Regio- and Enantioselective Iridium-Catalyzed Amination of Racemic Branched Alkyl-Substituted Allylic Acetates with Primary and Secondary Aromatic and Heteroaromatic Amines.,"The air- and water-stable pi-allyliridium C,O-benzoate modified by ( S)-tol-BINAP, ( S)-Ir-II, catalyzes highly regio- and enantioselective Tsuji-Trost-type aminations of racemic branched alkyl-substituted allylic acetates using primary or secondary (hetero)aromatic amines. Specifically, in the presence of ( S)-Ir-II (5 mol%) in DME solvent at 60-70 degrees C, alpha-methyl allyl acetate 1a (100 mol%) reacts with primary (hetero)aromatic amines 2a-2l (200 mol%) or secondary (hetero)aromatic amines 3a-3l (200 mol%) to form the branched products of allylic amination 4a-4l and 5a-5l, respectively, as single regioisomers in good to excellent yield with uniformly high levels of enantioselectivity. As illustrated by the conversion of heteroaromatic amine 3m to adducts 6a-6g, excellent levels of regio- and enantioselectivity are retained across diverse branched allylic acetates bearing normal alkyl or secondary alkyl substituents. For reactants 3n-3p, which incorporate both primary and secondary aryl amine moieties, regio- and enantioselective amination occurs with complete site-selectivity to furnish adducts 7a-7c. Mechanistic studies involving amination of the enantiomerically enriched, deuterium-labeled acetate 1h corroborate C-N bond formation via outer-sphere addition.",2
Cationic Cascade for Building Complex Polycyclic Molecules from Simple Precursors: Diastereoselective Installation of Three Contiguous Stereogenic Centers in a One-Pot Process.,"An expedient strategy for the synthesis of polycyclic small molecules is described. The method first joins together two achiral building blocks (an enyne and an aldehyde or a ketone) using an alkynyl halo-Prins protocol. Then, in the same reaction vessel, acidic conditions initiate a cationic cascade that includes a stereospecific halo-Nazarov electrocyclization and a diastereoselective Friedel-Crafts allylation. The entire sequence forms three carbon-carbon bonds and a carbon-halogen bond, generating halocyclopentene adducts in one pot from simple precursors. The process occurs with excellent diastereocontrol, providing highly functionalized polycycles containing three tertiary or quaternary stereogenic centers in a linear array. It is even possible to install three contiguous all-carbon quaternary centers using this method.",2
Proton Discharge on a Gold Electrode from Triethylammonium in Acetonitrile: Theoretical Modeling of Potential-Dependent Kinetic Isotope Effects.,"The discharge of protons on electrode surfaces, known as the Volmer reaction, is a ubiquitous reaction in heterogeneous electrocatalysis and plays an important role in renewable energy technologies. Recent experiments with triethylammonium (TEAH(+)) donating the proton to a gold electrode in acetonitrile demonstrate significantly different Tafel slopes for TEAH(+) and its deuterated counterpart, TEAD(+). As a result, the kinetic isotope effect (KIE) for the hydrogen evolution reaction changes considerably as a function of applied potential. Herein a vibronically nonadiabatic approach for proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) at an electrode interface is extended to heterogeneous electrochemical processes and is applied to this system. This approach accounts for the key effects of the electrical double layer and spans the electronically adiabatic and nonadiabatic regimes, as found to be necessary for this reaction. The experimental Tafel plots for TEAH(+) and TEAD(+) are reproduced using physically reasonable parameters within this model. The potential-dependent KIE or, equivalently, isotope-dependent Tafel slope is found to be a consequence of contributions from excited electron-proton vibronic states that depend on both isotope and applied potential. Specifically, the contributions from excited reactant vibronic states are greater for TEAD(+) than for TEAH(+). Thus, the two reactions proceed by the same fundamental mechanism yet exhibit significantly different Tafel slopes. This theoretical approach may be applicable to a wide range of other heterogeneous electrochemical PCET reactions.",2
Direct Synthesis of Crystalline Graphdiyne Analogue Based on Supramolecular Interactions.,"The synthesis of graphdiyne with an ordered internal structure is highly attractive for its various scientific and application investigations. We reported herein a rational method to fabricate a graphdiyne analogue with the help of supramolecular chemistry. The introduction of pi-pi/CH-pi interactions controlled the conformations of the precursors and afforded multilayer graphdiyne analogue Ben-GDY through the wet chemical method. The in-plane periodicity of the multilayer Ben-GDY was corroborated by transmission electron microscopy and selected area electron diffraction, which showed a pattern well matched with ABC-style stacking.",2
Divalent Ytterbium Complex-Catalyzed Homo- and Cross-Coupling of Primary Arylsilanes.,"Redistribution of primary silanes through C-Si and Si-H bond cleavage and reformation provides a straightforward synthesis of secondary silanes, but the poor selectivity and low efficiency severely hinders the application of this synthetic protocol. Here, we show that a newly synthesized divalent ytterbium alkyl complex exhibits unprecedentedly high catalytic activity toward the selective redistribution of primary arylsilanes to secondary arylsilanes. More significantly, this complex also effectively catalyzes the cross-coupling between electron-withdrawing substituted primary arylsilanes and electron-donating substituted primary arylsilanes to secondary arylsilanes containing two different aryls. DFT calculation indicates that the reaction always involve the exothermic formation of a hypervalent silicon upon facile addition of PhSiH3 to the Yb-E (E = C, H) bond. This hypervalent compound can easily either generate directly the Yb-Ph complex, or indirectly through the formation of Yb-H, that is the key complex for the formation of Ph2SiH2.",2
Forging C(sp(3))-C(sp(3)) Bonds with Carbon-Centered Radicals in the Synthesis of Complex Molecules.,"Radical fragment coupling reactions that unite intricate subunits have become an important class of transformations within the arena of complex molecule synthesis. This Perspective highlights some of the early contributions in this area, as well as more modern applications of radical fragment couplings in the preparation of natural products. Additionally, emphasis is placed on contemporary advances that allow for radical generation under mild conditions as a driving force for the implementation of radical fragment couplings in total synthesis.",2
Generalized View of Protein Folding: In Medio Stat Virtus.,"Proteins are often described in textbooks as being only ""marginally stable"" but many proteins, specifically those with a high free energy of unfolding are, in fact, so stable that they exist only in the fully folded state except under harsh denaturing conditions. Proteins that are truly only marginally stable, those with a low free energy of unfolding, exist as an equilibrium mixture of folded and unfolded forms under ""normal"" conditions. To some extent such proteins have some features in common with ""intrinsically disordered"" proteins. We analyzed the relationship between these marginally stable proteins and intrinsically disordered proteins in order to fully understand the twilight zone that distinguishes the two ensembles in the hope of clarifying the fuzzy borders of the current classification that divides the protein world into folded and intrinsically disordered ones. Our analysis suggests that the division may be too drastic and misleading, because it puts within the same category proteins with very different behaviors. We propose a restricted, albeit operational, definition of ""marginally stable proteins"", referring by this term only to proteins whose free energy difference between the folded and unfolded states falls in the interval 0-3 kcal/mol. These proteins have special features because they normally exist as equilibrium mixtures of folded and unfolded species or as molten globule states. This coexistence makes marginally stable proteins ideal tools to study even small environmental changes to which they may behave as natural sensors.",2
Metal-Organic Frameworks as Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering Substrates with High Tailorability.,"Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a widely used analytical technique for detecting trace-level molecules based on an indispensable SERS substrate. SERS substrates with high tailorability are assumed to be attractive and desirable for SERS detection, because the substrates match the need for the selective detection of different species. Nevertheless, the rational design of such SERS substrates is rather challenging for both noble-metal and semiconductor substrates. Herein, expanding beyond conventional SERS substrates, we demonstrate that metal-organic framework (MOF) materials can serve as a type of SERS substrate with molecular selectivity, which are rarely realized for SERS detection without any special pretreatment. A salient structural characteristic of MOF-based SERS substrates benefiting the SERS selectivity is their high tailorability. By controlling the metal centers, organic ligands, and framework topologies of our MOF-based SERS substrates, we show that the electronic band structures of MOF-based SERS substrate can be purposively manipulated to match those of the target analytes, thus resulting in different detectable species. Going further, the SERS enhancement factors (EFs) of the MOF-based SERS substrates can be greatly enhanced to as high as 10(6) with a low detection limit of 10(-8) M by pore-structure optimization and surface modification, which is comparable to the EFs of noble metals without ""hot spots"" and recently reported semiconductors. This selective enhancement is interpreted as being due to the controllable combination of several resonances, such as the charge-transfer, interband and molecule resonances, together with the ground-state charge-transfer interactions. Our study opens a new venue for the development of SERS substrates with high-design flexibility, which is especially important for selective SERS detection toward specific analytes.",2
"Palladium-Catalyzed Dearomative syn-1,4-Diamination.","Herein we report a dearomative syn-1,4-diamination protocol using simple nonactivated arenes and amines. This one-pot method utilizes arene-arenophile para-cycloadducts, formed via visible-light-mediated [4+2]-photocycloaddition that undergoes formal allylic substitution with amine nucleophiles under Pd-catalysis. The products are obtained with exclusive syn-1,4-selectivity; the method permits enantioselective desymmetrization of naphthalene, as well as elaborations of amine-containing drug molecules. Furthermore, the resulting unsaturated products are amenable to numerous options for diversification. Overall, this novel dearomative functionalization strategy offers rapid and straightforward access to complex building blocks, which are difficult to prepare otherwise, from simple arenes.",2
Asymmetric Synthesis of Griffipavixanthone Employing a Chiral Phosphoric Acid-Catalyzed Cycloaddition.,"Asymmetric synthesis of the biologically active xanthone dimer griffipavixanthone is reported along with its absolute stereochemistry determination. Synthesis of the natural product is accomplished via dimerization of a p-quinone methide using a chiral phosphoric acid catalyst to afford a protected precursor in excellent diastereo- and enantioselectivity. Mechanistic studies, including an unbiased computational investigation of chiral ion-pairs using parallel tempering, were performed in order to probe the mode of asymmetric induction.",2
Ultrasensitive Ambient Mass Spectrometry Immunoassays: Multiplexed Detection of Proteins in Serum and on Cell Surfaces.,"The sensitive and accurate determination of multiple protein biomarkers for clinical diagnosis is in high demand. Here, an ambient mass spectrometry immunoassay platform that possesses advantages of high sensitivity, multiplexed quantitation, low sample consumption and convenient operation was established. A series of extensible rhodamine-based mass tags that ensured quantification of multiple proteins with ultrahigh sensitivity through two-stage signal amplification were developed. Thrombin was detected at zeptomole sensitivity in 2 muL serum/plasma, as was free cancer antigen 125 (CA125). Three protein biomarkers (CA125, carcinoembryonic antigen, and epithelial cell adhesion molecule) were simultaneously detected in situ on ca. 20 cells. This platform is promising for multiple protein detection in a single drop of sample or at the single-cell scale for clinical diagnosis and therapy.",2
Efficient and Long-Lived Room-Temperature Organic Phosphorescence: Theoretical Descriptors for Molecular Designs.,"Room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with long afterglow from pure organic materials has attracted great attention for its potential applications in biological imaging, digital encryption, optoelectronic devices, and so on. Organic materials have been long considered to be nonphosphorescent owing to their weak molecular spin-orbit coupling and high sensitivity to temperature. However, recently, some purely organic compounds have demonstrated highly efficient RTP with long afterglow upon aggregation, while others fail. Namely, it remains a challenge to expound on the underlying mechanisms. In this study, we present the molecular descriptors to characterize the phosphorescence efficiency and lifetime. For a prototypical RTP system consisting of a carbonyl group and pi-conjugated segments, the excited states can be regarded as an admixture of n --> pi* (with portion alpha) and pi --> pi* (portion beta). Starting from the phosphorescent process and El-Sayed rule, we deduced that (i) the intersystem crossing (ISC) rate of S1 --> T n is mostly governed by the modification of the product of alpha and beta and (ii) the ISC rate of T1 --> S0 is determined by the beta value of T1. Thus, the descriptors (gamma = alpha x beta, beta) can be employed to describe the RTP character of organic molecules. From hybrid quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations, we illustrated the relationships among the descriptors (gamma, beta), phosphorescence efficiency and lifetime, and spin-orbit coupling constants. We stressed that the large gamma and beta values are favorable for the strong and long-lived RTP in organic materials. Experiments have reported confirmations of these molecular design rules.",2
In Vivo Albumin Traps Photosensitizer Monomers from Self-Assembled Phthalocyanine Nanovesicles: A Facile and Switchable Theranostic Approach.,"Albumin is a promising candidate as a biomarker for potential disease diagnostics and has been extensively used as a drug delivery carrier for decades. In these two directions, many albumin-detecting probes and exogenous albumin-based nanocomposite delivery systems have been developed. However, there are only a few cases demonstrating the specific interactions of exogenous probes with albumin in vivo, and nanocomposite delivery systems usually suffer from tedious fabrication processes and potential toxicity of the complexes. Herein, we demonstrate a facile ""one-for-all"" switchable nanotheranostic (NanoPcS) for both albumin detection and cancer treatment. In particular, the in vivo specific binding between albumin and PcS, arising from the disassembly of injected NanoPcS, is confirmed using an inducible transgenic mouse system. Fluorescence imaging and antitumor tests on different tumor models suggest that NanoPcS has superior tumor-targeting ability and the potential for time-modulated, activatable photodynamic therapy.",2
"Synthesis of 2-Aryloxy-1,3-dienes from Phenols and Propargyl Carbonates.","A convenient method for the synthesis of 1,3-dienes from readily available compounds is reported. 2-Aryoxy-1,3-dienes are produced stereoselectively by a nickel-catalyzed reaction of propargyl carbonates with phenols. Functional group tolerance is broad to allow iodo, formyl, and boryl groups. The resulting 1,3-dienes are of much synthetic value because they can participate in a wide variety of reactions, including the Diels-Alder reaction.",2
Plasmonic p-n Junction for Infrared Light to Chemical Energy Conversion.,"Infrared (IR) light represents an untapped energy source accounting for almost half of all solar energy. Thus, there is a need to develop systems to convert IR light to fuel and make full use of this plentiful resource. Herein, we report photocatalytic H2 evolution driven by near- to shortwave-IR light (up to 2500 nm) irradiation, based on novel CdS/Cu7S4 heterostructured nanocrystals. The apparent quantum yield reached 3.8% at 1100 nm, which exceeds the highest efficiencies achieved by IR light energy conversion systems reported to date. Spectroscopic results revealed that plasmon-induced hot-electron injection at p-n heterojunctions realizes exceptionally long-lived charge separation (>273 mus), which results in efficient IR light to hydrogen conversion. These results pave the way for the exploration of undeveloped low-energy light for solar fuel generation.",2
Elucidation of a Redox-Mediated Reaction Cycle for Nickel-Catalyzed Cross Coupling.,"A reaction cycle for redox-mediated, Ni-catalyzed aryl etherification is proposed under both photoredox and electrochemically mediated conditions. We demonstrate that a self-sustained Ni(I/III) cycle is operative in both cases by chemically synthesizing and characterizing a common paramagnetic Ni intermediate and establishing its catalytic activity. Furthermore, deleterious pathways leading to off-cycle Ni(II) species have been identified, allowing us to discover optimized conditions for achieving self-sustained reactivity at a approximately 15-fold increase in the quantum yield and a approximately 3-fold increase in the faradaic yield. These results highlight the importance of leveraging insight of complete reaction cycles for increasing the efficiency of redox-mediated reactions.",2
Hierarchically Compartmentalized Supramolecular Gels through Multilevel Self-Sorting.,"Hierarchical compartmentalization through the bottom-up approach is ubiquitous in living cells but remains a formidable task in synthetic systems. Here we report on hierarchically compartmentalized supramolecular gels that are spontaneously formed by multilevel self-sorting. Two types of molecular gelators are formed in situ from nonassembling building blocks and self-assemble into distinct gel fibers through a kinetic self-sorting process; interestingly, these distinct fibers further self-sort into separated microdomains, leading to microscale compartmentalized gel networks. Such spontaneously multilevel self-sorting systems provide a ""bottom-up"" approach toward hierarchically structured functional materials and may play a role in intracellular organization.",2
Rotaxane-Based Transition Metal Complexes: Effect of the Mechanical Bond on Structure and Electronic Properties.,"Early work by Sauvage revealed that mechanical bonding alters the stability and redox properties of their original catenane metal complexes. However, despite the importance of controlling metal ion properties for a range of applications, these effects have received relatively little attention since. Here we present a series of tri-, tetra-, and pentadentate rotaxane-based ligands and a detailed study of their metal binding behavior and, where possible, compare their redox and electronic properties with their noninterlocked counterparts. The rotaxane ligands form complexes with most of the metal ions investigated, and X-ray diffraction revealed that in some cases the mechanical bond enforces unusual coordination numbers and distorted arrangements as a result of the exclusion of exogenous ligands driven by the sterically crowded binding sites. In contrast, only the noninterlocked equivalent of the pentadentate rotaxane Cu(II) complex could be formed selectively, and this exhibited compromised redox stability compared to its interlocked counterpart. Frozen-solution EPR data demonstrate the formation of an interesting biomimetic state for the tetradentate Cu(II) rotaxane, as well as the formation of stable Ni(I) species and the unusual coexistence of high- and low-spin Co(II) in the pentadentate framework. Our results demonstrate that readily available mechanically chelating rotaxanes give rise to complexes the noninterlocked equivalent of which are inaccessible, and that the mechanical bond augments the redox behavior of the bound metal ion in a manner analogous to the carefully tuned amino acid framework in metalloproteins.",2
Atomic Structure of a Fluorescent Ag8 Cluster Templated by a Multistranded DNA Scaffold.,"Multinuclear silver clusters encapsulated by DNA exhibit size-tunable emission spectra and rich photophysics, but their atomic organization is poorly understood. Herein, we describe the structure of one such hybrid chromophore, a green-emitting Ag8 cluster arranged in a Big Dipper-shape bound to the oligonucleotide A2C4. Three 3' cytosine metallo-base pairs stabilize a parallel A-form-like duplex with a 5' adenine-rich pocket, which binds a metallic, trapezoidal-shaped Ag5 moiety via Ag-N bonds to endo- and exocyclic nitrogens of cytosine and adenine. The unique DNA configuration, constrained coordination environment, and templated Ag8 cluster arrangement highlight the reciprocity between the silvers and DNA in adopting this structure. These first atomic details of a DNA-encapsulated Ag cluster fluorophore illuminate many aspects of biological assembly, nanoscience, and metal cluster photophysics.",2
"Cu/Chiral Phosphoric Acid-Catalyzed Asymmetric Three-Component Radical-Initiated 1,2-Dicarbofunctionalization of Alkenes.","An asymmetric intermolecular, three-component radical-initiated dicarbofunctionalization of 1,1-diarylalkenes with diverse carbon-centered radical precursors and electron-rich heteroaromatics by a copper(I) and chiral phosphoric acid cooperative catalysis strategy has been developed, providing straightforward access to chiral triarylmethanes bearing quaternary all-carbon stereocenters with high efficiency as well as excellent chemo- and enantioselectivity. The key to success is not only the introduction of a sterically demanding chiral phosphoric acid to favor radical difunctionalization over the otherwise remarkable side reactions but also the in situ generation of carbocation intermediates from benzylic radical to realize asymmetric induction with the aid of a removable hydroxy directing group via cooperative interactions with chiral phosphate. Density functional theory calculations elucidated the critical chiral environment created by the hydrogen-bonding and ion-pair interactions between the chiral phosphoric acid catalyst and substrates, which leads to the enantioselective C-C bond formation.",2
Toward Anion-pi Interactions Directed Self-Assembly with Predesigned Dual Macrocyclic Receptors and Dianions.,"Realizing anion-pi interaction induced self-assembly with charge-neutral pi receptors as building components is extremely challenging. We designed and synthesized a series of bisoxacalix[2]arene[2]triazines 7-11 in which two macrocyclic motifs are linked in diverse branching angle and rigidity. Crystal structures showed the use of rigid linkers is able to control the orientation of the two macrocyclic cavities. The interplay between the two cavities was revealed by binding studies of 8-11 with chloride in solution. Whereas 180 degrees - and 120 degrees -branched hosts 8 and 9 possess dual complexation ability, 60 degrees -branched and flexibly linked hosts 10 and 11 only form 1:1 complex with chloride. Association and self-assembly of these bismacrocyclic building units with dianionic naphthalene-1,5-disulfonate were systematically investigated. The formation of oligomeric self-assemblies and large aggregates in solution was suggested by (1)H NMR titrations, concentration- and temperature-variable (1)H NMR, diffusion-ordered spectroscopy (DOSY), ESI-MS, and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The anion-pi induced long-distance self-assembly with coherent particle formation was revealed by SEM, TEM, cryo-TEM, and AFM techniques. The systematic studies allowed us to draw the conclusion that the dianion served to bridge the initial host aggregates through anion-pi interactions and was responsible for the coherent particle formation. The cavity orientation of the bismacrocycle components was found to have a significant influence on the coherent particle morphology.",2
Triarylmethane Fluorophores Resistant to Oxidative Photobluing.,"Spectral stability of small-molecule fluorescent probes is required for correct interpretation and reproducibility of multicolor fluorescence imaging data, in particular under high (de)excitation light intensities of super-resolution imaging or in single-molecule applications. We propose a synthetic approach to a series of spectrally stable rhodamine fluorophores based on sequential Ru- and Cu-catalyzed transformations, evaluate their stability against photobleaching and photoconversion in the context of other fluorophores using chemometric analysis, and demonstrate chemical reactivity of fluorophore photoproducts. The substitution patterns providing the photoconversion-resistant triarylmethane fluorophores have been identified, and the applicability of nonbluing labels in live-cell STED nanoscopy is demonstrated.",2
Inverse Correlation between Amyloid Stiffness and Size.,"We reveal that the axial stiffness of amyloid fibrils is inversely correlated with their cross-sectional area. Because amyloid fibrils' stiffness is determined by hydrogen bond (H-bond) density with a linear correlation, our finding implies that amyloid fibrils with larger radial sizes are generally softer and have lower density H-bond networks. In silico calculations show that the stiffness-size relationship of amyloid fibrils is, indeed, driven by the packing densities of residues and H-bonds. Our results suggest that polypeptide chains which form amyloid fibrils with narrow cross sections can optimize packing densities in the fibrillar core structure, in contrast to those forming wide amyloid fibrils. Consequently, the density of residues and H-bonds that contribute to mechanical stability is higher in amyloid fibrils with narrow cross sections. This size dependence of nanomechanics appears to be a global property of amyloid fibrils, just like the well-known cross-beta sheet topology.",2
Tuning P2-Structured Cathode Material by Na-Site Mg Substitution for Na-Ion Batteries.,"Most P2-type layered oxides suffer from multiple voltage plateaus, due to Na(+)/vacancy-order superstructures caused by strong interplay between Na-Na electrostatic interactions and charge ordering in the transition metal layers. Here, Mg ions are successfully introduced into Na sites in addition to the conventional transition metal sites in P2-type Na0.7[Mn0.6Ni0.4]O2 as new cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. Mg ions in the Na layer serve as ""pillars"" to stabilize the layered structure, especially for high-voltage charging, meanwhile Mg ions in the transition metal layer can destroy charge ordering. More importantly, Mg ion occupation in both sodium and transition metal layers will be able to create ""Na-O-Mg"" and ""Mg-O-Mg"" configurations in layered structures, resulting in ionic O 2p character, which allocates these O 2p states on top of those interacting with transition metals in the O-valence band, thus promoting reversible oxygen redox. This innovative design contributes smooth voltage profiles and high structural stability. Na0.7Mg0.05[Mn0.6Ni0.2Mg0.15]O2 exhibits superior electrochemical performance, especially good capacity retention at high current rate under a high cutoff voltage (4.2 V). A new P2 phase is formed after charge, rather than an O2 phase for the unsubstituted material. Besides, multiple intermediate phases are observed during high-rate charging. Na-ion transport kinetics are mainly affected by elemental-related redox couples and structural reorganization. These findings will open new opportunities for designing and optimizing layer-structured cathodes for sodium-ion batteries.",2
Principles Governing Catalytic Activity of Self-Assembled Short Peptides.,"Molecular self-assembly provides a chemical strategy for the synthesis of nanostructures by using the principles of nature, and peptides serve as the promising building blocks to construct adaptable molecular architectures. Recently, a series of heptapeptides with alternative hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues were reported to form amyloid-like structures, which are capable of catalyzing acyl ester hydrolysis with remarkable efficiency. However, information remains elusive about the atomic structures of the fibrils. What is the origin of the sequence-dependent catalytic activity? How is the ester hydrolysis catalyzed by the fibrils? In this work, the atomic structures of the aggregates were determined by using molecular modeling and further validated by solid-state NMR experiments, where the fibril with high activity adopts twisted parallel configuration within each layer, and the one with low activity is in flat antiparallel configuration. The polymorphism originates from the interactions between different regions of the building block peptides, where the delicate balance between rigidity and flexibility plays an important role. We further show that the p-nitrophenylacetate ( pNPA) hydrolysis reactions catalyzed by two different fibrils follow a similar mechanism, and the difference in microenvironment at the active site between the natural enzyme and the present self-assembled fibrils should account for the discrepancy in catalytic activities. The present work provides understanding of the structure and function of self-assembled fibrils formed with short peptides at an atomic level and thus sheds new insight on designing aggregates with better functions.",2
Complex Molecules That Fold Like Proteins Can Emerge Spontaneously.,"Folding can bestow macromolecules with various properties, as evident from nature's proteins. Until now complex folded molecules are the product either of evolution or of an elaborate process of design and synthesis. We now show that molecules that fold in a well-defined architecture of substantial complexity can emerge autonomously and selectively from a simple precursor. Specifically, we have identified a self-synthesizing macrocyclic foldamer with a complex and unprecedented secondary and tertiary structure that constructs itself highly selectively from 15 identical peptide-nucleobase subunits, using a dynamic combinatorial chemistry approach. Folding of the structure drives its synthesis in 95% yield from a mixture of interconverting molecules of different ring sizes in a one-step process. Single-crystal X-ray crystallography and NMR reveal a folding pattern based on an intricate network of noncovalent interactions involving residues spaced apart widely in the linear sequence. These results establish dynamic combinatorial chemistry as a powerful approach to developing synthetic molecules with folding motifs of a complexity that goes well beyond that accessible with current design approaches. The fact that such molecules can form autonomously implies that they may have played a role in the origin of life at earlier stages than previously thought possible.",2
A Mild and Direct Site-Selective sp(2) C-H Silylation of (Poly)Azines.,"A base-mediated protocol that allows for the site-selective sp(2) C-H silylation of azines is described. This method is distinguished by its mild conditions, simplicity and excellent site-selective modulation for a diverse set of azines, even in the context of late-stage functionalization, while exhibiting orthogonal reactivity with classical silylation reactions.",2
Harnessing Noncovalent Interactions in Dual-Catalytic Enantioselective Heck-Matsuda Arylation.,"The use of more than one catalyst in one-pot reaction conditions has become a rapidly evolving protocol in the development of asymmetric catalysis. The lack of molecular insights on the mechanism and enantioselectivity in dual-catalytic reactions motivated the present study focusing on an important catalytic asymmetric Heck-Matsuda cross-coupling. A comprehensive density functional theory (M06 and B3LYP-D3) investigation of the coupling between a spirocyclic cyclopentene and 4-fluorophenyl diazonium species under a dual-catalytic condition involving Pd2(dba)3 (dba = trans, trans-dibenzylideneacetone) and chiral 2,2'-binaphthyl diamine (BINAM)-derived phosphoric acids (BDPA, 2,2'-binaphthyl diamine-derived phosphoric acids) is presented. Among various mechanistic possibilities examined, the pathway with explicit inclusion of the base (in situ generated sodium bicarbonate/sodium biphosphate) is found to be energetically more preferred over the analogous base-free routes. The chiral phosphate generated by the action of sodium carbonate on BDPA is found to remain associated with the reaction site as a counterion. The initial oxidative addition of Pd(0) to the aryl diazonium bond gives rise to a Pd-aryl intermediate, which then goes through the enantiocontrolling migratory insertion to the cyclic alkene, leading to an arylated cycloalkene intermediate. Insights on how a series of noncovalent interactions, such as C-H...O, C-H...N, C-H...F, C-H...pi, lp...pi, O-H...pi, and C-F...pi, in the enantiocontrolling transition state (TS) render the migration of the Pd-aryl to the si prochiral face of the cyclic alkene more preferred over that to the re face are utilized for modulating the enantioselectivity. Aided by molecular insights on the enantiocontrolling transition states, we predicted improved enantioselectivity from 37% to 89% by changes in the N-aryl substituents of the catalyst. Subsequent experiments in our laboratory offered very good agreement with the predicted enantioselectivities.",2
Kinetic Resolution of Allylic Alcohol with Chiral BINOL-Based Alkoxides: A Combination of Experimental and Theoretical Studies.,"The development and characterization of enantioselective catalytic kinetic resolution of allylic alcohols through asymmetric isomerization with chiral BINOL derivatives-based alkoxides as bifunctional Bronsted base catalysts were described in the study. A number of chiral BINOL derivatives-based alkoxides were synthesized, and their structure-enantioselectivity correlation study in asymmetric isomerization identified a promising chiral Bronsted base catalyst, which afforded various chiral secondary allylic alcohols (ee up to 99%, S factor up to >200). In the mechanistic study, alkoxide species were identified as active species and the phenol group of BINOL largely affected the high reactivity and enantioselectivity via hydrogen bonding between the chiral Bronsted base catalyst and substrates. The strategy is the first successful synthesis strategy of various chiral secondary allylic alcohols through enantioselective transition-metal-free base-catalyzed isomerization. The applicability of the strategy had been demonstrated by the synthesis of the bioactive natural product (+)-veraguensin.",2
Pressure-Engineered Structural and Optical Properties of Two-Dimensional (C4H9NH3)2PbI4 Perovskite Exfoliated nm-Thin Flakes.,"Resolving the structure-property relationships of two-dimensional (2D) organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites is essential for the development of photovoltaic and photoelectronic devices. Here, pressure (0-10 GPa) was applied to 2D hybrid perovskite flakes mechanically exfoliated from butylammonium lead halide single crystals, (C4H9NH3)2PbI4, from which we observed a series of changes of the strong excitonic emissions in the photoluminescence spectra. By correlating with in situ high-pressure X-ray diffraction results, we examine successfully the relationship between structural modifications in the inorganic PbI4(2-) layer and their excitonic properties. During the transition between Pbca (1b) phase and Pbca (1a) phase at around 0.1 GPa, the decrease in Pb-I-Pb bond angle and increase in Pb-I bond length lead to an abrupt blue shift of the excitonic bandgap. The presence of the P21/a phase above 1.4 GPa increases the Pb-I-Pb bond angle and decreases the Pb-I bond length, leading to a deep red shift of the excitonic bandgap. The total band gap narrowing of approximately 350 meV to 2.03 eV at 5.3 GPa before amorphization, facilitates (C4H9NH3)2PbI4 as a much better solar absorber. Moreover, phase transitions inevitably modify the carrier lifetime of (C4H9NH3)2PbI4, where an initial 150 ps at ambient phase is prolongated to 190 ps in the Pbca (1a) phase along with enhanced photoluminescence (PL), originating from pressure-induced strong radiative recombination of trapped excitons.The onset of P21/a phase shortens significantly the carrier lifetime to 53 ps along with a weak PL emission due to pressure-induced severe lattice distortion and amorphization. High-pressure study on (C4H9NH3)2PbI4 nm-thin flakes may provide insights into the mechanisms for synthetically designing novel 2D hybrid perovskite based photoelectronic devices and solar cells.",2
How Does the Oxidation State of Palladium Surfaces Affect the Reactivity and Selectivity of Direct Synthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide from Hydrogen and Oxygen Gases? A Density Functional Study.,"Direct synthesis of H2O2 from H2 and O2 is an environmentally benign and atom economic process and as such is the ideal pathway in catalysis. However, currently no low-cost pathway of this kind of catalysis exists, although it would be an attractive alternative strategy to the common industrial anthraquinone method for H2O2 production. Metal-based catalysts are widely employed in such a direct synthesis process but often need to be oxidized, alloyed, or supplied with additives to make them selective. To understand the metal-oxidation state in heterogeneous catalysis, we studied the selective oxidation of hydrogen by molecular oxygen on Pd(111) and PdO(101) surfaces, leading to either H2O2 or H2O products. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that the oxidized PdO(101) surface clearly shows better performance and selectivity, as compared to the reduced Pd(111) one. The activation barrier on the oxidized Pd surface is ca. 0.2 eV lower than the one on the reduced Pd surface. On the oxidized surface, the H2O2 synthesis route is preferred, while, on the reduced surface, the H2O route is predominant. The decomposition of H2O2 is also greatly inhibited on the oxidized surface. We analyzed the different pathways in detail through thermochemical cycles, which establishes that the oxidized surface shows weaker adsorption ability toward the reagents O2 and H2, the key intermediate OOH, and also the product H2O2 in comparison with the Pd(111) surface, which we believe affect the selectivity. The work presented here clearly shows that the oxidation state of metal surfaces is one of the most important factors that tunes the catalysis of a chemical reaction and can affect the selectivity and reaction patterns dramatically.",2
What Are the Radical Intermediates in Oxidative N-Heterocyclic Carbene Organocatalysis?,"The oxidation of the Breslow intermediate resulting from the addition of an N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) to benzaldehyde triggers a fast deprotonation, followed by a second electron transfer, directly affording the corresponding acylium at E > -0.8 V (versus Fc/Fc(+)). Similarly, the oxidation of the cinnamaldehyde analogue occurs at an even higher potential and is not a reversible electrochemical process. As a whole, and contrary to previous beliefs, it is demonstrated that Breslow intermediates, which are the key intermediates in NHC-catalyzed transformations of aldehydes, cannot undergo a single electron transfer (SET) with mild oxidants ( E < -1.0 V). Moreover, the corresponding enol radical cations are ruled out as relevant intermediates. It is proposed that oxidative NHC-catalyzed radical transformations of enals proceed either through SET from the corresponding electron-rich enolate or through coupled electron-proton transfer from the enol, in any case generating neutral capto-dative radicals. Relevant electrochemical surrogates of these paramagnetic species have been isolated.",2
Total Synthesis of Herquline B and C.,"The total syntheses of (-)-herquline B (2) and a heretofore-unrecognized congener, (+)-herquline C (3), are described. The syntheses require 14 and 13 steps, respectively, and feature a key oxazoline reduction that sets the stage for piperazine construction.",2
Asymmetric Catalysis Using Aromatic Aldehydes as Chiral alpha-Alkoxyalkyl Anions.,"We have developed a new umpolung strategy for catalytically forming a chiral alpha-alkoxyalkyl anion from an aromatic aldehyde for use in asymmetric synthesis. The reaction between aromatic aldehydes and aryl or allyl electrophiles with a silylboronate utilizing a chiral copper-N-heterocyclic carbene catalyst and a palladium-bisphosphine catalyst in a synergistic manner occurred with high enantioselectivities to deliver the three-component coupling products, chiral silyl-protected secondary alcohol derivatives. Our method features the catalytic generation of enantioenriched chiral alpha-alkoxyalkylcopper(I) intermediates from aldehydes and their subsequent palladium-catalyzed stereospecific cross-coupling.",2
Diamantane Suspended Single Copper Atoms.,"Single chains of metal atoms are expected to be perfect one-dimensional nanowires in nanotechnology, due to their quantum nature including tunable electronic or spin coupling strengths. However, it is still rather difficult to fabricate such nanowires with metallic atoms under directional and separation control. Here, we succeeded in building higher-order single diamondoid-chains from the lower-order chains using a chemically well-controlled approach that employs diamondoids on metal surfaces. This approach results in higher-order diamondoid double chains by linking two neighboring single chains, and ultimately forms a central chain consisting of single Cu atoms suspended by the diamantane framework. The suspended Cu atoms are placed above the metal surface with a periodic distance of 0.67 +/- 0.01 nm. Our bottom-up approach will allow detailed experimental investigations of the properties of these exciting suspended metal atoms (for example, quantized conductance, spin coupling, as well as transfer, etc.). Furthermore, we also identified different spatial configurations on the metal surfaces in on-surface reaction processes using high-resolution AFM imaging and density functional theory computations. Our findings broaden the on-surface synthesis concept from 2D planar aromatic molecules to 3D bulky aliphatic molecules.",2
Chemoselective methylene oxidation in aromatic molecules.,"Despite significant progress in the development of site-selective aliphatic C-H oxidations over the past decade, the ability to oxidize strong methylene C-H bonds in the presence of more oxidatively labile aromatic functionalities remains a major unsolved problem. Such chemoselective reactivity is highly desirable for enabling late-stage oxidative derivatizations of pharmaceuticals and medicinally important natural products that often contain such functionality. Here, we report a simple manganese small-molecule catalyst Mn(CF3-PDP) system that achieves such chemoselectivity via an unexpected synergy of catalyst design and acid additive. Preparative remote methylene oxidation is obtained in 50 aromatic compounds housing medicinally relevant halogen, oxygen, heterocyclic and biaryl moieties. Late-stage methylene oxidation is demonstrated on four drug scaffolds, including the ethinylestradiol scaffold where other non-directed C-H oxidants that tolerate aromatic groups effect oxidation at only activated tertiary benzylic sites. Rapid generation of a known metabolite (piragliatin) from an advanced intermediate is demonstrated.",2
The reductive C3 functionalization of pyridinium and quinolinium salts through iridium-catalysed interrupted transfer hydrogenation.,"Aromatic rings are ubiquitous in organic chemistry and form the basis of many commercial products. Despite the numerous routes available for the preparation of aromatic compounds, there remain few methods that allow their conversion into synthetically useful partially saturated derivatives and even fewer that allow new C-C bonds to be formed at the same time. Here we set out to address this problem and uncover a unique catalytic partial reduction reaction that forms partially saturated azaheterocycles from aromatic precursors. In this reaction, methanol and formaldehyde are used for the reductive functionalization of pyridines and quinolines using catalytic iridium; thus, inexpensive and renewable feedstocks are utilized in the formation of complex N-heterocycles. By harnessing the formation of a nucleophilic enamine intermediate, the C-C bond-forming process reverses the normal pattern of reactivity and allows access to the C3 position of the arene. Mechanistic investigations using D-labelling experiments reveal the source of hydride added to the ring and show the reversible nature of the iridium-hydride addition.",2
Cobalt-Catalyzed Electrophilic Aminations with Anthranils: An Expedient Route to Condensed Quinolines.,"The reaction of various organozinc pivalates with anthranils provides anilines derivatives, which cyclize under acidic conditions providing condensed quinolines. Using alkenylzinc pivalates, electron-rich arylzinc pivalates or heterocyclic zinc pivalates produces directly the condensed quinolines of which several structures belong to new heterocyclic scaffolds. These N-heterocycles are of particular interest for organic light emitting diodes with their high photoluminescence quantum yields and long exciton lifetimes as well as for hole-transporting materials in methylammonium lead iodide perovskites solar cells due to an optimal band alignment for holes and a large bandgap.",2
A Mononuclear Nonheme Iron(IV)-Amido Complex Relevant for the Compound II Chemistry of Cytochrome P450.,"A mononuclear nonheme iron(IV)-amido complex bearing a tetraamido macrocyclic ligand, [(TAML)Fe(IV)(NHTs)](-) (1), was synthesized via a hydrogen atom (H atom) abstraction reaction of an iron(V)-imido complex, [(TAML)Fe(V)(NTs)](-) (2), and fully characterized using various spectroscopies. We then investigated (1) the p Ka of 1, (2) the reaction of 1 with a carbon-centered radical, and (3) the H atom abstraction reaction of 1. To the best of our knowledge, the present study reports for the first time the synthesis and chemical properties/reactions of a high-valent iron(IV)-amido complex.",2
Spatial Presentation of Cholesterol Units on a DNA Cube as a Determinant of Membrane Protein-Mimicking Functions.,"Cells use membrane proteins as gatekeepers to transport ions and molecules, catalyze reactions, relay signals, and interact with other cells. DNA nanostructures with lipidic anchors are promising as membrane protein mimics because of their high tunability. However, the design features specifying DNA nanostructures' functions in lipid membranes are yet to be fully understood. Here, we show that altering patterns of cholesterol units on a cubic DNA scaffold dramatically changes its interaction mode with lipid membranes. This results in simple design rules that allow a single DNA nanostructure to reproduce multiple membrane protein functions: peripheral anchoring, nanopore behavior, and conformational switching to reveal membrane-binding units. Strikingly, the DNA-cholesterol cubes constitute the first open-walled DNA nanopores, as only a quarter of their wall is made of DNA. This functional diversity can increase our fundamental understanding of membrane phenomena and result in sensing, drug delivery, and cell manipulation tools.",2
Kinetics of the Topochemical Transformation of (PbSe) m(TiSe2) n(SnSe2) m(TiSe2) n to (Pb0.5Sn0.5Se) m(TiSe2) n.,"Solid-state reaction kinetics on atomic length scales have not been heavily investigated due to the long times, high reaction temperatures, and small reaction volumes at interfaces in solid-state reactions. All of these conditions present significant analytical challenges in following reaction pathways. Herein we use in situ and ex situ X-ray diffraction, in situ X-ray reflectivity, high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy to investigate the mechanistic pathways for the formation of a layered (Pb0.5Sn0.5Se)1+delta(TiSe2) m heterostructure, where m is the varying number of TiSe2 layers in the repeating structure. Thin film precursors were vapor deposited as elemental-modulated layers into an artificial superlattice with Pb and Sn in independent layers, creating a repeating unit with twice the size of the final structure. At low temperatures, the precursor undergoes only a crystallization event to form an intermediate (SnSe2)1+gamma(TiSe2) m(PbSe)1+delta(TiSe2) m superstructure. At higher temperatures, this superstructure transforms into a (Pb0.5Sn0.5Se)1+delta(TiSe2) m alloyed structure. The rate of decay of superlattice reflections of the (SnSe2)1+gamma(TiSe2) m(PbSe)1+delta(TiSe2) m superstructure was used as the indicator of the progress of the reaction. We show that increasing the number of TiSe2 layers does not decrease the rate at which the SnSe2 and PbSe layers alloy, suggesting that at these temperatures it is reduction of the SnSe2 to SnSe and Se that is rate limiting in the formation of the alloy and not the associated diffusion of Sn and Pb through the TiSe2 layers.",2
Surface Dynamics and Ligand-Core Interactions of Quantum Sized Photoluminescent Gold Nanoclusters.,"Quantum-sized metallic clusters protected by biological ligands represent a new class of luminescent materials; yet the understanding of structural information and photoluminescence origin of these ultrasmall clusters remains a challenge. Herein we systematically study the surface ligand dynamics and ligand-metal core interactions of peptide-protected gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) with combined experimental characterizations and theoretical molecular simulations. We show that the peptide sequence plays an important role in determining the surface peptide structuring, interfacial water dynamics and ligand-Au core interaction, which can be tailored by controlling peptide acetylation, constituent amino acid electron donating/withdrawing capacity, aromaticity/hydrophobicity and by adjusting environmental pH. Specifically, emission enhancement is achieved through increasing the electron density of surface ligands in proximity to the Au core, discouraging photoinduced quenching, and by reducing the amount of surface-bound water molecules. These findings provide key design principles for understanding the surface dynamics of peptide-protected nanoparticles and maximizing the photoluminescence of metallic clusters through the exploitation of biologically relevant ligand properties.",2
Structure-Guided Identification of a Small Molecule That Inhibits Anaerobic Choline Metabolism by Human Gut Bacteria.,"The anaerobic gut microbial pathway that converts choline into trimethylamine (TMA) is broadly linked to human disease. Here, we describe the discovery that betaine aldehyde inhibits TMA production from choline by human gut bacterial isolates and a complex gut community. In vitro assays and a crystal structure suggest betaine aldehyde targets the gut microbial enzyme choline TMA-lyase (CutC). In our system, we do not observe activity for the previously reported CutC inhibitor 3,3-dimethylbutanol (DMB). The workflow we establish for identifying and characterizing betaine aldehyde provides a framework for developing additional inhibitors of gut microbial choline metabolism, including therapeutic candidates.",2
"Anomalous Stoichiometry, 3-D Bridged Triangular/Pentagonal Layered Structured Artificial Antiferromagnet for the Prussian Blue Analogue A3Mn(II)5(CN)13 (A = NMe4, NEtMe3). A Cation Adaptive Structure.","The size of the organic cation dictates both the composition and the extended 3-D structure for hybrid organic/inorganic Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) of A aMn(II) b(CN) a+2 b (A = cation) stoichiometry. Alkali PBAs are typically cubic with both MC6 and M'N6 octahedral coordination sites and the alkali cation content depends on the M and M' oxidation states. The reaction of Mn(II)(O2CCH3)2 and A(+)CN(-) (A = NMe4, NEtMe3) forms a hydrated material of A3Mn(II)5(CN)13 composition. A3Mn(II)5(CN)13 forms a complex, 3-D extended structural motif with octahedral and rarely observed square pyramidal and trigonal bipyramidal Mn(II) sites with a single layer motif of three pentagonal and one triangular fused rings. A complex pattern of Mn(II)CN chains bridge the layers. (NMe4)3Mn(II)5(CN)13 possesses one low-spin octahedral and four high-spin pentacoordinate Mn(II) sites and orders as an antiferromagnet at 11 K due to the layers being bridged and antiferromagnetically coupled by the nonmagnetic cyanides. These are rare examples of intrinsic, chemically prepared and controlled artificial antiferromagnets and have the advantage of having controlled uniform spacing between the layers as they are not physically prepared via deposition methods. A3Mn5(CN)13 (A = NMe4, NEtMe3) along with [NEt4]2Mn(II)3(CN)8, [NEt4]Mn(II)3(CN)7, and Mn(CN)2 form stoichiometrically related A aMn(II) b(CN) a+2 b ( a = 0, b = 1; a = 2, b = 3; a = 1, b = 3; and a = 3, b = 5) series possessing unprecedented stoichiometries and lattice motifs. These unusual structures and stoichiometries are attributed to the very ionic nature of the high-spin N-bonded Mn(II) ion that enables the maximization of the attractive van der Waals interactions via minimization of void space via a reduced angleMnNC. This A aMn(II) b(CN) a+2 b family of compounds are referred to as being cation adaptive in which size and shape dictate both the stoichiometry and structure.",2
Small-Molecule Fluorescent Probes for Live-Cell Super-Resolution Microscopy.,"Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy is a powerful tool to visualize biomolecules and cellular structures at the nanometer scale. Employing these techniques in living cells has opened up the possibility to study dynamic processes with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. Different physical approaches to super-resolution microscopy have been introduced over the last years. A bottleneck to apply these approaches for live-cell imaging has become the availability of appropriate fluorescent probes that can be specifically attached to biomolecules. In this Perspective, we discuss the role of small-molecule fluorescent probes for live-cell super-resolution microscopy and the challenges that need to be overcome for their generation. Recent trends in the development of labeling strategies are reviewed together with the required chemical and spectroscopic properties of the probes. Finally, selected examples of the use of small-molecule fluorescent probes in live-cell super-resolution microscopy are given.",2
Metal-Free Transfer Hydroiodination of C-C Multiple Bonds.,"The design and a gram-scale synthesis of a bench-stable cyclohexa-1,4-diene-based surrogate of gaseous hydrogen iodide are described. By initiation with a moderately strong Bronsted acid, hydrogen iodide is transferred from the surrogate onto C-C multiple bonds such as alkynes and allenes without the involvement of free hydrogen iodide. The surrogate fragments into toluene and ethylene, easy-to-remove volatile waste. This hydroiodination reaction avoids precarious handling of hydrogen iodide or hydroiodic acid. By this, a broad range of previously unknown or difficult-to-prepare vinyl iodides can be accessed in stereocontrolled fashion.",2
Extended pi-Conjugated Structures via Dehydrative C-C Coupling.,"We describe a methodology for the synthesis of extended aromatic structures through dehydrative C-C coupling from readily accessible diols. Treatment of the diols with a Bronsted acid ( para-toluenesulfonic acid) induces the nucleophilic addition of an arene or heteroarene, yielding fully aromatic products in high to quantitative yields with thiophenes, furan, indole, and N, N-dimethylaniline as coupling partners. The C-C coupling reactions proceed under mild, open flask conditions and offer high atom economy, while providing an attractive alternative approach to metal-catalyzed cross-coupling.",2
Nano-Assemblies from J-Aggregated Dyes: A Stimuli-Responsive Tool Applicable To Living Systems.,"Controlling the packing arrangements of dyes is a facile way of tuning their photophysical and/or photochemical properties, thus enabling new sensing mechanisms for photofunctional tools. Here, we present a general and robust strategy toward water-stable J-aggregated dye-templated nanoassemblies by incorporating an amphiphilic diblock copolymer and a stimuli-responsive dye as the only two building components. An iodo-substituted boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) was adopted as a template to direct the self-assembly of poly(ethylene glycol)- block-polycaprolactone (PEG-PCL), forming a core-shell nanoplate with slip-stacked BODIPYs as core surrounded by hydrophilic PEG shell. The self-assembled nanoplate is stable in cell culture medium and possesses a built-in stimuli-responsiveness that arises from BODIPY bearing meso-carboxylate protecting group, which is efficiently removed upon treatment with peroxynitrite. The resulting negative charges lead to rearrangement of dyes from J-stacking to nonstacking, which activates photoinduced singlet oxygen production from the nanoassemblies. The stimuli-activatable photosensitivity has been exploited for specific photodynamic ablation of activated RAW 264.7 cells with excessive endogenous peroxynitrite. In light of the generality of the sensing mechanism, the concept described herein will significantly expand the palette of design principles to develop diverse photofunctional tools for biological research and clinical needs.",2
His-Ligation to the [4Fe-4S] Subcluster Tunes the Catalytic Bias of [FeFe] Hydrogenase.,"[FeFe] hydrogenases interconvert H2 into protons and electrons reversibly and efficiently. The active site H-cluster is composed of two sites: a unique [2Fe] subcluster ([2Fe]H) covalently linked via cysteine to a canonical [4Fe-4S] cluster ([4Fe-4S]H). Both sites are redox active and electron transfer is proton-coupled, such that the potential of the H-cluster lies very close to the H2 thermodynamic potential, which confers the enzyme with the ability to operate quickly in both directions without energy losses. Here, one of the cysteines coordinating [4Fe-4S]H (Cys362) in the [FeFe] hydrogenase from the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii ( CrHydA1) was exchanged with histidine and the resulting C362H variant was shown to contain a [4Fe-4S] cluster with a more positive redox potential than the wild-type. The change in the [4Fe-4S] cluster potential resulted in a shift of the catalytic bias, diminishing the H2 production activity but giving significantly higher H2 oxidation activity, albeit with a 200 mV overpotential requirement. These results highlight the importance of the [4Fe-4S] cluster as an electron injection site, modulating the redox potential and the catalytic properties of the H-cluster.",2
Changes in Regioselectivity of H Atom Abstraction during the Hydroxylation and Cyclization Reactions Catalyzed by Hyoscyamine 6beta-Hydroxylase.,"Hyoscyamine 6beta-hydroxylase (H6H) is an alphaKG-dependent nonheme iron oxidase that catalyzes the oxidation of hyoscyamine to scopolamine via two separate reactions: hydroxylation followed by oxidative cyclization. Both of these reactions are expected to involve H atom abstraction from each of two adjacent carbon centers (C6 vs C7) in the substrate. During hydroxylation, there is a roughly 85:1 preference for H atom abstraction from C6 versus C7; however, this inverts to a 1:16 preference during cyclization. Furthermore, (18)O incorporation experiments in the presence of deuterated substrate are consistent with the catalytic iron(IV)-oxo complex being able to support the coordination of an additional ligand during hydroxylation. These observations suggest that subtle differences in the substrate binding configuration can have significant consequences for the catalytic cycle of H6H.",2
"Binding of the Bacterial Adhesin FimH to Its Natural, Multivalent High-Mannose Type Glycan Targets.","Multivalent carbohydrate-lectin interactions at host-pathogen interfaces play a crucial role in the establishment of infections. Although competitive antagonists that prevent pathogen adhesion are promising antimicrobial drugs, the molecular mechanisms underlying these complex adhesion processes are still poorly understood. Here, we characterize the interactions between the fimbrial adhesin FimH from uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains and its natural high-mannose type N-glycan binding epitopes on uroepithelial glycoproteins. Crystal structures and a detailed kinetic characterization of ligand-binding and dissociation revealed that the binding pocket of FimH evolved such that it recognizes the terminal alpha(1-2)-, alpha(1-3)-, and alpha(1-6)-linked mannosides of natural high-mannose type N-glycans with similar affinity. We demonstrate that the 2000-fold higher affinity of the domain-separated state of FimH compared to its domain-associated state is ligand-independent and consistent with a thermodynamic cycle in which ligand-binding shifts the association equilibrium between the FimH lectin and the FimH pilin domain. Moreover, we show that a single N-glycan can bind up to three molecules of FimH, albeit with negative cooperativity, so that a molar excess of accessible N-glycans over FimH on the cell surface favors monovalent FimH binding. Our data provide pivotal insights into the adhesion properties of uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains to their target receptors and a solid basis for the development of effective FimH antagonists.",2
Primary Anion-pi Catalysis and Autocatalysis.,"Epoxide-opening ether cyclizations are shown to occur on pi-acidic aromatic surfaces without the need of additional activating groups and with autocatalytic amplification. Increasing activity with the intrinsic pi acidity of benzenes, naphthalenediimides (NDIs) and perylenediimides (PDIs) support that anion-pi interactions account for function. Rate enhancements maximize at 270 for anion-pi catalysis on fullerenes and at 5100 M(-1) for autocatalysis. The occurrence of anion-pi autocatalysis is confirmed with increasing initial rates in the presence of additional product. Computational studies on autocatalysis reveal transition state and product forming a hydrogen-bonded noncovalent macrocycle, like holding their hands and dancing on the active pi surface, with epoxide opening and nucleophile being activated by anion-pi interactions and hydrogen bonds to the product, respectively.",2
Realizing High Thermoelectric Performance in p-Type SnSe through Crystal Structure Modification.,"The simple binary compound SnSe has been reported as a robust thermoelectric material for energy conversion by showing strong anharmonicity and multiple electronic valence bands. Herein, we report a record-high average ZT value of approximately 1.6 at 300-793 K with maximum ZT values ranging from 0.8 at 300 K to 2.1 at 793 K in p-type SnSe crystals. This remarkable thermoelectric performance arises from the enhanced power factor and lowered lattice thermal conductivity through crystal structure modification via Te alloying. Our results elucidate that Te alloying increases the carrier mobility by making the bond lengths more nearly equal and sharpening the valence bands; meanwhile, the Seebeck coefficient remains large due to multiple valence bands. As a result, a record-high power factor of approximately 55 muW cm(-1) K(-2) at 300 K is achieved. Additionally, Te alloying promotes Sn atom displacements, thus leading to a lower lattice thermal conductivity. Our conclusions are well supported by electron localization function calculations, the Callaway model, and structural characterization via aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy. Our approach of modifying crystal structures could also be applied in other low-symmetry thermoelectric materials and represents a new strategy to enhance thermoelectric performance.",2
"Well-Designed Phosphine-Urea Ligand for Highly Diastereo- and Enantioselective 1,3-Dipolar Cycloaddition of Methacrylonitrile: A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Study.","A novel chiral phosphine-urea bifunctional ligand has been developed for Cu-catalyzed asymmetric 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of iminoesters with methacrylonitrile, a long-standing challenging substrate in asymmetric catalysis. Distortion-interaction energy analysis based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveals that the distortion energy plays an important role in the observed enantioselectivity, which can be attributed to the steric effect between the phosphine ligand and the dipole reactant. DFT calculations also indicate that nucleophilic addition is the enantioselectivity-determining step and hydrogen bonding between the urea moiety and methacrylonitrile assists in control of the diastereo- and enantioselectivity. By a combination of metal catalysis and organocatalysis, excellent diastereo- and enantioselectivities (up to 99:1 diastereomeric ratio, 99% enantiomeric excess) as well as good yields are achieved. A wide range of substitution patterns of both iminoester and acrylonitrile is tolerated by this catalyst system, providing access to a series of highly substituted chiral cyanopyrrolidines with up to two quaternary stereogenic centers. The synthetic utility is demonstrated by enantioselective synthesis of antitumor agent ETP69 with a pivotal nitrile pharmacophore and an all-carbon quaternary stereogenic center.",2
Stereospecific Alkene Aziridination Using a Bifunctional Amino-Reagent: An Aza-Prilezhaev Reaction.,In situ deprotection (TFA) of O-Ts activated N-Boc hydroxylamines triggers intramolecular aziridination of N-tethered alkenes to provide complex N-heterocyclic ring systems. Synthetic and computational studies corroborate a diastereospecific aza-Prilezhaev-type mechanism. The feasibility of related intermolecular alkene aziridinations is also demonstrated.,2
Solid-State Order and Charge Mobility in [5]- to [12]Cycloparaphenylenes.,"We report a computational study of mesoscale morphology and charge-transport properties of radially pi-conjugated cycloparaphenylenes ([ n]CPPs) of various ring sizes ( n = 5-12, where n is the number of repeating phenyl units). These molecules are considered structural constituents of fullerenes and carbon nanotubes. [ n]CPP molecules are nested in a unique fashion in the solid state. Molecular dynamics simulations show that while intramolecular structural stability (order) increases with system size, intermolecular structural stability decreases. Density functional calculations reveal that reorganization energy, an important parameter in charge transfer, decreases as n is increased. Intermolecular charge-transfer electronic couplings in the solid state are relatively weak (due to curved pi-conjugation and loose intermolecular contacts) and are on the same order of magnitude ( approximately 10 meV) for each system. Intrinsic charge-carrier mobilities were simulated from kinetic Monte Carlo simulations; hole mobilities increased with system size and scaled as approximately n(4). We predict that disordered [ n]CPPs exhibit hole mobilities as high as 2 cm(2)/(V.s). Our computations show a strong correlation between reorganization energy and hole mobility (mu approximately lambda(-4)). Quantum mechanical calculations were performed on cofacially stacked molecular pairs for varying phenyl units and reveal that orbital delocalization is responsible for both decreasing reorganization energies and electronic couplings as n is increased.",2
Unraveling Oxygen Evolution on Iron-Doped beta-Nickel Oxyhydroxide: The Key Role of Highly Active Molecular-like Sites.,"The active site for electrocatalytic water oxidation on the highly active iron(Fe)-doped beta-nickel oxyhydroxide (beta-NiOOH) electrocatalyst is hotly debated. Here we characterize the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of an unexplored facet of this material with first-principles quantum mechanics. We show that molecular-like 4-fold-lattice-oxygen-coordinated metal sites on the (1211) surface may very well be the key active sites in the electrocatalysis. The predicted OER overpotential (etaOER) for a Fe-centered pathway is reduced by 0.34 V relative to a Ni-centered one, consistent with experiments. We further predict unprecedented, near-quantitative lower bounds for the etaOER, of 0.48 and 0.14 V for pure and Fe-doped beta-NiOOH(1211), respectively. Our hybrid density functional theory calculations favor a heretofore unpredicted pathway involving an iron(IV)-oxo species, Fe(4+)=O. We posit that an iron(IV)-oxo intermediate that stably forms under a low-coordination environment and the favorable discharge of Ni(3+) to Ni(2+) are key to beta-NiOOH's OER activity.",2
Kinetics of the Strongly Correlated CH3O + O2 Reaction: The Importance of Quadruple Excitations in Atmospheric and Combustion Chemistry.,"Kinetics measurements on radical-radical reactions are often unavailable experimentally, and obtaining quantitative rate constants for such reactions by theoretical methods is challenging because the transition states and the reactants are often strongly correlated. Treating strongly correlated systems by coupled cluster theory limited to single, double, and triple connected excitations is often inadequate. We therefore use a new method, called GMM(P), for extrapolation to the complete configuration interaction limit to go beyond triple excitations and in particular to approximate the CCSDTQ(P)/CBS limit. Here, we present this method and use it to investigate the CH3O + O2 reaction. The contribution of connected quadruple excitations to the barrier height energy is found to be -3.13 kcal/mol, and adding a quasiperturbative calculation of the effect of connected pentuple excitations brings the post-connected-triples contributions to -3.44 kcal/mol, which corresponds to Boltzmann factors that increase calculated rate constants by factors of 1.0 x 10(3), 3.3 x 10(2), and 18 at 250, 298, and 600 K, respectively. We present rate constants for temperatures from 250 to 2000 K, and we find that the Arrhenius activation energy increases from 0.58 to 9.68 kcal/mol over this range. We also find reasonably good accuracy for the barrier height with the MN15-L exchange-correlation functional, and we calculate rate constants by a combination of GMM(P) and MN15-L electronic structure calculations and conventional and variational transition state theory, in particular canonical variational theory with small-curvature tunneling. The present findings have broad implications for obtaining quantitative rate constants for complex reaction systems in atmospheric and combustion chemistry.",2
A Probe-Enabled Approach for the Selective Isolation and Characterization of Functionally Active Subpopulations in the Gut Microbiome.,"Commensal microorganisms in the mammalian gut play important roles in host health and physiology, but a central challenge remains in achieving a detailed mechanistic understanding of specific microbial contributions to host biochemistry. New function-based approaches are needed that analyze gut microbial function at the molecular level by coupling detection and measurements of in situ biochemical activity with identification of the responsible microbes and enzymes. We developed a platform employing beta-glucuronidase selective activity-based probes to detect, isolate, and identify microbial subpopulations in the gut responsible for this xenobiotic metabolism. We find that metabolic activity of gut microbiota can be plastic and that between individuals and during perturbation, phylogenetically disparate populations can provide beta-glucuronidase activity. Our work links biochemical activity with molecular-scale resolution without relying on genomic inference.",2
Frustrated Lewis Pair Catalyzed Hydrogenation of Amides: Halides as Active Lewis Base in the Metal-Free Hydrogen Activation.,"A method for the metal-free reduction of carboxylic amides using oxalyl chloride as an activating agent and hydrogen as the final reductant is introduced. The reaction proceeds via the hydrogen splitting by B(2,6-F2-C6H3)3 in combination with chloride as the Lewis base. Density functional theory calculations support the unprecedented role of halides as active Lewis base components in the frustrated Lewis pair mediated hydrogen activation. The reaction displays broad substrate scope for tertiary benzoic acid amides and alpha-branched carboxamides.",2
Solution Processing for Lateral Transition-Metal Dichalcogenides Homojunction from Polymorphic Crystal.,"Homojunctions comprised of transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMD) polymorphs are attractive building blocks for next-generation two-dimensional (2D) electronic circuitry. However, the synthesis of such homojunctions, which usually involves elaborate manipulation at the nanoscale, still remains a great challenge. Herein, we demonstrated a solution-processing strategy to successfully harvest lateral semiconductor-metal homojunctions with high yield. Specially, through precisely controlled lithiation process, precursors of polymorphic crystal arranged with 1T-2H domains were successfully achieved. A programmed exfoliation procedure was further employed to orderly laminate each phase in the polymorphic crystal, thus leading to 1T-2H TMD homojunction monolayers with sizes up to tens of micrometers. Moreover, the atomically sharp boundaries and superior band alignment improved the device on the basis of the semiconductor-metal homojunction with 50% decrease of electric field strength required in the derivation of state transition. We anticipate that solution processing based on programmed exfoliation would be a powerful tool to produce new configurations of 2D nanomaterials.",2
Effect of Oxidative Damage on Charge and Spin Transport in DNA.,"A Hall device was used for measuring spin polarization on electrons that are either reorganized within the molecules or transmitted through the self-assembled monolayers of DNA adsorbed on the device surface. We were able to observe spin-dependent charge polarization and charge transport through double-stranded DNA of various lengths and through double-stranded DNA containing oxidative damage. We found enhancement in the spin-dependent transport through oxidatively damaged DNA. This phenomenon can be rationalized either by assuming that the damaged DNA is characterized by a higher barrier for conduction or by charge transfer through the DNA being conducted through at least two channels, one involves the bases and is highly conductive but less spin selective, while the other pathway is mainly through the ribophosphate backbone and it is the minor one in terms of charge transmission efficiency, but it is highly spin selective.",2
"Self-Assembled Copper-Amino Acid Nanoparticles for in Situ Glutathione ""AND"" H2O2 Sequentially Triggered Chemodynamic Therapy.","Nanoformulations that can respond to the specific tumor microenvironment (TME), such as a weakly acidic pH, low oxygen, and high glutathione (GSH), show promise for killing cancer cells with minimal invasiveness and high specificity. In this study, we demonstrate self-assembled copper-amino acid mercaptide nanoparticles (Cu-Cys NPs) for in situ glutathione-activated and H2O2-reinforced chemodynamic therapy for drug-resistant breast cancer. After endocytosis into tumor cells, the Cu-Cys NPs could first react with local GSH, induce GSH depletion, and reduce Cu(2+) to Cu(+). Subsequently, the generated Cu(+) would react with local H2O2 to generate toxic hydroxyl radicals (.OH) via a Fenton-like reaction, which has a fast reaction rate in the weakly acidic TME, that are responsible for tumor-cell apoptosis. Due to the high GSH and H2O2 concentration in tumor cells, which sequentially triggers the redox reactions, Cu-Cys NPs exhibited relatively high cytotoxicity to cancer cells, whereas normal cells were left alive. The in vivo results also proved that Cu-Cys NPs efficiently inhibited drug-resistant breast cancer without causing obvious systemic toxicity. As a novel copper mercaptide nanoformulation responsive to the TME, these Cu-Cys NPs may have great potential in chemodynamic cancer therapy.",2
Ab Initio Prediction of Proton Exchange Barriers for Alkanes at Bronsted Sites of Zeolite H-MFI.,"A hybrid of high level and low level quantum mechanics (QM) methods has been employed to predict intrinsic and apparent energy barriers for the direct proton exchange mechanism of methane, ethane, propane, n-butane, and i-butane on Bronsted sites of H-MFI. The specific hybrid MP2:PBE+D2 + DeltaCC implementation used is known to yield the so-called ""chemical accuracy"" (+/-4 kJ/mol). Whereas the apparent enthalpy barriers decrease with increasing C number from 104 to 63 kJ/mol, in line with the decreasing heat of adsorption, the intrinsic enthalpy barriers are constant within 124-127 kJ/mol at 500 K. For methane, ethane, propane, and n-butane, we find the expected agreement of apparent barriers with activation energies from batch recirculation reactor experiments. The activation energies derived from NMR experiments (103-113 kJ/mol) are similarly constant as the predicted intrinsic barriers but systematically lower. For i-butane the predicted intrinsic and apparent barriers for the direct proton exchange step are the same as for n-butane with deviations of 2-5 kJ/mol, while the experiments yield values that are 50-60 kJ/mol lower, far outside the estimated range of combined experimental and computational uncertainty (+/-14 kJ/mol). A change to the indirect proton exchange mechanism, in which a hydride ion is transferred between the alkane and a tert-butyl carbenium ion can be excluded, because we confirm previous findings that the barrier for dehydrogenation that would create a tert-butyl cation from i-butane is much too high, 188 and 132 kJ/mol for the intrinsic and apparent enthalpy barriers, respectively, at 500 K. The possible role of extraframework- and framework-bound alumina species is discussed.",2
Energy-Degeneracy-Driven Covalency in Actinide Bonding.,"Evaluating the nature of chemical bonding for actinide elements represents one of the most important and long-standing problems in actinide science. We directly address this challenge and contribute a Cl K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy and relativistic density functional theory study that quantitatively evaluates An-Cl covalency in AnCl6(2-) (An(IV) = Th, U, Np, Pu). The results showed significant mixing between Cl 3p- and An(IV) 5f- and 6d-orbitals (t1u*/t2u* and t2 g*/eg *), with the 6d-orbitals showing more pronounced covalent bonding than the 5f-orbitals. Moving from Th to U, Np, and Pu markedly changed the amount of M-Cl orbital mixing, such that An(IV) 6d - and Cl 3p-mixing decreased and metal 5f - and Cl 3p-orbital mixing increased across this series.",2
Chiral Molecule-mediated Porous Cu xO Nanoparticle Clusters with Antioxidation Activity for Ameliorating Parkinson's Disease.,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the major pathological mechanisms of Parkinson's disease. Using inorganic nanomaterials to scavenge ROS has drawn significant interest and can prevent ROS-mediated neurological disorders. We prepared uniform Cu xO nanoparticle clusters (NCs) with an average size of 65 +/- 7 nm, using phenylalanine (Phe) as the structure-directing agent. These Cu xO NCs functionally mimicked the activities of peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. Because they eliminated ROS, the Cu xO NCs inhibited neurotoxicity in a cellular model of Parkinson's disease and rescued the memory loss of mice with Parkinson's disease. The biocompatibility and multiple enzyme-mimicking activities of Cu xO NCs offer new opportunities for the application of NCs in biomedicine, biosensing, and biocatalysis.",2
TiO2 Nanoparticles Catalyze Oxidation of Huntingtin Exon 1-Derived Peptides Impeding Aggregation: A Quantitative NMR Study of Binding and Kinetics.,"Polyglutamine expansion within the N-terminal region of the huntingtin protein results in the formation of intracellular aggregates responsible for Huntington's disease, a fatal neurodegenerative condition. The interaction between TiO2 nanoparticles and huntingtin peptides comprising the N-terminal amphiphilic domain without (htt(NT)) or with (htt(NT)Q10) a ten-residue C-terminal polyglutamine tract, is investigated by NMR spectroscopy. TiO2 nanoparticles decrease aggregation of htt(NT)Q10 by catalyzing the oxidation of Met(7) to a sulfoxide, resulting in an aggregation-incompetent peptide. The oxidation agent is hydrogen peroxide generated on the surface of the TiO2 nanoparticles either by UV irradiation or at low steady-state levels in the dark. The binding kinetics of nonaggregating htt(NT) to TiO2 nanoparticles is characterized by quantitative analysis of (15)N dark state exchange saturation transfer and lifetime line broadening NMR data. Binding involves a sparsely populated intermediate that experiences hindered rotational diffusion relative to the free state. Catalysis of methionine oxidation within the N-terminal domain of the huntingtin protein may potentially provide a strategy for delaying the onset of Huntington's disease.",2
"Enantioselective Trapping of Pd-Containing 1,5-Dipoles by Photogenerated Ketenes: Access to 7-Membered Lactones Bearing Chiral Quaternary Stereocenters.","An enantioselective [5+2] cycloaddition of vinylethylene carbonates and alpha-diazoketones was achieved for the first time by merging photoactivation and asymmetric Pd catalysis. The key to the success of this method is the enantioselective trapping of Pd-containing, 1,5-dipolar intermediates by ketenes, a class of reactive C2 synthons, which were generated in an in situ and traceless manner under visible light irradiation. Through this trapping, a variety of 7-membered lactones bearing challenging chiral quaternary stereocenters can be accessed in a facile manner with good efficiency and high enantioselectivity (up to 99% yield and 96:4 er).",2
Ultrasmall Abundant Metal-Based Clusters as Oxygen-Evolving Catalysts.,"The oxygen evolution reaction is a crucial step in water electrolysis to develop clean and renewable energy. Although noble metal-based catalysts have demonstrated high activity for the oxygen evolution reaction, their application is limited by their high cost and low availability. Here we report the use of a molecule-to-cluster strategy for preparing ultrasmall trimetallic clusters by using the polyoxometalate molecule as a precursor. Ultrafine (0.8 nm) transition-metal clusters with controllable chemical composition are obtained. The transition-metal clusters enable highly efficient oxygen evolution through water electrolysis in alkaline media, manifested by an overpotential of 192 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 36 mV dec(-1), and long-term stability for 30 h of electrolysis. We note, however, that besides the excellent performance as an oxygen evolution catalyst, our molecule-to-cluster strategy provides a means to achieve well-defined transition-metal clusters in the subnanometer regime, which potentially can have an impact on several other applications.",2
Extended Bis(anthraoxa)quinodimethanes with Nine and Ten Consecutively Fused Six-Membered Rings: Neutral Diradicaloids and Charged Diradical Dianions/Dications.,"We report the challenging synthesis of two very long bis(anthraoxa)quinodimethanes with nine (ABA) and ten (ANA) consecutively fused six-membered rings. The former is stable with negligible diradical character, while the latter with a moderate diradical character ( y0 = 25.0%) is reactive and an unexpected trifluoroacetic substituted product (ANA-TFA) was isolated. X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed a planar backbone with a typical quinoidal character for both. Their dications can be regarded as the isoelectronic structures of the respective nonacene and decacene. The dication ABA(2+) and dianion ABA(2-) are open-shell singlet diradicaloids, while the longer dication ANA-TFA(2+) and dianion ANA(2-) have closed-shell ground state, which can be explained by the different intramolecular Coulomb interactions. Both dianions have a bent backbone and can be considered as an isoelectronic structure of the tetraanion of nonacene and decacene, respectively.",2
High Hole Mobility and Nonsaturating Giant Magnetoresistance in the New 2D Metal NaCu4Se4 Synthesized by a Unique Pathway.,"The new compound NaCu4Se4 forms by the reaction of CuO and Cu in a molten sodium polyselenide flux, with the existence of CuO being unexpectedly critical to its synthesis. It adopts a layered hexagonal structure (space group P63/ mmc with cell parameters a = 3.9931(6) A and c = 25.167(5) A), consisting of infinite two-dimensional [Cu4Se4](-) slabs separated by Na(+) cations. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy suggests that NaCu4Se4 is mixed-valent with the formula (Na(+))(Cu(+))4(Se(2-))(Se(-))(Se2)(2-). NaCu4Se4 is a p-type metal with a carrier density of approximately 10(21) cm(-3) and a high hole mobility of approximately 808 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) at 2 K based on electronic transport measurements. First-principles calculations suggest the density of states around the Fermi level are composed of Cu-d and Se-p orbitals. At 2 K, a very large transverse magnetoresistance of approximately 1400% was observed, with a nonsaturating, linear dependence on field up to 9 T. Our results indicate that the use of metal oxide chemical precursors can open reaction paths to new low-dimensional compounds.",2
Concise Syntheses of Delta(12)-Prostaglandin J Natural Products via Stereoretentive Metathesis.,"Delta(12)-Prostaglandin J family is recently discovered and has potent anticancer activity. Concise syntheses of four Delta(12)-prostaglandin J natural products (7-8 steps in the longest linear sequences) are reported, enabled by convergent stereoretentive cross-metathesis. Exceptional control of alkene geometry was achieved through stereoretention.",2
Ultrathin Conductor Enabling Efficient IR Light CO2 Reduction.,"The concurrent transformation of carbon dioxide and water into hydrocarbons and oxygen by low-photonic-energy IR light still represents a huge challenge. Here, we design an ultrathin conductor system, in which the special partially occupied band serves as the mediator to simultaneously guarantee IR light harvesting and satisfy band-edge positions, while the ultrathin configuration improves charge separation rates and surface redox kinetics. Taking the low cost and earth-abundant CuS as an example, we first fabricate ultrathin CuS layers, where temperature-dependent resistivities, valence-band spectra, and theoretical calculations affirm their metallic nature. Synchrotron-radiation photoelectron and ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared spectra show that metallic CuS atomic layers could realize a new cooperative intraband-interband transition under IR light irradiation, where the generated electrons and holes could simultaneously involve the carbon dioxide reduction and water oxidation reactions. As a result, CuS atomic layers exhibit nearly 100% selective CO production with an evolution rate of 14.5 mumol g(-1) h(-1) under IR light irradiation, while the catalytic performance shows no obvious decay after a 96 h test. Briefly, benefiting from ultrahigh conductivity and a unique partially occupied band, abundant conductor materials such as conducting metal sulfides and metal nitrides hold great promise for applications as effective IR light responsive photocatalysts.",2
Contribution of Cotranslational Folding Defects to Membrane Protein Homeostasis.,"Membrane proteins are prone to misfolding and degradation within the cell, yet the nature of the conformational defects involved in this process remain poorly understood. The earliest stages of membrane protein folding are mediated by the Sec61 translocon, a molecular machine that facilitates the lateral partitioning of the polypeptide into the membrane. Proper membrane integration is an essential prerequisite for folding of the nascent chain. However, the marginal energetic drivers of this reaction suggest the translocon may operate with modest fidelity. In this work, we employed biophysical modeling in conjunction with quantitative biochemical measurements in order to evaluate the extent to which cotranslational folding defects influence membrane protein homeostasis. Protein engineering was employed to selectively perturb the topological energetics of human rhodopsin, and the expression and cellular trafficking of engineered variants were quantitatively compared. Our results reveal clear relationships between topological energetics and the efficiency of rhodopsin biogenesis, which appears to be limited by the propensity of a polar transmembrane domain to achieve its correct topological orientation. Though the polarity of this segment is functionally constrained, we find that its topology can be stabilized in a manner that enhances biogenesis without compromising the functional properties of rhodopsin. Furthermore, sequence alignments reveal this topological instability has been conserved throughout the course of evolution. These results suggest that topological defects significantly contribute to the inefficiency of membrane protein folding in the cell. Additionally, our findings suggest that the marginal stability of rhodopsin may represent an evolved trait.",2
Analysis of TiO2 Atomic Layer Deposition Surface Chemistry and Evidence of Propene Oligomerization Using Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy.,"Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of TiO2 was performed in tandem with in situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to monitor changes in the transient surface species across multiple ALD cycles. A self-assembled monolayer of 3-mercaptopropionic acid was used as a capture agent to ensure that nucleation of the titanium precursor (titanium tetraisopropoxide [TTIP]) occurs. Comparisons between the Raman spectra of the neat precursor and the SER spectra of the first ALD cycle of TiO2 reveal typical ligand exchange chemistry taking place, with self-limiting behavior and intact isopropoxide ligands. However, subsequent cycles show drastically different chemistry, with no isopropoxide ligands remaining at any point during the second and third cycles. Continuous exposure of either TTIP or isopropyl alcohol after the first cycle shows unlimited chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-type growth. Comparisons with alternative precursors (aluminum isopropoxide, titanium tert-butoxide, and titanium propoxide) and DFT calculations reveal that, for the TTIP precursor, isolated TiO2 sites play a role in the dehydration of off-gassing isopropyl alcohol. The resulting propene then undergoes oligomerization into six-carbon olefins before polymerizing into indistinguishable carbon products that accumulate on the surface. The emergence of the dehydration chemistry is expected to be exclusively the result of these isolated TiO2 sites and, as such, is expected to occur on other surfaces where TiO2 ALD is feasible. This work showcases how seemingly innocuous ALD can evolve into a CVD process when the products can participate in various side reactions with newly made surface sites.",2
Discrete Dimers of Redox-Active and Fluorescent Perylene Diimide-Based Rigid Isosceles Triangles in the Solid State.,"The development of rigid covalent chiroptical organic materials, with multiple, readily available redox states, which exhibit high photoluminescence, is of particular importance in relation to both organic electronics and photonics. The chemically stable, thermally robust, and redox-active perylene diimide (PDI) fluorophores have received ever-increasing attention owing to their excellent fluorescence quantum yields in solution. Planar PDI derivatives, however, generally suffer from aggregation-caused emission quenching in the solid state. Herein, we report on the design and synthesis of two chiral isosceles triangles, wherein one PDI fluorophore and two pyromellitic diimide (PMDI) or naphthalene diimide (NDI) units are arranged in a rigid cyclic triangular geometry. The optical, electronic, and magnetic properties of the rigid isosceles triangles are fully characterized by a combination of optical spectroscopies, X-ray diffraction (XRD), cyclic voltammetry, and computational modeling techniques. Single-crystal XRD analysis shows that both isosceles triangles form discrete, nearly cofacial PDI-PDI pi-dimers in the solid state. While the triangles exhibit fluorescence quantum yields of almost unity in solution, the dimers in the solid state exhibit very weak-yet at least an order of magnitude higher-excimer fluorescence yield in comparison with the almost completely quenched fluorescence of a reference PDI. The triangle containing both NDI and PDI subunits shows superior intramolecular energy transfer from the lowest excited singlet state of the NDI to that of the PDI subunit. Cyclic voltammetry suggests that both isosceles triangles exhibit multiple, easily accessible, and reversible redox states. Applications beckon in arenas related to molecular optoelectronic devices.",2
Metal Oxide/(oxy)hydroxide Overlayers as Hole Collectors and Oxygen-Evolution Catalysts on Water-Splitting Photoanodes.,"Solar water splitting provides a mechanism to convert and store solar energy in the form of stable chemical bonds. Water-splitting systems often include semiconductor photoanodes, such as n-Fe2O3 and n-BiVO4, which use photogenerated holes to oxidize water. These photoanodes often exhibit improved performance when coated with metal-oxide/(oxy)hydroxide overlayers that are catalytic for the water-oxidation reaction. The mechanism for this improvement, however, remains a controversial topic. This is, in part, due to a lack of experimental techniques that are able to directly track the flow of photogenerated holes in such multicomponent systems. In this Perspective, we illustrate how this issue can be addressed by using a second working electrode to make direct current/voltage measurements on the catalytic overlayer during operation in a photoelectrochemical cell. We discuss examples where the second working electrode is a thin metallic film deposited on the catalyst layer, as well as where it is the tip of a conducting atomic-force-microscopy probe. In applying these techniques to multiple semiconductors (Fe2O3, BiVO4, Si) paired with various metal-(oxy)hydroxide overlayers (e.g., Ni(Fe)O xH y and CoO xH y), we found in all cases investigated that the overlayers collect photogenerated holes from the semiconductor, charging to potentials sufficient to drive water oxidation. The overlayers studied thus form charge-separating heterojunctions with the semiconductor as well as serve as water-oxidation catalysts.",2
Competition between Normative and Drug-Induced Virus Self-Assembly Observed with Single-Particle Methods.,"Disruption of virus capsid assembly has compelling antiviral potential that has been applied to hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV core protein assembly can be modulated by heteroaryldihydropyrimidines (HAPs), and such molecules are collectively termed core protein allosteric modulators (CpAMs). Although the antiviral effects of CpAMs are acknowledged, the mechanism of action remains an open question. Challenging aspects of characterizing misdirected assembly are the large size and nonuniform nature of the final particles. In this study of HBV assembly, we observed a competition between normative and CpAM-induced aberrant assembly with electron microscopy and resistive-pulse sensing on nanofluidic devices. This competition was a function of the strength of the association energy between individual core proteins, which is proportional to ionic strength. At strong association energy, assembly reactions primarily yielded morphologically normal HBV capsids, despite the presence of HAP-TAMRA. At weak association energy, HAP-TAMRA led to increased assembly product size and disrupted morphology. The smallest particles were T = 4 icosahedra, whereas the larger particles were defective spheres, ellipsoids, and bacilliform cylinders, with regions of T = 4 geometry interspersed with flat regions. Deviation from spherical geometry progressively increased with particle size, which is consistent with the interpretation of a competition between two alternative assembly pathways.",2
Chemical Requirement for Extracting Energetic Charge Carriers from Plasmonic Metal Nanoparticles to Perform Electron-Transfer Reactions.,"Performing electron-transfer reactions on metal nanoparticles requires separation of charge carriers at the nanoparticle and their transfer to the reacting molecules. Inducing these reactions using light is challenging due to the exceedingly short lifetimes of energetic charge carriers formed in metal nanoparticles under light illumination. The results described here show that certain conditions must be met to drive these electron-transfer reactions on plasmonic nanoparticles. One critical requirement is that the process of electronic excitation takes place at the nanoparticle/molecule interface. This is accomplished by high plasmonic electric fields at the surface of plasmonic nanoparticles. Furthermore, it is also evident from our study that the electron (or hole)-donating capacity of the hole (or electron) scavengers needs to be high enough to allow for the extraction of holes (or electrons) from the nanoparticle/molecule complex, therefore completing the catalytic cycle. We discuss these findings through a case study of the conversion of methylene blue (MB) into a reduced MB ion radical on the surface of plasmonic Ag and Ag-Pt core-shell nanoparticles. To directly monitor the reduction reaction of MB on the nanoparticle surfaces, we have used time-dependent in situ surface-enhanced Raman scattering measurement, which also informs us about the underlying mechanistic details of plasmon-driven charge transfer.",2
Chemical Interventions for the Opioid Crisis: Key Advances and Remaining Challenges.,"The present United States opioid crisis requires urgent and innovative scientific intervention. This perspective highlights a role for the chemical sciences by expounding upon three key research areas identified as priorities by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). Specifically, important advances in chemical interventions for overdose reversal, strategies for opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment, including immunopharmacotherapies, and next-generation alternatives for pain management will be discussed. Ultimately, progress made will be presented in light of remaining challenges for the field.",2
"Heterologous and in Vitro Reconstitution of Fuscanodin, a Lasso Peptide from Thermobifida fusca.","Lasso peptides are a class of ribosomally derived natural products typified by their threaded rotaxane structure. The conversion of a linear precursor peptide into a lasso peptide structure requires two enzymatic activities: cleavage of the precursor via a cysteine protease and cyclization via isopeptide bond formation. In vitro studies of lasso peptide enzymology have been hampered by difficulties in obtaining pure, soluble enzymes. We reasoned that thermophilic bacteria would be a good source for well-behaved lasso peptide biosynthetic enzymes. The genome of the thermophilic actinobacterium Thermobifida fusca encodes for a lasso peptide with an unprecedented Trp residue at its N-terminus, a peptide we have named fuscanodin. Here we reconstitute fuscanodin biosynthesis in vitro with purified components, establishing a minimal fuscanodin synthetase. These experiments have allowed us to probe the kinetics of lasso peptide biosynthesis for the first time, and we report initial rates of fuscanodin biosynthesis. The fuscanodin biosynthetic enzymes are insensitive to substrate concentration and operate in a near single-turnover regime in vitro. While lasso peptides are often touted for their stability to both chaotropic and thermal challenges, fuscanodin is found to undergo a conformational change consistent with lasso peptide unthreading in organic solvents at room temperature.",2
Regiochemistry of Thiolate for Selenolate Ligand Exchange on Gold Clusters.,"Ligand exchange is a fundamental reaction of metal nanoparticles. Multiple symmetry and kinetic exchange environments are observed for thiolate protected gold nanoparticles, but the correlation between these is unclear. Structural study of ligand exchange on chalcogenide passivated gold clusters has so-far revealed the locations of 10% or fewer of incoming ligands. In a set of 13 crystal structures, we reveal the locations of up to 17 ligands of the 18 ligands in thiolate for selenolate exchanged Au25(SeR)18- x(SR) x clusters. Overall, we see a distinct preference for the locations of thiolate and selenolate ligands that emerges over time. This most-comprehensive to-date structural study of ligand exchange on gold clusters evidences a structural basis for exchange of solvated ligands, exchange of ligands between clusters, and a net reaction that amounts to translation of ligands on the cluster surface.",2
Fluorescence Enhancement of a Microbial Rhodopsin via Electronic Reprogramming.,"The engineering of microbial rhodopsins with enhanced fluorescence is of great importance in the expanding field of optogenetics. Here we report the discovery of two mutants (W76S/Y179F and L83Q) of a sensory rhodopsin from the cyanobacterium Anabaena PCC7120 with opposite fluorescence behavior. In fact, while W76S/Y179F displays, with respect to the wild-type protein, a nearly 10-fold increase in red-light emission, the second is not emissive. Thus, the W76S/Y179F, L83Q pair offers an unprecedented opportunity for the investigation of fluorescence enhancement in microbial rhodopsins, which is pursued by combining transient absorption spectroscopy and multiconfigurational quantum chemistry. The results of such an investigation point to an isomerization-blocking electronic effect as the direct cause of instantaneous (subpicosecond) fluorescence enhancement.",2
3D Covalent Organic Frameworks of Interlocking 1D Square Ribbons.,"A new mode of mechanical entanglement in extended structures is described where 1D organic ribbons of corner-sharing squares are mutually interlocked to form 3D woven covalent organic framework-500, COF-500. Reaction of aldehyde-functionalized tetrahedral Cu(PDB)2PO2Ph2 complexes (PDB = 4,4'-(1,10-phenanthroline-2,9-diyl)dibenzaldehyde) with rectangular tetratopic ETTBA (4',4''',4''''',4'''''''-(ethene-1,1,2,2-tetrayl)tetrakis([1,1'-biphenyl]-4-amine )) linkers through imine condensation, yielded a crystalline porous metalated COF, COF-500-Cu, with pts topology. Upon removal of the Cu(I) ions, the individual 1D square ribbons in the demetalated form (COF-500) are held together only by mechanical interlocking of rings, which allows their collective movement to produce a narrow-pore form, as evidenced by nitrogen adsorption and solid-state photoluminescence studies. When exposed to tetrahydrofuran vapor, the interlocking ribbons can dynamically move away from each other to reopen up the structure. The structural integrity of COF-500 is maintained during its dynamics because the constituent square ribbons cannot part company due to spatial confinement imparted by their interlocking nature.",2
Transition of Metastable Cross-alpha Crystals into Cross-beta Fibrils by beta-Turn Flipping.,"The ensemble of native, folded state was once considered to represent the global energy minimum of a given protein sequence. More recently, the discovery of the cross-beta amyloid state revealed that deeper energy minima exist, often associated with pathogenic, fibrillar deposits, when the concentration of proteins reaches a critical value. Fortunately, a sizable energy barrier impedes the conversion from native to pathogenic states. However, little is known about the structure of the related transition state. In addition, there are indications of polymorphism in the amyloidogenic process. Here, we report the first evidence of the conversion of metastable cross-alpha-helical crystals to thermodynamically stable cross-beta-sheet-like fibrils by a de novo designed heptapeptide. Furthermore, for the first time, we demonstrate at atomic resolution that the flip of a peptide plane from a type I to a type II' turn facilitates transformation to cross-beta structure and assembly of a dry steric zipper. This study establishes the potential of a peptide turn, a common protein secondary structure, to serve as a principal gatekeeper between a native metastable folded state and the amyloid state.",2
Uranyl Functionalization Mediated by Redox-Active Ligands: Generation of O-C Bonds via Acylation.,"A series of uranyl compounds with the redox-active iminoquinone ligand have been synthesized, and their electronic structures elucidated using multinuclear NMR, EPR, electronic absorption spectroscopies, SQUID magnetometry, and X-ray crystallography. Characterization and analysis of the iminoquinone (iq(0)) complex, ((dipp)iq)UO2(OTf)2THF (1-iq), the iminosemiquinone (isq(1-)) complex, ((dipp)isq)2UO2THF (2-isq), and the amidophenolate (ap(2-)) complex, [((dipp)ap)2UO2THF][K(18-crown-6)(THF)2]2(3-ap crown) show that reduction events are ligand-based, with the uranium center remaining in the hexavalent state. Reactivity of 2-isq with B-chlorocatecholborane or pivaloyl chloride leads to U-Ouranyl bond scission and reduction of U(VI) to U(IV) concomitant with ligand oxidation along with organic byproducts. (18)O isotopic labeling experiments along with IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and multinuclear NMR spectroscopy confirm that the organic byproducts contain oxygen atoms which originate from U-Ouranyl bond activation.",2
Intersystem crossing in the exit channel.,"Intersystem crossing plays an important role in photochemistry. It is understood to be efficient when heavy atoms are present due to strong spin-orbit coupling, or when strongly bound long-lived complexes are formed that increase the chance of finding the singlet-triplet intersection seam. Here we present evidence for a different intersystem crossing mechanism in the bimolecular reaction of O((3)P) with alkylamines. In crossed-beam experiments, product velocity-flux maps are measured for aminoalkyl radicals produced from H abstraction from the methyl group, which also gives OH radicals as co-fragments. The low translational-energy release and isotropic angular distributions of the products indicate that such reactions undergo the formation of a complex before OH and aminoalkyl are produced. However, there is no well on the triplet potential energy surface that could support such a complex. Multi-reference ab initio calculations suggest, instead, that intersystem crossing occurs in the exit-channel region due to the long-range dipole-dipole interaction between the nascent radical product pair coupled with the vanishing singlet-triplet splitting at long range. Intersystem crossing then leads to a deep hydroxylamine well before OH elimination.",2
Rapamycin-inspired macrocycles with new target specificity.,"Rapamycin and FK506 are macrocyclic natural products with an extraordinary mode of action, in which they form binary complexes with FK506-binding protein (FKBP) through a shared FKBP-binding domain before forming ternary complexes with their respective targets, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and calcineurin, respectively. Inspired by this, we sought to build a rapamycin-like macromolecule library to target new cellular proteins by replacing the effector domain of rapamycin with a combinatorial library of oligopeptides. We developed a robust macrocyclization method using ring-closing metathesis and synthesized a 45,000-compound library of hybrid macrocycles (named rapafucins) using optimized FKBP-binding domains. Screening of the rapafucin library in human cells led to the discovery of rapadocin, an inhibitor of nucleoside uptake. Rapadocin is a potent, isoform-specific and FKBP-dependent inhibitor of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 and is efficacious in an animal model of kidney ischaemia reperfusion injury. Together, these results demonstrate that rapafucins are a new class of chemical probes and drug leads that can expand the repertoire of protein targets well beyond mTOR and calcineurin.",2
Streamlining the chemoenzymatic synthesis of complex N-glycans by a stop and go strategy.,"Contemporary chemoenzymatic approaches can provide highly complex multi-antennary N-linked glycans. These procedures are, however, very demanding and typically involve as many as 100 chemical steps to prepare advanced intermediates that can be diversified by glycosyltransferases in a branch-selective manner to give asymmetrical structures commonly found in nature. Only highly specialized laboratories can perform such syntheses, which greatly hampers progress in glycoscience. Here we describe a biomimetic approach in which a readily available bi-antennary glycopeptide can be converted in ten or fewer chemical and enzymatic steps into multi-antennary N-glycans that at each arm can be uniquely extended by glycosyltransferases to give access to highly complex asymmetrically branched N-glycans. A key feature of our approach is the installation of additional branching points using recombinant MGAT4 and MGAT5 in combination with unnatural sugar donors. At an appropriate point in the enzymatic synthesis, the unnatural monosaccharides can be converted into their natural counterpart, allowing each arm to be elaborated into a unique appendage.",2
Carbopalladation of C-C sigma-bonds enabled by strained boronate complexes.,"Transition-metal-catalysed cross-coupling reactions, particularly those mediated by palladium, are some of the most broadly used chemical transformations. The fundamental reaction steps of such cross-couplings typically include oxidative addition, transmetallation, carbopalladation of a pi-bond and/or reductive elimination. Herein, we describe an unprecedented fundamental reaction step: a C-C sigma-bond carbopalladation. Specifically, an aryl palladium(II) complex interacts with a sigma-bond of a strained bicyclo[1.1.0]butyl boronate complex to enable addition of the aryl palladium(II) species and an organoboronic ester substituent across a C-C sigma-bond. The overall process couples readily available aryl triflates and organoboronic esters across a cyclobutane unit with total diastereocontrol. The pharmaceutically relevant 1,1,3-trisubstituted cyclobutane products are decorated with an array of modular building blocks, including a boronic ester that can be readily derivatized.",2
Hybrid Silver Nanocubes for Improved Plasmon-Enhanced Singlet Oxygen Production and Inactivation of Bacteria.,"Plasmonic nanoparticles can strongly interact with adjacent photosensitizer molecules, resulting in a significant alteration of their singlet oxygen ((1)O2) production. In this work, we report the next generation of metal-enhanced (1)O2 nanoplatforms exploiting the lightning rod effect, or plasmon hot spots, in anisotropic (nonspherical) metal nanoparticles. We describe the synthesis of Rose Bengal-decorated silica-coated silver nanocubes (Ag@SiO2-RB NCs) with silica shell thicknesses ranging from 5 to 50 nm based on an optimized protocol yielding highly homogeneous Ag NCs. Steady-state and time-resolved (1)O2 measurements demonstrate not only the silica shell thickness dependence on the metal-enhanced (1)O2 production phenomenon but also the superiority of this next generation of nanoplatforms. A maximum enhancement of (1)O2 of approximately 12-fold is observed with a 10 nm silica shell, which is among the largest (1)O2 production metal enhancement factors ever reported for a colloidal suspension of nanoparticles. Finally, the Ag@SiO2-RB NCs were benchmarked against the Ag@SiO2-RB nanospheres previously reported by our group, and the superior (1)O2 production of Ag@SiO2-RB NCs resulted in improved antimicrobial activities in photodynamic inactivation experiments using both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria model strains.",2
Schottky Barrier Induced Coupled Interface of Electron-Rich N-Doped Carbon and Electron-Deficient Cu: In-Built Lewis Acid-Base Pairs for Highly Efficient CO2 Fixation.,"Highly efficient fixation of CO2 for the synthesis of useful organic carbonates has drawn much attention. The design of sustainable Lewis acid-base pairs, which has mainly relied on expensive organic ligands, is the key challenge in the activation of the substrate and CO2 molecule. Here, we report the application of Mott-Schottky type nanohybrids composed of electron-deficient Cu and electron-rich N-doped carbon for CO2 fixation. A ligand-free and additive-free method was used to boost the basicity of the carbon supports and the acidity of Cu by increasing the Schottky barrier at their boundary, mimicking the beneficial function of organic ligands acting as the Lewis acid and base in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) or polymers and simultaneously avoiding the possible deactivation associated with the necessary stability of a heterogeneous catalyst. The optimal Cu/NC-0.5 catalyst exhibited a remarkably high turnover frequency (TOF) value of 615 h(-1) at 80 degrees C, which is 10 times higher than that of the state-of-the-art metal-based heterogeneous catalysts in the literature.",2
Selective Ruthenium-Catalyzed Transformation of Carbon Dioxide: An Alternative Approach toward Formaldehyde.,"Formaldehyde is an important precursor to numerous industrial processes and is produced in multimillion ton scale every year by catalytic oxidation of methanol in an energetically unfavorable and atom-inefficient industrial process. In this work, we present a highly selective one-step synthesis of a formaldehyde derivative starting from carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas utilizing a homogeneous ruthenium catalyst. Here, formaldehyde is obtained as dimethoxymethane, its dimethyl acetal, by selective reduction of carbon dioxide at moderate temperatures (90 degrees C) and partial pressures (90 bar H2/20 bar CO2) in the presence of methanol. Besides the desired product, only methyl formate is formed, which can be transformed to dimethoxymethane in a consecutive catalytic step. By comprehensive screening of the catalytic system, maximum turnover numbers of 786 for dimethoxymethane and 1290 for methyl formate were achieved with remarkable selectivities of over 90% for dimethoxymethane.",2
Charge Transfer from Upconverting Nanocrystals to Semiconducting Electrodes: Optimizing Thermodynamic Outputs by Electronic Energy Transfer.,"Light-harvesting inorganic nanocrystals play an important role in emerging solar energy conversion and optoelectronic devices. We describe here a strategy for a new family of photoelectrodes with upconverting nanocrystal assemblies as the photosensitizer. The assemblies consist of oleic acid-capped cadmium selenide (CdSe) nanocrystals that coordinate directly onto a layer of surface-bound, carboxylic acid-derivatized anthracenes through displacement of the oleic acid capping ligands. Steady-state emission and transient absorption measurements show that the upconverting nanocrystal assemblies, selectively excited by green light, generate singlet excitons that enable efficient charge injection into both the conduction band of TiO2 at the photoanode and the valence band of NiO at the photocathode. The singlet excitons form by sensitized triplet-triplet annihilation within the compact layer of anthracenes on the electrode surfaces. Density of state analysis reveals that the electronic coupling between the anthracene singlet excited states and the oxides provides a thermodynamic basis for light-induced charge transfer. The interplay between the excited-state populations at the surface-bound molecules and the assembled nanocrystals presents new design rules that can potentially overcome the limitations of previous dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells for catalytic applications.",2
"Nickel-Catalyzed 1,2-Diarylation of Simple Alkenyl Amides.","A nickel-catalyzed conjunctive cross-coupling of simple alkenyl amides with aryl iodides and aryl boronic esters is reported. The reaction is enabled by an electron-deficient olefin (EDO) ligand, dimethyl fumarate, and delivers the desired 1,2-diarylated products with excellent regiocontrol. Under optimized conditions, a wide range of amides derived from 3-butenoic acid, 4-pentenoic acid, and allyl amine are compatible substrates. This method represents the first example of regiocontrolled 1,2-diarylation directed by a native amide functional group. Computational analysis sheds light on the potential substrate binding mode and the role of the EDO ligand in the reductive elimination step.",2
"Empowerment of 15-Lipoxygenase Catalytic Competence in Selective Oxidation of Membrane ETE-PE to Ferroptotic Death Signals, HpETE-PE.","sn2-15-Hydroperoxy-eicasotetraenoyl-phosphatidylethanolamines ( sn2-15-HpETE-PE) generated by mammalian 15-lipoxygenase/phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein-1 (15-LO/PEBP1) complex is a death signal in a recently identified type of programmed cell demise, ferroptosis. How the enzymatic complex selects sn2-ETE-PE as the substrate among 1 of approximately 100 total oxidizable membrane PUFA phospholipids is a central, yet unresolved question. To unearth the highly selective and specific mechanisms of catalytic competence, we used a combination of redox lipidomics, mutational and computational structural analysis to show they stem from (i) reactivity toward readily accessible hexagonally organized membrane sn2-ETE-PEs, (ii) relative preponderance of sn2-ETE-PE species vs other sn2-ETE-PLs, and (iii) allosteric modification of the enzyme in the complex with PEBP1. This emphasizes the role of enzymatic vs random stochastic free radical reactions in ferroptotic death signaling.",2
"Complexation Chemistry in N,N-Dimethylformamide-Based Molecular Inks for Chalcogenide Semiconductors and Photovoltaic Devices.","Molecular inks based on dimethyl sulfoxide, thiourea (TU), and metal salts have been used to form high optoelectronic quality semiconductors and have led to high power conversion efficiencies for solution-processed photovoltaic devices for Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTS), Cu2Zn(Ge,Sn)(S,Se)4 (CZGTS), CuIn(S,Se)2 (CIS), and Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGS). However, several metal species of interest, including Ag(I), In(III), Ge(II), and Ge(IV), either have low solubility (requiring dilute inks) or lead to precipitation or gelation. Here, we demonstrate that the combination of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and TU has the remarkable ability to form intermediate-stability acid-base complexes with a wide number of metal chloride Lewis acids (CuCl, AgCl, ZnCl2, InCl3, GaCl3, SnCl4, GeCl4, and SeCl4), to give high-concentration stable molecular inks. Using calorimetry, Raman spectroscopy, and solubility experiments, we reveal the important role of chloride transfer and TU to stabilize metal cations in DMF. Methylation of TU is used to vary the strength of the Lewis basicity and demonstrate that the strength of the TU-metal chloride complex formed after DMF evaporation is critical to prevent volatilization of metal containing species. Further, we formulated a sulfur-free molecular ink which was used to deposit crystalline CuInSe2 without selenization that sustains high quasi-Fermi level splitting under constant illumination. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of the DMF-TU molecular ink chemistry to lead to high-photovoltaic power conversion efficiencies and high-open-circuit voltages for solution-processed CIS and CZGTS with power conversion efficiencies of 13.4% and 11.0% and Voc/ Voc,SQ of 67% and 63%, respectively.",2
"Enhancement of Antiaromatic Character via Additional Benzoannulation into Dibenzo[ a, f]pentalene: Syntheses and Properties of Benzo[ a]naphtho[2,1- f]pentalene and Dinaphtho[2,1- a, f]pentalene.","Understanding the structure-property relationships in antiaromatic molecules is crucial for controlling their electronic properties and designing new organic optoelectronic materials. Dibenzo[ a, f]pentalene, a structural isomer of dibenzopentalene, displays open-shell and antiaromatic character harmonization, which is not shared by the well-known isomer, dibenzo[ a, e]pentalene. The next questions of interest concern the topological effects of the pi-extension on the harmonization of the open-shell and antiaromatic character in the dibenzo[ a, f]pentalene pi-system. Herein, we describe the synthesis and characterization of the pi-extended (bis)annulated analogues, benzo[ a]naphtho[2,1- f]pentalene 4 and dinaphtho[2,1- a, f]pentalene 5. The solid-state structures and the magnetic and optoelectronic properties characterized these pi-extended analogues as closed-shell antiaromatic molecules, in sharp contrast with dibenzo[ a, f]pentalene 2. In these pi-extended analogues, the open-shell character was annihilated whereas the antiaromatic character was retained. The fusion of additional hexagons into 2 shifted the main 4npi-conjugated circuit from a global to a local system. Further investigations into magnetic ring currents using gauge-including magnetically induced current (GIMIC) calculations suggested that an enhanced local paratropic ring current appeared in the pentalene core of 5. The preservation of the benzenoid character in the additionally fused hexagons confined the paratropicity to the pentalene subunit, and the inherent presence of an o-quinoidal structure highlighted the 4npi-electron delocalization on the pentalene unit. The antiaromaticity of 4 and 5 was characterized by their small HOMO-LUMO energy gap. Both experimental and computational results demonstrated that the [ a, f]-type ring fusion of the pentalene core effectively enhanced the antiaromatic character compared with the [ a, e]-type ring fusion in the reported bisannulated[ a, e]pentalenes. The findings of this study could potentially be used for the rational design of optoelectronic devices based on novel antiaromatic molecules.",2
Photochemical Resolution of a Thermally Inert Cyclometalated Ru(phbpy)(N-N)(Sulfoxide)(+) Complex.,"In this work a photosubstitution strategy is presented that can be used for the isolation of chiral organometallic complexes. A series of five cyclometalated complexes Ru(phbpy)(N-N)(DMSO-kappaS)](PF6) ([1]PF6-[5]PF6) were synthesized and characterized, where Hphbpy = 6'-phenyl-2,2'-bipyridyl, and N-N = bpy (2,2'-bipyridine), phen (1,10-phenanthroline), dpq (pyrazino[2,3- f][1,10]phenanthroline), dppz (dipyrido[3,2- a:2',3'- c]phenazine, or dppn (benzo[ i]dipyrido[3,2- a,2',3'- c]phenazine), respectively. Due to the asymmetry of the cyclometalated phbpy(-) ligand, the corresponding [Ru(phbpy)(N-N)(DMSO-kappaS)](+)complexes are chiral. The exceptional thermal inertness of the Ru-S bond made chiral resolution of these complexes by thermal ligand exchange impossible. However, photosubstitution by visible light irradiation in acetonitrile was possible for three of the five complexes ([1]PF6-[3]PF6). Further thermal coordination of the chiral sulfoxide ( R)-methyl p-tolylsulfoxide to the photoproduct [Ru(phbpy)(phen)(NCMe)]PF6, followed by reverse phase HPLC, led to the separation and characterization of the two diastereoisomers of [Ru(phbpy)(phen)(MeSO(C7H7))]PF6, thus providing a new photochemical approach toward the synthesis of chiral cyclometalated ruthenium(II) complexes. Full photochemical, electrochemical, and frontier orbital characterization of the cyclometalated complexes [1]PF6-[5]PF6 was performed to explain why [4]PF6 and [5]PF6 are photochemically inert while [1]PF6-[3]PF6 perform selective photosubstitution.",2
Free Amino Acid Recognition: A Bisbinaphthyl-Based Fluorescent Probe with High Enantioselectivity.,"A novel fluorescent probe based on a bisbinaphthyl structure has been designed and synthesized. This compound in combination with Zn(II) has exhibited highly enantioselective fluorescence enhancement with 13 common free amino acids. For example, its enantiomeric fluorescent enhancement ratios ( ef or Delta IL/Delta ID) in the presence of the following amino acids are extremely high: 177 for valine, 199 for methionine, 186 for phenylalanine, 118 for leucine, and 89 for alanine. The observed high enantioselectivity and the extent of the substrate scope are unprecedented in the fluorescent recognition of free amino acids. This fluorescent probe can be applied to determine the enantiomeric composition of the structurally diverse chiral amino acids. NMR and mass spectroscopic investigations have provided clues to elucidate the observed high enantioselectivity.",2
Molecular Design Strategy to Construct the Near-Infrared Fluorescent Probe for Selectively Sensing Human Cytochrome P450 2J2.,"Cytochrome P450 2J2 (CYP2J2), a key enzyme responsible for oxidative metabolism of various xenobiotics and endogenous compounds, participates in a diverse array of physiological and pathological processes in humans. Its biological role in tumorigenesis and cancer diagnosis remains poorly understood, owing to the lack of molecular tools suitable for real-time monitoring CYP2J2 in complex biological systems. Using molecular design principles, we were able to modify the distance between the catalytic unit and metabolic recognition moiety, allowing us to develop a CYP2J2 selective fluorescent probe using a near-infrared fluorophore ( E)-2-(2-(6-hydroxy-2, 3-dihydro-1 H-xanthen-4-yl)vinyl)-3,3-dimethyl-1-propyl-3 H-indol-1-ium iodide (HXPI). To improve the reactivity and isoform specificity, a self-immolative linker was introduced to the HXPI derivatives in order to better fit the narrow substrate channel of CYP2J2, the modification effectively shortened the spatial distance between the metabolic moiety ( O-alkyl group) and catalytic center of CYP2J2. After screening a panel of O-alkylated HXPI derivatives, BnXPI displayed the best combination of specificity, sensitivity and applicability for detecting CYP2J2 in vitro and in vivo. Upon O-demethylation by CYP2J2, a self-immolative reaction occurred spontaneously via 1,6-elimination of p-hydroxybenzyl resulting in the release of HXPI. Allowing BnXPI to be successfully used to monitor CYP2J2 activity in real-time for various living systems including cells, tumor tissues, and tumor-bearing animals. In summary, our practical strategy could help the development of a highly specific and broadly applicable tool for monitoring CYP2J2, which offers great promise for exploring the biological functions of CYP2J2 in tumorigenesis.",2
Total Enzyme Syntheses of Napyradiomycins A1 and B1.,"The biosynthetic route to the napyradiomycin family of bacterial meroterpenoids has been fully described 32 years following their original isolation and 11 years after their gene cluster discovery. The antimicrobial and cytotoxic natural products napyradiomycins A1 and B1 are produced using three organic substrates (1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate, and geranyl pyrophosphate), and catalysis via five enzymes: two aromatic prenyltransferases (NapT8 and T9); and three vanadium dependent haloperoxidase (VHPO) homologues (NapH1, H3, and H4). Building upon the previous characterization of NapH1, H3, and T8, we herein describe the initial (NapT9, H1) and final (NapH4) steps required for napyradiomycin construction. This remarkably streamlined biosynthesis highlights the utility of VHPO enzymology in complex natural product generation, as NapH4 efficiently performs a unique chloronium-induced terpenoid cyclization to establish two stereocenters and a new carbon-carbon bond, and dual-acting NapH1 catalyzes chlorination and etherification reactions at two distinct stages of the pathway. Moreover, we employed recombinant napyradiomycin biosynthetic enzymes to chemoenzymatically synthesize milligram quantities in one pot in 1 day. This method represents a viable enantioselective approach to produce complex halogenated metabolites, like napyradiomycin B1, that have yet to be chemically synthesized.",2
Bioinspired Metal-Organic Framework Catalysts for Selective Methane Oxidation to Methanol.,"Particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO) is an enzyme that oxidizes methane to methanol with high activity and selectivity. Limited success has been achieved in incorporating biologically relevant ligands for the formation of such active site in a synthetic system. Here, we report the design and synthesis of metal-organic framework (MOF) catalysts inspired by pMMO for selective methane oxidation to methanol. By judicious selection of a framework with appropriate topology and chemical functionality, MOF-808 was used to postsynthetically install ligands bearing imidazole units for subsequent metalation with Cu(I) in the presence of dioxygen. The catalysts show high selectivity for methane oxidation to methanol under isothermal conditions at 150 degrees C. Combined spectroscopies and density functional theory calculations suggest bis(mu-oxo) dicopper species as probable active site of the catalysts.",2
"High-Efficiency, Hysteresis-Less, UV-Stable Perovskite Solar Cells with Cascade ZnO-ZnS Electron Transport Layer.","Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have reached certified efficiencies of up to 23.7% but suffered from frailness and instability when exposed to ambient atmosphere. Zinc oxide (ZnO), when used as electron transport layer (ETL) on PSCs, gives rise to excellent electronic, optic, and photonic properties, yet the Lewis basic nature of ZnO surface leads to deprotonation of the perovskite layer, resulting in serious degradation of PSCs using ZnO as ETL. Here, we report a simple but effective strategy to convert ZnO surface into ZnS at the ZnO/perovskite interface by sulfidation. The sulfide on ZnO-ZnS surface binds strongly with Pb(2+) and creates a novel pathway of electron transport to accelerate electron transfer and reduce interfacial charge recombination, yielding a champion efficiency of 20.7% with improved stability and no appreciable hysteresis. The model devices modified with sulfide maintained 88% of their initial performance for 1000 h under storage condition and 87% for 500 h under UV radiation. ZnS is demonstrated to act as both a cascade ETL and a passivating layer for enhancing the performance of PSCs.",2
Deconvoluting Surface-Bound Quinone Proton Coupled Electron Transfer in Unbuffered Solutions: Toward a Universal Voltammetric pH Electrode.,"While quinone proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) under buffered conditions is well understood, the situation is more complicated in unbuffered aqueous solutions. With a view to producing a quinone-based voltammetric pH electrode that can function universally in both buffered and unbuffered solutions by following a two-electron (2e(-))/two-proton (2H(+)) Nernstian pathway over a wide pH range, the voltammetric response of strongly electronically coupled surface-bound quinones, directly integrated into a boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrode, is investigated. A laser ablation process enables integration of quinones into the BDD electrode surface with a high p Ka1 (first protonation state) and with controllable, very low surface coverages (as low as 2 orders of magnitude below monolayer coverage). Under buffered conditions, one wave results for all pH values, and the 2e(-)/2H(+) pathway is followed across the entire pH range. The measured ET rate constant values, from Laviron analysis, are also high, indicative of fast ET pathways. Under unbuffered conditions, one wave is again observed for all pH values; however, deviations from the buffered 2e(-)/2H(+) behavior are seen in the neutral region (pH 6-8). While 2e(-)/2H(+) transfer is maintained at all times, we attribute the observed deviation to local pH changes caused by the consumption and generation of protons at the electrode surface during the redox electrochemistry of the quinone. The associated proton fluxes generated at such sparse surface coverages are thought to be sufficiently high enough to prevent ET from occurring exclusively via a proton-independent route. By reducing surface coverage (down to approximately 4 x 10(-12) mol cm(-2); the limit of our laser ablation process) local pH changes can be reduced but are not eradicated completely. By moving to a pulsed voltammetric technique, where for each potential step protons consumed at the electrode are immediately replaced, it is possible, provided the surface coverage is low enough, to obtain a Nernstian 2e(-)/2H(+) response across a wide pH range in unbuffered solution.",2
Mechanical Deformation Distinguishes Tunneling Pathways in Molecular Junctions.,"Developing a clearer understanding of electron tunneling through molecules is a central challenge in molecular electronics. Here we demonstrate the use of mechanical stretching to distinguish orbital pathways that facilitate tunneling in molecular junctions. Our experiments employ junctions based on self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of homologous alkanethiols (C nT) and oligophenylene thiols (OPT n), which serve as prototypical examples of sigma-bonded and pi-bonded backbones, respectively. Surprisingly, molecular conductances ( Gmolecule) for stretched C nT SAMs have exactly the same length dependence as unstretched C nT SAMs in which molecular length is tuned by the number of CH2 repeat units, n. In contrast, OPT n SAMs exhibit a 10-fold-greater decrease in Gmolecule with molecular length for stretched versus unstretched cases. Experiment and theory show that these divergent results are explained by the dependence of the molecule-electrode electronic coupling Gamma on strain and the spatial extent of the principal orbital facilitating tunneling. In particular, differences in the strain sensitivity of Gamma versus the repeat-length ( n) sensitivity can be used to distinguish tunneling via delocalized orbitals versus localized orbitals. Angstrom-level tuning of interelectrode separation thus provides a strategy for examining the relationship between orbital localization or delocalization and electronic coupling in molecular junctions and therefore for distinguishing tunneling pathways.",2
"pi-Bond Character in Metal-Alkyl Compounds for C-H Activation: How, When, and Why?","C-H bond activation via sigma-bond metathesis is typically observed with transition-metal alkyl compounds in d(0) or d(0)f(n) electron configurations, e.g., biscyclopentadienyl metal alkyls. Related C-H activation processes are also observed for transition-metal alkyls with higher d-electron counts, such as W(II), Fe(II), or Ir(III). A sigma-bond metathesis mechanism has been proposed in all cases with a preference for an oxidative addition-reductive elimination pathway for Ir(III). Herein we show that, regardless of the exact mechanism, C-H activation with all of these compounds is associated with pi-character of the M-C bond, according to a detailed analysis of the (13)C NMR chemical shift tensor of the alpha-carbon. pi-Character is also a requirement for olefin insertion, indicating its similarity to sigma-bond metathesis. This observation explains the H2 response observed in d(0) olefin polymerization catalysts and underlines that sigma-bond metathesis, olefin insertion, and olefin metathesis are in fact isolobal reactions.",2
Visible-Light-Driven Conversion of CO2 to CH4 with an Organic Sensitizer and an Iron Porphyrin Catalyst.,"Using a phenoxazine-based organic photosensitizer and an iron porphyrin molecular catalyst, we demonstrated photochemical reduction of CO2 to CO and CH4 with turnover numbers (TONs) of 149 and 29, respectively, under visible-light irradiation (lambda > 435 nm) with a tertiary amine as sacrificial electron donor. This work is the first example of a molecular system using an earth-abundant metal catalyst and an organic dye to effect complete 8e(-)/8H(+) reduction of CO2 to CH4, as opposed to typical 2e(-)/2H(+) products of CO or formic acid. The catalytic system continuously produced methane even after prolonged irradiation up to 4 days. Using CO as the feedstock, the same reactive system was able to produce CH4 with 85% selectivity, 80 TON and a quantum yield of 0.47%. The redox properties of the organic photosensitizer and acidity of the proton source were shown to play a key role in driving the 8e(-)/8H(+) processes.",2
Endogenous Dynamic Nuclear Polarization for Natural Abundance (17)O and Lithium NMR in the Bulk of Inorganic Solids.,"In recent years magic angle spinning-dynamic nuclear polarization (MAS-DNP) has developed as an excellent approach for boosting the sensitivity of solid-state NMR (ssNMR) spectroscopy, thereby enabling the characterization of challenging systems in biology and chemistry. Most commonly, MAS-DNP is based on the use of nitroxide biradicals as polarizing agents. In materials science, since the use of nitroxides often limits the signal enhancement to the materials' surface and subsurface layers, there is need for hyperpolarization approaches which will provide sensitivity in the bulk of micron sized particles. Recently, an alternative in the form of paramagnetic metal ions has emerged. Here we demonstrate the remarkable efficacy of Mn(II) dopants, used as endogenous polarization agents for MAS-DNP, in enabling the detection of (17)O at a natural abundance of only 0.038%. Distinct oxygen sites are identified in the bulk of micron-sized crystals, including battery anode materials Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) and Li2ZnTi3O8, as well as the phosphor materials NaCaPO4 and MgAl2O4, all doped with Mn(II) ions. Density functional theory calculations are used to assign the resonances to specific oxygen environments in these phases. Depending on the Mn(II) dopant concentration, we obtain significant signal enhancement factors, 142 and 24, for (6)Li and (7)Li nuclei in LTO, respectively. We furthermore follow the changes in the (6,7)Li LTO resonances and determine their enhancement factors as a function of Mn(II) concentration. The results presented show that MAS-DNP from paramagnetic metal ion dopants provides an efficient approach for probing informative nuclei such as (17)O, despite their low gyromagnetic ratio and negligible abundance, without isotope enrichment.",2
Subwavelength Spatially Resolved Coordination Chemistry of Metal-Organic Framework Glass Blends.,"Microstructured metal-organic framework (MOF) glasses have been produced by combining two amorphous MOFs. However, the electronic structure of these materials has not been interrogated at the length scales of the chemical domains formed in these glasses. Here, we report a subwavelength spatially resolved physicochemical analysis of the electronic states at visible and UV energies in a blend of two zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), ZIF-4-Co and ZIF-62-Zn. By combining spectroscopy at visible and UV energies as well as at core ionization energies in electron energy loss spectroscopy in the scanning transmission electron microscope with density functional theory calculations, we show that domains less than 200 nm in size retain the electronic structure of the precursor crystalline ZIF phases. Prototypical signatures of coordination chemistry including d- d transitions in ZIF-4-Co are assigned and mapped with nanoscale precision.",2
(18)O Kinetic Isotope Effects Reveal an Associative Transition State for Phosphite Dehydrogenase Catalyzed Phosphoryl Transfer.,"Phosphite dehydrogenase (PTDH) catalyzes an unusual phosphoryl transfer reaction in which water displaces a hydride leaving group. Despite extensive effort, it remains unclear whether PTDH catalysis proceeds via an associative or dissociative mechanism. Here, primary (2)H and secondary (18)O kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) were determined and used together with computation to characterize the transition state (TS) catalyzed by a thermostable PTDH (17X-PTDH). The large, normal (18)O KIEs suggest an associative mechanism. Various transition state structures were computed within a model of the enzyme active site and (2)H and (18)O KIEs were predicted to evaluate the accuracy of each TS. This analysis suggests that 17X-PTDH catalyzes an associative process with little leaving group displacement and extensive nucleophilic participation. This tight TS is likely a consequence of the extremely poor leaving group requiring significant P-O bond formation to expel the hydride. This finding contrasts with the dissociative TSs in most phosphoryl transfer reactions from phosphate mono- and diesters.",2
Probing O-H Bonding through Proton Detected (1)H-(17)O Double Resonance Solid-State NMR Spectroscopy.,"The ubiquity of oxygen in organic, inorganic, and biological systems has stimulated the application and development of (17)O solid-state NMR spectroscopy as a probe of molecular structure and dynamics. Unfortunately, (17)O solid-state NMR experiments are often hindered by a combination of broad NMR signals and low sensitivity. Here, it is demonstrated that fast MAS and proton detection with the D-RINEPT pulse sequence can be generally applied to enhance the sensitivity and resolution of (17)O solid-state NMR experiments. Complete 2D (17)O --> (1)H D-RINEPT correlation NMR spectra were typically obtained in less than 10 h from less than 10 mg of material, with low to moderate (17)O enrichment (less than 20%). Two-dimensional (1)H-(17)O correlation solid-state NMR spectra allow overlapping oxygen sites to be resolved on the basis of proton chemical shifts or by varying the mixing time used for (1)H-(17)O magnetization transfer. In addition, J-resolved or separated local field (SLF) blocks can be incorporated into the D-RINEPT pulse sequence to allow the direct measurement of one-bond (1)H-(17)O scalar coupling constants ((1) JOH) or (1)H-(17)O dipolar couplings ( DOH), respectively, the latter of which can be used to infer (1)H-(17)O bond lengths. (1) JOH and DOH calculated from plane-wave density functional theory (DFT) show very good agreement with experimental values. Therefore, the 2D (1)H-(17)O correlation experiments, (1)H-(17)O scalar and dipolar couplings, and plane-wave DFT calculations provide a method to precisely determine proton positions relative to oxygen atoms. This capability opens new opportunities to probe interactions between oxygen and hydrogen in a variety of chemical systems.",2
Spontaneous Formation of Gating Lipid Domain in Uniform-Size Peptide Vesicles for Controlled Release.,"Hybrid assemblies composed of phospholipids and amphiphilic polymers have been investigated previously as a biomimetic model of biological cells. However, these studies focused on the functions of polymers in a sea of membrane lipids. Here, we prepared a highly stable peptide-lipid hybrid vesicle from a combination of an amphiphilic polypeptide and the phospholipid, 1,2-dimyristoyl- sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, with a mixing molar ratio of 1:1. The phase-separated structure of the hybrid vesicle was demonstrated by fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis. The lipid domain of the hybrid vesicle had a phase-transition temperature of 38 degrees C and allowed the permeation of a hydrophilic molecule, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled polyethylene glycol ( Mw: 2000), above 38 degrees C. The designed peptide-lipid hybrid vesicle and a ""lipidic gate"" are a promising tool for smart drug delivery.",2
Probing the Transformation of Boron Nitride Catalysts under Oxidative Dehydrogenation Conditions.,"Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNT) were recently reported as highly selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins in the gas phase. Previous studies revealed a substantial increase in surface oxygen content after exposure to ODH conditions (heating to ca. 500 degrees C under a flow of alkane and oxygen); however, the complexity of these materials has thus far precluded an in-depth understanding of the oxygenated surface species. In this contribution, we combine advanced NMR spectroscopy experiments with scanning electron microscopy and soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy to characterize the molecular structure of the oxygen functionalized phase that arises on h-BN and BNNT following catalytic testing for ODH of propane. The pristine BN materials are readily oxidized and hydrolyzed under ODH reaction conditions to yield a phase consisting of three-coordinate boron sites with variable numbers of hydroxyl and bridging oxide groups which is denoted B(OH) xO3- x (where x = 0-3). Evidence for this robust oxide phase revises previous literature hypotheses of hydroxylated BN edges as the active component on h-BN.",2
Cell-Penetrating Peptides Transport Noncovalently Linked Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Nanoparticles for Time-Resolved Luminescence Imaging.,"Luminescent probes and nanoparticles (NPs) with long excited state lifetimes are essential for time-resolved biological imaging. Generally, cell membranes are physiological barriers that could prevent the uptake of many unnatural compounds. It is still a big challenge to prepare biocompatible imaging agents with high cytomembrane permeability, especially for nonmetallic NPs with long-lived luminescence. Herein, an amphiphilic cell-penetrating peptide, F6G6(rR)3R2, was designed to transport hydrophobic fluorophores across cellular barriers. Three classical thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules, 4CzIPN, NAI-DPAC, and BTZ-DMAC, could self-assemble into well-dispersed NPs with F6G6(rR)3R2 in aqueous solution. These NPs showed low cytotoxicity and could penetrate membranes easily. Moreover, long-lived TADF enabled them to be used in time-resolved luminescence imaging in oxygenic environments. These findings greatly expanded the applications of cell-penetrating peptides for delivery of molecules and NPs by only noncovalent interactions, which were more flexible and easier than covalent modifications.",2
Bifunctional Biphenyl-2-ylphosphine Ligand Enables Tandem Gold-Catalyzed Propargylation of Aldehyde and Unexpected Cycloisomerization.,"Despite extensive studies in gold catalysis, sigma-allenylgold species have not been invoked as catalytic intermediates and their reactivities not studied. This work reports for the first time they are generated in situ and undergo nucleophilic addition to activated aldehydes in a bifunctional phosphine ligand-enabled gold catalysis. This development reveals a broad range of opportunities to achieve propargylic C-H functionalization for the first time under catalytic and mild conditions. The homopropargylic alcohols generated undergo ligand-enabled cycloisomerizations involving an unexpected silyl migration.",2
Radical Approach to Enzymatic beta-Thioether Bond Formation.,"Ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are an emerging class of natural products that harbor diverse chemical functionalities, usually introduced via the action of a small number of tailoring enzymes. We have been interested in RiPP biosynthetic gene clusters that encode unusual metalloenzymes, as these may install as yet unknown alterations. Using a new bioinformatic search strategy, we recently identified an array of unexplored RiPP gene clusters that are quorum sensing-regulated and contain one or more uncharacterized radical S-adenosylmethionine (RaS) metalloenzymes. Herein, we investigate the reaction of one of these RaS enzymes and find that it installs an intramolecular beta-thioether bond onto its substrate peptide by connecting a Cys-thiol group to the beta-carbon of an upstream Asn residue. The enzyme responsible, NxxcB, accepts several amino acids in place of Asn and introduces unnatural beta-thioether linkages at unactivated positions. This new transformation adds to the growing list of Nature's peptide macrocyclization strategies and expands the already impressive catalytic repertoire of the RaS enzyme superfamily.",2
Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Substituted Azepanes by Sequential Biocatalytic Reduction and Organolithium-Mediated Rearrangement.,"Enantioenriched 2-aryl azepanes and 2-arylbenzazepines were generated biocatalytically by asymmetric reductive amination using imine reductases or by deracemization using monoamine oxidases. The amines were converted to the corresponding N'-aryl ureas, which rearranged on treatment with base with stereospecific transfer of the aryl substituent to the 2-position of the heterocycle via a configurationally stable benzyllithium intermediate. The products are previously inaccessible enantioenriched 2,2-disubstituted azepanes and benzazepines.",2
"Cation Exchange Reactions in Layered Double Hydroxides Intercalated with Sulfate and Alkaline Cations (A(H2O)6)[M(2+)6Al3(OH)18(SO4)2].6H2O (M(2+) = Mn, Mg, Zn; A(+) = Li, Na, K).","Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with similar compositions to the minerals shigaite, natroglaucocerinite, and motukoreaite were synthesized by co-precipitation with increasing pH and characterized by several instrumental techniques. These minerals have previously been described to occur only with sodium and sulfate (Na(H2O)6)[M(+2)6Al3(OH)18(SO4)2].6H2O (M(2+) = Mn, Mg, and Zn). These phases were synthesized successfully along with others containing lithium and potassium. Cation exchange reactions were performed in the presence of alkaline metal sulfates, and for the first time several instrumental techniques were employed to show that the cations can be totally exchanged without removing the intercalated sulfate anions. This class of compounds, traditionally considered to be anion exchangers, can also be considered cation exchangers, which opens new avenues for future scientific and industrial applications.",2
"Selective Catalytic Formation of Cross-Tetramers from Tetrafluoroethylene, Ethylene, Alkynes, and Aldehydes via Nickelacycles as Key Reaction Intermediates.","In the presence of a catalytic amount of Ni(cod)2 (cod = 1,5-cyclooctadiene) and PCy3 (Cy = cyclohexyl), the cross-tetramerization of tetrafluoroethylene (TFE), ethylene, alkynes, and aldehydes leads to a variety of fluorine-containing enone derivatives. This reaction is the first example of a highly selective cross-tetramerization between four different unsaturated compounds. Stoichiometric reactions revealed that the present reaction involves partially fluorinated five- and seven-membered nickelacycles as key reaction intermediates.",2
"[2,2'-Bipyridin]-6(1 H)-one, a Truly Cooperating Ligand in the Palladium-Mediated C-H Activation Step: Experimental Evidence in the Direct C-3 Arylation of Pyridine.","The ligand [2,2'-bipyridin]-6(1 H)-one (bipy-6-OH) has a strong accelerating effect on the Pd-catalyzed direct arylation of pyridine or arenes. The isolation of relevant intermediates and the study of their decomposition unequivocally show that the deprotonated coordinated ligand acts as a base and assists the cleavage of the C-H bond. Mechanistic work indicates that the direct arylation of pyridine with this ligand occurs through a Pd(0)/Pd(II) cycle. Because of this dual ligand-intramolecular base role, there is no need for an available coordination site on the metal for an external base, a difficulty encountered when chelating ligands are used in coupling reactions that involve a C-H cleavage step.",2
Cationic Alkynyl Heck Reaction toward Substituted Allenes Using BobCat: A New Hybrid Pd(0)-Catalyst Incorporating a Water-Soluble dba Ligand.,"The cationic alkynyl Heck reaction between aryl triflates and alkynes to give substituted allenes is described. Key to the success of this method was the discovery and development of a new hybrid Pd(0)-catalyst, BobCat, that incorporates a water-soluble dba-ligand and biaryl phosphine ligand to provide substituted allenes in good yields under mild reaction conditions.",2
Enantioselective Synthesis of Isocarbostyril Alkaloids and Analogs Using Catalytic Dearomative Functionalization of Benzene.,"Enantioselective total syntheses of the anticancer isocarbostyril alkaloids (+)-7-deoxypancratistatin, (+)-pancratistatin, (+)-lycoricidine, and (+)-narciclasine are described. Our strategy for accessing this unique class of natural products is based on the development of a Ni-catalyzed dearomative trans-1,2-carboamination of benzene. The effectiveness of this dearomatization approach is notable, as only two additional olefin functionalizations are needed to construct the fully decorated aminocyclitol cores of these alkaloids. Installation of the lactam ring has been achieved through several pathways and a direct interconversion between natural products was established via a late-stage C-7 cupration. Using this synthetic blueprint, we were able to produce natural products on a gram scale and provide tailored analogs with improved activity, solubility, and metabolic stability.",2
Intrinsic Reactivity of Diatomic 3d Transition-Metal Carbides in the Thermal Activation of Methane: Striking Electronic Structure Effects.,"Mechanistic aspects of the C-H bond activation of methane by metal-carbide cations MC(+) of the 3d transition-metals Sc-Zn were elucidated by NEVPT2//CASSCF quantum-chemical calculations and verified experimentally for M = Ti, V, Fe, and Cu by using Fourier transform ion-cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. While MC(+) species with M = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Cu, and Zn activate CH4 at ambient temperature, this is prevented with carbide cations of M = Mn, Fe, and Co by high apparent barriers; NiC(+) has a small apparent barrier. Hydrogen-atom transfers from methane to metal-carbide cations were found to proceed via a proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism for M = Sc-Co; wherein the doubly occupied pixz/yz-orbitals between metal and carbon at the carbon site serve as electron donors and the corresponding metal-centered vacant pi*xz/yz-orbitals as electron acceptors. Classical hydrogen-atom transfer transpires only in the case of NiC(+), while ZnC(+) follows a mechanistic scenario, in which a formally hydridic hydrogen is transferred. CuC(+) reacts by a synchronous activation of two C-H bonds. While spin density is often so crucial for the reactions of numerous MO(+)/CH4 couples, it is much less important for the C-H bond activation by carbide cations of the 3d transition-metals, in which one notes large changes in bond dissociation energies, spin states, number of d-electrons, and charge distributions. All these factors jointly affect both the reactivity of the metal carbides and their mechanisms of C-H bond activation.",2
Visible-Light-Driven External-Reductant-Free Cross-Electrophile Couplings of Tetraalkyl Ammonium Salts.,"Cross-electrophile couplings between two electrophiles are powerful and economic methods to generate C-C bonds in the presence of stoichiometric external reductants. Herein, we report a novel strategy to realize the first external-reductant-free cross-electrophile coupling via visible-light photoredox catalysis. A variety of tetraalkyl ammonium salts, bearing primary, secondary, and tertiary C-N bonds, undergo selective couplings with aldehydes/ketone and CO2. Notably, the in situ generated byproduct, trimethylamine, is efficiently utilized as the electron donor. Moreover, this protocol exhibits mild reaction conditions, low catalyst loading, broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and facile scalability. Mechanistic studies indicate that benzyl radicals and anions might be generated as the key intermediates via photocatalysis, providing a new direction for cross-electrophile couplings.",2
A Chemoproteomic Strategy for Direct and Proteome-Wide Covalent Inhibitor Target-Site Identification.,"Despite recent clinical successes for irreversible drugs, potential toxicities mediated by unpredictable modification of off-target cysteines represents a major hurdle for expansion of covalent drug programs. Understanding the proteome-wide binding profile of covalent inhibitors can significantly accelerate their development; however, current mass spectrometry strategies typically do not provide a direct, amino acid level readout of covalent activity for complex, selective inhibitors. Here we report the development of CITe-Id, a novel chemoproteomic approach that employs covalent pharmacologic inhibitors as enrichment reagents in combination with an optimized proteomic platform to directly quantify dose-dependent binding at cysteine-thiols across the proteome. CITe-Id analysis of our irreversible CDK inhibitor THZ1 identified dose-dependent covalent modification of several unexpected kinases, including a previously unannotated cysteine (C840) on the understudied kinase PKN3. These data streamlined our development of JZ128 as a new selective covalent inhibitor of PKN3. Using JZ128 as a probe compound, we identified novel potential PKN3 substrates, thus offering an initial molecular view of PKN3 cellular activity. CITe-Id provides a powerful complement to current chemoproteomic platforms to characterize the selectivity of covalent inhibitors, identify new, pharmacologically addressable cysteine-thiols, and inform structure-based drug design programs.",2
Room Temperature Iron-Catalyzed Transfer Hydrogenation and Regioselective Deuteration of Carbon-Carbon Double Bonds.,"An iron catalyst has been developed for the transfer hydrogenation of carbon-carbon multiple bonds. Using a well-defined beta-diketiminate iron(II) precatalyst, a sacrificial amine and a borane, even simple, unactivated alkenes such as 1-hexene undergo hydrogenation within 1 h at room temperature. Tuning the reagent stoichiometry allows for semi- and complete hydrogenation of terminal alkynes. It is also possible to hydrogenate aminoalkenes and aminoalkynes without poisoning the catalyst through competitive amine ligation. Furthermore, by exploiting the separate protic and hydridic nature of the reagents, it is possible to regioselectively prepare monoisotopically labeled products. DFT calculations define a mechanism for the transfer hydrogenation of propene with (n)BuNH2 and HBpin that involves the initial formation of an iron(II)-hydride active species, 1,2-insertion of propene, and rate-limiting protonolysis of the resultant alkyl by the amine N-H bond. This mechanism is fully consistent with the selective deuteration studies, although the calculations also highlight alkene hydroboration and amine-borane dehydrocoupling as competitive processes. This was resolved by reassessing the nature of the active transfer hydrogenation agent: experimentally, a gel is observed in catalysis, and calculations suggest this can be formulated as an oligomeric species comprising H-bonded amine-borane adducts. Gel formation serves to reduce the effective concentrations of free HBpin and (n)BuNH2 and so disfavors both hydroboration and dehydrocoupling while allowing alkene migratory insertion (and hence transfer hydrogenation) to dominate.",2
Exploiting Substrate Promiscuity To Develop Activity-Based Probes for Ten-Eleven Translocation Family Enzymes.,"Ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes catalyze repeated oxidations of 5-methylcytosine in genomic DNA. Because of the challenges of tracking reactivity within a complex DNA substrate, chemical tools to probe TET activity are limited, despite these enzyme's crucial role in epigenetic regulation. Here, building on precedents from related Fe(II)/alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, we show that TET enzymes can promiscuously act upon cytosine bases with unnatural 5-position modifications. Oxidation of 5-vinylcytosine (vC) in DNA results in the predominant formation of a 5-formylmethylcytosine product that can be efficiently labeled to provide an end-point read-out for TET activity. The reaction with 5-ethynylcytosine (eyC), moreover, results in the formation of a high-energy ketene intermediate that can selectively trap any active TET isoform as a covalent enzyme-DNA complex, even in the complex milieu of a total cell lysate. Exploiting substrate promiscuity therefore offers a new and needed means to directly track TET activity in vitro or in vivo.",2
The Elusive Seven-Membered Cyclic Imino Ether Tetrahydrooxazepine.,"Cyclic imino ether heterocycles are used as ligands in transition metal catalysis, in various drugs and as reactive monomers in living cationic ring-opening polymerization (CROP). While five- and six-membered cyclic imino ethers, i.e. 2-oxazolines and 4,5-dihydro-1,3-oxazines, have extensively been studied in these areas, their seven-membered ring counterparts have remained unexplored. Herein, we report the synthesis of 2-phenyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1,3-oxazepine allowing reassignment of the earlier, incorrectly reported 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1,3-oxazepines as their N-acylated pyrrolidine isomers. Finally, we also report a comparison of the CROP reactivity of a homologous series of cyclic imino ethers with a 2-carbon, 3-carbon, and 4-carbon methylene bridge, revealing a remarkable ring size effect.",2
"Multivalent Ligand Binding to Cell Membrane Antigens: Defining the Interplay of Affinity, Valency, and Expression Density.","Nature uses multivalency to govern many biological processes. The development of macromolecular and cellular therapies has largely been dependent on engineering similar polyvalent interactions to enable effective targeting. Such therapeutics typically utilize high-affinity binding domains that have the propensity to recognize both antigen-overexpressing tumors and normal-expressing tissues, leading to ""on-target, off-tumor"" toxicities. One strategy to improve these agents' selectivity is to reduce the binding affinity, such that biologically relevant interactions between the therapeutic and target cell will only exist under conditions of high avidity. Preclinical studies have validated this principle of avidity optimization in the context of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells; however, a rigorous analysis of this approach in the context of soluble multivalent targeting scaffolds has yet to be undertaken. Using a modular protein nanoring capable of displaying </=8 fibronectin domains with engineered specificity for a model antigen, epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), this study demonstrates that binding affinity and ligand valency can be optimized to afford discrimination between EpCAM(High) (2.8-3.8 x 10(6) antigens/cell) and EpCAM(Low) (5.2 x 10(4) to 2.2 x 10(5) antigens/cell) tissues both in vitro and in vivo.",2
Development of S-Substituted Thioisothioureas as Efficient Hydropersulfide Precursors.,"Because of their inherent instability, hydropersulfides (RSSH) must be generated in situ using precursors, but very few physiologically useful RSSH precursors have been developed to date. In this work, we report the design, synthesis, and evaluation of novel S-substituted thiosiothioureas as RSSH precursors. These water-soluble precursors show efficient and controllable release of RSSH under physiological conditions.",2
Molecular Zirconium Nitride Super Base from a Mononuclear Parent Imide.,"In this work, we prepared, isolated, and structurally characterized a zirconium complex having a terminally bound imide motif, (PN)2Zr identical withNH (PN(-) = (N-(2-(i)Pr2P-4-methylphenyl)-2,4,6-trimethylanilide)), along with the zirconium nitride complex {(PN)2Zr identical withN[mu2-Li(THF)]}2. (PN)2Zr identical withNH was prepared by reduction of trans-(PN)2Zr(N3)2 with KC8. Isotopic labeling and spectroscopic studies were conducted using the respective (15)N enriched isotopologues, whereas solid-state structural studies confirmed some of the shortest Zr identical withN distances known to date (Zr identical withNH, 1.830(3) A; Zr identical withN(-), 1.822(2) A). It was found that the nitride in {(PN)2Zr identical withN[mu2-Li(THF)]}2 is super basic and in the range of -36 to -43 p Kb units. Computational studies have been applied to probe the bonding and structure for this new class of zirconium-nitrogen multiple bonds.",2
Stable Thiele's Hydrocarbon Derivatives Exhibiting Near-Infrared Absorption/Emission and Two-Step Electrochromism.,"We report synthesis and characterization of near-infrared (NIR)-absorbing/emitting Thiele's hydrocarbon derivatives, in which four aryl groups are bridged to a quinodimethane skeleton. The quinoid structure of the bridged-tetra-aryl- p-quinodimethanes (BTAQs) was confirmed by spectroscopic, X-ray crystallographic, and computational methods. Although quinodimethane derivatives with a small HOMO-LUMO energy gap often exhibit biradical character, BTAQs showed no biradical character. Instead, they exhibited two-step near-infrared electrochromism. The donor/acceptor properties of the aryl groups were found to play a key role in the unique properties of BTAQs.",2
Self-Sorting of Amphiphilic Copolymers for Self-Assembled Materials in Water: Polymers Can Recognize Themselves.,"Amphiphilic random copolymers bearing hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and hydrophobic alkyl pendants showed dynamic self-sorting behavior, that is, self-recognition, under competitive conditions in aqueous media. The self-sorting universally takes place not only in water but also in hydrogels and on the material surfaces, according to encoded information originating from the primary structure of composition and pendants. Binary blends of the copolymers with different composition or alkyl pendants readily induced composition- or alkyl pendant-dependent self-sorting to simultaneously provide discrete and size-controlled micelles with hydrophobic cores. Surprisingly, the micelles reversibly keep exchanging polymer chains exclusively between identical polymer micelles even in the presence of different counterparts. Owing to the dynamic self-sorting behavior, ABA-triblock copolymers comprising the amphiphilic random copolymer A segments and a hydrophilic PEG chain B segment further provided hydrogels with self-healing yet selectively adhesive properties.",2
Extraordinary Redox Activities in Ladder-Type Conjugated Molecules Enabled by B <-- N Coordination-Promoted Delocalization and Hyperconjugation.,"The introduction of B <-- N coordinate bond-isoelectronic to C-C single bond-into pi-systems represents a promising strategy to impart exotic redox and electrochromic properties into conjugated organic molecules and macromolecules. To achieve both reductive and oxidative activities using this strategy, a cruciform ladder-type molecular constitution was designed to accommodate oxidation-active, reduction-active, and B <-- N coordination units into a compact structure. Two such compounds (BN-F and BN-Ph) were synthesized via highly efficient N-directed borylation. These molecules demonstrated well-separated, two reductive and two oxidative electron-transfer processes, corresponding to five distinct yet stable oxidation states, including a rarely observed boron-containing radical cation. Spectroelectrochemical measurements revealed unique optical characteristics for each of these reduced/oxidized species, demonstrating multicolor electrochromism with excellent recyclability. Distinct color changes were observed between each redox state with clear isosbestic points on the absorption spectra. The underlying redox mechanism was elucidated by a combination of computational and experimental investigations. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis on the neutral state, the oxidized radical cation, and the reduced dianion of BN-Ph revealed structural transformations into two distinct quinonoid constitutions during the oxidation and reduction processes, respectively. B <-- N coordination played an important role in rendering the robust and reversible multistage redox properties, by extending the charge and spin delocalization, by modulating the pi-electron density, and by a newly established hyperconjugation mechanism.",2
Interaction of Water with the Gypsum (010) Surface: Structure and Dynamics from Nonlinear Vibrational Spectroscopy and Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics.,"Water-mineral interfaces are important for several environmental, industrial, biological, and geological processes. Gypsum, CaSO4.2H2O, is a widespread mineral of high technological, medical, and environmental relevance, but little is known about its surface structure and its interaction with water. A molecular-level understanding of gypsum/water interface is given here by a combined experimental/theoretical study. We investigate the structure and dynamics of water adsorbed from vapor on the gypsum (010) single-crystal surface at room temperature, combining sum-frequency generation (SFG) vibrational spectroscopy experiments and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. The SFG spectra of gypsum at low relative humidity (RH) show an anisotropic arrangement of structural water molecules and the presence of dangling OH groups. The AIMD simulations allow a detailed assignment of the SFG spectra and show that the cleaved (010) surface rearranges to have only 25% of the OH groups pointing away from the surface. At higher RHs, the first adsorbed water layer binds to these OH groups and forms an anisotropic arrangement, but with the amount of free OH groups significantly suppressed and without any significant diffusion. Upon adsorption of a second water layer, although the topmost layer of molecules is more disordered and dynamic than the previous one, its structure is still influenced by the gypsum surface underneath because it has a much reduced amount of free OH groups with respect to the free surface of water, and a slower surface diffusion with respect to bulk water. The theoretical results corroborate the experimental ones and provide an accurate atomic characterization of the surface structure.",2
Molecular Gating of an Engineered Enzyme Captured in Real Time.,"Enzyme engineering tends to focus on the design of active sites for the chemical steps, while the physical steps of the catalytic cycle are often overlooked. Tight binding of a substrate in an active site is beneficial for the chemical steps, whereas good accessibility benefits substrate binding and product release. Many enzymes control the accessibility of their active sites by molecular gates. Here we analyzed the dynamics of a molecular gate artificially introduced into an access tunnel of the most efficient haloalkane dehalogenase using pre-steady-state kinetics, single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics. Photoinduced electron-transfer-fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (PET-FCS) has enabled real-time observation of molecular gating at the single-molecule level with rate constants ( kon = 1822 s(-1), koff = 60 s(-1)) corresponding well with those from the pre-steady-state kinetics ( k-1 = 1100 s(-1), k1 = 20 s(-1)). The PET-FCS technique is used here to study the conformational dynamics in a soluble enzyme, thus demonstrating an additional application for this method. Engineering dynamical molecular gates represents a widely applicable strategy for designing efficient biocatalysts.",2
Two-Dimensional Electronic Spectroscopy Reveals Excitation Energy-Dependent State Mixing during Singlet Fission in a Terrylenediimide Dimer.,"Singlet fission (SF) is a spin-allowed process in which a singlet exciton, (1)(S1S0), within an assembly of two or more chromophores spontaneously down-converts into two triplet excitons via a multiexciton correlated triplet pair state, (1)(T1T1). To elucidate the involvement of charge transfer (CT) states and vibronic coupling in SF, we performed 2D electronic spectroscopy (2DES) on dilute solutions of a covalently linked, slip-stacked terrylene-3,4:11,12-bis(dicarboximide) (TDI) dimer. This dimer undergoes efficient SF in nonpolar 1,4-dioxane and symmetry-breaking charge separation in polar dichloromethane. The various 2DES spectral features in 1,4-dioxane show different pump wavelength dependencies, supporting the presence of mixed states with variable (1)(S1S0), (1)(T1T1) and CT contributions that evolve with time. Analysis of the 2DES spectra in dichloromethane reveals the presence of a state having largely (1)(T1T1) character during charge separation. Therefore, the (1)(T1T1) multiexciton state plays an important role in the photophysics of this TDI dimer irrespective of solvent polarity.",2
Atomic Scale Evidence of the Switching Mechanism in a Photomagnetic CoFe Dinuclear Prussian Blue Analogue.,"Molecular complexes based on Prussian Blue analogues have recently attracted considerable interest for their unique bistable properties combined to ultimately reduced dimensions. Here, we investigate the first dinuclear FeCo complex exhibiting both thermal and photomagnetic bistability in the solid state. Through an experimental and theoretical approach combining local techniques-X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), and ligand field multiplet calculations-we were able to evidence the changes occurring at the atomic scale in the electronic and magnetic properties. The spectroscopic studies were able to fully support at the atomic level the following conclusions: (i) the 300 K phase and the light-induced excited state at 4 K are both built from FeLS(III)-CoHS(II) paramagnetic pairs with no apparent reorganization of the local structure, (ii) the 100 K phase is composed of FeLS(II)-CoLS(III) diamagnetic pairs, and (iii) the light-induced excited state is fully relaxed at an average temperature of approximately 50 K. In the paramagnetic phase at 2 K, XAS and XMCD reveal that both Fe and Co ions exhibit a rather large orbital magnetic moment (0.65 muB and 0.46 muB, respectively, under an external magnetic induction of 6.5 T), but it was not possible to detect a magnetic interaction between spin centers above 2 K.",2
Elucidating CO2 Chemisorption in Diamine-Appended Metal-Organic Frameworks.,"The widespread deployment of carbon capture and sequestration as a climate change mitigation strategy could be facilitated by the development of more energy-efficient adsorbents. Diamine-appended metal-organic frameworks of the type diamine-M2(dobpdc) (M = Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn; dobpdc(4-) = 4,4'-dioxidobiphenyl-3,3'-dicarboxylate) have shown promise for carbon-capture applications, although questions remain regarding the molecular mechanisms of CO2 uptake in these materials. Here we leverage the crystallinity and tunability of this class of frameworks to perform a comprehensive study of CO2 chemisorption. Using multinuclear nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy experiments and van-der-Waals-corrected density functional theory (DFT) calculations for 13 diamine-M2(dobpdc) variants, we demonstrate that the canonical CO2 chemisorption products, ammonium carbamate chains and carbamic acid pairs, can be readily distinguished and that ammonium carbamate chain formation dominates for diamine-Mg2(dobpdc) materials. In addition, we elucidate a new chemisorption mechanism in the material dmpn-Mg2(dobpdc) (dmpn = 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-diaminopropane), which involves the formation of a 1:1 mixture of ammonium carbamate and carbamic acid and accounts for the unusual adsorption properties of this material. Finally, we show that the presence of water plays an important role in directing the mechanisms for CO2 uptake in diamine-M2(dobpdc) materials. Overall, our combined NMR and DFT approach enables a thorough depiction and understanding of CO2 adsorption within diamine-M2(dobpdc) compounds, which may aid similar studies in other amine-functionalized adsorbents in the future.",2
Unraveling the Self-Assembly of Heterocluster Janus Dumbbells into Hybrid Cubosomes with Internal Double-Diamond Structure.,"Cubosomes are bicontinuous cubic-phase particles generated by amphiphile self-assembly with bicontinuous cubic phases, which creates an intricate network of interconnected nanochannels that endow these materials with special functions for advanced applications. On the other hand, clusters are an attractive class of molecules that exhibit intriguing functions and properties that differ from those of atoms and nanoparticles. Inspired by lipid self-assembly and attracted to the new functionalities of clusters, we prepared special heterocluster Janus dumbbells (HCJDs) composed of dissimilar nanoclusters: namely, a polyoxometalate and a polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane. HCJDs resemble conventional amphiphiles and, as such, they self-assemble in solution into faceted hybrid cubosomes via the transformation of vesicles into spongelike aggregates. Multiple mechanisms that lead to equilibrium, including molecular self-assembly, vesicle accumulation, membrane fusion, inner-structure reorganization, and cubic crystal growth, contributed to the overall process. On the basis of these results, we proposed a strategy for self-assembly-from basic molecular design that goes beyond traditional amphiphiles to the construction of micro- or nanomaterials with hierarchical structures and advanced functions.",2
Na3MnZr(PO4)3: A High-Voltage Cathode for Sodium Batteries.,"Sodium batteries have been regarded as promising candidates for large-scale energy storage application, provided cathode hosts with high energy density and long cycle life can be found. Herein, we report NASICON-structured Na3MnZr(PO4)3 as a cathode for sodium batteries that exhibits an electrochemical performance superior to those of other manganese phosphate cathodes reported in the literature. Both the Mn(4+)/Mn(3+) and Mn(3+)/Mn(2+) redox couples are reversibly accessed in Na3MnZr(PO4)3, providing high discharge voltage plateaus at 4.0 and 3.5 V, respectively. A high discharge capacity of 105 mAh g(-1) was obtained from Na3MnZr(PO4)3 with a small variation of lattice parameters and a small volume change on extraction of two Na(+) ions per formula unit. Moreover, Na3MnZr(PO4)3 exhibits an excellent cycling stability, retaining 91% of the initial capacity after 500 charge/discharge cycles at 0.5 C rate. On the basis of structural analysis and density functional theory calculations, we have proposed a detailed desodiation pathway from Na3MnZr(PO4)3 where Mn and Zr are disordered within the structure. We further show that the cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion of Mn(3+) is suppressed in the cathode and that Na2MnZr(PO4)3 is a stable phase.",2
Design Principles for Trap-Free CsPbX3 Nanocrystals: Enumerating and Eliminating Surface Halide Vacancies with Softer Lewis Bases.,"We introduce a general surface passivation mechanism for cesium lead halide perovskite materials (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) that is supported by a combined experimental and theoretical study of the nanocrystal surface chemistry. A variety of spectroscopic methods are employed together with ab initio calculations to identify surface halide vacancies as the predominant source of charge trapping. The number of surface traps per nanocrystal is quantified by (1)H NMR spectroscopy, and that number is consistent with a simple trapping model in which surface halide vacancies create deleterious under-coordinated lead atoms. These halide vacancies exhibit trapping behavior that differs among CsPbCl3, CsPbBr3, and CsPbI3. Ab initio calculations suggest that introduction of anionic X-type ligands can produce trap-free band gaps by altering the energetics of lead-based defect levels. General rules for selecting effective passivating ligand pairs are introduced by considering established principles of coordination chemistry. Introducing softer, anionic, X-type Lewis bases that target under-coordinated lead atoms results in absolute quantum yields approaching unity and monoexponential luminescence decay kinetics, thereby indicating full trap passivation. This work provides a systematic framework for preparing highly luminescent CsPbX3 nanocrystals with variable compositions and dimensionalities, thereby improving the fundamental understanding of these materials and informing future synthetic and post-synthetic efforts toward trap-free CsPbX3 nanocrystals.",2
Nickel-Catalyzed Reductive [2+2] Cycloaddition of Alkynes.,"The nickel-catalyzed synthesis of tetrasubstituted cyclobutenes from alkynes is reported. This transformation is uniquely promoted by the use of a primary aminophosphine, an unusual ligand in nickel catalysis. Mechanistic insights for this new transformation are provided, and postreaction modifications of the cyclobutene products to stereodefined cyclic and acyclic compounds are reported, including the synthesis of epi-truxillic acid.",2
Graphene Oxide Hybrid with Sulfur-Nitrogen Polymer for High-Performance Pseudocapacitors.,"Toward the introduction of fast faradaic pseudocapacitive behavior and the increase of the specific capacitance of carbon-based electrodes, we covalently functionalized graphene oxide with a redox active thiourea-formaldehyde polymer, yielding a multifunctional hybrid system. The multiscale physical and chemical characterization of the novel 3-dimensional hybrid revealed high material porosity with high specific surface area (402 m(2) g(-1)) and homogeneous element distribution. The presence of multiple functional groups comprising sulfur, nitrogen, and oxygen provide additional contribution of Faradaic redox reaction in supercapacity performance, leading to a high effective electrochemical pseudocapacitance. Significantly, our graphene-based 3-dimensional thiourea-formaldehyde hybrid exhibited specific capacitance as high as 400 F g(-1), areal capacitance of 160 mF cm(-2), and an energy density of 11.1 mWh cm(-3) at scan rate of 1 mV s(-1) with great capacitance retention (100%) after 5000 cycles at scan rate of 100 mV s(-1).",2
Identification of G-Quadruplex-Binding Protein from the Exploration of RGG Motif/G-Quadruplex Interactions.,"The arginine/glycine-rich region termed the RGG domain is usually found in G-quadruplex (G4)-binding proteins and is important in G4-protein interactions. Studies on the binding mechanism of RGG domains found that small segments (RGG motif) inside the domain contribute greatly to the G4 binding affinity. However, unlike the entire RGG domains that have been broadly explored, the role of the RGG motif remains obscure, with very limited study. Herein, to clarify the role of the RGG motif in G4-protein interactions, we systematically investigated the binding affinity and mode between RGG-motif peptides and G4s. The internal arrangement of RGG repeats and gap amino acids played a more crucial role in the G4-binding mechanism than a critical number of RGG repeats. Arginines and phenylalanines at the exact position of the RGG motif might enable additional hydrogen bonding and pi-stacking interaction with nucleobases and strengthen the binding of G4. Impressively, proceeding from a G4-binding RGG peptide, 12, discovered above, we identified the cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRBP) as a new G4 DNA-binding protein both in vitro and in cells. In addition, we found that the key amino acids for G4 binding in peptide 12 and CIRBP were highly similar, and peptide 12 clearly played a key role in the G4 binding of CIRBP. This report is the first in which a G4-binding protein was identified from exploration of the G4-binding RGG motif. Our findings suggest a novel strategy for discovering new G4-binding proteins by exploring key peptide segments.",2
Dielectric Behavior as a Screen in Rational Searches for Electronic Materials: Metal Pnictide Sulfosalts.,"Dielectric screening plays an important role in reducing the strength of carrier scattering and trapping by point defects for many semiconductors such as the halide perovskite solar materials. However, it was rarely considered as a screen to find new electronic semiconductors. We performed a material search study using the dielectric properties as a screen to identify potential electronic materials in the class of metal-pnictide ternary sulfosalts, containing Bi or Sb. These salts are basically ionic due to the electronegativity difference between the S and both the metal and pnictogen elements. However, we do find significant cross-gap hybridization between the S p-derived valence bands and pnictogen p-derived conduction bands in many of the materials. This leads to enhanced Born effective charges and, in several cases, highly enhanced dielectric constants. We find a chemical rule for high dielectric constants in terms of the bond connectivity of the pnictogen-chalcogen part of the crystal structure. We additionally find a series of compounds with low effective mass, high dielectric constant, and other properties that suggest good performance as electronic materials and also several potential thermoelectric compounds. Experimental optical data and solar conversion efficiency are reported for Sn-Sb-S samples, and results in accord with predicted good performance are found. The results illustrate the utility of dielectric properties as a screen for identifying complex semiconductors.",2
Metallaphotoredox-Catalyzed Cross-Electrophile Csp(3)-Csp(3) Coupling of Aliphatic Bromides.,"A strategy for the installation of small alkyl fragments onto pharmaceutically relevant aliphatic structures has been established via metallaphotoredox catalysis. Herein, we report that tris(trimethylsilyl)silanol can be employed as an effective halogen abstraction reagent that, in combination with photoredox and nickel catalysis, allows a generic approach to Csp(3)-Csp(3) cross-electrophile coupling. In this study, we demonstrate that a variety of aliphatic drug-like groups can be successfully coupled with a number of commercially available small alkyl electrophiles, including methyl tosylate and strained cyclic alkyl bromides. Moreover, the union of two secondary aliphatic carbon centers, a long-standing challenge for organic molecule construction, has been accomplished with a wide array of structural formats. Last, this technology can be selectively merged with Csp(2)-Csp(3) aryl-alkyl couplings to build drug-like systems in a highly modular fashion.",2
Control over Near-Ballistic Electron Transport through Formation of Parallel Pathways in a Single-Molecule Wire.,"This paper reports highly efficient coherent tunneling in single-molecule wires of oligo-ferrocenes with one to three Fc units. The Fc units were directly coupled to the electrodes, i.e., without chemical anchoring groups between the Fc units and the terminal electrodes. We found that a single Fc unit readily interacts with the metal electrodes of an STM break junction (STM = scanning tunneling microscope) and that the zero-voltage bias conductance of an individual Fc molecular junction increased 5-fold, up to 80% of the conductance quantum G0 (77.4 muS), when the length of the molecular wire was increased from one to three connected Fc units. Our compendium of experimental evidence combined with nonequilibrium Green function calculations contemplate a plausible scenario to explain the exceedingly high measured conductance based on the electrode/molecule contact via multiple Fc units. The oligo-Fc backbone is initially connected through all Fc units, and, as one of the junction electrodes is pulled away, each Fc unit is sequentially disconnected from one of the junction terminals, resulting in several distinct conductance features proportional to the number of Fc units in the backbone. The conductance values are independent of the applied temperature (-10 to 85 degrees C), which indicates that the mechanism of charge transport is coherent tunneling for all measured configurations. These measurements show the direct Fc-electrode coupling provides highly efficient molecular conduits with very low barrier for electron tunneling and whose conductivity can be modulated near the ballistic regime through the number of Fc units able to bridge and the energy position of the frontier molecular orbital.",2
Design and Biosynthesis of Dimeric Alboflavusins with Biaryl Linkages via Regiospecific C-C Bond Coupling.,"Alboflavusins (AFNs) are a group of cyclohexapeptides with moderate antibacterial and antitumor activities from Streptomyces alboflavus sp. 313. In vivo and in vitro studies proposed that AFNs are biosynthesized by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase machinery, and the 6-Cl-L-Trp precursor is supplied by a tryptophan halogenase gene located outside the afn gene cluster. Guided by the structure-activity relationship knowledge about the AFN-like cyclohexapeptides, two dimeric AFNs (di-AFNs) with regiospecific biaryl linkages were designed and generated biotechnologically by expressing the P450 gene hmtS or clpS in S. alboflavus wild-type and mutant strains. The di-AFNs displayed much better antibacterial and antitumor activities than their monomers as anticipated, exemplifying a rational strategy to generate natural product congeners with improved bioactivities.",2
Binding of Distinct Substrate Conformations Enables Hydroxylation of Remote Sites in Thaxtomin D by Cytochrome P450 TxtC.,"Cytochromes P450 (CYPs) catalyze various oxidative transformations in drug metabolism, xenobiotic degradation, and natural product biosynthesis. Here we report biochemical, structural, and theoretical studies of TxtC, an unusual bifunctional CYP involved in the biosynthesis of the EPA-approved herbicide thaxtomin A. TxtC was shown to hydroxylate two remote sites within the Phe residue of its diketopiperazine substrate thaxtomin D. The reactions follow a preferred order, with hydroxylation of the alpha-carbon preceding functionalization of the phenyl group. To illuminate the molecular basis for remote site functionalization, X-ray crystal structures of TxtC in complex with the substrate and monohydroxylated intermediate were determined. Electron density corresponding to a diatomic molecule (probably dioxygen) was sandwiched between the heme iron atom and Thr237 in the TxtC-intermediate structure, providing insight into the mechanism for conversion of the ferrous-dioxygen complex into the reactive ferryl intermediate. The substrate and monohydroxylated intermediate adopted similar conformations in the active site, with the pi-face of the phenyl group positioned over the heme iron atom. Docking simulations reproduced this observation and identified a second, energetically similar but conformationally distinct binding mode in which the alpha-hydrogen of the Phe residue is positioned over the heme prosthetic group. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed that the alpha-hydrogen is sufficiently close to the ferryl oxygen atom to be extracted by it and indicated that the two substrate conformations cannot readily interconvert in the active site. These results indicate that TxtC is able to hydroxylate two spatially remote sites by binding distinct conformations of the substrate and monohydroxylated intermediate.",2
Concept and Development of Framework Nucleic Acids.,"The blooming field of structural DNA nanotechnology harnessing the material properties of nucleic acids has attracted widespread interest. The exploitation of the precise and programmable Watson-Crick base pairing of DNA or RNA has led to the development of exquisite nucleic acid nanostructures from one to three dimensions. The advances of computer-aided tools facilitate automated design of DNA nanostructures with various sizes and shapes. Especially, the construction of shell or skeleton DNA frameworks, or more recently dubbed ""framework nucleic acids"" (FNAs) provides a means to organize molecules or nanoparticles with nanometer precision. The intrinsic biological properties and tailorable functionalities of FNAs hold great promise for physical, chemical, and biological applications. This Perspective highlights state-of-the-art design and construction, of precisely assembled FNAs, and outlines the challenges and opportunities for exploiting the structural potential of FNAs for translational applications.",2
Rational Design of an Amphiphilic Coordination Cage-Based Emulsifier.,"Self-assembled, porous coordination cages with a functional interior find application in controlled guest inclusion/release, drug delivery, separation processes, and catalysis. However, only few studies exist that describe their utilization for the development of self-assembled materials based on their 3-dimensional shape and external functionalization. Here, dodecyl chain-containing, acridone-based ligands (L(A)) and shape-complementary phenanthrene-derived ligands (L(B)) are shown to self-assemble to heteroleptic coordination cages cis-[Pd2(L(A))2(L(B))2](4+) acting as a gemini amphiphile (CGA-1; Cage-based Gemini Amphiphile-1). Owing to their anisotropic decoration with short polar and long nonpolar side chains, the cationic cages were found to assemble into vesicles with diameters larger than 100 nm in suitable polar solvents, visualized by cryo-TEM and Liquid-Cell Transmission Electron Microscopy (LC-TEM). LC-TEM reveals that these vesicles aggregate into chains and necklaces via long-range interactions. In addition, the cages show a rarely described ability to stabilize oil-in-oil emulsions.",2
Amphiphile-Mediated Depalmitoylation of Proteins in Living Cells.,"Post-translational S-palmitoylation plays a central role in protein localization, trafficking, stability, aggregation, and cell signaling. Dysregulation of palmitoylation pathways in cells can alter protein function and is the cause of several diseases. Considering the biological and clinical importance of S-palmitoylation, tools for direct, in vivo modulation of this lipid modification would be extremely valuable. Here, we describe a method for the cleavage of native S-palmitoyl groups from proteins in living cells. Using a cell permeable, cysteine-functionalized amphiphile, we demonstrate the direct depalmitoylation of cellular proteins. We show that amphiphile-mediated depalmitoylation (AMD) can effectively cleave S-palmitoyl groups from the native GTPase HRas and successfully depalmitoylate mislocalized proteins in an infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (INCL) disease model. AMD enables direct and facile depalmitoylation of proteins in live cells and has potential therapeutic applications for diseases such as INCL, where native protein thioesterase activity is deficient.",2
Silicon-Mediated Selective Homo- and Heterocoupling of Carbon Monoxide.,"While the transformation of carbon monoxide to multicarbon compounds (fuels and organic bulk chemicals) via reductive scission of the enormously strong CO bond is dominated by transition metals, splitting and deoxygenative reductive coupling of CO under nonmatrix conditions using silicon, the second most abundant nonmetal of the earth's crust, is extremely scarce and mechanistically not well understood. Herein, we report the selective deoxygenative homocoupling of carbon monoxide by divalent silicon utilizing the (LSi:)2Xant 1a [Xant = 9,9-dimethyl-xanthene-4,5-diyl; PhC(N (t)Bu)2] and (LSi:)2Fc 1b (Fc = 1,1'-ferrocenyl) as four-electron reduction reagents under mild reaction conditions (RT, 1 atm), affording the corresponding disilylketenes, Xant(LSi)2(mu-O)(mu-CCO) 2a and Fc(LSi)2(mu-O)(mu-CCO) 2b, respectively. However, the dibenzofuran analogue of 1b, compound 1c, was unreactive toward CO due to the longer distance between the two Si(II) atoms, which demonstrated the crucial role of the Si...Si distance on cooperative CO binding and activation. This is confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and further theoretical investigations on CO homocoupling with 1a and 1b revealed that the initial step of CO binding and scission involved CO acting as a Lewis acid (four-electron acceptor), in sharp contrast to CO activation mediated by transition metals where CO serves as a Lewis base (two-electron donor). This mechanism was strongly reinforced by the reaction of 1a with isocyanide Xyl-NC (Xyl = 2,6-Me2C6H3), isoelectronic with CO. Treatment of 1a with one or two molecules of Xyl-NC furnished the unique (silyl)(imido)silene 3a and the C horizontal lineC coupled bis(Xyl-NC) product 5, respectively, via the isolable doubly bridged Xant(LSi)2(mu-XylNC)2 intermediate 4. Moreover, compound 3a reacts with 1 molar equivalent of CO to give the disilylketenimine Xant(LSi)2(mu-O)(mu-CCNR) 6, representing, for the first time, a selective heterocoupling product of CO with isoelectronic isocyanide.",2
Triangular DNA Origami Tilings.,"DNA origami tilings provide methods for creating complex molecular patterns and shapes using flat DNA origami structures as building blocks. Square tiles have been developed to construct micrometer-scale arrays and to generate patterns using stochastic or deterministic strategies. Here we show triangular tiles as a complementary approach for enriching the design space of DNA tilings and for extending the shape of the self-assembled arrays from 2D to 3D. We introduce a computational approach for maximizing binding specificity in a fully symmetric tile design, with which we construct a 20-tile structure resembling a rhombic triacontahedron. We demonstrate controlled transition between 3D and 2D structures using simple methods including tile concentration, magnesium, and fold symmetry in tile edge design. Using these approaches, we construct 2D arrays with unbounded and designed sizes. The programmability of the edge design and the flexibility of the structure make the triangular DNA origami tile an ideal building block for complex self-assembly and reconfiguration in artificial molecular machines and fabricated nanodevices.",2
"Anthracene as a Launchpad for a Phosphinidene Sulfide and for Generation of a Phosphorus-Sulfur Material Having the Composition P2S, a Vulcanized Red Phosphorus That Is Yellow.","Thermolysis of a pair of dibenzo-7-phosphanorbornadiene compounds is shown to lead to differing behaviors: phosphinidene sulfide release and formation of amorphous P2S. These compounds, (t)BuP(S)A (1, A = C14H10 or anthracene; 59% isol. yield) and HP(S)A (2; 63%), are available through thionation of (t)BuPA and the new secondary phosphine HPA (5), prepared from Me2NPA and DIBAL-H in 50% yield. Phosphinidene sulfide [ (t)BuP horizontal lineS] transfer is shown to proceed efficiently from 1 to 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene to form Diels-Alder product 3 with a zero-order dependence on diene. Platinum complex (Ph3P)2Pt(eta(2)- (t)BuPS) (4, 47%) is also accessed from 1 and structurally characterized. In contrast, heating parent species 2 (3 h, 135 degrees C) under vacuum instead produces an insoluble, nonvolatile yellow residual material 6 of composition P2S that displays semiconductor properties with an optical band gap of 2.4 eV. Material 6 obtained in this manner from molecular precursor 2 is in a poorly characterized portion of the phosphorus-sulfur phase diagram and has therefore been subjected to a range of spectroscopic techniques to gain structural insight. X-ray spectroscopic and diffraction techniques, including Raman, XANES, EXAFS, and PDF, reveal 6 to have similarities with related compounds including P4S3, Hittorf's violet phosphorus. Various possible structures have been explored as well using quantum chemical calculations under the constraint that each phosphorus atom is trivalent with no terminal sulfide groups, and each sulfur atom is divalent. The structural conclusions are supported by data from phosphorus-31 magic angle spinning (MAS) solid state NMR spectroscopy, bolstering the structural comparisons to other phosphorus-sulfur systems while excluding the formulation of P2S as a simple mixture of P4S3 and phosphorus.",2
"A Highly Ordered Nanoporous, Two-Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework with Modifiable Pores, and Its Application in Water Purification and Ion Sieving.","The preparation of membranes with high selectivity based on specific chemical properties such as size and charge would impact the efficiency of the world's energy supply, the production of clean water, and many other separation technologies. We report a flexible synthetic protocol for preparing highly ordered two-dimensional nanoporous polymeric materials (termed covalent organic frameworks or COFs) that allow for placing virtually any function group within the nanopores. We demonstrate that membranes, fabricated with this new family of materials with carboxylated pore walls, are very water permeable, as well as highly charged and size selective.",2
Nitric Oxide Reductase Activity in Heme-Nonheme Binuclear Engineered Myoglobins through a One-Electron Reduction Cycle.,"FeBMbs are structural and functional models of native bacterial nitric oxide reductases (NORs) generated through engineering of myoglobin. These biosynthetic models replicate the heme-nonheme diiron site of NORs and allow substitutions of metal centers and heme cofactors. Here, we provide evidence for multiple NOR turnover in monoformyl-heme-containing FeBMb1 proteins loaded with Fe(II), Co(II), or Zn(II) metal ions at the FeB site (Fe(II)/Co(II)/Zn(II)-FeBMb1(MF-heme)). FTIR detection of the nu(NNO) band of N2O at 2231 cm(-1) provides a direct quantitative measurement of the product in solution. A maximum number of turnover is observed with Fe(II)-FeBMb1(MF-heme), but the NOR activity is retained when the FeB site is loaded with Zn(II). These data support the viability of a one-electron semireduced pathway for the reduction of NO at binuclear centers in reducing conditions.",2
Design and Enantioresolution of Homochiral Fe(II)-Pd(II) Coordination Cages from Stereolabile Metalloligands: Stereochemical Stability and Enantioselective Separation.,"The stereochemistry of chiral-at-metal complexes is much more abundant, albeit complicated, than chiral-at-carbon compounds, but how to make use of stereolabile metal-centers remains a formidable challenge due to the highly versatile coordination geometry of metal ions and racemization/epimerization problem. We demonstrate herein a stepwise assembly of configurationally stable [Pd6(FeL3)8](28+) (Delta/Lambda-MOCs-42) homochiral octahedral cages from unstable D3-symmetry tris-chelate-Fe type metalloligands via strong face-directed stereochemical coupling and facile chiral-induced resolution processes based on stereodifferentiating host-guest dynamics. Kinetic studies reveal that the dissociation rate of MOC-42 cages is 100-fold slower than that of Fe-metalloligands and the racemization is effectively inhibited, making the cages retain their chirality over extended periods of time (>5 months) at room temperature. Recyclable enantioseparation of atropisomeric compounds has been successfully achieved, giving up to 88% ee.",2
"Photoactivation Mechanism, Timing of Protein Secondary Structure Dynamics and Carotenoid Translocation in the Orange Carotenoid Protein.","The orange carotenoid protein (OCP) is a two-domain photoactive protein that noncovalently binds an echinenone (ECN) carotenoid and mediates photoprotection in cyanobacteria. In the dark, OCP assumes an orange, inactive state known as OCP(O); blue light illumination results in the red active state, known as OCP(R). The OCP(R) state is characterized by large-scale structural changes that involve dissociation and separation of C-terminal and N-terminal domains accompanied by carotenoid translocation into the N-terminal domain. The mechanistic and dynamic-structural relations between photon absorption and formation of the OCP(R) state have remained largely unknown. Here, we employ a combination of time-resolved UV-visible and (polarized) mid-infrared spectroscopy to assess the electronic and structural dynamics of the carotenoid and the protein secondary structure, from femtoseconds to 0.5 ms. We identify a hereto unidentified carotenoid excited state in OCP, the so-called S* state, which we propose to play a key role in breaking conserved hydrogen-bond interactions between carotenoid and aromatic amino acids in the binding pocket. We arrive at a comprehensive reaction model where the hydrogen-bond rupture with conserved aromatic side chains at the carotenoid beta1-ring in picoseconds occurs at a low yield of <1%, whereby the beta1-ring retains a trans configuration with respect to the conjugated pi-electron chain. This event initiates structural changes at the N-terminal domain in 1 mus, which allow the carotenoid to translocate into the N-terminal domain in 10 mus. We identified infrared signatures of helical elements that dock on the C-terminal domain beta-sheet in the dark and unfold in the light to allow domain separation. These helical elements do not move within the experimental range of 0.5 ms, indicating that domain separation occurs on longer time scales, lagging carotenoid translocation by at least 2 decades of time.",2
Synergetic Organocatalysis for Eliminating Epimerization in Ring-Opening Polymerizations Enables Synthesis of Stereoregular Isotactic Polyester.,"Ring-opening polymerization of O-carboxyanhydrides (OCAs) can furnish polyesters with a diversity of functional groups that are traditionally hard to harvest by polymerization of lactones. Typical ring-opening catalysts are subject to unavoidable racemization of most OCA monomers, which hampers the synthesis of highly isotactic crystalline polymers. Here, we describe an effective bifunctional single-molecule organocatalysis for selective ring-opening polymerization of OCAs without epimerization. The close vicinity of both activating groups in the same molecule engenders an amplified synergetic effect and thus allows for the use of mild bases, thereby leading to minimal epimerization for polymerization. Ring-opening polymerization of manOCA monomer (OCA from mandelic acid) mediated by the bifunctional single-molecule organocatalyst yields highly isotactic poly(mandelic acid) (PMA) with controlled molecular weights (up to 19.8 kg mol(-1)). Mixing of the two enantiomers of PMA generates the first example of a crystalline stereocomplex in this area, which displayed distinct Tm values around 150 degrees C. Remarkably, the bifunctional catalysts are moisture-stable, recyclable, and easy to use, allowing sustainable and scalable synthesis of a stereoregular functional polyester.",2
Sequence-defined multifunctional polyethers via liquid-phase synthesis with molecular sieving.,"Synthetic chemists have devoted tremendous effort towards the production of precision synthetic polymers with defined sequences and specific functions. However, the creation of a general technology that enables precise control over monomer sequence, with efficient isolation of the target polymers, is highly challenging. Here, we report a robust strategy for the production of sequence-defined synthetic polymers through a combination of liquid-phase synthesis and selective molecular sieving. The polymer is assembled in solution with real-time monitoring to ensure couplings proceed to completion, on a three-armed star-shaped macromolecule to maximize efficiency during the molecular sieving process. This approach is applied to the construction of sequence-defined polyethers, with side-arms at precisely defined locations that can undergo site-selective modification after polymerization. Using this versatile strategy, we have introduced structural and functional diversity into sequence-defined polyethers, unlocking their potential for real-life applications in nanotechnology, healthcare and information storage.",2
Photochemical generation of radicals from alkyl electrophiles using a nucleophilic organic catalyst.,"Chemists extensively use free radical reactivity for applications in organic synthesis, materials science, and life science. Traditionally, generating radicals requires strategies that exploit the bond dissociation energy or the redox properties of the precursors. Here, we disclose a photochemical catalytic approach that harnesses different physical properties of the substrate to form carbon radicals. We use a nucleophilic dithiocarbamate anion catalyst, adorned with a well-tailored chromophoric unit, to activate alkyl electrophiles via an SN2 pathway. The resulting photon-absorbing intermediate affords radicals upon homolytic cleavage induced by visible light. This catalytic SN2-based strategy, which exploits a fundamental mechanistic process of ionic chemistry, grants access to open-shell intermediates from a variety of substrates that would be incompatible with or inert to classical radical-generating strategies. We also describe how the method's mild reaction conditions and high functional group tolerance could be advantageous for developing C-C bond-forming reactions, for streamlining the preparation of a marketed drug, for the late-stage elaboration of biorelevant compounds and for enantioselective radical catalysis.",2
Hierarchical organization of perylene bisimides and polyoxometalates for photo-assisted water oxidation.,"The oxygen in Earth's atmosphere is there primarily because of water oxidation performed by photosynthetic organisms using solar light and one specialized protein complex, photosystem II (PSII). High-resolution imaging of the PSII 'core' complex shows the ideal co-localization of multi-chromophore light-harvesting antennas with the functional reaction centre. Man-made systems are still far from replicating the complexity of PSII, as the majority of PSII mimetics have been limited to photocatalytic dyads based on a 1:1 ratio of a light absorber, generally a Ru-polypyridine complex, with a water oxidation catalyst. Here we report the self-assembly of multi-perylene-bisimide chromophores (PBI) shaped to function by interaction with a polyoxometalate water-oxidation catalyst (Ru4POM). The resulting [PBI]5Ru4POM complex shows a robust amphiphilic structure and dynamic aggregation into large two-dimensional paracrystalline domains, a redshifted light-harvesting efficiency of >40% and favourable exciton accumulation, with a peak quantum efficiency using 'green' photons (lambda > 500 nm). The modularity of the building blocks and the simplicity of the non-covalent chemistry offer opportunities for innovation in artificial photosynthesis.",2
Highly responsive nature of porous coordination polymer surfaces imaged by in situ atomic force microscopy.,"The ability of porous coordination polymers to undergo reversible structural transformations in response to the presence of guest molecules has been intensively investigated for applications such as molecular separation, storage, sensing and signalling processes. Here we report on the direct observation of the highly guest-responsive nature of the surface of a single-crystalline porous coordination polymer, which consists of paddlewheel zinc clusters and two types of ligand, by in situ liquid-phase atomic force microscopy. Observations were carried out in solution at constant temperature (28 degrees C) by high-speed atomic force microscopy with lattice resolution. A sharp and reversible response to the presence or absence of biphenyl guest molecules was observed, under conditions that can scarcely induce the transformation of the bulk crystal. Additionally, by modulating the surface coordination equilibrium, layer-by-layer delamination events were captured in real time at every ~13 s per frame.",2
"Copper-Catalyzed Radical 1,4-Difunctionalization of 1,3-Enynes with Alkyl Diacyl Peroxides and N-Fluorobenzenesulfonimide.","Many reactions involving allenyl ion species have been studied, but reactions involving allenyl radicals are less well understood, perhaps because of the inconvenience associated with the generation of short-lived allenyl radicals. We describe here a versatile method for the generation of allenyl radicals and their previously unreported applications in the intermolecular 1,4-carbocyanation and 1,4-sulfimidocyanation of 1,3-enynes. With the assistance of the trifunctional reagents, alkyl diacyl peroxides or N-fluorobenzenesulfonimide, a range of synthetically challenging multisubstituted allenes can be prepared with high regioselectivity. These multisubstituted allenes can be easily transformed into synthetically useful structures such as fluorinated vinyl cyanides, lactones, functionalized allenyl amides, 1-aminonaphthalenes, and pyridin-2(1 H)-ones, and several novel transformations are reported. The results of radical scavenger and radical clock experiments are consistent with the proposed allenyl radical pathway. Density functional theory (DFT) and IR spectroscopy studies suggest the formation of an isocyanocopper(II) species in the ligand exchange step. On the basis of the results of IR, DFT, and diastereoselectivity studies, an isocyanocopper(II)/copper(I) catalytic cycle is proposed, which differs from the previously considered Cu(III) mechanism in cyanation reactions.",2
An Isolable Bis(silylene)-Stabilized Germylone and Its Reactivity.,"The first zerovalent germanium complex (""germylone"") 3, [Si(II)(Xant)Si(II)]Ge(0), stabilized by a chelating bis(N-heterocyclic silylene)xanthene donor ligand 1 was successfully synthesized via the dechlorination of the corresponding {[Si(II)(Xant)Si(II)]GeCl}(+)Cl(-) complex 2 with KC8; it was structurally and spectroscopically characterized, and also studied by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis of 3 unambiguously exhibits two lone pairs of electrons (one sigma-type lone-pair and one 3p(Ge) lone-pair) on the zerovalent Ge atom. This is why the Ge atom can form the corresponding mono- and bis-AlBr3 Ge --> Al Lewis adducts [Si(II)(Xant)Si(II)]Ge(AlBr3) 4 and [Si(II)(Xant)Si(II)]Ge(AlBr3)2 5, respectively. Due to the electron-rich character of the Ge(0) atom, the germylone 3 displayed quite unusual reactivities. Thus, the reaction of 3 with 9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (9-BBN) as a potential Lewis acid furnished the first boryl(silyl)germylene complex 6, possessing a heteroallylic B...Ge...Si pi-conjugation. When 3 was allowed to react with Ni(cod)2 (cod = 1,5-cyclooctadiene), the unique {[Si(II)(Xant)Si(II)]Ge(I)}2Ni(II) complex with a three-membered ring Ge2Ni-metallacycle was obtained via reductive coupling of two Ge(0) atoms on the Ni center. Moreover, 3 was suitable to form a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) with BPh3, which was capable of heterolytic H2 cleavage at 1 atm and room temperature, representing, for the first time, that a metallylone could be applied in FLP chemistry.",2
Calix[4]pyrrole Hydridosilicate: The Elusive Planar Tetracoordinate Silicon Imparts Striking Stability to Its Anionic Silicon Hydride.,"Anionic hydridosilicates are highly reactive and strong hydride donors. In contrast, calix[4]pyrrole hydridosilicate is an entirely water-stable, anionic silicon hydride, which does not show hydridic reactivity. However, it still acts as an electron donor and enables the detection of a single electron transfer process in the reduction chemistry with hydridosilicates. Most important, these unusual properties are imparted by the unique planar structure of its elusive parent neutral silane-substantiating the effect of planar tetracoordinate silicon for the first time.",2
Overcoming the Limitations of gamma- and delta-C-H Arylation of Amines through Ligand Development.,"L,X-Type transient directing groups (TDGs) based on a reversible imine linkage have emerged as broadly useful tools for C-H activation of ketones and free amines. However, competitive binding interactions among multiple reaction components (TDG itself, substrate, and substrate-TDG adduct) with the palladium catalyst often lead to the formation of multiple unreactive complexes, rendering ligand development extremely challenging. Herein, we report the finding of versatile 2-pyridone ligands that addresses these problems and significantly improves the gamma-methylene arylation of alkyl amines, extending the coupling partners to a wide range of medicinally important heteroaryl iodides and even previously unreactive heteroaryl bromides. The combination of an appropriate transient directing group and pyridone ligand has also enabled the delta-arylation of alkyl amines. Notably, our transient directing group design reveals the importance of matching the size of the Pd-chelation with different transient directing groups and the size of palladacycles generated from gamma- and delta-C-H bonds: TDGs that coordinate with Pd(II) to form a six-membered chelate are selective toward gamma-C-H bonds, whereas TDGs that coordinate with Pd(II) via a five-membered chelate tend to activate delta-C-H bonds. These findings provide an avenue for developing protecting group free and selective C-H functionalization using the transient directing group strategy.",2
Potential Dependence of Mechanical Stability and Electronic Coupling of Single S-Au Bonds.,"Providing a mechanically stable and electronically efficient coupling between a molecule and an electrode is critical to the study of charge transfer and conductance of the molecule. A common method is to link the molecule to Au electrodes via a linker (e.g., thiol terminal of the molecule). Here we study the mechanical stability and electronic coupling of a S-Au bond in single-molecule junctions over a broad range of electrode potentials. Our results show that the mechanical and electromechanical properties of molecule-electrode contact undergo a systematic change with the potential involving Au oxidation at positive potentials and S protonation at negative potentials. The study establishes the potential range for a stable S-Au bond and determines the potential dependence of the mechanical and electromechanical properties of the molecule-electrode contact, which is crucial to the interpretation of potential-dependent charge transfer in electrochemistry and electrochemical gating of charge transport in molecular electronics.",2
Synthesis and Characterization of a Neutral U(II) Arene Sandwich Complex.,"Reduction of IU(NHAr(iPr6))2 (Ar(iPr6) = 2,6-(2,4,6-(i)Pr3C6H2)2C6H3) results in a rare example of a U(II) complex, U(NHAr(iPr6))2, and the first example that is a neutral species. Here, we show spectroscopic and magnetic studies that suggest a 5f(4)6d(0) valence electronic configuration for uranium, along with characterization of related U(III) complexes.",2
Preparing Semiconducting Nanoribbons with Tunable Length and Width via Crystallization-Driven Self-Assembly of a Simple Conjugated Homopolymer.,"Precise control of width and length of one-dimensional (1D) semiconducting nanostructures has attracted much attention owing to its potential for optoelectronic applications. However, regulating both their length and width using conjugated polymers or even block copolymers is a huge challenge. To solve this problem, we synthesized a unique conjugated polyacetylene homopolymer by living cyclopolymerization, which spontaneously formed 1D nanoribbons via in situ nanoparticlization. Interestingly, their widths could be controlled from 8 to 41 nm, which were directly proportional to their degree of polymerization. Furthermore, a self-seeding technique via crystallization-driven self-assembly (CDSA) was used to control the length of the nanoribbons up to 5.2 mum with narrow distributions less than 1.1. Interestingly, adding a block copolymer unimer to these nanoribbons produced triblock comicelles by the living CDSA mechanism. Finally, these nanoribbons were visualized directly by super-resolution optical fluorescence microscopy. Now, one can modulate both length and width of 1D nanoribbons simultaneously.",2
Reactivity of Solid Rubrene with Potassium: Competition between Intercalation and Molecular Decomposition.,"We present the synthesis and characterization of the K(+)-intercalated rubrene (C42H28) phase, K2Rubrene (K2R), and identify the coexistence of amorphous and crystalline materials in samples where the crystalline component is phase-pure. We suggest this is characteristic of many intercalated alkali metal-polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) systems, including those for which superconductivity has been claimed. The systematic investigation of K-rubrene solid-state reactions using both K and KH sources reveals a complex competition between K intercalation and the decomposition of rubrene, producing three K-intercalated compounds, namely, K2R, K(RR*), and K xR' (where R* and R' are rubrene decomposition derivatives C42H26 and C30H20, respectively). K2R is obtained as the major phase over a wide composition range and is accompanied by the formation of amorphous byproducts from the decomposition of rubrene. K(RR*) is synthesized as a single phase, and K xR' is obtained only as a secondary phase to the majority K2R phase. The crystal structure of K2R was determined using high-resolution powder X-ray diffraction, revealing that the structural rearrangement from pristine rubrene creates two large voids per rubrene within the molecular layers in which K(+) is incorporated. K(+) cations accommodated within the large voids interact strongly with the neighboring rubrene via eta(6), eta(3), and eta(2) binding modes to the tetracene cores and the phenyl groups. This contrasts with other intercalated PAHs, where only a single void per PAH is created and the intercalated K(+) weakly interacts with the host. The decomposition products of rubrene are also examined using solution NMR, highlighting the role of the breaking of C-Cphenyl bonds. For the crystalline decomposition derivative products K(RR*) and K xR', a lack of definitive structural information with regard to R* and R' prevents the crystal structures from being determined. The study illustrates the complexity in accessing solvent-free alkali metal salts of reduced PAH of the type claimed to afford superconductivity.",2
Electronegativity Seen as the Ground-State Average Valence Electron Binding Energy.,"We introduce a new electronegativity scale for atoms, based consistently on ground-state energies of valence electrons. The scale is closely related to (yet different from) L. C. Allen's, which is based on configuration energies. Using a combination of literature experimental values for ground-state energies and ab initio-calculated energies where experimental data are missing, we are able to provide electronegativities for elements 1-96. The values are slightly smaller than Allen's original scale, but correlate well with Allen's and others. Outliers in agreement with other scales are oxygen and fluorine, now somewhat less electronegative, but in better agreement with their chemistry with the noble gas elements. Group 11 and 12 electronegativities emerge as high, although Au less so than in other scales. Our scale also gives relatively high electronegativities for Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, Tc, Cd, Hg (affected by choice of valence state), and Gd. The new electronegativities provide hints for new alloy/compound design, and a framework is in place to analyze those energy changes in reactions in which electronegativity changes may not be controlling.",2
Preassembly Strategy To Fabricate Porous Hollow Carbonitride Spheres Inlaid with Single Cu-N3 Sites for Selective Oxidation of Benzene to Phenol.,"Developing single-atom catalysts with porous micro-/nanostructures for high active-site accessibility is of great significance but still remains a challenge. Herein, we for the first time report a novel template-free preassembly strategy to fabricate porous hollow graphitic carbonitride spheres with single Cu atoms mounted via thermal polymerization of supramolecular preassemblies composed of a melamine-Cu complex and cyanuric acid. Atomically dispersed Cu-N3 moieties were unambiguously confirmed by spherical aberration correction electron microscopy and extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. More importantly, this material exhibits outstanding catalytic performance for selective oxidation of benzene to phenol at room temperature, especially showing phenol selectivity (90.6 vs 64.2%) and stability much higher than those of the supported Cu nanoparticles alone, originating from the isolated unique Cu-N3 sites in the porous hollow structure. An 86% conversion of benzene, with an unexpectedly high phenol selectivity of 96.7% at 60 degrees C for 12 h, has been achieved, suggesting a great potential for practical applications. This work paves a new way to fabricate a variety of single-atom catalysts with diverse graphitic carbonitride architectures.",2
Two-Dimensional Kagome Lattices Made of Hetero Triangulenes Are Dirac Semimetals or Single-Band Semiconductors.,"Here we discuss, based on first-principles calculations, two-dimensional (2D) kagome lattices composed of polymerized heterotriangulene units, planar molecules with D3h point group containing a B, C, or N center atom and CH2, O, or CO bridges. We explore the design principles for a functional lattice made of 2D polymers, which involves control of pi-conjugation and electronic structure of the knots. The former is achieved by the chemical potential of the bridge groups, while the latter is controlled by the heteroatom. The resulting 2D kagome polymers have a characteristic electronic structure with a Dirac band sandwiched by two flat bands and are either Dirac semimetals (C center), or single-band semiconductors-materials with either exclusively electrons (B center) or holes (N center) as charge carriers of very high mobility, reaching values of up to approximately 8 x 10(3) cm(2) V(-1) s(-1), which is comparable to crystalline silicon.",2
Design of Iron Coordination Complexes as Highly Active Homogenous Water Oxidation Catalysts by Deuteration of Oxidation-Sensitive Sites.,"The nature of the oxidizing species in water oxidation reactions with chemical oxidants catalyzed by alpha-[Fe(OTf)2(mcp)] (1alpha; mcp = N, N'-dimethyl- N, N'-bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)cyclohexane-1,2-diamine, OTf = trifluoromethanesulfonate anion) and beta-[Fe(OTf)2(mcp)] (1beta) has been investigated. Mossbauer spectroscopy provides definitive evidence that 1alpha and 1beta generate oxoiron(IV) species as the resting state. Decomposition paths of the catalysts have been investigated by identifying and quantifying ligand fragments that form upon degradation. This analysis correlates the water oxidation activity of 1alpha and 1beta with stability against oxidative damage of the ligand via aliphatic C-H oxidation. The site of degradation and the relative stability against oxidative degradation are shown to be dependent on the topology of the catalyst. Furthermore, the mechanisms of catalyst degradation have been rationalized by computational analyses, which also explain why the topology of the catalyst enforces different oxidation-sensitive sites. This information has served in creating catalysts where sensitive C-H bonds have been replaced by C-D bonds. The deuterated analogues D4-alpha-[Fe(OTf)2(mcp)] (D4-1alpha), D4-beta-[Fe(OTf)2(mcp)] (D4-1beta), and D6-beta-[Fe(OTf)2(mcp)] (D6-1beta) were prepared, and their catalytic activity has been studied. D4-1alpha proves to be an extraordinarily active and efficient catalyst (up to 91% of O2 yield); it exhibits initial reaction rates identical with those of its protio analogue, but it is substantially more robust toward oxidative degradation and yields more than 3400 TON ( n(O2)/ n(Fe)). Altogether this evidences that the water oxidation catalytic activity is performed by a well-defined coordination complex and not by iron oxides formed after oxidative degradation of the ligands.",2
Reversible Metalation and Catalysis with a Scorpionate-like Metallo-ligand in a Metal-Organic Framework.,"The installation of metallo-ligands in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is an effective means to create site-isolated metal centers toward single-site heterogeneous catalysis. Although trispyrazolyborate (Tp) and tripyrazolylmethane (Tpm) form one of the most iconic classes of homogeneous catalysts, neither has been used as a metallo-ligand for the generation of MOFs thus far. Here, we show that upon in situ metalation with Cu(I), a tricarboxylated Tpm ligand reacts with ZrOCl2 to generate a new MOF exhibiting neutral scorpionate-like chelating sites. These sites undergo for facile demetalation and remetalation with retention of crystallinity and porosity. When remetalated with Cu(I), the MOF exhibits spectroscopic features and catalytic activity for olefin cyclopropanation reactions that are similar to the molecular [Cu(CH3CN)Tpm*]PF6 complex (Tpm* = tris(3,5-dimethylpyrazolyl)methane). These results demonstrate the inclusion of Tp or Tpm metallo-ligands in a MOF for the first time and provide a blueprint for immobilizing Tpm* catalysts in a spatially isolated and well-defined environment.",2
Balancing Specificity and Promiscuity in Enzyme Evolution: Multidimensional Activity Transitions in the Alkaline Phosphatase Superfamily.,"Highly proficient, promiscuous enzymes can be springboards for functional evolution, able to avoid loss of function during adaptation by their capacity to promote multiple reactions. We employ a systematic comparative study of structure, sequence, and substrate specificity to track the evolution of specificity and reactivity between promiscuous members of clades of the alkaline phosphatase (AP) superfamily. Construction of a phylogenetic tree of protein sequences maps out the likely transition zone between arylsulfatases (ASs) and phosphonate monoester hydrolases (PMHs). Kinetic analysis shows that all enzymes characterized have four chemically distinct phospho- and sulfoesterase activities, with rate accelerations ranging from 10(11)- to 10(17)-fold for their primary and 10(9)- to 10(12)-fold for their promiscuous reactions, suggesting that catalytic promiscuity is widespread in the AP-superfamily. This functional characterization and crystallography reveal a novel class of ASs that is so similar in sequence to known PMHs that it had not been recognized as having diverged in function. Based on analysis of snapshots of catalytic promiscuity ""in transition"", we develop possible models that would allow functional evolution and determine scenarios for trade-off between multiple activities. For the new ASs, we observe largely invariant substrate specificity that would facilitate the transition from ASs to PMHs via trade-off-free molecular exaptation, that is, evolution without initial loss of primary activity and specificity toward the original substrate. This ability to bypass low activity generalists provides a molecular solution to avoid adaptive conflict.",2
Exact Stoichiometry of Ce xZr6- x Cornerstones in Mixed-Metal UiO-66 Metal-Organic Frameworks Revealed by Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure Spectroscopy.,"Bimetallic Ce/Zr-UiO-66 metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) proved to be promising materials for various catalytic redox applications, representing, together with other bimetallic MOFs, a new generation of porous structures. However, no direct proof for the presence of both metals in a single cornerstone of UiO-type MOFs was reported so far. Employing element-selective X-ray absorption spectroscopy techniques herein, we demonstrate, for the first time, that our synthesis route allows obtaining Ce/Zr-UiO-66 MOFs with desired Ce content and bimetallic CeZr5 cornerstones. Performing multiple-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis, we determine the exact stoichiometry of the cornerstones, which explains the dependence of thermal and chemical stability of the materials on Ce content.",2
Geometrically Compelled Disilene with lambda(4)-Coordinate Si(II) Atoms.,"The first hypercoordinated disilene with the longest Si horizontal lineSi distance (2.623(1) A) reported to date, the 5,6-bis(amidinato silylenyl)acenaphtene (amidinato = PhC(N(t)Bu)2) (1), is presented. It results from a spatially compelled double dative interaction between the two singlet silylene moieties, due to their close proximity. The dynamic behavior of the Si horizontal lineSi bond contraction and elongation in 1 predicted by quantum chemical calculations could be confirmed experimentally by variable temperature NMR spectroscopy. Compound 1 exhibits an ambivalent reactivity, reacting as disilene with ethylene, diphenylacetylene and benzophenone to give [2+2] cycloaddition products, but as bis(silylene) toward Ni(cod)2 (cod = cycloocta-1,4-diene) to form the corresponding bis(silylene)Ni(0)(eta(4)-cod) complex.",2
Supramolecular Transformation of Metallacycle-linked Star Polymers Driven by Simple Phosphine Ligand-Exchange Reaction.,"As a common phenomenon in biological systems, supramolecular transformations of biomacromolecules lead to specific biological functions as outputs, which thus inspire people to construct biomimetic dynamic systems through supramolecular transformation strategy. It should be noted that well-modulating the artificial macromolecules to fine-tune their properties is of great significance yet still remains a big challenge in polymer chemistry. In this study, through the combination of coordination-driven self-assembly and postassembly ring-opening polymerization, a six-armed star polymer linked by well-defined hexagonal metallacycle as core was successfully prepared. At the same time, the trans-platinum acetylide moieties as transformation sites were anchored onto the discrete metallacycle scaffold. Subsequently, the simple phosphine ligand-exchange reaction induced the conversions of platinum acetylide building blocks with the varied binding angles, which thus resulted in the successive hexagon-rhomboid-hexagon transformations of metallacyclic scaffold, therefore allowing for the corresponding supramolecular transformation of metallacycle-linked star polymers. More importantly, accompanied by such transformation process, property modulation of the resultant polymers has been successfully realized. In a word, by taking advantage of dynamic nature of metal-ligand coordination bonds and simple phosphine ligand-exchange reactions, facile architecture transformation of a star polymer to a linear polymer and back to a star polymer was successfully realized, which may provide a promising approach toward the construction of new dynamic polymeric materials.",2
Radical Germylzincation of alpha-Heteroatom-Substituted Alkynes.,"The regio- and stereoselective addition of germanium and zinc across the C-C triple bond of nitrogen-, sulfur-, oxygen-, and phosphorus-substituted terminal and internal alkynes is achieved by reaction with a combination of R3GeH and Et2Zn. Diagnostic experiments support a radical-chain mechanism and the beta-zincated vinylgermanes that show exceptional stability are characterized by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. The unique feature of this new radical germylzincation reaction is that the C(sp(2))-Zn bond formed remains available for subsequent in situ Cu(I)- or Pd(0)-mediated C-C or C-heteroatom bond formation with retention of the double bond geometry. These protocols offer modular access to elaborated tri- and tetrasubstituted vinylgermanes decorated with heteroatom substituents beta to germanium that are useful for the preparation of stereodefined alkenes.",2
Stereoselective Assembly of Gigantic Chiral Molybdenum Blue Wheels Using Lanthanide Ions and Amino Acids.,"The synthesis of chiral polyoxometalates (POMs) is a challenge because of the difficulty to induce the formation of intrinsically chiral metal-oxo frameworks. Herein we report the stereoselective synthesis of a series of gigantic chiral Mo Blue (MB) POM clusters 1-5 that are formed by exploiting the synergy between coordinating lanthanides ions as symmetry breakers to produce MBs with chiral frameworks decorated with amino acids ligands; these promote the selective formation of enantiopure MBs. All the compounds share the same framework archetype, based on {Mo124Ce4}, which forms an intrinsically chiral Delta or Lambda configurations, controlled by the configurations of functionalized chiral amino acids. The chirality and stability of 1-5 in solution are confirmed by circular dichroism, (1)H NMR, and electrospray ion mobility-mass spectrometry studies. In addition, the framework of the {Mo124Ce4} MB not only behaves as a host able to trap a chiral {Mo8} cluster that is not accessible by traditional synthesis but also promotes the transformation of tryptophan to kynurenine in situ. This work demonstrates the potential and applicability of our synthetic strategy to produce gigantic chiral POM clusters capable of host-guest chemistry and selective synthetic transformations.",2
"Proton Mobility, Intrinsic Acid Strength, and Acid Site Location in Zeolites Revealed by Varying Temperature Infrared Spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory Studies.","The intrinsic Bronsted acid strength in solid acids relates to the energy required to separate a proton from a conjugate base, for example a negatively charged zeolite framework. The reliable characterization of zeolites' intrinsic acidity is fundamental to the understanding of acid catalysis and setting in relation solid Bronsted acids with their activity and selectivity. Here, we report an infrared spectroscopic study with partial isotopic deuterium exchange of a series of 15 different acidic aluminosilicate materials, including ZSM-5 zeolites with very few defects. Varying Temperature Infrared spectroscopy (VTIR) permitted estimating activation energies for proton diffusion. Two different proton transfer mechanisms have been distinguished for two different temperature ranges. Si-rich zeolites appeared to be promising proton-transfer materials ( Eact. < 40 kJ mol(-1)) at temperatures above 150 degrees C (423 K). Further, a linear bathochromic shift of the Si-(OD)-Al stretching vibration as a function of temperature was observed. It can be assumed that this red-shift is related to the intrinsic O-(H/D) bond strength. This observation allowed the extrapolation and estimation of precise v(O-D)@0 K values, which could be attributed to distinct crystallographic locations through Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The developed method was used to reliably determine the likelihood of the position of a proton in ZSM-5 zeolites under catalytically relevant conditions ( T > 423 K), which has so far never been achieved by any other technique.",2
"Catalytic Synthesis of Superlinear Alkenyl Arenes Using a Rh(I) Catalyst Supported by a ""Capping Arene"" Ligand: Access to Aerobic Catalysis.","Alkyl and alkenyl arenes are used in a wide range of products. However, the synthesis of 1-phenylalkanes or their alkenyl variants from arenes and alkenes is not accessible with current commercial acid-based catalytic processes. Here, it is reported that an air-stable Rh(I) complex, (5-FP)Rh(TFA)(eta(2)-C2H4) (5-FP = 1,2-bis( N-7-azaindolyl)benzene; TFA = trifluoroacetate), serves as a catalyst precursor for the oxidative conversion of arenes and alkenes to alkenyl arenes that are precursors to 1-phenylalkanes upon hydrogenation. It has been demonstrated that coordination of the 5-FP ligand enhances catalyst longevity compared to unligated Rh(I) catalyst precursors, and the 5-FP-ligated catalyst permits in situ recycling of the Cu(II) oxidant using air. The 5-FP ligand provides a Rh catalyst that can maintain activity for arene alkenylation over at least 2 weeks in reactions at 150 degrees C that involve multiple Cu(II) regeneration steps using air. Conditions to achieve >13000 catalytic turnovers with an 8:1 linear:branched (L:B) ratio have been demonstrated. In addition, the catalyst is active under aerobic conditions using air as the sole oxidant. At 80 degrees C, an 18:1 L:B ratio of alkenyl arenes has been observed, but the reaction rate is substantially reduced compared to 150 degrees C. Quantum mechanics (QM) calculations compare two predicted reaction pathways with the experimental data, showing that an oxidative addition/reductive elimination pathway is energetically favored over a pathway that involves C-H activation by concerted metalation-deprotonation. In addition, our QM computations are consistent with the observed selectivity (11:1) for linear alkenyl arene products.",2
Highly Stable Artificial Cells from Galactopyranose-Derived Single-Chain Amphiphiles.,"Single-chain amphiphiles (SCAs) that self-assemble into large vesicular structures are attractive components of synthetic cells because of the simplicity of bilayer formation and increased membrane permeability. However, SCAs commonly used for vesicle formation suffer from restricted working pH ranges, instability to divalent cations, and the inhibition of biocatalysts. Construction of more robust biocompatible membranes from SCAs would have significant benefits. We describe the formation of highly stable vesicles from alkyl galactopyranose thioesters. The compatibility of these uncharged SCAs with biomolecules makes possible the encapsulation of functional enzymes and nucleic acids during the vesicle generation process, enabling membrane protein reconstitution and compartmentalized nucleic acid amplification, even when charged precursors are supplied externally.",2
Competitive Immunoassays for the Detection of Small Molecules Using Single Molecule Arrays.,"Small-molecule detection is important for many applications including clinical diagnostics, drug discovery, and measurements of environmental samples and agricultural products. Current techniques for small-molecule detection suffer from various limitations including low analytical sensitivity and complex sample processing. Furthermore, as a result of their small size, small molecules are difficult to detect using an antibody pair in a traditional sandwich assay format. To overcome these limitations, we developed an ultrasensitive competitive immunoassay for small-molecule detection using Single Molecule Arrays (Simoa). We show that the competitive Simoa assay is approximately 50-fold more sensitive than the conventional ELISA. We performed theoretical calculations to determine the factors that influence the sensitivity of competitive Simoa assays and used them to achieve maximal sensitivity. We also demonstrate detection of small molecules in complex biological samples. We show that the competitive Simoa assay is a simple, fast, and highly sensitive approach for ultrasensitive detection of small molecules.",2
Uniform Nucleation of Lithium in 3D Current Collectors via Bromide Intermediates for Stable Cycling Lithium Metal Batteries.,"The conductive framework is generating considerable interest for lithium metal anodes to accommodate Li(+) deposition, due to its ability to reduce electrode current density by increasing the deposition area. However, in most cases, the electroactive surface area is not fully utilized for the nucleation of Li in 3D current collectors, especially under high current densities. Herein, uniform nucleation of Li in the conductive skeleton is achieved by a two-step synergetic process arising from CuBr- and Br-doped graphene-like film. The modified electrode regulates Li nucleating in uniform pancake-like seeds and growing into a granular Li metal ascribed to the excellent lithiophilicity of CuBr- and Br-doping sites and the low Li diffusion barrier on the surface of generated LiBr, as confirmed by the experimental and computational results. Therefore, the modified anode endows small nucleation overpotential, a high-reversibility Li plating/stripping process, and excellent performance in full batteries with industrially significant cathode loading. This work suggests that a two-step cooperative strategy opens a viable route to the development of a Li anode with high reversibility for stable cycling Li metal batteries.",2
Pb2GaF2(SeO3)2Cl: Band Engineering Strategy by Aliovalent Substitution for Enlarging Bandgap while Keeping Strong Second Harmonic Generation Response.,"Wide bandgap and strong second-order generation (SHG) effect are two crucial but contradictory conditions for practical nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. Herein, a new NLO crystal Pb2GaF2(SeO3)2Cl (I) containing novel functional (GaO3F3)(6-) octahedra is designed and synthesized by a rational band engineering strategy with aliovalent substitution. Benefiting from the removal of transition metal cations and the introduction of bridged F anions, I exhibits the widest bandgap among all reported phase-matchable NLO selenites. Meanwhile, a strong SHG response more than 4.5 times of KH2PO4 (KDP) is maintained. The dominate role of the (GaO3F3)(6-) groups to the enlarged bandgap in I are elucidated by first-principles studies.",2
Fast Living Polymerization and Helix-Sense-Selective Polymerization of Diazoacetates Using Air-Stable Palladium(II) Catalysts.,"In this work, air-stable palladium(II) catalysts bearing bidentate phosphine ligands were designed and prepared, which could initiate fast and living polymerizations of various diazoacetate monomers under mild conditions. The polymerization afforded the desired polymers in high yields with controlled molecular weights ( Mns) and narrow molecular weight distributions ( Mw/ Mns). The Mns of the isolated polymers were linearly correlated to the initial feed ratios of monomer to catalyst, confirming the living/controlled manner of the polymerizations. The Mn also increased linearly with the monomer conversion, and all of the isolated polymers showed narrow Mw/ Mns. The polymerization was relatively fast and could be accomplished within several minutes. Such fast living polymerization method can be applied to a wide range of diazoacetate monomers in various organic solvents at room temperature in air. Taking advantage of the living nature, we facilely prepared a series of block copolymers through chain extension reactions. The amphiphilic block copolymers synthesized by this method exhibited interesting self-assembly properties. Moreover, polymerization of achiral bulky diazoacetate by Pd(II) catalysts bearing a chiral bidentate phosphine ligand leads to the formation of polymers with high optical activity due to the formation of the predominantly one-handed helix of the main chain. The helix sense of the polymers was determined by the chirality of the Pd(II) catalysts.",2
Taking Solution Proton NMR to Its Extreme: Prediction and Detection of a Hydride Resonance in an Intermediate-Spin Iron Complex.,"Guided by DFT based modeling the chemical shift range of a hydride resonance in the proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum of the intermediate-spin, square planar iron complex (tBu)(PNP)Fe-H was predicted and detected as a broad resonance at -3560 ppm (295 K) with a temperature dependent shift of approximately 2000 ppm between 223 and 383 K. The first detection of a metal-bonded hydrogen atom by solution NMR in a complex with a paramagnetic ground state illustrates the interplay of theory and experiment for the characterization of key components in paramagnetic base metal catalysis.",2
Controlling and Observing Sharp-Valleyed Quantum Interference Effect in Single Molecular Junctions.,"The ability to control over the quantum interference (QI) effect in single molecular junctions is attractive in the application of molecular electronics. Herein we report that the QI effect of meta-benzene based molecule with dihydrobenzo[ b]thiophene as the anchoring group ( meta-BT) can be controlled by manipulating the electrode potential of the junctions in electrolyte while the redox state of the molecule does not change. More than 2 orders of magnitude conductance change is observed for meta-BT ranging from <10(-6.0) to 10(-3.3) G0 with varying the electrode potential, while the upper value is even larger than the conductance of para-BT ( para-benzene based molecule with anchoring group of dihydrobenzo[ b]thiophene). This phenomenon is attributed to the shifting of energy level alignment between the molecule and electrodes under electrode potential control. Calculation is carried out to predict the transmission function of single molecular junction and the work function of Au surface in the presence of the molecule, and good agreement is found between theory and experiments, both showing sharp-valley featured destructive QI effect for the meta-BT. The present work demonstrates that the QI effect can be tuned through electrochemical gating without change of molecular redox states, which provides a feasible way toward realization of effective molecular switches.",2
Cationic Surfactant-Based Electrolyte Additives for Uniform Lithium Deposition via Lithiophobic Repulsion Mechanisms.,"Lithium metal is among the most promising anode materials for high-energy batteries due to its high theoretical capacity and lowest electrochemical potential. However, dendrite formation is a major challenge, which can result in fire and explosion of the batteries. Herein, we report on hexadecyl trimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) as an electrolyte additive that can suppress the growth of lithium dendrites by lithiophobic repulsion mechanisms. During the lithium plating process, cationic surfactant molecules can aggregate around protuberances via electrostatic attraction, forming a nonpolar lithiophobic protective outer layer, which drives the deposition of lithium ions to adjacent regions to produce dendrite-free uniform Li deposits. Thus, an excellent cycle of 300 h at 1.0 mA cm(-2) and rate performance up to 4 mA cm(-2) are available safely in symmetric Li|Li cells. In particular, significantly enhanced cycle and rate performance were achieved when the electrolyte with CTAC additives was used in lithium-sulfur and Li|LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 full cells. The effects of carbon chains, anions of surfactant, and electrostatic repulsion on the deposition of lithium anodes are reported. This work advances research in inhibiting Li dendrite growth with a new electrolyte additive based on cationic surfactants.",2
Imaging of Neurite Network with an Anti-L1CAM Aptamer Generated by Neurite-SELEX.,"Neurite outgrowth is the critical step of nervous development. Molecular probes against neurites are essential for evaluation of the nervous system development, compound neurotoxicity, and drug efficacy on nerve regeneration. To obtain a neurite probe, we developed a neurite-SELEX strategy and generated a DNA aptamer, yly12, that strongly binds neurites. The molecular target of yly12 was identified to be neural cell adhesion molecule L1 (L1CAM), a surface antigen expressed in normal nervous system and various cancers. Here, yly12 was successfully applied to image the three-dimensional network of neurites between live cells, as well as the neurite fibers on normal brain tissue section. This aptamer was also found to have an inhibitory effect on neurite outgrowth between cells. Given the advantages of aptamers, yly12 hold great potential as a molecular tool in the field of neuroscientific research. The high efficiency of neurite-SELEX suggests that SELEX against a subcellular structure instead of the whole cells is more effective in obtaining the desired aptamers.",2
Covalent Organic Frameworks: Chemistry beyond the Structure.,"Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) represent a new field of rapidly growing chemical research that takes direct inspiration from diverse covalent bonds existing between atoms. The success of linking atoms in two and three dimensions to construct extended framework structures moved the chemistry of COFs beyond the structures to methodologies, highlighting the possibility of prospective applications. Although structure to property relation in COFs has led to fascinating properties, chemical stability, processability and scalability were some of the important challenges that needed to be overcome for their successful implementation. In this Perspective, we take a closer look at the growth of COFs from mere supramolecular structures to potential industrializable materials.",2
Nanoscale Surface Structure-Activity in Electrochemistry and Electrocatalysis.,"Nanostructured electrochemical interfaces (electrodes) are found in diverse applications ranging from electrocatalysis and energy storage to biomedical and environmental sensing. These functional materials, which possess compositional and structural heterogeneity over a wide range of length scales, are usually characterized by classical macroscopic or ""bulk"" electrochemical techniques that are not well-suited to analyzing the nonuniform fluxes that govern the electrochemical response at complex interfaces. In this Perspective, we highlight new directions to studying fundamental electrochemical and electrocatalytic phenomena, whereby nanoscale-resolved information on activity is related to electrode structure and properties colocated and at a commensurate scale by using complementary high-resolution microscopy techniques. This correlative electrochemical multimicroscopy strategy aims to unambiguously resolve structure and activity by identifying and characterizing the structural features that constitute an active surface, ultimately facilitating the rational design of functional electromaterials. The discussion encompasses high-resolution correlative structure-activity investigations at well-defined surfaces such as metal single crystals and layered materials, extended structurally/compositionally heterogeneous surfaces such as polycrystalline metals, and ensemble-type electrodes exemplified by nanoparticles on an electrode support surface. This Perspective provides a roadmap for next-generation studies in electrochemistry and electrocatalysis, advocating that complex electrode surfaces and interfaces be broken down and studied as a set of simpler ""single entities"" (e.g., steps, terraces, defects, crystal facets, grain boundaries, single particles), from which the resulting nanoscale understanding of reactivity can be used to create rational models, underpinned by theory and surface physics, that are self-consistent across broader length scales and time scales.",2
Synthetic and Spectroscopic Investigations Enabled by Modular Synthesis of Molecular Phosphaalkyne Precursors.,"A series of dibenzo-7-phosphanorbornadiene compounds, Ph3PC(R)PA (1-R; A = C14H10, anthracene; R = Me, Et, (i)Pr, (s)Bu), are reported to be capable of thermal fragmentation to generate alkyl-substituted phosphaalkynes (RC identical withP) concomitant with triphenylphosphine and anthracene. Facile preparation of these molecular precursors proceeds by treatment of ClPA with the appropriate ylide Ph3P horizontal lineCHR (2 equiv). For methyl, ethyl, and isopropyl substituents, the phosphaalkyne conversions are measured to be 56-73% in solution by quantitative (31)P NMR spectroscopy. In the case of compound 1-Me, the kinetic profile of its spontaneous unimolecular fragmentation is investigated by an Eyring analysis. The resulting 1-phosphapropyne is directly detected by solution NMR spectroscopy and gas phase rotational microwave spectroscopy. The latter technique allows for the first time measurement of the phosphorus-31 nuclear spin-rotation coupling tensor. The nuclear spin-rotation coupling provides a link between rotational and NMR spectroscopies, and is contextualized in relation to the chemical shift anisotropy.",2
Nanoscale Metal-Organic Layers for Radiotherapy-Radiodynamic Therapy.,"Nanoscale metal-organic layers (nMOLs) are an emerging class of 2D crystalline materials formed by reducing the dimensionality of nanoscale metal-organic frameworks (nMOFs). nMOLs hold significant potential in biomedical applications by combining the structural and compositional tunability of nMOFs and anisotropic properties of 2D nanomaterials. Here we report two novel nMOLs, Hf12-Ir and Hf6-Ir, based on Hf12 and Hf6 secondary building units (SBUs) and photosensitizing Ir(bpy)[dF(CF3)ppy]2(+) derived ligands [bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine; dF(CF3)ppy = 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridine] for radiotherapy (RT) and radiodynamic therapy (RDT). Upon X-ray irradiation, the Hf12 or Hf6 SBUs in the nMOLs efficiently absorb X-rays to enhance RT by producing hydroxyl radicals and to elicit RDT through the excitation of Ir(bpy)[dF(CF3)ppy]2(+) derived ligands to generate singlet oxygen and superoxide anions. Hf12-Ir and Hf6-Ir promoted effective cell instant death through RDT and cell reproductive death through RT to elicit superb anticancer efficacy, resulting in >99% tumor regression at low X-ray doses of 0.5 x 5 Gy.",2
"Rapid Dissolution of BaSO4 by Macropa, an 18-Membered Macrocycle with High Affinity for Ba(2).","Insoluble BaSO4 scale is a costly and time-consuming problem in the petroleum industry. Clearance of BaSO4-impeded pipelines requires chelating agents that can efficiently bind Ba(2+), the largest nonradioactive +2 metal ion. Due to the poor affinity of currently available chelating agents for Ba(2+), however, the dissolution of BaSO4 remains inefficient, requiring very basic solutions of ligands. In this study, we investigated three diaza-18-crown-6 macrocycles bearing different pendent arms for the chelation of Ba(2+) and assessed their potential for dissolving BaSO4 scale. Remarkably, the bis-picolinate ligand macropa exhibits the highest affinity reported to date for Ba(2+) at pH 7.4 (log K' = 10.74), forming a complex of significant kinetic stability with this large metal ion. Furthermore, the BaSO4 dissolution properties of macropa dramatically surpass those of the state-of-the-art ligands DTPA and DOTA. Using macropa, complete dissolution of a molar equivalent of BaSO4 is reached within 30 min at room temperature in pH 8 buffer, conditions under which DTPA and DOTA only achieve 40% dissolution of BaSO4. When further applied for the dissolution of natural barite, macropa also outperforms DTPA, showing that this ligand is potentially valuable for industrial processes. Collectively, this work demonstrates that macropa is a highly effective chelator for Ba(2+) that can be applied for the remediation of BaSO4 scale.",2
Visualizing Kinetically Robust Co(III)4L6 Assemblies in Vivo: SPECT Imaging of the Encapsulated [(99m)Tc]TcO4(-) Anion.,"Noncovalent encapsulation is an attractive approach for modifying the efficacy and physiochemical properties of both therapeutic and diagnostic species. Abiotic self-assembled constructs have shown promise, yet many hurdles between in vitro and (pre)clinical studies remain, not least the challenges associated with maintaining the macromolecular, hollow structure under nonequilibrium conditions. Using a kinetically robust Co(III)4L6 tetrahedron we now show the feasibility of encapsulating the most widely used precursor in clinical nuclear diagnostic imaging, the gamma-emitting [(99m)Tc]TcO4(-) anion, under conditions compatible with in vivo administration. Subsequent single-photon emission computed tomography imaging of the caged-anion reveals a marked change in the biodistribution compared to the thyroid-accumulating free oxo-anion, thus moving clinical applications of (metallo)supramolecular species a step closer.",2
Imaging Insulin Secretion from Mouse Pancreas by MRI Is Improved by Use of a Zinc-Responsive MRI Sensor with Lower Affinity for Zn(2+) Ions.,"It has been demonstrated that divalent zinc ions packaged with insulin in beta-cell granules can be detected by MRI during glucose-stimulated insulin secretion using a gadolinium-based Zn(2+)-sensitive agent. This study was designed to evaluate whether a simpler agent design having single Zn(2+)-sensing moieties but with variable Zn(2+) binding affinities might also detect insulin secretion from the pancreas. Using an implanted MR-compatible window designed to hold the pancreas in a fixed position for imaging, we now demonstrate that focally intense ""hot spots"" can be detected in the tail of the pancreas using these agents after administration of glucose to stimulate insulin secretion. Histological staining of the same tissue verified that the hot spots identified by imaging correspond to clusters of islets, perhaps reflecting first-responder islets that are most responsive to a sudden increase in glucose. A comparison of images obtained when using a high-affinity Zn(2+) sensor versus a lower-affinity sensor showed that the lower-affinity sensors produced the best image contrast. An equilibrium model that considers all possible complexes formed between Zn(2+), the GdL sensor, and HSA predicts that a GdL sensor with lower affinity for Zn(2+) generates a lower background signal from endogenous Zn(2+) prior to glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and that the weaker binding affinity agent is more responsive to a further increase in Zn(2+) concentration near beta-cells after GSIS. These model predictions are consistent with the in vivo imaging observations.",2
"Carbon's Three-Center, Four-Electron Tetrel Bond, Treated Experimentally.","Tetrel bonding is the noncovalent interaction of group IV elements with electron donors. It is a weak, directional interaction that resembles hydrogen and halogen bonding yet remains barely explored. Herein, we present an experimental investigation of the carbon-centered, three-center, four-electron tetrel bond, [N-C-N](+), formed by capturing a carbenium ion with a bidentate Lewis base. NMR-spectroscopic, titration-calorimetric, and reaction-kinetic evidence for the existence and structure of this species is reported. The studied interaction is by far the strongest tetrel bond reported so far and is discussed in comparison with the analogous halogen bond. The necessity of the involvement of a bidentate Lewis base in its formation is demonstrated by providing spectroscopic and crystallographic evidence that a monodentate Lewis base induces a reaction rather than stabilizing the tetrel bond complex. A vastly decreased Lewis basicity of the bidentate ligand or reduced Lewis acidity of the carbenium ion weakens-or even prohibits-the formation of the tetrel bond complex, whereas synthetic modifications facilitating attractive orbital overlaps promote it. As the geometry of the complex resembles the SN2 transition state, it provides a model system for the investigation of fundamental reaction mechanisms and chemical bonding theories.",2
Pressure-Driven Reversible Switching between n- and p-Type Conduction in Chalcopyrite CuFeS2.,"Temperature-dependent switching between p- and n-type conduction is a newly observed phenomenon in very few Ag-based semiconductors, which may promote fascinating applications in modern electronics. Pressure, as an efficient external stimulus that has driven collective phenomena such as spin-crossover and Mott transition, is also expected to initialize a conduction-type switching in transition metal-based semiconductors. Herein, we report the observation of a pressure-driven dramatic switching between p- and n-type conduction in chalcopyrite CuFeS2 associated with a structural phase transition. Under compression around 8 GPa, CuFeS2 undergoes a phase transition with symmetry breakdown from space group I-42 d to space group I-4 accompanying with a remarkable volume shrinkage of the FeS4 tetrahedra. A high-to-low spin-crossover of Fe(2+) ( S = 2 to S = 0) is manifested along with this phase transition. Instead of pressure-driven metallization, a surprising semiconductor-to-semiconductor transition is observed associated with the structural and electronic transformations. Significantly, both photocurrent and Hall coefficient measurements confirm that CuFeS2 undergoes a reversible pressure-driven p- n conduction type switching accompanying with the structural phase transition. The absence of cationic charge transfer between copper and iron during the phase transition is confirmed by both X-ray absorption near-edge spectra (Cu/Fe, K-edge) and total-fluorescence-yield X-ray absorption spectra (Fe, K-edge) results, and the valence distribution maintains Cu(2+)Fe(2+)S2 in the high-pressure phase. The observation of an abrupt pressure-driven p- n conduction type switching in a transition metal-based semiconductor paves the way to novel pressure-responsive switching devices.",2
Metal-Ion-Responsive Bionanocomposite for Selective and Reversible Enzyme Inhibition.,"A bionanocomposite with artificial binding pockets for a DNA repair enzyme has been developed by in situ assembly of an affinity protein with a surrounding contact surface of polydopamine on the surface of silica coated magnetic nanoparticles via molecular imprinting reactions. The obtained nanoparticles exhibited antibody-like binding behavior toward the target enzyme with highly specific and efficient inhibition effect. Moreover, the binding and inhibition could be flexibly tuned by the addition of metal ions such as Mn(2+) and Mg(2+), which provided a convenient tool to regulate enzyme activity with artificially engineered nanoinhibitors.",2
Extraordinary Dielectric Properties at Heterojunctions of Amorphous Ferroelectrics.,"Materials having a high dielectric constant are needed for a variety of electrical applications from transistors to capacitors. Ferroelectric amorphous-oxide (glass) alkali-ion electrolytes of composition A2.99Ba0.005ClO (A = Li, Na) are shown by two different types of measurement and different consistent analyses to have extraordinarily high dielectric constants, varying from 10(9) at 25 degrees C to 10(10) at 220 degrees C if the glass is properly conditioned. These anomalously high dielectric properties coexist with alkali-ion conductivities at 25 degrees C that are equivalent to those of the best organic-liquid electrolytes of a Li-ion cell, and cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a Au/glass electrolyte/Au cell is stable from -10 to +10 V. A model to interpret microscopically all the key features of the CV curves shows that the electric-double-layer capacitors that form at the gold/electrolyte interfaces in the Au/glass electrolyte/Au heterojunction reverse polarization at an applied voltage V = +/-2.1 V, resulting in three almost equivalent discharging capacitances for a single physical capacitor from -10 to +10 V.",2
Highly Active Platinum Catalysts for Nitrile and Cyanohydrin Hydration: Catalyst Design and Ligand Screening via High-Throughput Techniques.,"Nitrile hydration provides access to amides that are indispensable to researchers in chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Prohibiting the use of this venerable reaction, however, are (1) the dearth of biphasic catalysts that can effectively hydrate nitriles at ambient temperatures with high turnover numbers and (2) the unsolved challenge of hydrating cyanohydrins. Herein, we report the design of new "" donor-acceptor""-type platinum catalysts by precisely arranging electron-rich and electron-deficient ligands trans to one other, thereby enhancing both the nucleophilicity of the hydroxyl group and the electrophilicity of the nitrile group. Leveraging a high-throughput, automated workflow and evaluating a library of bidentate ligands, we have discovered that commercially available, inexpensive DPPF [1,1'-ferrocenendiyl-bis(diphenylphosphine)] provides superior reactivity. The corresponding "" donor-acceptor""-type catalyst 2a is readily prepared from (DPPF)PtCl2, PMe2OH, and AgOTf. The enhanced activity of 2a permits the hydration of a wide range of nitriles and cyanohydrins to proceed at 40 degrees C with excellent turnover numbers. Rational reevaluation of the ligand structure has led to the discovery of modified catalyst 2c, harboring the more electron-rich 1,1'-bis[bis(5-methyl-2-furanyl)phosphino] ferrocene ligand, which demonstrates the highest activity toward hydration of nitriles and cyanohydrins at room temperature. Finally, the correlation between the electron-donating ability of the phosphine ligands with catalyst efficiencies of 2a, 2c, 2d, and 2e in the hydration of nitrile 7 are examined, and the results support the "" donor-acceptor"" hypothesis.",2
Electron Transport in Low Dimensional Solids: A Surface Chemistry Perspective.,"Electron transport is a fundamental process that controls the intrinsic chemical and physical properties of solid materials. The surface phase becomes dominant when downsized dimensionality into cluster scale in nanomaterials, and surface chemistry plays more and more important role in regulating electron transport. During past decades, varieties of chemical approaches have been developed to modify the surface of low dimensional solids, substantially providing versatile perspectives on engineering electron transport. In this Perspective, we focus on recent researches concerning surface chemical modification strategies, such as surface molecular adsorption, atomic incorporation, defect engineering and spin scattering to engineer electron transport of typical one-/two-dimensional systems. Under the framework of Drude's transport model, we highlight the core role of micro degrees of freedom, i.e., charge, lattice, and spin, in molecular-level understanding and optimizing the regulation effect of surface chemistry. Finally, based on the discussion and current achievements of surface chemistry effect on electron transport of low dimensional solids, some personal perspectives on the future development are also presented.",2
Plasmonic Nanosensors Reveal a Height Dependence of MinDE Protein Oscillations on Membrane Features.,"Single-particle plasmon spectroscopy has become a standard technique to detect and quantify the presence of unlabeled macromolecules. Here, we extend this method to determine their exact distance from the plasmon sensors with sub-nanometer resolution by systematically varying the sensing range into the surrounding by adjusting the size of the plasmonic nanoparticles. We improved current single-particle plasmon spectroscopy to record continuously for hours the scattering spectra of thousands of nanoparticles of different sizes simultaneously with 1.8 s time resolution. We apply this technique to study the interaction dynamics of bacterial Min proteins with supported lipid membranes of different composition. Our experiments reveal a surprisingly flexible operating mode of the Min proteins: In the presence of cardiolipin and membrane curvature induced by nanoparticles, the protein oscillation occurs on top of a stationary MinD patch. Our results reveal the need to consider membrane composition and local curvature as important parameters to quantitatively understand the Min protein system and could be extrapolated to other macromolecular systems. Our label-free method is generally easily implementable and well suited to measure distances of interacting biological macromolecules.",2
Highly Efficient and Robust Photocatalytic Systems for CO2 Reduction Consisting of a Cu(I) Photosensitizer and Mn(I) Catalysts.,"The development of highly efficient, selective, and durable photocatalytic CO2 reduction systems that only use earth-abundant elements is key for both solving global warming and tackling the shortage of energy and carbon resources. Here, we successfully developed CO2 reduction photocatalysts using [Cu2(P2bph)2](2+) (CuPS) (P2bph = 4,7-diphenyl-2,9-di(diphenylphosphinotetramethylene)-1,10-phenanthroline) as a redox photosensitizer and fac-Mn(X2bpy)(CO)3Br (Mn(4X)) (X2bpy = 4,4'-X2-2,2'-bipyridine (X = -H and -OMe) or Mn(6mes) (6mes = 6,6'-(mesityl)2-2,2'-bipyridne)) as the catalyst. The most efficient photocatalysis was achieved by Mn(4OMe): The total quantum yield of CO2 reduction products was 57%, the turnover number based on the Mn catalyst was over 1300, and the selectivity of CO2 reduction was 95%. Electronic and steric effects of the substituents (X) in the Mn complexes largely affected both the photocatalytic efficiency and the product selectivity. For example, the highest selectivity of CO formation was achieved by using Mn(6mes) (selectivity SCO = 96.6%), whereas the photocatalytic system using Mn(4H) yielded HCOOH as the main product ( SHCOOH = 74.6%) with CO and H2 as minor products ( SCO = 23.7%, SH2 = 1.7%). In these photocatalytic reactions, CuPS played its role as an efficient and very durable redox photosensitizer, while remaining stable in the reaction solution even after a turnover number of 200 had been reached (the catalyst used had a turnover number of over 1000).",2
SO2F2-Mediated Oxidative Dehydrogenation and Dehydration of Alcohols to Alkynes.,"Direct synthesis of alkynes from inexpensive, abundant alcohols was achieved in high yields (greater than 40 examples, up to 95% yield) through a SO2F2-promoted dehydration and dehydrogenation process. This straightforward transformation of sp(3)-sp(3) (C-C) bonds to sp-sp (C identical withC) bonds requires only inexpensive and readily available reagents (no transition metals) under mild conditions. The crude alkynes are sufficiently free of impurities to permit direct use in further transformations, as illustrated by regioselective Huisgen alkyne-azide cycloaddition reactions with PhN3 to give 1,4-substituted 1,2,3-traiazoles (16 examples, up to 92% yield) and Sonogashira couplings (10 examples, up to 77% yield).",2
Mapping the Substrate Recognition Pathway in Cytochrome P450.,"Cytochrome P450s are ubiquitous metalloenzymes involved in the metabolism and detoxification of foreign components via catalysis of the hydroxylation reactions of a vast array of organic substrates. However, the mechanism underlying the pharmaceutically critical process of substrate access to the catalytic center of cytochrome P450 is a long-standing puzzle, further complicated by the crystallographic evidence of a closed catalytic center in both substrate-free and substrate-bound cytochrome P450. Here, we address a crucial question whether the conformational heterogeneity prevalent in cytochrome P450 translates to heterogeneous pathways for substrate access to the catalytic center of these metalloenzymes. By atomistically capturing the full process of spontaneous substrate association from bulk solvent to the occluded catalytic center of an archetypal system P450cam in multi-microsecond-long continuous unbiased molecular dynamics simulations, we here demonstrate that the substrate recognition in P450cam always occurs through a single well-defined dominant pathway. The simulated final bound pose resulting from these unguided simulations is in striking resemblance with the crystallographic bound pose. Each individual binding trajectory reveals that the substrate, initially placed at random locations in bulk solvent, spontaneously lands on a single key channel on the protein-surface of P450cam and resides there for an uncharacteristically long period, before correctly identifying the occluded target-binding cavity. Surprisingly, the passage of substrate to the closed catalytic center is not accompanied by any large-scale opening in protein. Rather, the unbiased simulated trajectories ( approximately 57 mus) and underlying Markov state model, in combination with free-energy analysis, unequivocally show that the substrate recognition process in P450cam needs a substrate-induced side-chain displacement coupled with a complex array of dynamical interconversions of multiple metastable substrate conformations. Further, the work reconciles multiple precedent experimental and theoretical observations on P450cam and establishes a comprehensive view of substrate-recognition in cytochrome P450 that only occurs via substrate-induced structural rearrangements.",2
Ambimodal Dipolar/Diels-Alder Cycloaddition Transition States Involving Proton Transfers.,"Quantum mechanical computations and molecular dynamics simulations have been used to elucidate the factors that control reaction outcomes in ambimodal transition states leading to both dipolar and Diels-Alder cycloaddition products, which can interconvert via alpha-ketol rearrangements. The dipolar cycloaddition pathways were found to be disadvantaged due to the persistence of charge separation after the second C-C formation en route to the dipolar cycloaddition adducts. Structural modifications that result in the stabilization of the charge-separated species lead to an increase in the amount of dipolar cycloadducts formed.",2
QM-Mechanism-Based Hierarchical High-Throughput in Silico Screening Catalyst Design for Ammonia Synthesis.,"We propose and test a hierarchical high-throughput screening (HHTS) approach to catalyst design for complex catalytic reaction systems that is based on quantum mechanics (QM) derived full reaction networks with QM rate constants but simplified to examine only the reaction steps likely to be rate determining. We illustrate this approach by applying it to determine the optimum dopants (our of 35 candidates) to improve the turnover frequency (TOF) for the Fe-based Haber-Bosch ammonia synthesis process. We start from the QM-based free-energy reaction network for this reaction over Fe(111), which contains the 26 most important surface configurations and 17 transition states at operating conditions of temperature and pressure, from which we select the key reaction steps that might become rate determining for the alloy. These are arranged hierarchically by decreasing free-energy reaction barriers. We then extract from the full reaction network, a reduced set of reaction rates required to quickly predict the effect of the catalyst changes on each barrier. This allows us to test new candidates with only 1% of the effort for a full calculation. Thus, we were able to quickly screen 34 candidate dopants to select a small subset (Rh, Pt, Pd, Cu) that satisfy all criteria, including stability. Then from these four candidates expected to increase the TOF for NH3 production, we selected the best candidate (Rh) for a more complete free-energy and kinetic analysis (10 times the effort for HHTS but still 10% of the effort for a complete analysis of the full reaction network). We predict that Rh doping of Fe will increase the TOF for NH3 synthesis by a factor of approximately 3.3 times compared to Fe(111), in excellent agreement with our HHTS predictions, validating this approach.",2
Signalling and differentiation in emulsion-based multi-compartmentalized in vitro gene circuits.,"Multicellularity enables the growth of complex life forms as it allows for the specialization of cell types, differentiation and large-scale spatial organization. In a similar way, modular construction of synthetic multicellular systems will lead to dynamic biomimetic materials that can respond to their environment in complex ways. To achieve this goal, artificial cellular communication and developmental programs still have to be established. Here, we create geometrically controlled spatial arrangements of emulsion-based artificial cellular compartments containing synthetic in vitro gene circuitry, separated by lipid bilayer membranes. We quantitatively determine the membrane pore-dependent response of the circuits to artificial morphogen gradients, which are established via diffusion from dedicated organizer cells. Utilizing different types of feedforward and feedback in vitro gene circuits, we then implement artificial signalling and differentiation processes, demonstrating the potential for the realization of complex spatiotemporal dynamics in artificial multicellular systems.",2
Catalytic Radical-Polar Crossover Reactions of Allylic Alcohols.,"Radical-polar crossover hydrofunctionalizations of tertiary allylic alcohols are described. Depending on the structure of the catalyst, corresponding epoxides or semipinacol rearrangement products are selectively obtained in good yields. Experimental evidence points to the participation of alkylcobalt complexes as electrophilic intermediates.",2
Benzimidazoles as Metal-Free and Recyclable Hydrides for CO2 Reduction to Formate.,"We report a novel metal-free chemical reduction of CO2 by a recyclable benzimidazole-based organo-hydride, whose choice was guided by quantum chemical calculations. Notably, benzimidazole-based hydride donors rival the hydride-donating abilities of noble-metal-based hydrides such as [Ru(tpy)(bpy)H](+) and [Pt(depe)2H](+). Chemical CO2 reduction to the formate anion (HCOO(-)) was carried out in the absence of biological enzymes, a sacrificial Lewis acid, or a base to activate the substrate or reductant. (13)CO2 experiments confirmed the formation of H(13)COO(-) by CO2 reduction with the formate product characterized by (1)H NMR and (13)C NMR spectroscopy and ESI-MS. The highest formate yield of 66% was obtained in the presence of potassium tetrafluoroborate under mild conditions. The likely role of exogenous salt additives in this reaction is to stabilize and shift the equilibrium toward the ionic products. After CO2 reduction, the benzimidazole-based hydride donor was quantitatively oxidized to its aromatic benzimidazolium cation, establishing its recyclability. In addition, we electrochemically reduced the benzimidazolium cation to its organo-hydride form in quantitative yield, demonstrating its potential for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. These results serve as a proof of concept for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 by sustainable, recyclable, and metal-free organo-hydrides.",2
Raising the Bar in Aromatic Donor-Acceptor Interactions with Cyclic Trinuclear Gold(I) Complexes as Strong pi-Donors.,"Aromatic donor-acceptor interactions are of high importance in supramolecular chemistry, materials science and biology. Compared to other noncovalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, the binding is often weak. Here we show that strong donor-acceptor interactions between planar aromatics with binding free energies down to -10.1 kcal mol(-1) and association constants of up to 2.34 x 10(7) L mol(-1) for 1:1 complexes can be realized using cyclic trinuclear complexes of gold(I) with pyridinate, imidazolate, or carbeniate ligands. Data were obtained through NMR and UV/vis absorption spectroscopic studies and supported by quantum chemical calculations for a variety of acceptors. By using a specifically designed bridged naphthalene diimide-based acceptor with only one binding site, we furthermore show that a 1:2 (donor:acceptor) binding model is best suited to quantify the donor and acceptor/complex equilibrium. Scanning electron microscopy on selected donor-acceptor pairs shows crystalline supramolecular assemblies. We anticipate this study to be relevant for the future design of supramolecular systems and chemical sensors and the determination of binding energies between planar donors and acceptors.",2
Surface effects on exciton diffusion in non polar ZnO/ZnMgO heterostructures.,"The diffusion of excitons injected in ZnO/Zn0.92Mg0.08O quantum well heterostructures grown by metal-organic-vapor-phase-epitaxy on non-polar ZnO substrates is investigated at room temperature. Cathodoluminescence linescans in a field-emission-gun scanning-electron-microscope are performed across cleaved cross-sections. A 55 nm diffusion length is assessed for excitons in bulk ZnMgO. When prepared as small angle bevels using focused ion beam (FIB), the effective diffusion length of excitons is shown to decrease down to 8 nm in the thinner part of the slab. This effect is attributed to non-radiative surface recombinations, with a 7 x 10(4) cm s(-1) recombination velocity estimated at the FIB-machined ZnMgO surface. The strong reduction of the diffusion extent in such thin lamellae usually used for transmission electron microscopy could be use improve the spatial resolution of cathodoluminescence images, often limited by diffusion processes.",3
Doping effect on the physical properties of Ca10Pt3As8(Fe2As2)5 single crystals.,"Ca10Pt3As8(Fe2As2)5 is a unique parent compound for superconductivity, which consists of both semiconducting Pt3As8 and metallic FeAs layers. We report the observation of superconductivity induced via chemical doping in either Ca site using rare-earth (RE) elements (RE = La, Gd) or Fe site using Pt. The interlayer distance and the normal-state physical properties of the doped system change correspondingly. The coupled changes include (1) superconducting transition temperature T c increases with increasing both doping concentration and interlayer distance, (2) our T c value is higher than previously reported maximum value for Pt doping in the Fe site, (3) both the normal-state in-plane resistivity and out-of-plane resistivity change from non-metallic to metallic behavior with increasing doping concentration and T c, and (4) the transverse in-plane magnetoresistance (MRab) changes from linear-field dependence to quadratic behavior upon increasing T c. For La-doped compound with the highest T c (~35 K), upper critical fields ([Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]), coherence lengths (xi ab, xi c), and in-plane penetration depth (lambda ab) are estimated. We discuss the relationship between chemical doping, interlayer distance, and physical properties in this system.",3
Atomic-scale distortions and temperature-dependent large pseudogap in thin films of the parent iron-chalcogenide superconductor Fe1+y Te.,"We investigate with scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations the surface structures and the electronic properties of Fe1+y Te thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition. Contrary to the regular arrangement of antiferromagnetic nanostripes previously reported on cleaved single-crystal samples, the surface of Fe1+y Te thin films displays a peculiar distribution of spatially inhomogeneous nanostripes. Both STM and DFT calculations show the bias-dependent nature of such features and support the interpretation of spin-polarized tunneling between the FeTe surface and an unintentionally magnetized tip. In addition, the spatial inhomogeneity is interpreted as a purely electronic effect related to changes in hybridization and Fe-Fe bond length driven by local variations in the concentration of excess interstitial Fe cations. Unexpectedly, the surface density of states measured by STS strongly evolves with temperature in close proximity to the antiferromagnetic-paramagnetic first-order transition, and reveals a large pseudogap of 180-250 meV at about 50-65 K. We believe that in this temperature range a phase transition takes place, and the system orders and locks into particular combinations of orbitals and spins because of the interplay between excess interstitial magnetic Fe and strongly correlated d-electrons.",3
"Anharmonic, dimensionality and size effects in phonon transport.","We have developed and employed a numerically efficient semi- ab initio theory, based on density-functional and relaxation-time schemes, to examine anharmonic, dimensionality and size effects in phonon transport in three- and two-dimensional solids of different crystal symmetries. Our method uses third- and fourth-order terms in crystal Hamiltonian expressed in terms of a temperature-dependent Gruneisen's constant. All input to numerical calculations are generated from phonon calculations based on the density-functional perturbation theory. It is found that four-phonon processes make important and measurable contribution to lattice thermal resistivity above the Debye temperature. From our numerical results for bulk Si, bulk Ge, bulk MoS2 and monolayer MoS2 we find that the sample length dependence of phonon conductivity is significantly stronger in low-dimensional solids.",3
Temperature dependent structural evolution in liquid Ag<sub>50</sub>Ga<sub>50</sub> alloy.,"The temperature dependence of atomic structural evolution in the liquid Ag50Ga50 alloy has been studied by using in situ high energy X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiment combined with the first-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulations. The experimental data show a reversible structural crossover at the temperature about 1050 K. Changes in both electrical resistivity and absolute thermoelectric power at about 1100 K strongly support the XRD results. Additionally, FPMD simulations reveal an abnormal temperature dependent behavior of partial coordination number and atomic diffusivity at about 1200 K, elucidating that the partition experimentally observed changes in structure and properties could be linked with the repartition between Ag and Ga atoms in the liquid at around 1050-1200 K. This finding will trigger more studies on the structural evolution of noble-polyvalent metals in particular and metallic liquids in general.",3
"Lanthanide stannate pyrochlores (Ln<sub>2</sub>Sn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>; Ln = Nd, Gd, Er) at high pressure.","Lanthanide stannate pyrochlores (Ln2Sn2O7; Ln=Nd, Gd, and Er) were investigated in situ to 50 GPa in order to determine their structural response to compression and compare it to that of lanthanide titanate, zirconate, and hafnate pyrochlores. The cation radius ratio of A3+/B4+ in pyrochlore oxides (A2B2O7) is thought to be the dominant property that influences their compression response. The ionic radius of Sn4+ is intermediate to that of Ti4+, Zr4+, and Hf4+, but the &lt;Sn-O&gt; bond in stannate pyrochlore is more covalent than the &lt;B-O&gt; bonds in titanates, zirconate, and hafnates. In stannates, the pyrochlore cation and anion sublattices begin to disorder at 0.3 GPa. The extent of sublattice disorder vs. pressure is greater in stannates with a smaller Ln3+ cation. Stannate pyrochlores (Fd-3m) begin a sluggish transformation to a cotunnite-like structure (Pnma) at ~28 GPa; similar transitions have been observed in titanate, zirconate, and hafnate pyrochlore at varying pressures with cation radius ratio. The extent of the phase transition vs. pressure varies directly with the size of the Ln3+ cation. Post-decompression from ~50 GPa, Er2Sn2O7 and Gd2Sn2O7 adopt a pyrochlore structure, rather than the multiscale defect-fluorite + weberite structure adopted by Nd2Sn2O7 that is characteristic of titanate, zirconate, and hafnate pyrochlore treated to similar conditions. Like pyrochlore titanates, zirconates, and hafnates, the bulk modulus, B0, of stannates varies linearly and inversely with cation radius ratio. The trends of bulk moduli in stannates in this study are in excellent agreement with previous experimental studies on stannates, and suggest that the size of the Ln3+ cation is a primary determining factor of B0. Additionally, when normalized to rA/rB, the bulk moduli of stannates are comparable to those of zirconates and hafnates, which vary from titanates. Our results suggest that the cation radius ratio strongly influences the bulk moduli of stannates as well as their overall compression response.",3
Relaxation processes and physical aging in metallic glasses.,"Since their discovery in the 1960s, metallic glasses have continuously attracted much interest across the physics and materials science communities. In the forefront are their unique properties, which hold the alluring promise of broad application in fields as diverse as medicine, environmental science and engineering. However, a major obstacle to their wide-spread commercial use is their inherent temporal instability arising from underlying relaxation processes that can dramatically alter their physical properties. The result is a physical aging process which can bring about degradation of mechanical properties, namely through embrittlement and catastrophic mechanical failure. Understanding and controlling the effects of aging will play a decisive role in our on-going endeavor to advance the use of metallic glasses as structural materials, as well as in the more general comprehension of out-of-equilibrium dynamics in complex systems. This review presents an overview of the current state of the art in the experimental advances probing physical aging and relaxation processes in metallic glasses. Similarities and differences between other hard and soft matter glasses are highlighted. The topic is discussed in a multiscale approach, first presenting the key features obtained in macroscopic studies, then connecting them to recent novel microscopic investigations. Particular emphasis is put on the occurrence of distinct relaxation processes beyond the main structural process in viscous metallic melts and their fate upon entering the glassy state, trying to disentangle results and formalisms employed by the different groups of the glass-science community. A microscopic viewpoint is presented, in which physical aging manifests itself in irreversible atomic-scale processes such as avalanches and intermittent dynamics, ascribed to the existence of a plethora of metastable glassy states across a complex energy landscape. Future experimental challenges and the comparison with recent theoretical and numerical simulations are discussed as well.",3
Microfluidic multiplexing of solid-state nanopores.,"Although solid-state nanopores enable electronic analysis of many clinically and biologically relevant molecular structures, there are few existing device architectures that enable high-throughput measurement of solid-state nanopores. Herein, we report a method for microfluidic integration of multiple solid-state nanopores at a high density of one nanopore per (35 microm(2)). By configuring microfluidic devices with microfluidic valves, the nanopores can be rinsed from a single fluid input while retaining compatibility for multichannel electrical measurements. The microfluidic valves serve the dual purpose of fluidic switching and electric switching, enabling serial multiplexing of the eight nanopores with a single pair of electrodes. Furthermore, the device architecture exhibits low noise and is compatible with electroporation-based in situ nanopore fabrication, providing a scalable platform for automated electronic measurement of a large number of integrated solid-state nanopores.",3
Origin of the magnetic transition at 100 K in epsilon-Fe2O3 nanoparticles studied by x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy.,"The current study unveils the structural origin of the magnetic transition of the epsilon-Fe2O3 polymorph from an incommensurate magnetic order to a collinear ferrimagnetic state at low temperature. The high crystallinity of the samples and the absence of other iron oxide polymorphs have allowed us to carry out temperature-dependent x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy experiments out. The deformation of the structure is followed by the Debye-Waller factor for each selected Fe-O and Fe-Fe sub-shell. For nanoparticle sizes between 7 and 15 nm, the structural distortions between the Fete and Fe-D1oc sites are localized in a temperature range before the magnetic transition starts. On the contrary, the inherent interaction between the other sub-shells (named Fe-O1,2 and Fe-Fe1) provokes cooperative magneto-structural changes in the same temperature range. This means that the Fete with Fe-D1oc polyhedron interaction seems to be uncoupled with temperature dealing with these nanoparticle sizes wherein the structural distortions are likely moderate due to surface effects.",3
Spin-flip transitions in self-assembled quantum dots.,"Detailed realistic calculations of the spin-flip time (T 1) for an electron in a self-assembled quantum dot (SAQD) due to emission of an acoustic phonon, using only bulk properties with no fitting parameters, are presented. Ellipsoidal lens shaped [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text]As quantum dots, with electronic states calculated using 8-band strain dependent [Formula: see text] theory, are considered. The phonons are treated as bulk acoustic phonons coupled to the electron by both deformation potential and piezoelectric interactions. The dependence of T 1 on the geometry of SAQD, on the applied external magnetic field and on the lattice temperature is highlighted. The theoretical results are close to the experimental measurements on the spin-flip times for a single electron in QD.",3
Indium selenide monolayer: strain-enhanced optoelectronic response and dielectric environment-tunable 2D excitons features.,"Electronic and optical performances of beta-InSe monolayer (ML) are considerably boosted by tuning the corresponding band energies through the lattice in-plane compressive strain engineering. First principle calculations show an indirect-direct gap transition with large band gap size. The crossover is due to different responses of the near-gap state energies with respect to strain. This is explained by the variation of In-Se bond length, the bond nature of near-band-edge electronic orbital and of the momentum angular contribution versus in-plane compressive strain. Effective masses of charge carriers are also found to be highly modulated and significantly light at the indirect-direct gap transition. Tuned optical response of the resulting direct gap ML beta-InSe is evaluated versus applied energy to infer the allowed optical transitions, dielectric constants, semiconductor-metal behavior and refractive index. Environmental dielectric engineering of exciton behavior of the resulting direct gap ML beta-InSe is handled within the effective mass Wannier-Mott model and is expected to be important. Our results highlight the increase of binding energy and red-shifted exciton energy with decreasing screening substrates resulting in a stable exciton at room temperature .Intensity and energy of the ground state exciton emission are expected to be strongly influenced under substrates screening effect. According to our findings, the direct gap ML beta-InSe assures a tremendous 2D optoelectronic and nanoelectronic merits that could overcome several limitations of unstrained ML beta-InSe.",3
Fast and slow thermal processes in harmonic scalar lattices.,"An approach for analytical description of thermal processes in harmonic lattices is presented. We cover longitudinal and transverse vibrations of chains and out-of-plane vibrations of two-dimensional lattices with interactions of an arbitrary number of neighbors. The motion of each particle is governed by a single scalar equation and therefore the notion 'scalar lattice' is used. The evolution of initial temperature field in an infinite lattice is investigated. An exact equation describing the evolution is derived. Continualization of this equation with respect to spatial coordinates is carried out. The resulting continuum equation is solved analytically. The solution shows that the kinetic temperature is represented as the sum of two terms, one describing short time behavior, the other large time behavior. At short times, the temperature performs high-frequency oscillations caused by redistribution of energy among kinetic and potential forms (fast process). Characteristic time of this process is of the order of ten periods of atomic vibrations. At large times, changes of the temperature are caused by ballistic heat transfer (slow process). The temperature field is represented as a superposition of waves having the shape of initial temperature distribution and propagating with group velocities dependent on the wave vector. Expressions describing fast and slow processes are invariant with respect to substitution t by [Formula: see text]. However, examples considered in the paper demonstrate that these processes are irreversible. Numerical simulations show that presented theory describes the evolution of temperature field at short and large time scales with high accuracy.",3
Machine learning and data science in soft materials engineering.,"In many branches of materials science it is now routine to generate data sets of such large size and dimensionality that conventional methods of analysis fail. Paradigms and tools from data science and machine learning can provide scalable approaches to identify and extract trends and patterns within voluminous data sets, perform guided traversals of high-dimensional phase spaces, and furnish data-driven strategies for inverse materials design. This topical review provides an accessible introduction to machine learning tools in the context of soft and biological materials by 'de-jargonizing' data science terminology, presenting a taxonomy of machine learning techniques, and surveying the mathematical underpinnings and software implementations of popular tools, including principal component analysis, independent component analysis, diffusion maps, support vector machines, and relative entropy. We present illustrative examples of machine learning applications in soft matter, including inverse design of self-assembling materials, nonlinear learning of protein folding landscapes, high-throughput antimicrobial peptide design, and data-driven materials design engines. We close with an outlook on the challenges and opportunities for the field.",3
Metastable ultracondensed hydrogenous materials.,"The primary purpose of this paper is to stimulate theoretical predictions of how to retain metastably hydrogenous materials made at high pressure P on release to ambient. Ultracondensed metallic hydrogen has been made at high pressures in the fluid and reported made probably in the solid. Because the long quest for metallic hydrogen is likely to be concluded in the relatively near future, a logical question is whether another research direction, comparable in scale to the quest for metallic H, will arise in high pressure research. One possibility is retention of metastable solid metallic hydrogen and other hydrogenous materials on release of dynamic and static high pressures P to ambient. If hydrogenous materials could be retained metastably on release, those materials would be a new class of materials for scientific investigations and technological applications. This paper is a review of the current situation with the synthesis of metallic hydrogen, potential technological applications of metastable metallic H and other hydrogenous materials at ambient, and general background of published experimental and theoretical work on what has been accomplished with metastable phases in the past and thus what might be accomplished in the future.",3
Geometrical frustration yields fiber formation in self-assembly.,"Controlling the self-assembly of supramolecular structures is vital for living cells, and a central challenge for engineering at the nano- and microscales [1, 2]. Nevertheless, even particles without optimized shapes can robustly form well-defined morphologies. This is the case in numerous medical conditions where normally soluble proteins aggregate into fibers [3, 4]. Beyond the diversity of molecular mechanisms involved [5, 6], we propose that fibers generically arise from the aggregation of irregular particles with short-range interactions. Using a minimal model of ill-fitting, sticky particles, we demonstrate robust fiber formation for a variety of particle shapes and aggregation conditions. Geometrical frustration plays a crucial role in this process, and accounts for the range of parameters in which fibers form as well as for their metastable character.",3
Spin reorientation and disordered rare earth magnetism in Ho2FeCoO6.,"We report the experimental observation of spin reorientation in the double perovskite Ho2FeCoO6. The magnetic phase transitions in this compound are characterized and studied through magnetization and specific heat, and the magnetic structures are elucidated through neutron powder diffraction. Two magnetic phase transitions are observed in this compound-one at [Formula: see text] K, from paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic, and the other at [Formula: see text] K, from a phase with mixed magnetic structures to a single phase through a spin reorientation process. The magnetic structure in the temperature range 200-45 K is a mixed phase of the irreducible representations [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], both of which are antiferromagnetic. The phase with mixed magnetic structures that exists in Ho2FeCoO6 gives rise to a large thermal hysteresis in magnetization that extends from 200 K down to the spin reorientation temperature. At T N2, the magnetic structure transforms to [Formula: see text]. Though long-range magnetic order is established in the transition metal lattice, it is seen that only short-range magnetic order prevails in the Ho(3+) lattice. Our results should motivate further detailed studies on single crystals in order to explore the spin reorientation process, spin switching and the possibility of anisotropic magnetic interactions giving rise to electric polarization in Ho2FeCoO6.",3
Quasiparticle conductance-voltage characteristics for break junctions involving d-wave superconductors: charge-density-wave effects.,"Quasiparticle tunnel conductance-voltage characteristics (CVCs), [Formula: see text], were calculated for break junctions (BJs) made up of layered d-wave superconductors partially gapped by charge-density waves (CDWs). The current is assumed to flow in the ab-plane of electrodes. The influence of CDWs is analyzed by comparing the resulting CVCs with CVCs calculated for BJs made up of pure d-wave superconductors with relevant parameters. The main CDW-effects were found to be the appearance of new CVC peculiarities and the loss of CVC symmetry with respect to the V-sign. Tunnel directionality was shown to be one of the key factors in the formation of [Formula: see text] dependences. In particular, the orientation of electrodes with respect to the current channel becomes very important. As a result, [Formula: see text] can acquire a large variety of forms similar to those for tunnel junctions between superconductors with s-wave, d-wave, and mixed symmetry of their order parameters. The diversity of peculiarities is especially striking at finite temperatures. In the case of BJs made up of pure d-wave superconductors, the resulting CVC can include a two-peak gap-driven structure. The results were compared with the experimental BJ data for a number of high-T c oxides. It was shown that the large variety of the observed current-voltage characteristics can be interpreted in the framework of our approach. Thus, quasiparticle tunnel currents in the ab-plane can be used as an additional mean to detect CDWs competing with superconductivity in cuprates or other layered superconductors.",3
Absence of single critical dose for the amorphization of quartz under ion irradiation.,"In this work, we first simulated the amorphization of crystalline quartz under 50 keV [Formula: see text]Na ion irradiation with classical molecular dynamics (MD). We then used binary collision approximation algorithms to simulate the Rutherford backscattering spectrometry in channeling conditions (RBS-C) from these irradiated MD cells, and compared the RBS-C spectra with experiments. The simulated RBS-C results show an agreement with experiments in the evolution of amorphization as a function of dose, showing what appears to be (by this measure) full amorphization at about 2.2 eV[Formula: see text]. We also applied other analysis methods, such as angular structure factor, Wigner-Seitz, coordination analysis and topological analysis, to analyze the structural evolution of the irradiated MD cells. The results show that the atomic-level structure of the sample keeps evolving after the RBS signal has saturated, until the dose of about 5 eV[Formula: see text]. The continued evolution of the [Formula: see text] structure makes the definition of what is, on the atomic level, an amorphized quartz ambiguous.",3
STM contrast of a CO dimer on a Cu(1 1 1) surface: a wave-function analysis.,"We present a method used to intuitively interpret the scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) contrast by investigating individual wave functions originating from the substrate and tip side. We use localized basis orbital density functional theory, and propagate the wave functions into the vacuum region at a real-space grid, including averaging over the lateral reciprocal space. Optimization by means of the method of Lagrange multipliers is implemented to perform a unitary transformation of the wave functions in the middle of the vacuum region. The method enables (i) reduction of the number of contributing tip-substrate wave function combinations used in the corresponding transmission matrix, and (ii) to bundle up wave functions with similar symmetry in the lateral plane, so that (iii) an intuitive understanding of the STM contrast can be achieved. The theory is applied to a CO dimer adsorbed on a Cu(1 1 1) surface scanned by a single-atom Cu tip, whose STM image is discussed in detail by the outlined method.",3
Manifestation of intra-atomic 5d6s-4f exchange coupling in photoexcited gadolinium.,"Intra-atomic exchange couplings (IECs) between 5d6s and 4f electrons are ubiquitous in rare-earth metals and play a critical role in spin dynamics. However, detecting them in real time domain has been difficult. Here we show the direct evidence of IEC between 5d6s and 4f electrons in gadolinium. Upon femtosecond laser excitation, 5d6s electrons are directly excited; their majority bands shift toward the Fermi level while their minority bands do the opposite. For the first time, our first-principles minority shift now agrees with the experiment quantitatively. Excited 5d6s electrons lower the exchange potential barrier for 4f electrons, so the 4f states are also shifted in energy, a prediction that can be tested experimentally. Although a significant number of 5d6s electrons, some several eV below the Fermi level, are excited out of the Fermi sea, there is no change in the 4f states, a clear manifestation of intra-atomic exchange coupling.",3
Filamentous phages as building blocks for reconfigurable and hierarchical self-assembly.,"Filamentous bacteriophages such as fd-like viruses are monodisperse rod-like colloids that have well defined properties of diameter, length, rigidity, charge and chirality. Engineering these viruses leads to a library of colloidal rods, which can be used as building blocks for reconfigurable and hierarchical self-assembly. Their condensation in an aqueous solution with additive polymers, which act as depletants to induce attraction between the rods, leads to a myriad of fluid-like micronic structures ranging from isotropic/nematic droplets, colloid membranes, achiral membrane seeds, twisted ribbons, pi-wall, pores, colloidal skyrmions, Mobius anchors, scallop membranes to membrane rafts. These structures, and the way that they shape-shift, not only shed light on the role of entropy, chiral frustration and topology in soft matter, but also mimic many structures encountered in different fields of science. On the one hand, filamentous phages being an experimental realization of colloidal hard rods, their condensation mediated by depletion interactions constitutes a blueprint for the self-assembly of rod-like particles and provides a fundamental foundation for bio- or material-oriented applications. On the other hand, the chiral properties of the viruses restrict the generalities of some results but vastly broaden the self-assembly possibilities.",3
Two-gap superconductivity in Ag1-x Mo6S8 Chevrel phase.,"The superconducting properties of [Formula: see text]Mo6S8 [[Formula: see text]] Chevrel phase [[Formula: see text] K] are studied on a sample compacted by spark plasma sintering. Both lower ([Formula: see text] mT) and the upper [[Formula: see text] T] critical magnetic fields are obtained from magnetization and electrical resistivity measurements for the first time. The analysis of the low-temperature electronic specific heat indicates [Formula: see text]Mo6S8 to be a two band superconductor with the energy gaps [Formula: see text] meV (95%) and [Formula: see text] meV (5%). Theoretical DFT calculations reveal a much stronger electron-phonon coupling in the studied Chevrel phase compared to earlier reports. Similar to MgB2, the Fermi surface of studied Chevrel phase is formed by two hole-like and one electron-like bands.",3
Investigating the thermal dissociation of viral capsid by lattice model.,"The dissociation of icosahedral viral capsids was investigated by a homogeneous and a heterogeneous lattice model. In thermal dissociation experiments with cowpea chlorotic mottle virus and probed by small-angle neutron scattering, we observed a slight shrinkage of viral capsids, which can be related to the strengthening of the hydrophobic interaction between subunits at increasing temperature. By considering the temperature dependence of hydrophobic interaction in the homogeneous lattice model, we were able to give a better estimate of the effective charge. In the heterogeneous lattice model, two sets of lattice sites represented different capsid subunits with asymmetric interaction strengths. In that case, the dissociation of capsids was found to shift from a sharp one-step transition to a gradual two-step transition by weakening the hydrophobic interaction between AB and CC subunits. We anticipate that such lattice models will shed further light on the statistical mechanics underlying virus assembly and disassembly.",3
Quasielastic and low-energy inelastic neutron scattering study of HoCrO3 by high resolution time-of-flight neutron spectroscopy.,"In order to understand the origin of the huge quasielastic magnetic scattering observed previously with a back-scattering neutron spectrometer, we have re-investigated the low energy excitations in HoCrO3 by inelastic neutron scattering in a much wider energy range with time-of-flight neutron spectrometers. The inelastic signals are due to the excitations between the ground state doublet of the Ho ion. The quasielastic signal is due to the fluctuation of the disordered Ho moments. At low temperature the intensity of quasielastic scattering is small. It starts increasing as the temperature increases above 30 K. At the same temperature, the elastic intensity due to Ho moment ordering decreases in a similar way. This observation strengthens the hypothesis that the quasielastic scattering is due the fluctuations of the disordered Ho moments. The time scale of fluctuations has been determine from the quasielastic scattering and was found to vary from about 22 ps at [Formula: see text] K to about 2.5 ps at [Formula: see text] K. The stretched exponential line shape indicates a distribution of decay rates at low temperatures.",3
Linear magnetoresistance and surface to bulk coupling in topological insulator thin films.,"We explore the temperature dependent magnetoresistance of bulk insulating topological insulator thin films. Thin films of Bi2Se2Te and BiSbTeSe1.6 were grown using the pulsed laser deposition technique and subjected to transport measurements. Magnetotransport measurements indicate a non-saturating linear magnetoresistance (LMR) behavior at high magnetic field values. We present a careful analysis to explain the origin of LMR taking into consideration all the existing models of LMR. Here we consider that the bulk insulating states and the metallic surface states constitute two parallel conduction channels. Invoking this, we were able to explain linear magnetoresistance behavior as a competition between these parallel channels. We observe that the cross-over field, where LMR sets in, decreases with increasing temperature. We propose that this cross-over field can be used phenomenologically to estimate the strength of surface to bulk coupling.",3
Temperature dependent electron paramagnetic resonance study on magnetoelectric YCrO<sub>3</sub>.,"We report temperature dependent electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies on polycrystalline YCrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; samples at X-band (9.46 GHz) in the temperature range of 120 K to 298 K. The EPR spectra exhibit a single broad line across the whole temperature range, attributed to Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. The variation of EPR spectra parameters (line width, integrated intensity, and g-factor) as a function of temperature was analyzed to understand the nature of spin-dynamics in the paramagnetic region of YCrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. A peak in the g-factor suggests the presence of a new phase within the paramagnetic state at an intermediate point of temperature &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;IP&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 230 K, attributed to the onset of short range canted antiferromagnetic correlations in the material much above 140 K, Neel temperature (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;) of YCrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The EPR intensity increases with a decrease in temperature up to &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; due to the renormalization of the magnetic moments arising from the appearance of canted antiferromagnetic correlations. Further, temperature dependent dielectric measurements also exhibit an anomaly at ~ 230 K suggesting the presence of magnetodielectric coupling in YCrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, with a possibility towards a relatively high temperature magnetodielectric system.",3
Electrical controllable spin pump based on a zigzag silicene nanoribbon junction.,"We propose a possible electrical controllable spin pump based on a zigzag silicene nanoribbon ferromagnetic junction by applying two time-dependent perpendicular electric fields. By using the Keldysh Green's function method, we derive the analytic expression of the spin-resolved current at the adiabatic approximation and demonstrate that two asymmetric spin up and spin down currents can be pumped out in the device without an external bias. The pumped currents mainly come from the interplay between the photon-assisted spin pump effect and the electrically-modulated energy band structure of the tunneling junction. The spin valve phenomena are not only related to the energy gap opened by two perpendicular staggered potentials, but also dependent on the system parameters such as the pumping frequency, the pumping phase difference, the spin-orbit coupling and the Fermi level, which can be tuned by the electrical methods. The proposed device can also be used to produce a pure spin current and a 100% polarized spin current through the photon-assisted pumping process. Our investigations may provide an electrical manipulation of spin-polarized electrons in graphene-like pumping devices.",3
First-principles study of enhanced magnetic anisotropies in transition-metal atoms doped WS2 monolayer.,"Considerable progress in contemporary spintronics has been made in recent years for developing nanoscale data memory and quantum information processing. It is, however, still a great challenge to achieve the ultimate limit of storage bit. 2D materials, fortunately, provide an alternative solution for designing materials with the expected miniaturizing scale, chemical stability as well as giant magnetic anisotropy energy. By performing first-principles calculations, we have examined two possible doping sites on a WS2 monolayer using three kinds of transition metal (TM) atoms (Mn, Fe and Co). It is found that the TM atoms prefer to stay on the W atom site. Additionally, differently from the case of Mn, doping Co and Fe atoms on the W vacancy can achieve perpendicular magnetic anisotropy with a much larger magnitude, which provides a bright prospect for generating atomic-scale magnets of storage devices.",3
Stability of charged density waves in InAs nanowires in an external magnetic field.,We report on magnetotransport measurements at [Formula: see text] K in a high-quality InAs nanowire ([Formula: see text] kOmega) in the presence of the charged tip of an atomic force microscope serving as a mobile gate. We demonstrate the crucial role of the external magnetic field on the amplitude of the charge density waves with a wavelength of 0.8 mum. The observed suppression rate of their amplitude is similar or slightly higher than the one for weak localization correction in our investigated InAs nanowire.,3
"The magnetic structures of GdCuSn, GdAgSn and GdAuSn.","We have determined the magnetic structures of GdCuSn, GdAgSn and GdAuSn using a combination of [Formula: see text]Gd Mossbauer spectroscopy and neutron powder diffraction. Each compound shows the same antiferromagnetic ordering of the Gd sublattice. The magnetic cell is doubled along the crystallographic a-axis (propagation vector [Formula: see text]) with the moments aligned along the hexagonal c-axis, forming alternating ferromagnetic sheets of up/down Gd moments along the a-axis.",3
An empirical potential for simulating vacancy clusters in tungsten.,"We present an empirical interatomic potential for tungsten, particularly well suited for simulations of vacancy-type defects. We compare energies and structures of vacancy clusters generated with the empirical potential with an extensive new database of values computed using density functional theory, and show that the new potential predicts low-energy defect structures and formation energies with high accuracy. A significant difference to other popular embedded-atom empirical potentials for tungsten is the correct prediction of surface energies. Interstitial properties and short-range pairwise behaviour remain similar to the Ackford-Thetford potential on which it is based, making this potential well-suited to simulations of microstructural evolution following irradiation damage cascades. Using atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we predict vacancy cluster dissociation in the range 1100-1300 K, the temperature range generally associated with stage IV recovery.",3
Raman signatures of ferroic domain walls captured by principal component analysis.,"Ferroic domain walls are currently investigated by several state-of-the art techniques in order to get a better understanding of their distinct, functional properties. Here, principal component analysis (PCA) of Raman maps is used to study ferroelectric domain walls (DWs) in LiNbO3 and ferroelastic DWs in NdGaO3. It is shown that PCA allows us to quickly and reliably identify small Raman peak variations at ferroelectric DWs and that the value of a peak shift can be deduced-accurately and without a priori-from a first order Taylor expansion of the spectra. The ability of PCA to separate the contribution of ferroelastic domains and DWs to Raman spectra is emphasized. More generally, our results provide a novel route for the statistical analysis of any property mapped across a DW.",3
Self-learning kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of diffusion in ferromagnetic alpha-Fe-Si alloys.,"Diffusion of Si atom and vacancy in the A2-phase of alpha-Fe-Si alloys in the ferromagnetic state, with and without magnetic order and in various temperature ranges, are studied using AKSOME, an on-lattice self-learning KMC code. Diffusion of the Si atom and the vacancy are studied in the dilute limit and up to 12 at.% Si, respectively, in the temperature range 350-700 K. Local Si neighborhood dependent activation energies for vacancy hops were calculated on-the-fly using a broken-bond model based on pairwise interaction. The migration barrier and prefactor for the Si diffusion in the dilute limit were obtained and found to agree with published data within the limits of uncertainty. Simulations results show that the prefactor and the migration barrier for the Si diffusion are approximately an order of magnitude higher, and a tenth of an electron-volt higher, respectively, in the magnetic disordered state than in the fully ordered state. However, the net result is that magnetic disorder does not have a significant effect on Si diffusivity within the range of parameters studied in this work. Nevertheless, with increasing temperature, the magnetic disorder increases and its effect on the Si diffusivity also increases. In the case of vacancy diffusion, with increasing Si concentration, its diffusion prefactor decreases while the migration barrier more or less remained constant and the effect of magnetic disorder increases with Si concentration. Important vacancy-Si/Fe atom exchange processes and their activation barriers were identified, and the effect of energetics on ordered phase formation in Fe-Si alloys are discussed.",3
Spin-polarized confined states in Ag films on Fe(1 1 0).,"Spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of thin Ag(1 1 1) films on ferromagnetic Fe(1 1 0) shows a series of spin-polarized peaks. These features derive from Ag sp-bands, which form quantum well states and resonances due to confinement by a spin-dependent interface potential barrier. The spin-up states are broader and located at higher binding energy than the corresponding spin-down states at [Formula: see text], although the differences attenuate near the Fermi level. The spin-down states display multiple gap openings, which interrupt their parabolic-like dispersion. First-principles calculations attribute these findings to the symmetry- and spin-selective hybridization of the Ag states with the exchange-split bands of the substrate.",3
Glassy magnetic ground state and Kondo-like behaviour in Mn<sub>10</sub>FeGe<sub>8</sub> alloy.,"We report detailed investigation on the ground-state magnetic properties of newly synthesized Mn10FeGe8 alloy. The sample can be thought of being derived by substituting one Mn atom by Fe of the parent compound Mn11Ge8. Fe-substitution leads to drastic change in the magnetic ground state as well as to the magnetotransport properties of the parent alloy. On cooling below 250 K,Mn10FeGe8 undergoes a transition from paramagnetic phase to a state having significant ferromagnetic correlations. The ground state is found to be canonical spin glass (CSG) type in nature as evident from the dc magnetization and ac susceptibility measurements. Interestingly, the resistivity data shows an upturn at low temperature below about 30 K mimicking the Kondo-like behaviour. Mn10FeGe8 is turned out to be a rare example among 3d transition metal alloys, where a Kondo like state coexists within a CSG phase.",3
Spin-transfer torque in multiferroic tunnel junctions with composite dielectric/ferroelectric barriers.,"Using model calculations, we demonstrate a very high level of control of the spin-transfer torque (STT) by electric field in multiferroic tunnel junctions with composite dielectric/ferroelectric barriers. We find that, for particular device parameters, toggling the polarization direction can switch the voltage-induced part of STT between a finite value and a value close to zero, i.e. quench and release the torque. Additionally, we demonstrate that under certain conditions the zero-voltage STT, i.e. the interlayer exchange coupling, can switch sign with polarization reversal, which is equivalent to reversing the magnetic ground state of the tunnel junction. This bias- and polarization-tunability of the STT could be exploited to engineer novel functionalities such as softening/hardening of the bit or increasing the signal-to-noise ratio in magnetic sensors, which can have important implications for magnetic random access memories or for combined memory and logic devices.",3
Low field induced large magnetocaloric effect in Tm<sub>2</sub>Ni<sub>0.93</sub>Si<sub>2.93</sub> : influence of short range magnetic correlation.,"In this work, we report successful synthesis of a new intermetallic compound Tm&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.93&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2.93&lt;/sub& gt; that forms in single phase only in defect crystal structure. The compound does not show any long range magnetic ordering down to 2 K. The material exhibits large magnetic entropy change (-DeltaS&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 13.7 J/kg K) and adiabatic temperature change (DeltaT&lt;sub&gt;ad&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 4.4 K) at 2.2 K for a field change of 20 kOe which can be realized by permanent magnets, thus being very beneficial for application purpose. In the absence of long range magnetic ordering down to 2 K, metastable nature of the low temperature spin dynamics and short range magnetic correlations are considered to be responsible for such large magnetocaloric effect (MCE) over a wide temperature region.",3
"Effect of Gd and Cr substitution on the structural, electronic and magnetic phases of SrRuO3: a case study of doping and chemical phase separation.","We explore the crystal structure, electrical resistivity and magnetic behavior of the compositional series (SrRuO3)[Formula: see text] (GdCrO3) x (where [Formula: see text]), which resides between orthorhombic ferromagnetic (FM) metal SrRuO3 ([Formula: see text] K) and orthorhombic antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulator GdCrO3 ([Formula: see text] K). Crystal structure analysis reveals that complete solid solution exists only up to [Formula: see text], above which chemical phase separation of two/three phases occurs, and persists up to [Formula: see text]. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurement also corroborates the existence of [Formula: see text] for the intermediate composition [Formula: see text], which reinforces the astonishing scheelite-type GdCrO4 formation (at ambient pressure) for [Formula: see text] compositions. Electrical resistivity measurements affirm the temperature driven metal to insulator (M-I) transition for [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] samples. Low temperature insulating state in these samples is interpreted by electron-electron interaction of weak disordered systems. Precise analysis of temperature dependent resistivity for [Formula: see text] samples (which have insulating ground state) dictate that the transport phenomenon is mainly associated with Arrhenius-type charge conduction, Mott's variable range hopping, short-range and long-range Coulomb interaction mediated hopping processes, due to the high degree of randomness. Interruption of magnetic Ru-O-Ru interaction by Ru-O-Cr and Cr-O-Cr interactions lowers the FM transition temperature (T C), and thereby introduces Griffiths phase in phase separated samples. Furthermore, we believe that a sharp rise in magnetization at low temperature for [Formula: see text] samples is due to the formation of AFM GdCrO4 phase. Prominent thermal hysteresis in temperature dependent magnetization curves for [Formula: see text], and appearance of spin-reorientation transition for [Formula: see text] are the distinct indications for transformation into canted AFM GdCrO3 oxide at higher x. The effective magnetic moment ([Formula: see text]) continuously increases with the incorporation of higher moment elements (Gd and Cr); while coercive field (H C) exhibits an abrupt variation as a function of x at the onset of phase separation.",3
Accuracy of dielectric-dependent hybrid functionals in the prediction of optoelectronic properties of metal oxide semiconductors: a comprehensive comparison with many-body GW and experiments.,"Understanding the electronic structure of metal oxide semiconductors is crucial to their numerous technological applications, such as photoelectrochemical water splitting and solar cells. The needed experimental and theoretical knowledge goes beyond that of pristine bulk crystals, and must include the effects of surfaces and interfaces, as well as those due to the presence of intrinsic defects (e.g. oxygen vacancies), or dopants for band engineering. In this review, we present an account of the recent efforts in predicting and understanding the optoelectronic properties of oxides using ab initio theoretical methods. In particular, we discuss the performance of recently developed dielectric-dependent hybrid functionals, providing a comparison against the results of many-body GW calculations, including G 0 W 0 as well as more refined approaches, such as quasiparticle self-consistent GW. We summarize results in the recent literature for the band gap, the band level alignment at surfaces, and optical transition energies in defective oxides, including wide gap oxide semiconductors and transition metal oxides. Correlated transition metal oxides are also discussed. For each method, we describe successes and drawbacks, emphasizing the challenges faced by the development of improved theoretical approaches. The theoretical section is preceded by a critical overview of the main experimental techniques needed to characterize the optoelectronic properties of semiconductors, including absorption and reflection spectroscopy, photoemission, and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS).",3
Conformational effects in photoelectron circular dichroism.,"Photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) is a novel type of spectroscopy, which presents surprising sensitivity to conformational effects in chiral systems. While classical photoelectron spectroscopy mainly responds to conformational effects in terms of energy level shifts, PECD provides a rich and detailed response to tiny changes in electronic and structural properties by means of the intensity dispersion of the circular dichroism as a function of photoelectron kinetic energy. In this work, the basics of PECD will be outlined, emphasizing the role of interference from the [Formula: see text] outgoing partial wave of the photoelectron in the PECD transition matrix element, which is responsible for the extreme sensitivity to conformational effects. Examples using molecular systems and interfaces will shed light on the powerful application of PECD to classical conformational effects such as group substitution, isomerism, conformer population and clustering. Moreover, the PECD results will be reported in challenging new fields where conformations play a key role, such as vibrational effects, transient chirality and time- resolved experiments. To date, PECD has mostly been based on synchrotron radiation facilities, but it also has a future as a table-top lab experiment by means of multiphoton ionization. An important application of PECD as an analytical tool will be reported. The aim of this review is to illustrate that in PECD, the presence of conformational effects is essential for understanding a wide range of effects from a new perspective, making it different from classical spectroscopy.",3
Observation of pseudogap in MgB2.,"We investigate the electronic structure of a specially prepared highly dense conventional high temperature superconductor, MgB2, employing high resolution photoemission spectroscopy. The spectral evolution close to the Fermi energy is commensurate to BCS descriptions as expected. However, the spectra in the wider energy range reveal the emergence of a pseudogap much above the superconducting transition temperature indicating an apparent departure from the BCS scenario. The energy scale of the pseudogap is comparable to the energy of the [Formula: see text] phonon mode responsible for superconductivity in MgB2 and the pseudogap can be attributed to the effect of electron-phonon coupling on the electronic structure. These results reveal a scenario of the emergence of the superconducting gap within an electron-phonon coupling induced pseudogap and have significant implications in the study of high temperature superconductors.",3
Assembly/disassembly of a complex icosahedral virus to incorporate heterologous nucleic acids.,"Hollow protein containers are widespread in nature, and include virus capsids as well as eukaryotic and bacterial complexes. Protein cages are studied extensively for applications in nanotechnology, nanomedicine and materials science. Their inner and outer surfaces can be modified chemically or genetically, and the internal cavity can be used to template, store and/or arrange molecular cargos. Virus capsids and virus-like particles (VLP, noninfectious particles) provide versatile platforms for nanoscale bioengineering. Study of capsid protein self-assembly into monodispersed particles, and of VLP structure and biophysics is necessary not only to understand natural processes, but also to infer how these platforms can be redesigned to furnish novel functional VLP. Here we address the assembly dynamics of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), a complex icosahedral virus. IBDV has a ~70 nm-diameter T = 13 capsid with VP2 trimers as the only structural subunits. During capsid assembly, VP2 is synthesized as a precursor (pVP2) whose C terminus is cleaved. The pVP2 C terminus has an amphipathic helix that controls VP2 polymorphism. In the absence of the VP3 scaffolding protein, necessary for control of assembly, 466/456-residue pVP2 intermediates bearing this helix assemble into VLP only when expressed with an N-terminal His6 tag (the HT-VP2-466 protein). HT-VP2-466 capsids are optimal for genetic insertion of proteins (cargo space ~78 000 nm(3)). We established an in vitro assembly/disassembly system of HT-VP2-466-based VLP for heterologous nucleic acid packaging and/or encapsulation of drugs and other molecules. HT-VP2-466 (empty) capsids were disassembled and reassembled by dialysis against low-salt/basic pH and high-salt/acid pH buffers, respectively, thus illustrating the reversibility in vitro of IBDV capsid assembly. HT-VP2-466 VLP also packed heterologous DNA by non-specific confinement during assembly. These and previous results establish the bases for biotechnological applications based on the IBDV capsid and its ability to incorporate exogenous proteins and nucleic acids.",3
Current-induced instability of domain walls in cylindrical nanowires.,"We study the current-driven domain wall (DW) motion in cylindrical nanowires using micromagnetic simulations by implementing the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with nonlocal spin-transfer torque in a finite difference micromagnetic package. We find that in the presence of DW, Gaussian wave packets (spin waves) will be generated when the charge current is suddenly applied to the system. This effect is excluded when using the local spin-transfer torque. The existence of spin waves emission indicates that transverse domain walls can not move arbitrarily fast in cylindrical nanowires although they are free from the Walker limit. We establish an upper velocity limit for DW motion by analyzing the stability of Gaussian wave packets using the local spin-transfer torque. Micromagnetic simulations show that the stable region obtained by using nonlocal spin-transfer torque is smaller than that by using its local counterpart. This limitation is essential for multiple DWs since the instability of Gaussian wave packets will break the structure of multiple DWs.",3
Alternative long-ranged charge optimized many-body potential for aluminium.,"A new COMB3 potential was developed for aluminium, which focuses on long-range interaction and phase transition. The potential was developed by fitting the equilibrium lattice properties of different phases and defects to ensure its transferability to general systems. The quality of the potential was tested in several problems and compared with the EAM potential as well as the published COMB3 potential, the effect of the cutoff method was studied in detail to demonstrate the necessity to extend the cutoff region. Systems of strong deformations along the Bain path, under a trigonal strain and with planar stacking faults were calculated and the present potential performed as well as the EAM potential. At last, a surface process that involves adsorption and diffusion was studied using the present potential.",3
Experimental observation of hysteresis in a coherent metal-hydride phase transition.,"We investigate the hysteresis obtained in the hydrogen absorption and desorption cycle for a single crystal [Formula: see text] superlattice. Below the critical temperature, a small but clear hysteresis is observed in the pressure-composition isotherms, while it is absent above. The experimental results thereby prove the relevance of macroscopic energy barriers for obtaining hysteresis in coherent structural transformations. The textured Pd layer exhibits substantially larger hysteresis effects, which can be related to an irreversible energy loss caused by defect generation in Pd.",3
Temperature and impurity effect on parallel field magnetoconductance of bulk insulating topological insulator (Bi<sub>1-x</sub>Sb<sub>x</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>.,"We have performed a systematic parallel field magnetotransport studies of (Bi&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T e&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to understand the temperature and impurity effect on interference of bulk conductance on the surface states of highly insulating topologically insulating compound Bi2Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The compound exhibits a weak antilocalization effect (WAL) at low temperature and low magnetic field. WAL weakens and weak localization (WL) effect is observed to be developed in the compound with the increase in the temperature due to the creation of topologically trivial 2D electron gas (2DEG) states. Strong interlayer interference and coupling of bulk carriers with surface states are observed at low temperature. Similar kind of temperature effect is observed for all the concentrations of Sb. Topologically protected surface states enhance with the increase in Sb contents up to x=0.3, however, further increase in the Sb concentration leads to decrease in the surface states. The data has been analysed by the generalised Altshuler and Aronov model for parallel field transport anticipating weak antilocalization and interlayer interference.",3
Anisotropic thermal and electrical transport of Weyl semimetal TaAs.,"We report on anisotropic electrical, thermal as well as thermoelectric properties of the prototypical Weyl semimetal TaAs. Compared to the normal metallic behavior along a axis, TaAs is more electrically resistive along c axis and exhibits a semiconductor-like resistivity upturn below [Formula: see text] K. In the same temperature range, the thermal conductivity along c axis shows a pronounced maximum of 183 [Formula: see text] characteristic of a crystalline solid, three times higher than that of a axis. The thermoelectric power, while exhibiting enhanced values around room temperature, becomes diminished in a substantial range of temperature ([Formula: see text] K) for both axes. Together with the enhanced Nernst signals, this hints at a dominating ambipolar diffusion as is frequently seen in a compensated semimetal. An in-depth investigation of the anisotropic transport quantities is expected to yield deep insights into the propagating Weyl fermions in TaAs.",3
Effect of increasing disorder on domains of the 2d Coulomb glass.,"We have studied a two dimensional lattice model of Coulomb glass for a wide range of disorders at [Formula: see text]. The system was first annealed using Monte Carlo simulation. Further minimization of the total energy of the system was done using an algorithm developed by Baranovskii et al, followed by cluster flipping to obtain the pseudo-ground states. We have shown that the energy required to create a domain of linear size L in d dimensions is proportional to [Formula: see text]. Using Imry-Ma arguments given for random field Ising model, one gets critical dimension [Formula: see text] for Coulomb glass. The investigation of domains in the transition region shows a discontinuity in staggered magnetization which is an indication of a first-order type transition from charge-ordered phase to disordered phase. The structure and nature of random field fluctuations of the second largest domain in Coulomb glass are inconsistent with the assumptions of Imry and Ma, as was also reported for random field Ising model. The study of domains showed that in the transition region there were mostly two large domains, and that as disorder was increased the two large domains remained, but a large number of small domains also opened up. We have also studied the properties of the second largest domain as a function of disorder. We furthermore analysed the effect of disorder on the density of states, and showed a transition from hard gap at low disorders to a soft gap at higher disorders. At [Formula: see text], we have analysed the soft gap in detail, and found that the density of states deviates slightly ([Formula: see text]) from the linear behaviour in two dimensions. Analysis of local minima show that the pseudo-ground states have similar structure.",3
Magnetization dynamics of weak stripe domains in Fe-N thin films: a multi-technique complementary approach.,"The resonant eigenmodes of an alpha'-FeN thin film characterized by weak stripe domains are investigated by Brillouin light scattering and broadband ferromagnetic resonance experiments, assisted by micromagnetic simulations. The spectrum of the dynamic eigenmodes in the presence of the weak stripes is very rich and two different families of modes can be selectively detected using different techniques or different experimental configurations. Attention is paid to the evolution of the mode frequencies and spatial profiles under the application of an external magnetic field, of variable intensity, in the direction parallel or transverse to the stripes. The different evolution of the modes with the external magnetic field is accompanied by a distinctive spatial localization in specific regions, such as the closure domains at the surface of the stripes and the bulk domains localized in the inner part of the stripes. The complementarity of BLS and FMR techniques, based on different selection rules, is found to be a fruitful tool for the study of the wealth of localized magnetic excitations generally found in nanostructures.",3
Electrical and thermoelectric transport properties of two-dimensional fermionic systems with k-cubic spin-orbit coupling.,"We investigate the effect of k-cubic spin-orbit interaction on the electrical and thermoelectric transport properties of two-dimensional fermionic systems. We obtain exact analytical expressions of the inverse relaxation time (IRT) and the Drude conductivity for long-range Coulomb and short-range delta scattering potentials. The IRT reveals that the scattering is completely suppressed along the three directions [Formula: see text] with [Formula: see text]. We also obtain analytical results of the thermopower and thermal conductivity at low temperature. The thermoelectric transport coefficients obey the Wiedemann-Franz law, even in the presence of k-cubic Rashba spin-orbit interaction (RSOI) at low temperature. In the presence of a quantizing magnetic field, the signature of the RSOI is revealed through the appearance of the beating pattern in the Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations of thermopower and thermal conductivity in the low magnetic field regime. The empirical formulae for the SdH oscillation frequencies accurately describe the locations of the beating nodes. The beating pattern in magnetothermoelectric measurement can be used to extract the spin-orbit coupling constant.",3
Advanced capabilities for materials modelling with Quantum ESPRESSO.,"Quantum EXPRESSO is an integrated suite of open-source computer codes for quantum simulations of materials using state-of-the-art electronic-structure techniques, based on density-functional theory, density-functional perturbation theory, and many-body perturbation theory, within the plane-wave pseudopotential and projector-augmented-wave approaches. Quantum EXPRESSO owes its popularity to the wide variety of properties and processes it allows to simulate, to its performance on an increasingly broad array of hardware architectures, and to a community of researchers that rely on its capabilities as a core open-source development platform to implement their ideas. In this paper we describe recent extensions and improvements, covering new methodologies and property calculators, improved parallelization, code modularization, and extended interoperability both within the distribution and with external software.",3
Doping Effect on the Physical Properties of Ca<sub>10</sub>Pt<sub>3</sub>As<sub>8</sub>(Fe<sub>2</sub>As<sub>2</sub>)<sub>5</ sub> Single Crystals.,"Ca10Pt3As8(Fe2As2)5 is a unique parent compound for superconductivity, which consists of both semiconducting Pt3As8 and metallic FeAs layers. We report the observation of superconductivity induced via chemical doping in either Ca site using rare-earth (RE) elements (RE = La, Gd) or Fe site using Pt. The interlayer distance and the normal-state physical properties of the doped system change correspondingly. The coupled changes include (1) superconducting transition temperature T_c increases with increasing both doping concentration and interlayer distance, (2) our Tc value is higher than previously reported maximum value for Pt doping in the Fe site, (3) both the normal-state in-plane resistivity and out-of-plane resistivity change from non-metallic to metallic behavior with increasing doping concentration and Tc, and (4) the transverse in-plane magnetoresistance (MRab) changes from linear-field dependence to quadratic behavior upon increasing Tc. For La-doped compound with the highest Tc (~35 K), upper critical fields (""H"" _""c2"" ^""ab"" , ""H"" _""c2"" ^""c"" ), coherence lengths (xiab, xic), and in-plane penetration depth (lambdaab) are estimated. We discuss the relationship between chemical doping, interlayer distance, and physical properties in this system.",3
Stable ultra-thin CdTe crystal: a robust direct gap semiconductor.,"Employing density functional theory based calculations, we investigate structural, vibrational and strain-dependent electronic properties of an ultra-thin CdTe crystal structure that can be derived from its bulk counterpart. It is found that this ultra-thin crystal has an 8-atom primitive unit cell with considerable surface reconstructions. Dynamic stability of the structure is predicted based on its calculated vibrational spectrum. Electronic band structure calculations reveal that both electrons and holes in single layer CdTe possess anisotropic in-plane masses and mobilities. Moreover, we show that the ultra-thin CdTe has some interesting electromechanical features, such as strain-dependent anisotropic variation of the band gap value, and its rapid increase under perpendicular compression. The direct band gap semiconducting nature of the ultra-thin CdTe crystal remains unchanged under all types of applied strain. With a robust and moderate direct band gap, single-layer CdTe is a promising material for nanoscale strain dependent device applications.",3
Two-dimensional thio- and seleno-cyanates of Mo and W.,"The stability of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal di-chalcogenides (TMDC) is controlled by the fact that sulfur or selenium atoms can cap the 2D layers without exposing highly reactive bonds. Here we use first-principles calculations to show that a similar structural motif can stabilize Mo- and W-based 2D materials with thio- or seleno-cyanate groups. In particular, we show that the formation of Mo(SeCN)2, W(SCN)2 and W(SeCN)2 sheets is energetically favorable and can lead to various configurations that resemble the well-known polymorphs of TMDCs. The lowest-energy structures are small-gap semiconductors, while certain polytypes bear Dirac-like cones close to the Fermi energy, demonstrating the potential of these new 2D materials for applications in modern electronic devices.",3
A systematic study of 4d and 5d transition metal mediated exchange coupling between Fe and Gd nanolaminates.,"We present a systematic study of the magnetic coupling between iron and gadolinium layers intermediated by 4d and 5d transition metals using density functional theory. We demonstrate that it is possible to find a magnetic coupling for most of them. In particular, for the early transition metals (d (1), d (2), d (3) and d (4)), a ferromagnetic coupling occurs even stronger than the 3d interlayers. Atomic size and the electronic configuration of the transition metals are crucial for the nature of the coupling. All the open shell transition metals present induced magnetic moments. By increasing the number of interlayers, an oscillating behavior in the magnetic coupling was found and the magnetic coupling goes to zero beyond four spacer layers. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that the interlayer strongly enhances the critical temperature in the Gd layers closest to the interface.",3
Ab initio simulations of water splitting on hematite.,"In recent years, hematite has attracted great interest as a photocatalyst for water splitting, but many questions remain unanswered about the mechanisms and the main limiting factors. For this reason, density functional theory has been used to understand the optical, electronic and chemical properties of this material at an atomistic level. Bulk doping can be used to reduce the band gap, and to increase photoabsorption and charge mobility. Charge transport takes place through adiabatic polaron hopping. The stable (0 0 0 1) surface has a stoichiometric termination when exposed to oxygen, it becomes hydroxylated in water, and it has an oxygen-rich termination under illumination in a photoelectrochemical setup. On the oxygen-rich termination, surface states are present that might act as recombination centres for electrons and holes. On the contrary, on the hydroxylated termination surface states appear only on reaction intermediates. The intrinsic surface states disappear in the presence of an overlayer of gallium oxide. The reaction of water oxidation is assumed to proceed by four proton-coupled electron transfers and it is shown to involve a nucleophilic attack with the formation of an OOH group. Calculated overpotentials are in the range of 0.5-0.6 V. Open questions and future research directions are briefly discussed.",3
Chemical states of surface oxygen during CO oxidation on Pt(1 1 0) surface revealed by ambient pressure XPS.,"The study of CO oxidation on Pt(1 1 0) surface is revisited using ambient pressure x-ray photoemission spectroscopy. When the surface temperature reaches the activation temperature for CO oxidation under elevated pressure conditions, both the alpha-phase of PtO2 oxide and chemisorbed oxygen are formed simultaneously on the surface. Due to the exothermic nature of CO oxidation, the temperature of the Pt surface increases as CO oxidation takes place. As the CO/O2 ratio increases, the production of CO2 increases continuously and the surface temperature also increases. Interestingly, within the diffusion limited regions, the amount of surface oxide changes little while the chemisorbed oxygen is reduced.",3
CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB structures with orthogonal easy axes: perpendicular anisotropy and damping.,"We report on the Gilbert damping parameter alpha, the effective magnetization [Formula: see text], and the asymmetry of the g-factor in bottom-CoFeB(0.93 nm)/MgO(0.90-1.25 nm)/CoFeB(1.31 nm)-top as-deposited systems. Magnetization of CoFeB layers exhibits a specific noncollinear configuration with orthogonal easy axes and with [Formula: see text] values of [Formula: see text] kG and [Formula: see text] kG for the bottom and top layers, respectively. We show that [Formula: see text] depends on the asymmetry [Formula: see text] of the g-factor measured in the perpendicular and the in-plane directions revealing a highly nonlinear relationship. In contrast, the Gilbert damping is practically the same for both layers. Annealing of the films results in collinear easy axes perpendicular to the plane for both layers. However, the linewidth is strongly increased due to enhanced inhomogeneous broadening.",3
Revisiting local structural changes in GeO2 glass at high pressure.,"Despite the great importance in fundamental and industrial fields, understanding structural changes for pressure-induced polyamorphism in network-forming glasses remains a formidable challenge. Here, we revisited the local structural transformations in GeO2 glass up to 54 GPa using x-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy via a combination diamond anvil cell and polycapillary half-lens. Three polyamorphic transitions can be clearly identified by XAFS structure refinement. First, a progressive increase of the nearest Ge-O distance and bond disorder to a maximum at ~5-16 GPa, in the same pressure region of previously observed tetrahedral-octahedral transformation. Second, a marked decrease of the nearest Ge-O distance at ~16-22.6 GPa but a slight increase at ~22.6-32.7 GPa, with a concomitant decrease of bond disorder. This stage can be related to a second-order-like transition from less dense to dense octahedral glass. Third, another decrease in the nearest Ge-O distance at ~32.7-41.4 GPa but a slight increase up to 54 GPa, synchronized with a gradual increase of bond disorder. This stage provides strong evidence for ultrahigh-pressure polyamorphism with coordination number >6. Furthermore, cooperative modification is observed in more distant shells. Those results provide a unified local structural picture for elucidating the polyamorphic transitions and densification process in GeO2 glass.",3
Photonic surface waves on metamaterial interfaces.,"A surface wave (SW) in optics is a light wave, which is supported at an interface of two dissimilar media and propagates along the interface with its field amplitude exponentially decaying away from the boundary. Research on surface waves has been flourishing in the last few decades due to their unique properties of surface sensitivity and field localization. These features have resulted in applications in nano-guiding, sensing, light-trapping and imaging based on near-field techniques, contributing to the establishment of nanophotonics as a field of research. Up to now, a wide variety of surface waves has been investigated in numerous material and structure settings. This article reviews the recent progress and development in the physics of SWs localized at metamaterial interfaces, as well as bulk media in order to provide broader perspectives on optical surface waves in general. For each type of surface wave, we discuss the material and structural platforms. We mainly focus on experimental realizations in the visible and near-infrared wavelength ranges. We also address existing and potential application of SWs in chemical and biological sensing, and experimental excitation and characterization methods.",3
Bilayers of Ni3C12S12 and Pt3C12S12: graphene-like 2D topological insulators tunable by electric fields.,"In the present work we predict, through first-principles calculations, that bilayers of the recently synthesized Ni3 [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] and Pt3 [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] layered materials are topological insulators upon electron doping, and that their topological insulator properties can be modulated by the application of electric fields with magnitudes achievable in devices. The electronic structures of both bilayers are characterized by spin-orbit split graphene-like bands, with gap magnitudes that are three orders of magnitude larger than graphene's. In ribbon geometries, chiral edge modes develop at each side with band dispersions similar to that of Kane-Mele graphene model. Surprisingly, the edge states' spin-propagation locking occurs even for very thin ribbons. We also find that the response of the electronic structure of both materials to applied electric fields are similar to both graphene and the Kane-Mele model with a Rashba term. All these findings indicate that these bilayer systems can be considered as large-spin-orbit graphene analogues with a strong sensitivity to applied electric fields.",3
Monovacancy paramagnetism in neutron-irradiated graphite probed by (13)C NMR.,"We report on the magnetic properties of monovacancy defects in neutron-irradiated graphite, probed by (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The bulk paramagnetism of the defect moments is revealed by the temperature dependence of the NMR frequency shift and spectral linewidth, both of which follow a Curie behavior, in agreement with measurements of the macroscopic magnetization. Compared to pristine graphite, the fluctuating hyperfine fields generated by the defect moments lead to an enhancement of the (13)C nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate [Formula: see text] by about two orders of magnitude. With an applied magnetic field of 7.1 T, the temperature dependence of [Formula: see text] below about 10 K can well be described by a thermally activated form, [Formula: see text], yielding a singular Zeeman energy of ([Formula: see text]) meV, in excellent agreement with the sole presence of polarized, non-interacting defect moments.",3
Relaxation dynamics and polydispersivity associated with defects and ferroelectric correlations in Ba-doped EuTiO3.,"We present the frequency- and temperature-dependent dielectric response of Eu1-x Ba x TiO3 (0 x 0.5) in detail. Excluding grain boundary effects, four relaxation mechanisms were observed. Relaxation dynamics were observed to arise due to hopping conduction associated with defects, namely oxygen vacancies as well as Eu(3+) and Ti(3+) ions. Dielectric relaxation analysis led to the identification of Ti ions in two different environments with different relaxation rates in the overall EuTiO3 perovskite structure. The emergence of another relaxation mechanism associated with ferroelectric order as a consequence of the formation of polar regions was also observed for higher Ba concentrations. The addition of Ba led to the identification of relaxation dynamics associated with hopping conduction between Eu ions, Ti ions (in the regions with and without oxygen vacancies) and with the formation of ferroelectric polar regions. Furthermore, the polydispersivity and relaxation times were extracted within the framework of the modified Debye model. Relaxation times have been observed to increase with a decrease in temperature while larger values of polydispersivity reveal a wide distribution of relaxation times due to the presence of lattice parameter and energy barrier distributions.",3
Polaron effect on the bandgap modulation in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides.,"We theoretically study the bandgap modulation in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) originating from the carrier-optical phonon coupling in the Frohlich polaron model, in which both of the surface optical phonons modes induced by the polar substrate and the intrinsic longitudinal optical phonons modes have been taken into account. We find that the modulated magnitude of the bandgap is in the range of 100-500 meV by altering different polar substrates and tuning the internal distance between TMDs and polar substrate. The large tunability of the bandgap not only provides a possible explanation for the experimental measurements regarding the dielectric environmental sensitivity of the bandgap, but also holds promise for potential applications in optoelectronics and photovoltaics.",3
Twofold stationary states in the classical spin-Hall effect.,"The stationary states occurring in spin-Hall devices are investigated within the framework of the phenomenological two spin-channel model. It is shown that two different stationary states can be defined, which depends on the redistribution of the electric charges between the two spin-channels during the transient time. A first stationary state can be reached if the charge accumulation occurs inside each spin channel independently, while a second stationary state is reached if the two spin channels are undifferentiated from the point of view of the electric charge accumulation. The screening equations that describe the accumulation of electric charges due to spin-orbit coupling are derived in both cases, and the two stationary states are discussed in terms of the Dyakonov-Perel transport equations. It is shown that the equations should be generalized to spin-dependent electric fields in order to take into account the first stationary state. In both cases, the phenomenology is compatible with experimental observations.",3
Polarization rotation and the electrocaloric effect in barium titanate.,"We study the electrocaloric effect in the classic ferroelectric BaTiO3 through a series of phase transitions driven by applied electric field and temperature. We find both negative and positive electrocaloric effects, with the negative electrocaloric effect, where temperature decreases with applied field, in monoclinic phases. Macroscopic polarization rotation is evident through the monoclinic and orthorhombic phases under applied field, and is responsible for the negative electrocaloric effect.",3
Optical properties of graphene nanocones under electric and magnetic fields.,Here we present a theoretical study of the optical properties of graphene nanocones tuned by external electric and magnetic fields. We investigate the effects of the size and topology of the carbon nanostructures on the density of states and on the electro- and magneto-absorption of linearly polarized electromagnetic radiation in different nanocone geometries. We find that the electric field induces changes in the electric charge distribution mainly at the cone edges. In the infrared range the absorption coefficient shows a peculiar dependence on the electric field (magnitude and direction) and on the photon polarization for all investigated structures. Our results suggest that the electric field may be used to control the electric charge at the apex and for a selective light absorption. The presence of an axial magnetic field induces new features in the nanocone density of states due to the induced localization effects. For high fields the density of states exhibits a sequence of peaks resembling the graphene Landau spectra. The magneto-absorption spectra present a series of resonances strongly sensitive to the photon polarization opening routes for manipulation of the optical responses.,3
Squeezed Dirac and topological magnons in a bosonic honeycomb optical lattice.,"Quantum information storage using charge-neutral quasiparticles is expected to play a crucial role in the future of quantum computers. In this regard, magnons or collective spin-wave excitations in solid-state materials are promising candidates in the future of quantum computing. Here, we study the quantum squeezing of Dirac and topological magnons in a bosonic honeycomb optical lattice with spin-orbit interaction by utilizing the mapping to quantum spin-[Formula: see text] XYZ Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice with discrete Z2 symmetry and a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We show that the squeezed magnons can be controlled by the Z2 anisotropy and demonstrate how the noise in the system is periodically modified in the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases of the model. Our results also apply to solid-state honeycomb (anti)ferromagnetic insulators.",3
Large-scale calculations of thermoelectric transport coefficients: a case study of gamma-graphyne with point defects.,"Defects such as vacancies and impurities could have profound effects on the transport properties of thermoelectric materials. However, it is usually quite difficult to directly calculate the thermoelectric properties of defect-containing systems via first-principles methods since a very large supercell is required. In this work, based on the linear response theory and the kernel polynomial method, we present an efficient approach that can help to calculate the thermoelectric transport coefficients of a large system containing millions of atoms at arbitrary chemical potential and temperature. As a prototype example, we consider dilute vacancies and hydrogen impurities in a large-scale gamma-graphyne sheet and discuss their effects on the thermoelectric transport properties.",3
Effect of hydrostatic pressure on the superconducting properties of quasi-1D superconductor K2Cr3As3.,"K2Cr3As3 is a newly discovered quasi-1D superconductor with a T c = 6.1 K and an upper critical field micro 0 H c2(0) approximately 40 T three times larger than the Pauli paramagnetic limit micro 0 H p that is suggestive of a spin-triplet Cooper pairing. In this paper, we have investigated the effects of hydrostatic pressure on its T c and micro 0 H c2 by measuring the ac magnetic susceptibility chi'(T) under magnetic fields at various hydrostatic pressures up to 7.5 GPa. The major findings include: (1) T c is suppressed gradually to below 2 K at 7.5 GPa; (2) the estimated micro 0 H c2(0) decreases dramatically to below micro 0 H p above ~2 GPa and becomes slight lower than the orbital limiting field [Formula: see text] estimated from the initial slope of upper critical field via [Formula: see text] = -0.73T cdH c2/[Formula: see text] in the clean limit; (3) the estimated Maki parameter alpha = radical2[Formula: see text]/H p drops from 4 at ambient pressure to well below 1 at P > 2 GPa, suggesting the crossover from Pauli paramagnetic limiting to orbital limiting in the pair breaking process upon increasing pressure. These observations suggested that the application of hydrostatic pressure could drive K2Cr3As3 away from the ferromagnetic instability and lead to a breakdown of the spin-triplet pairing channel. We have also made a side-by-side comparison and discussed the distinct effects of chemical and physical pressures on the superconducting properties of K2Cr3As3.",3
Evidence for the confinement of magnetic monopoles in quantum spin ice.,"Magnetic monopoles are hypothesised elementary particles connected by Dirac strings that behave like infinitely thin solenoids (Dirac 1931 Proc. R. Soc. A 133 60). Despite decades of searching, free magnetic monopoles and their Dirac strings have eluded experimental detection, although there is substantial evidence for deconfined magnetic monopole quasiparticles in spin ice materials (Castelnovo et al 2008 Nature 326 411). Here we report the detection of a hierarchy of unequally-spaced magnetic excitations via high resolution inelastic neutron spectroscopic measurements on the quantum spin ice candidate [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text]. These excitations are well-described by a simple model of monopole pairs bound by a linear potential (Coldea et al Science 327 177) with an effective tension of 0.642(8) K [Formula: see text] at 1.65 K. The success of the linear potential model suggests that these low energy magnetic excitations are direct spectroscopic evidence for the confinement of magnetic monopole quasiparticles in the quantum spin ice candidate [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text].",3
"Diffusion of interstitials in metallic systems, illustration of a complex study case: aluminum.","While diffusion mechanisms of interstitial elements in fcc systems are generally well-known, especially in the case of H atoms, we show in this work that even in the case of a simple metallic system (aluminum), the diffusion of interstitials exhibits a wide variety of paths and mechanisms that depend on the specie. We used an approach based on first-principles calculations associated with kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations and a multi-state diffusion formalism to compute the diffusion coefficients of five interstitial elements: hydrogen, boron, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. For instance, at the atomic scale, whilst we find that C atoms prefer to be located in octahedral sites (labeled o) rather than in tetrahedral positions (labeled t), we find one additional stable position in the lattice (M). The diffusion through these three stable positions are thus studied in detail. In the case of B atoms, for which the tetrahedral site is found unstable, the diffusion path is between o-o sites. Similarly, in the case of oxygen, t positions are found to be the only stable positions (o are unstable) and the path of migration, along t-t direction, is found through a twice degenerated asymmetric transition state. In the case of H and N atoms for which t and o sites are stable, we explain why the only path is along the t-o direction. Finally, we discuss explicit formulas to compute coefficients of diffusion of interstitials in fcc structures.",3
Electronic and magnetic properties of multiferroic ScFeO3 available from diffraction experiments.,"Electronic and magnetic properties of ferric ions (3d (5)) in multiferroic ScFeO3 are puzzling, in part because they are different from the only other multiferroic known to possess the same polar chemical structure, BiFeO3. Open questions about ScFeO3 can be addressed by confronting observations with results for G-type antiferromagnetism allowed by the lithium niobate (LiNbO3)-like parent R3c structure. Calculated structure factors for resonant x-ray diffraction include all charge-like quadrupoles allowed by symmetry, and if experimental results for ScFeO3 subsequently imply they are different from zero then ferric ions cannot be in the high-spin (6)S state. The same type of experiment can reveal the moment direction in the G-type antiferromagnetism, according to our calculations, and thereby contribute to understanding magnetic anisotropy. Furthermore, structure factors for magnetic neutron diffraction by ScFeO3 include Dirac multipoles that are time-odd and parity-odd, e.g. dipoles that are often called anapoles or toroidal moments. Apart from Dirac multipoles, the conventional approach to the interpretation of neutron Bragg diffraction data will be inadequate if ferric ions (Fe(3+)) are not in the high-spin (6)S state, because the scattering amplitude includes more than simple dipole moments in the general case.",3
Dipole-switch induced modification of the emissive response of carbon nanotubes.,"The interaction of carbon nanotubes with the molecular dipole switch spiropyran is expected to affect the optical response of the tubes. Until now, the need of anchor groups to immobilize the switches on the tubes has hindered the experimental observation of the effects of switching on the emission behavior of the tubes. Here we present spiropyran-carbon nanotube complexes obtained by micelle swelling. This method does not require any anchor nor sophisticated chemistry to warrant close tube-switch proximity. For the first time, we observe the shifts predicted theoretically and their effect on the tubes' excitation and emission energies.",3
Diverse carrier mobility of monolayer BNC x : a combined density functional theory and Boltzmann transport theory study.,"BNC x monolayer as a kind of two-dimensional material has numerous chemical atomic ratios and arrangements with different electronic structures. Via calculations on the basis of density functional theory and Boltzmann transport theory under deformation potential approximation, the band structures and carrier mobilities of BNC x (x = 1,2,3,4) nanosheets are systematically investigated. The calculated results show that BNC2-1 is a material with very small band gap (0.02 eV) among all the structures while other BNC x monolayers are semiconductors with band gap ranging from 0.51 eV to 1.32 eV. The carrier mobility of BNC x varies considerably from tens to millions of cm(2) V(-1) s(-1). For BNC2-1, the hole mobility and electron mobility along both x and y directions can reach 10(5) orders of magnitude, which is similar to the carrier mobility of graphene. Besides, all studied BNC x monolayers obviously have anisotropic hole mobility and electron mobility. In particular, for semiconductor BNC4, its hole mobility along the y direction and electron mobility along the x direction unexpectedly reach 10(6) orders of magnitude, even higher than that of graphene. Our findings suggest that BNC x layered materials with the proper ratio and arrangement of carbon atoms will possess desirable charge transport properties, exhibiting potential applications in nanoelectronic devices.",3
Phase transitions and thermal entanglement of the distorted Ising-Heisenberg spin chain: topology of multiple-spin exchange interactions in spin ladders.,"We consider a symmetric spin-1/2 Ising-XXZ double sawtooth spin ladder obtained from distorting a spin chain, with the XXZ interaction between the interstitial Heisenberg dimers (which are connected to the spins based on the legs via an Ising-type interaction), the Ising coupling between nearest-neighbor spins of the legs and rungs spins, respectively, and additional cyclic four-spin exchange (ring exchange) in the square plaquette of each block. The presented analysis supplemented by results of the exact solution of the model with infinite periodic boundary implies a rich ground state phase diagram. As well as the quantum phase transitions, the characteristics of some of the thermodynamic parameters such as heat capacity, magnetization and magnetic susceptibility are investigated. We prove here that among the considered thermodynamic and thermal parameters, solely heat capacity is sensitive versus the changes of the cyclic four-spin exchange interaction. By using the heat capacity function, we obtain a singularity relation between the cyclic four-spin exchange interaction and the exchange coupling between pair spins on each rung of the spin ladder. All thermal and thermodynamic quantities under consideration should be investigated by regarding those points which satisfy the singularity relation. The thermal entanglement within the Heisenberg spin dimers is investigated by using the concurrence, which is calculated from a relevant reduced density operator in the thermodynamic limit.",3
Quantum modeling of ultrafast photoinduced charge separation.,"Phenomena involving electron transfer are ubiquitous in nature, photosynthesis and enzymes or protein activity being prominent examples. Their deep understanding thus represents a mandatory scientific goal. Moreover, controlling the separation of photogenerated charges is a crucial prerequisite in many applicative contexts, including quantum electronics, photo-electrochemical water splitting, photocatalytic dye degradation, and energy conversion. In particular, photoinduced charge separation is the pivotal step driving the storage of sun light into electrical or chemical energy. If properly mastered, these processes may also allow us to achieve a better command of information storage at the nanoscale, as required for the development of molecular electronics, optical switching, or quantum technologies, amongst others. In this Topical Review we survey recent progress in the understanding of ultrafast charge separation from photoexcited states. We report the state-of-the-art of the observation and theoretical description of charge separation phenomena in the ultrafast regime mainly focusing on molecular- and nano-sized solar energy conversion systems. In particular, we examine different proposed mechanisms driving ultrafast charge dynamics, with particular regard to the role of quantum coherence and electron-nuclear coupling, and link experimental observations to theoretical approaches based either on model Hamiltonians or on first principles simulations.",3
Highly anisotropic electric conductivity in PAN-based carbon nanofibers.,"In addition to the chemical and physical properties of nanostructures their successful utilization for applications is strongly triggered by economic aspects. Electrospinning of nanowires from solution followed by subsequent annealing steps is a comparably cheap technique to fabricate conductive carbon nanofibers (CNF) made from polyacrylonitrile (PAN) molecules in large quantities. In this work, we investigated the microscopic properties of the CNFs with diameters of 100-300 nm by means of Raman and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and correlated these results with transport measurements done with a 4-tip STM. In particular, we investigated the effect of fiber alignment and knot densities, which can be controlled by applying constant creep due to stress during the stabilization process. The comparison of the conductivity obtained from single CNFs revealed further that the fiber crossings within the ensemble structure act as scattering centers and proofs that the transport is along the surfaces of the CNFs.",3
On atomic mechanisms governing the oxidation of Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>.,"Oxidation of Bi2Te3 (space group R-3m) has been investigated using experimental and theoretical means. Based on calorimetry, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and thermodynamic modelling, Bi2Te3 is at equilibrium with Bi2O3 and TeO2, whereby the most stable compound is Bi2Te3, followed by Bi2O3. Hence, the reactivity of Bi towards oxygen is expected to be higher than that of Te. This notion is supported by density functional theory. The strongest bond is formed between Bi and Te, followed by Bi - O. This gives rise to unanticipated atomic processes. Dissociatively adsorbed oxygen diffuses through Bi and Te basal planes of Bi2Te3(0001) and preferably interacts with Bi. The Te termination considerably retards this process. These findings may clarify conflicting literature data. Any basal plane off-cut or Bi terminations trigger oxidation, but a perfect basal cleavage, where only Te terminations are exposed to air, may be stable for a longer period of time. These results are of relevance for applications in which surfaces are of key importance, such as nanostructured Bi2Te3 thermoelectric devices.",3
"Structure, magnetism and electronic properties in 3<i>d</i>-5<i>d</i> based double perovskite (Sr<sub>1-x</sub>Y<sub>x</sub>)<sub>2</sub>FeIrO<sub>6</sub>.","The 3$d$-5$d$ based double perovskites are of current interest as they provide model system to study the interplay between electronic correlation ($U$) and spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Here we report detailed structural, magnetic and transport properties of doped double perovskite material (Sr$_{1-x}$Y$_x$)$_2$FeIrO$_6$ with $x$ $\leq$ 0.2. With substitution of Y, system retains its original crystal structure but structural parameters modify with $x$ in nonmonotonic fashion. The magnetization data for Sr$_2$FeIrO$_6$ show antiferromagnetic type magnetic transition around 45 K, however, a close inspection in data indicates a weak magnetic phase transition around 120 K. No change of structural symmetry has been observed down to low temperature, although the lattice parameters show sudden changes around the magnetic transitions. Sr$_2$FeIrO$_6$ shows an insulating behavior over the whole temperature range which yet does not change with Y substitution. Nature of charge conduction is found to follow thermally activated Mott's variable range hopping and power law behavior for parent and doped samples, respectively. Interestingly, evolution of structural, magnetic and transport behavior in (Sr$_{1-x}$Y$_x$)$_2$FeIrO$_6$ is observed to reverse with $x$ $&gt;$ 0.1 which is believed to arise due to change in transition metal ionic state.",3
Charge-transfer modified embedded atom method dynamic charge potential for Li-Co-O system.,"To overcome the limitation of conventional fixed charge potential methods for the study of Li-ion battery cathode materials, a dynamic charge potential method, charge-transfer modified embedded atom method (CT-MEAM), has been developed and applied to the Li-Co-O ternary system. The accuracy of the potential has been tested and validated by reproducing a variety of structural and electrochemical properties of LiCoO2. A detailed analysis on the local charge distribution confirmed the capability of this potential for dynamic charge modeling. The transferability of the potential is also demonstrated by its reliability in describing Li-rich Li2CoO2 and Li-deficient LiCo2O4 compounds, including their phase stability, equilibrium volume, charge states and cathode voltages. These results demonstrate that the CT-MEAM dynamic charge potential could help to overcome the challenge of modeling complex ternary transition metal oxides. This work can promote molecular dynamics studies of Li ion cathode materials and other important transition metal oxides systems that involve complex electrochemical and catalytic reactions.",3
Vacancies and holes in bulk and at 180 degrees domain walls in lead titanate.,"Domain walls (DWs) in ferroic materials exhibit a plethora of unexpected properties that are different from the adjacent ferroic domains. Still, the intrinsic/extrinsic origin of these properties remains an open question. Here, density functional theory calculations are used to investigate the interaction between vacancies and 180 degrees DWs in the prototypical ferroelectric PbTiO3, with a special emphasis on cationic vacancies and released holes. All vacancies are more easily formed within the DW than in the domains. This is interpreted, using a phenomenological model, as the partial compensation of an extra-tensile stress when the defect is created inside the DW. Oxygen vacancies are found to be always fully ionized, independently of the thermodynamic conditions, while cationic vacancies can be either neutral or partially ionized (oxygen-rich conditions), or fully ionized (oxygen-poor conditions). Therefore, in oxidizing conditions, holes are induced by neutral and partially ionized Pb vacancies. In the bulk PbTiO3, these holes are more stable as delocalized rather than small polarons, but at DWs, the two forms are found to be possible.",3
Onsager's missing steps retraced.,"Onsager's paper on phase transition and phase coexistence in anisotropic colloidal systems is a landmark in the theory of lyotropic liquid crystals. However, an uncompromising scrutiny of Onsager's original derivation reveals that it would be rigorously valid only for ludicrous values of the system's number density (of the order of the reciprocal of the number of particles). Based on Penrose's tree identity and an appropriate variant of the mean-field approach for purely repulsive, hard-core interactions, our theory shows that Onsager's theory is indeed valid for a reasonable range of densities.",3
Polynomial description of inhomogeneous topological superconducting wires.,"We present the universal features of the topological invariant for p-wave superconducting wires after the inclusion of spatial inhomogeneities. Three classes of distributed potentials are studied, a single-defect, a commensurate and an incommensurate model, using periodic site modulations. An analytic polynomial description is achieved by splitting the topological invariant into two parts; one part depends on the chemical potential and the other does not. For the homogeneous case, an elliptical region is found where the topological invariant oscillates. The zeros of these oscillations occur at points where the fermion parity switches for finite wires. The increase of these oscillations with the inhomogeneity strength leads to new isolated non-topological phases. We characterize these new phases according to each class of spatial distributions. Such phases could also be observed in the XY model, to which our model is dual.",3
Influence of the orbital effects on the Majorana quasi-particles in a nanowire.,"Majorana quasi-particles can be realised using magnetic field in the form of diamagnetic (orbital) or paramagnetic effects. In both cases, the magnetic field induces a topologically non-trivial phase of matter. In this paper, the influence of orbital effects on Majorana bound states induced by paramagnetic effects in 1D nanowire is elaborated. The role of orbital effects in density of states and eigenstates of the system is also discussed. Additionally, we show the phase diagram-the magnetic field versus the magnetic flux, which displays a relation between topologically trivial and non-trivial phases. The Majorana bound states existence in the presence of relatively small orbital effects is indicated.",3
"Structural, magnetic and electronic properties of pulsed-laser-deposition grown SrFeO<sub>3-delta</sub> thin films and SrFeO<sub>3-delta</sub> /La<sub>2/3</sub>Ca<sub>1/3</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> multilayers.","We studied the structural, magnetic and electronic properties of SrFeO&lt;sub&gt;3-delta&lt;/sub&gt; (SFO) thin films and SrFeO&lt;sub&gt;3-delta&lt;/sub&gt; /La&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;Ca&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub& gt; (LCMO) superlattices that have been grown with pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on La&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;0.65&lt;/sub &gt;Ta&lt;sub&gt;0.35&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (LSAT) substrates. X-ray reflectometry and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) confirm the high structural quality of the films and flat and atomically sharp interfaces of the superlattices. The STEM data also reveal a difference in the interfacial layer stacking with a SrO layer at the LCMO/SFO and a LaO layer at the SFO/LCMO interfaces along the PLD growth direction. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) data suggest that the as grown SFO films and SFO/LCMO superlattices have an oxygen-deficient SrFeO&lt;sub&gt;3-delta&lt;/sub&gt; structure with I4/ mmm space group symmetry delta </= 0.2). Subsequent ozone annealed SFO films are consistent with an almost oxygen stoichiometric structure (delta approximately 0). The electronic and magnetic properties of these SFO films are similar to the ones of corresponding single crystals. In particular, the as grown SrFeO&lt;sub&gt;3-delta&lt;/sub&gt; films are insulating whereas the ozone annealed films are metallic. The magneto-resistance effects of the as grown SFO films have a similar magnitude as in the single crystals, but extend over a much wider temperature range. Last but not least, for the SFO/LCMO superlattices we observe a rather large exchange bias effect that varies as a function of the cooling field.",3
Negative thermophoresis of nanoparticles interacting with fluids through a purely-repulsive potential.,"Thermophoretic forces acting on nanoparticles are investigated using molecular dynamics simulation. We assume the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential for the interaction between fluid molecules. On the other hand, the interaction between the nanoparticle and the surrounding fluid molecules are assumed to be either LJ or Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) potential, where the latter is purely-repulsive. The effect of the interaction potential on the thermophoretic force is investigated for various situations. It is found that the thermophoretic force basically acts in the direction from the hotter side to the colder side of the nanoparticle. However, when the surrounding fluid is in the liquid phase, the force acts in the reversed direction for the case of the WCA potential. It is clarified that the sign reversal is caused by the different structures observed in the distribution of repulsive forces acting on the nanoparticle.",3
Self-assembly of model proteins into virus capsids.,"We consider self-assembly of proteins into a virus capsid by the methods of molecular dynamics. The capsid corresponds either to SPMV or CCMV and is studied with and without the RNA molecule inside. The proteins are flexible and described by the structure-based coarse-grained model augmented by electrostatic interactions. Previous studies of the capsid self-assembly involved solid objects of a supramolecular scale, e.g. corresponding to capsomeres, with engineered couplings and stochastic movements. In our approach, a single capsid is dissociated by an application of a high temperature for a variable period and then the system is cooled down to allow for self-assembly. The restoration of the capsid proceeds to various extent, depending on the nature of the dissociated state, but is rarely complete because some proteins depart too far unless the process takes place in a confined space.",3
Delocalized versus localized excitations in the photoisomerization of azobenzene-functionalized alkanethiolate SAMs.,"Self-assembled monolayers of azobenzene-functionalized alkanethiolates form molecular ensembles with preferential orientation and significant excitonic coupling among the azobenzene chromophores. We have studied their optical switching with differential reflectance and two-photon-photoemission spectroscopy tuning the excitation wavelength through the excitonically broadened S2 absorption band. While the effective isomerization cross-section increases towards shorter wavelengths, the fraction of cis molecules in the photostationary state decreases. We attribute this observation to the absorption of the cis isomer in the SAM. The photoisomerization in the SAM thereby follows the behavior of non-interacting chromophores in solution, despite the formation of H-aggregates. Our study thus reveals that photoswitching occurs via localized excitations while strongly excitonically coupled, delocalized states do not contribute significantly.",3
"Computational methods for 2D materials: discovery, property characterization, and application design.","The discovery of two-dimensional (2D) materials comes at a time when computational methods are mature and can predict novel 2D materials, characterize their properties, and guide the design of 2D materials for applications. This article reviews the recent progress in computational approaches for 2D materials research. We discuss the computational techniques and provide an overview of the ongoing research in the field. We begin with an overview of known 2D materials, common computational methods, and available cyber infrastructures. We then move onto the discovery of novel 2D materials, discussing the stability criteria for 2D materials, computational methods for structure prediction, and interactions of monolayers with electrochemical and gaseous environments. Next, we describe the computational characterization of the 2D materials' electronic, optical, magnetic, and superconducting properties and the response of the properties under applied mechanical strain and electrical fields. From there, we move on to discuss the structure and properties of defects in 2D materials, and describe methods for 2D materials device simulations. We conclude by providing an outlook on the needs and challenges for future developments in the field of computational research for 2D materials.",3
Statistical analysis of the reduction process of graphene oxide probed by Raman spectroscopy mapping.,"We propose a method for monitoring the large-scale homogeneity of the reduction process of graphene oxide. For this purpose, a Raman mapping technique is employed to probe the evolution of the phonon properties of two different graphene oxide (GO) thin films upon controllable thermal reduction. The reduction of GO is reflected by the upshift of the statistical distribution of the relative intensity ratio of the G and D peaks (I D/I G) of the Raman spectra and is consistent with the ratio obtained for chemically reduced GO. In addition, the shifts of the position distributions of the main Raman modes ([Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]) and their cross-correlation with the I D/I G ratio provides evidence of a change of the doping level, demonstrating the influence of reduction processes on GO films.",3
The influence of the dimensionality of the system on the realization of unconventional Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov pairing in ultra-cold Fermi gases.,"The recent development of experimental techniques in ultracold atomic Fermi gases is extremely helpful in the progress of the realization of the unconventional Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superfluid phase in quasi-one dimensional systems (Liao et al 2010 Nature 467 567). Due to a Fermi surface nesting, which is enhanced in 1D, the low-dimensional systems are particularly good candidates to find the FFLO phase stable. We investigate the influence of a dimensional crossover (from one dimension (1D) to two dimensions (2D) or three dimensions (3D)) on the stability of the FFLO state in the spin-imbalanced attractive Hubbard model.",3
Quasielastic and low-energy inelastic neutron scattering study of HoCrO<sub>3</sub> by high resolution time-of-flight neutron spectroscopy.,n order to understand the origin of the huge quasielastic magnetic scattering&#13; observed previously with a back-scattering neutron spectrometer we&#13; have re-investigated the low energy excitations in HoCrO$_3$ by&#13; inelastic neutron scattering in a much wider energy range with&#13; time-of-flight neutron spectrometers. The inelastic signals are due to&#13; the excitations between the ground state doublet of the Ho ion. The quasielastic signal is due to the fluctuation of the disordered Ho moments. At low temperature the intensity of quasielastic scattering is small. It starts increasing as the temperature increases above 30 K. At the same temperature the elastic intensity due to Ho moment ordering decreases in a similar way. This observation strengthens the hypothesis that the quasielastic scattering is due the fluctuations of the disordered Ho moments. The time scale of fluctuations has been determine from the quasielastic scattering and was found to vary from about 22 ps at T = 70 K to about 2.5 ps at T = 160 K. The stretched exponential line shape indicates a distribution of decay rates at low temperatures.,3
Manipulating magnetism by ultrafast control of the exchange interaction.,"In recent years, the optical control of exchange interactions has emerged as an exciting new direction in the study of the ultrafast optical control of magnetic order. Here we review recent theoretical works on antiferromagnetic systems, devoted to (i) simulating the ultrafast control of exchange interactions, (ii) modeling the strongly nonequilibrium response of the magnetic order and (iii) the relation with relevant experimental works developed in parallel. In addition to the excitation of spin precession, we discuss examples of rapid cooling and the control of ultrafast coherent longitudinal spin dynamics in response to femtosecond optically induced perturbations of exchange interactions. These elucidate the potential for exploiting the control of exchange interactions to find new scenarios for both faster and more energy-efficient manipulation of magnetism.",3
Ground state properties of 3d metals from self-consistent GW approach.,"The self consistent GW approach (scGW) has been applied to calculate the ground state properties (equilibrium Wigner-Seitz radius S WZ and bulk modulus B) of 3d transition metals Sc, Ti, V, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu. The approach systematically underestimates S WZ with average relative deviation from the experimental data of about 1% and it overestimates the calculated bulk modulus with relative error of about 25%. It is shown that scGW is superior in accuracy as compared to the local density approximation but it is less accurate than the generalized gradient approach for the materials studied. If compared to the random phase approximation, scGW is slightly less accurate, but its error for 3d metals looks more systematic. The systematic nature of the deviation from the experimental data suggests that the next order of the perturbation theory should allow one to reduce the error.",3
Spin reorientation and disordered rare earth magnetism in Ho<sub>2</sub>FeCoO<sub>6</sub>.,"We report the experimental observation of spin reorientation in the double perovskite Ho&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;FeCoO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. The magnetic phase transitions in this compound are characterized and studied through magnetization and specific heat, and the magnetic structures are elucidated through neutron powder diffraction. Two magnetic phase transitions are observed in this compound - one at T&lt;sub&gt;N1&lt;/sub&gt; approximately 250 K, from paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic, and the other at T&lt;sub&gt;N2&lt;/sub&gt; approximately 45 K, from a phase with mixed magnetic structures to a single phase through a spin reorientation process. The magnetic structure in the temperature range 200 K -45 K is a mixed phase of the irreducible representations Gamma&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and Gamma&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, both of which are antiferromagnetic. The phase with mixed magnetic structures that exists in Ho&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;FeCoO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; gives rise to a large thermal hysteresis in magnetization that extends from 200 K down to the spin reorientation temperature. At T&lt;sub&gt;N2&lt;/sub&gt;, the magnetic structure transforms to Gamma&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Though long-range magnetic order is established in the transition metal lattice, it is seen that only short-range magnetic order prevails in Ho&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; - lattice. Our results should motivate further detailed studies on single crystals in order to explore spin reorientation process, spin switching and the possibility of anisotropic magnetic interactions giving rise to electric polarization in Ho&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;FeCoO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.",3
Role of charged impurities in thermoelectric transport in molybdenum disulfide monolayers.,"A theoretical study of the electronic properties, namely, electrical conductivity (EC), electronic thermal conductivity (ETC) and thermoelectric power (TEP) in 2D MoS2 monolayers (MLs), over a wide range of temperatures (10 < T < 300 K), is presented employing Boltzmann transport formalism. Considering the electrons to be scattered by screened charged impurities and the acoustic, optical and remote phonons, the transport equation is solved using Ritz iterative method. Numerical calculations of EC, ETC and TEP presented for supported and free-standing MLs with high electron concentrations, as a function of temperature, bring out the relative importance of the various scattering mechanisms operative. The role of CIs, with regard to both concentration and separation from the substrate-ML interface, in determining the properties of supported MLs is demonstrated for the first time. Validity of Wiedemann-Franz law and Mott formula are examined for supported and free standing MLs. Calculations are in consonance with recent experimental data on mobility and TEP of exfoliated SiO2-supported MoS2 ML samples. In the case of TEP it is found that though the diffusion contribution is dominant the inclusion of the drag component, incorporating contributions from all relevant phonon scattering mechanisms, is needed to obtain good agreement with the data.",3
Electric control of the bandgap in quantum wells with band-inverted junctions.,"In IV-VI semiconductor heterojunctions with band-inversion, such as those made of [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text]Te or [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text]Se, interface states are properly described by a two-band model, predicting the appearance of a Dirac cone in single junctions. However, in quantum wells the interface dispersion is quadratic in momentum and the energy spectrum presents a gap. We show that the interface gap shrinks under an electric field parallel to the growth direction. Therefore, the interface gap can be dynamically tuned in experiments on double-gated quantum wells based on band-inverted compounds.",3
Nonclassical nucleation pathways in protein crystallization.,"Classical nucleation theory (CNT), which was established about 90 years ago, has been very successful in many research fields, and continues to be the most commonly used theory in describing the nucleation process. For a fluid-to-solid phase transition, CNT states that the solute molecules in a supersaturated solution reversibly form small clusters. Once the cluster size reaches a critical value, it becomes thermodynamically stable and favored for further growth. One of the most important assumptions of CNT is that the nucleation process is described by one reaction coordinate and all order parameters proceed simultaneously. Recent studies in experiments, computer simulations and theory have revealed nonclassical features in the early stage of nucleation. In particular, the decoupling of order parameters involved during a fluid-to-solid transition leads to the so-called two-step nucleation mechanism, in which a metastable intermediate phase (MIP) exists between the initial supersaturated solution and the final crystals. Depending on the exact free energy landscapes, the MIPs can be a high density liquid phase, mesoscopic clusters, or a pre-ordered state. In this review, we focus on the studies of nonclassical pathways in protein crystallization and discuss the applications of the various scenarios of two-step nucleation theory. In particular, we focus on protein solutions in the presence of multivalent salts, which serve as a model protein system to study the nucleation pathways. We wish to point out the unique features of proteins as model systems for further studies.",3
Fulde-Ferrell state in superconducting core/shell nanowires: role of the orbital effect.,"The orbital effect on the Fulde-Ferrell (FF) phase is investigated in superconducting core/shell nanowires subjected to the axial magnetic field. Confinement in the radial direction results in quantization of the electron motion with energies determined by the radial j and orbital m quantum numbers. In the external magnetic field, the twofold degeneracy with respect to the orbital magnetic quantum number m is lifted which leads to the Fermi wave vector mismatch between the paired electrons, [Formula: see text]. This mismatch is transferred to the nonzero total momentum of the Cooper pairs, which results in a formation of the FF phase occurring sequentially with increasing magnetic field. By changing the nanowire radius R and the superconducting shell thickness d, we discuss the role of the orbital effect in the FF phase formation in both the nanowire-like ([Formula: see text]) and nanofilm-like ([Formula: see text]) regime. We have found that the irregular pattern of the FF phase which appears for the case of the nanowire-like regime, for the nanofilm-like geometry evolves towards the regular distribution in which the FF phase stability regions emerge periodically between the BCS states. The transition between these two different phase diagrams is explained as resulting from the orbital effect and the multigap character of superconductivity in the core/shell nanowires.",3
Electrochemical phase diagrams of Ni from ab initio simulations: role of exchange interactions on accuracy.,"The stabilities of Ni metal and its derived compounds, including oxides, hydroxides, and oxyhydroxides under electrochemical conditions, can be readily predicted from the Ni Pourbaix diagram, where the formation free energies of the involved species are utilized to construct the phase stability map with respect to electrode potential and pH. We calculate and analyze the crystal structures, electronic structures, and thermodynamic energies of Ni metal and its compounds using different exchange-correlation functionals to density-functional-theory (DFT), including the semilocal LDA and GGA density functionals, the nonlocal metaGGA, and the hybrid density functionals. Next, we simulate the corresponding Ni Pourbaix diagrams to compare systematically the performance of the functional to each other and to experimental observations. We show that the structures and energies obtained from experimental databases may not be sufficiently accurate to describe direct electrochemical observations, and we explain how the electronic exchange within the density functionals plays a key role in determining the accuracy of the DFT calculated electronic, thermodynamic, and electrochemical properties. We find that only the hybrid density functional produces reliable results owing to the fractional contribution of exact Fock exchange included therein. Last, based on our accurate Ni Pourbaix diagram, we construct band-gap and magnetic electrochemical maps which can facilitate more experimental measurements and property assessments under variable potential and pH in the future.",3
Compact modes in quasi one dimensional coupled magnetic oscillators.,"In this work we study analytically and numerically the spectrum and localization properties of three quasi-one-dimensional (ribbons) split-ring resonator arrays which possess magnetic flatbands, namely, the stub, Lieb and kagome lattices, and how their spectra are affected by the presence of perturbations that break the delicate geometrical interference needed for a magnetic flatband to exist. We find that the stub and Lieb ribbons are stable against the three types of perturbations considered here, while the kagome ribbon is, in general, unstable. When losses are incorporated, all flatbands remain dispersionless but become complex, with the kagome ribbon exhibiting the highest loss rate. The stability of flatband modes of certain split-ring resonator arrays suggests that they could be used as components of future stable magnetic storage devices.",3
Atomic-scale distortions and temperature-dependent large pseudogap in thin films of the parent iron-chalcogenide superconductor Fe<sub>1+y</sub>Te.,"We investigate by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy/Spectroscopy (STM/STS) and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations the surface structures and the electronic properties of Fe1+yTe thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition. Contrary to the regular arrangement of antiferromagnetic nanostripes previously reported on cleaved single-crystal samples, the surface of Fe1+yTe thin films displays a peculiar distribution of spatially inhomogeneous nanostripes. Both STM and DFT calculations show the bias-dependent nature of such features and support the interpretation of spin-polarized tunneling between the FeTe surface and an unintentionally magnetized tip. In addition, the spatial inhomogeneity is interpreted as a purely electronic effect, related to changes in hybridization and Fe-Fe bond length driven by local variations in the concentration of excess interstitial Fe cations. Unexpectedly, the surface density of states measured by STS strongly evolves with temperature in close proximity to the antiferromagnetic-paramagnetic first-order transition, and reveals a large pseudogap of 180-250 meV at about 50-65 K. We believe that in this temperature range a phase transition takes place and the system orders and locks into particular combinations of orbitals and spins, because of the interplay between excess interstitial magnetic Fe and strongly correlated d-electrons.",3
A study of electron and thermal transport in layered titanium disulphide single crystals.,"We present a detailed study of thermal and electrical transport behavior of single crystal titanium disulphide flakes, which belong to the two dimensional, transition metal dichalcogenide class of materials. In-plane Seebeck effect measurements revealed a typical metal-like linear temperature dependence in the range of 85-285 K. Electrical transport measurements with in-plane current geometry exhibited a nearly T (2) dependence of resistivity in the range of 42-300 K. However, transport measurements along the out-of-plane current geometry showed a transition in temperature dependence of resistivity from T (2) to T (5) beyond 200 K. Interestingly, Au ion-irradiated TiS2 samples showed a similar T (5) dependence of resistivity beyond 200 K, even in the current-in-plane geometry. Micro-Raman measurements were performed to study the phonon modes in both pristine and ion-irradiated TiS2 crystals.",3
Length of encapsidated cargo impacts stability and structure of in vitro assembled alphavirus core-like particles.,"In vitro assembly of alphavirus nucleocapsid cores, called core-like particles (CLPs), requires a polyanionic cargo. There are no sequence or structure requirements to encapsidate single-stranded nucleic acid cargo. In this work, we wanted to determine how the length of the cargo impacts the stability and structure of the assembled CLPs. We hypothesized that cargo neutralizes the basic region of the alphavirus capsid protein and if the cargo is long enough, it will also act to scaffold the CP monomers together. Experimentally we found that CLPs encapsidating short 27mer oligonucleotides were less stable than CLPs encapsidating 48mer or 90mer oligonucleotides under different chemical and thermal conditions. Furthermore, cryo-EM studies showed there were structural differences between CLPs assembled with 27mer and 48mer cargo. To mimic the role of the cargo in CLP assembly we made a mutant (4D) where we substituted a cluster of four Lys residues in the CP with four Asp residues. We found that these few amino acid substitutions were enough to initiate CLP assembly in the absence of cargo. The cargo-free 4D CLPs show higher resistance to ionic strength and increased temperature compared to wild-type cargo containing CLPs suggesting their CLP assembly mechanism might also be different.",3
Ir d-band derived superconductivity in the lanthanum-iridium system LaIr3.,"The electronic properties of the heavy metal superconductor [Formula: see text] are reported. The estimated superconducting parameters obtained from physical properties measurements indicate that [Formula: see text] is a BCS-type superconductor. Electronic band structure calculations show that Ir d-states dominate the Fermi level. A comparison of electronic band structures of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] shows that the Ir-compound has a strong spin-orbit-coupling effect, which creates a complex Fermi surface.",3
A new tracking algorithm for multiple colloidal particles close to contact.,"In this paper, we propose a new algorithm based on radial symmetry center method to track colloidal particles close to contact, where the optical images of the particles start to overlap in digital video microscopy. This overlapping effect is important to observe the pair interaction potential in colloidal studies and it appears as additional interaction in the measurement of the interaction with conventional tracking analysis. The proposed algorithm in this work is simple, fast and applicable for not only two particles but also three and more particles without any modification. The algorithm uses gradient vectors of the particle intensity distribution, which allows us to use a part of the symmetric intensity distribution in the calculation of the actual particle position. In this study, simulations are performed to see the performance of the proposed algorithm for two and three particles, where the simulation images are generated by using fitted curve to experimental particle image for different sized particles. As a result, the algorithm yields the maximum error smaller than 2 nm for [Formula: see text] mum silica particles in contact condition.",3
Smectic phases in ionic liquid crystals.,"Ionic liquid crystals (ILCs) are anisotropic mesogenic molecules which carry charges and therefore combine properties of liquid crystals, e.g. the formation of mesophases, and of ionic liquids, such as low melting temperatures and tiny triple-point pressures. Previous density functional calculations have revealed that the phase behavior of ILCs is strongly affected by their molecular properties, i.e. their aspect ratio, the loci of the charges, and their interaction strengths. Here, we report new findings concerning the phase behavior of ILCs as obtained by density functional theory and Monte Carlo simulations. The most important result is the occurrence of a novel, wide smectic-A phase [Formula: see text], at low temperature, the layer spacing of which is larger than that of the ordinary high-temperature smectic-A phase [Formula: see text]. Unlike the ordinary smectic S A phase, the structure of the [Formula: see text] phase consists of alternating layers of particles oriented parallel to the layer normal and oriented perpendicular to it.",3
Deep level defects in 4H-SiC introduced by ion implantation: the role of single ion regime.,"We characterized intrinsic deep level defects created in ion collision cascades which were produced by patterned implantation of single accelerated 2.0 MeV He and 600 keV H ions into n-type 4H-SiC epitaxial layers using a fast-scanning reduced-rate ion microbeam. The initial deep level transient spectroscopy measurement performed on as-grown material in the temperature range 150-700 K revealed the presence of only two electron traps, Z 1/2 (0.64 eV) and EH6/7 (1.84 eV) assigned to the two different charge state transitions of the isolated carbon vacancy, V C (=/0) and (0/+). C-V measurements of as-implanted samples revealed the increasing free carrier removal with larger ion fluence values, in particular at depth corresponding to a vicinity of the end of an ion range. The first DLTS measurement of as-implanted samples revealed formation of additional deep level defects labelled as ET1 (0.35 eV), ET2 (0.65 eV) and EH3 (1.06 eV) which were clearly distinguished from the presence of isolated carbon vacancies (Z 1/2 and EH6/7 defects) in increased concentrations after implantations either by He or H ions. Repeated C-V measurements showed that a partial net free-carrier recovery occurred in as-implanted samples upon the low-temperature annealing following the first DLTS measurement. The second DLTS measurement revealed the almost complete removal of ET2 defect and the partial removal of EH3 defect, while the concentrations of Z 1/2 and EH6/7 defects increased, due to the low temperature annealing up to 700 K accomplished during the first temperature scan. We concluded that the ET2 and EH3 defects: (i) act as majority carrier removal traps, (ii) exhibit a low thermal stability and (iii) can be related to the simple point-like defects introduced by light ion implantation, namely interstitials and/or complex of interstitials and vacancies in both carbon and silicon sub-lattices.",3
Origin of the magnetic transition at 100 K in epsilon-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles studied by X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy.,"We present a study of the correlation between the magnetic phase transition and the structural distortion observed at 100 K in epsilon-Fe2O3. For this purpose, we have designed a novel one-pot sol-gel method assisted by glycerol, which reproducibly provides samples with a nominal 100% concentration of epsilon-Fe2O3 nanoparticles embedded in a SiO2 matrix. The high crystallinity of the samples and the absence of other iron oxide polymorphs has allowed us to perform, for the first time, temperature-dependent X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy experiments, with the aim of investigating the origin of the magnetic quenching anomaly observed at 100 K. The deformation of the structure at a local scale, where the tetrahedral and octahedral Fe sites undergo distortions of different intensities, has been simulated to fulfill the long-range order. Our results point to a local structure distortion accompanied by the magnetism quenching through a magneto-elastic coupling.",3
Sensitivity of the mixing-current technique for the detection of mechanical motion in the coherent tunnelling regime.,"In a recent publication we have studied theoretically the sensitivity of the mixing-current technique to detect nanomechanical motion by coupling the oscillator to a single-electron transistor in the incoherent tunnelling regime: [Formula: see text], where Gamma is the tunnelling rate, T is the electronic temperature, [Formula: see text] and k B are the Planck and the Boltzmann constant, respectively. In this work we consider the same problem when the detection device is a quantum dot in the coherent tunnelling regime ([Formula: see text]). In order to reach the best sensitivity we find that one should enter the strong coupling regime, as described in the recent publication (Micchi et al 2015 Phys. Rev. Lett. 115 206802) where a mechanical bistability is described. In this regime the electronic detection device strongly modifies the effective potential of the oscillator and the non-linearities determine the form of the displacement fluctuation spectrum. We find theoretical upper bounds to the sensitivity for the detection of the oscillation amplitude of the oscillator. It turns out that it is convenient to work as close as possible to the bistability.",3
Thermal transport in topological-insulator-based superconducting hybrid structures with mixed singlet and triplet pairing states.,"In the framework of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation, we investigate the thermal transport properties in topological-insulator-based superconducting hybrid structures with mixed spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairing states, and emphasize the different manifestations of the spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairing states in the thermal transport signatures. It is revealed that the temperature-dependent differential thermal conductance strongly depends on the components of the pairing state, and the negative differential thermal conductance only occurs in the spin-singlet pairing state dominated regime. It is also found that the thermal conductance is profoundly sensitive to the components of the pairing state. In the spin-singlet pairing state controlled regime, the thermal conductance obviously oscillates with the phase difference and junction length. With increasing the proportion of the spin-triplet pairing state, the oscillating characteristic of the thermal conductance fades out distinctly. These results suggest an alternative route for distinguishing the components of pairing states in topological-insulator-based superconducting hybrid structures.",3
Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy studies of metallic surface and interface states of oxide insulators.,"Over the last decade, conducting states embedded in insulating transition metal oxides (TMOs) have served as gateways to discovering and probing surprising phenomena that can emerge in complex oxides, while also opening opportunities for engineering advanced devices. These states are commonly realized at thin film interfaces, such as the well-known case of LaAlO3 (LAO) grown on SrTiO3 (STO). In recent years, the use of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to investigate the k-space electronic structure of such materials led to the discovery that metallic states can also be formed on the bare surfaces of certain TMOs. In this topical review, we report on recent studies of low-dimensional metallic states confined at insulating oxide surfaces and interfaces as seen from the perspective of ARPES, which provides a direct view of the occupied band structure. While offering a fairly broad survey of progress in the field, we draw particular attention to STO, whose surface is so far the best-studied, and whose electronic structure is probably of the most immediate interest, given the ubiquitous use of STO substrates as the basis for conducting oxide interfaces. The ARPES studies provide crucial insights into the electronic band structure, orbital character, dimensionality/confinement, spin structure, and collective excitations in STO surfaces and related oxide surface/interface systems. The obtained knowledge increases our understanding of these complex materials and gives new perspectives on how to manipulate their properties.",3
Phase field crystal simulation of stress induced localized solid-state amorphization in nanocrystalline materials.,"In this work, the phase field crystal (PFC) method is used to study the localized solid-state amorphization (SSA) and its dynamic transformation process in polycrystalline materials under the uniaxial tensile deformation with different factors. The impacts of these factors, including strain rates, temperatures and grain sizes, are analyzed. Kinetically, the ultra-high strain rate causes the lattice to be seriously distorted and the grain to gradually collapse, so the dislocation density rises remarkably. Therefore, localized SSA occurs. Thermodynamically, as high temperature increases the activation energy, the atoms are active and prefer to leave the original position, which induce atom rearrangement. Furthermore, small grain size increases the percentage of grain boundary and the interface free energy of the system. As a result, Helmholtz free energy increases. The dislocations and Helmholtz free energy act as the seed and driving force for the process of the localized SSA. Also, the critical diffusion-time step and the percentage of amorphous region areas are calculated. Through this work, the PFC method is proved to be an effective means to study localized SSA under uniaxial tensile deformation.",3
A bird's eye view on the flat and conic band world of the honeycomb and Kagome lattices: towards an understanding of 2D metal-organic frameworks electronic structure.,"We present a thorough tight-binding analysis of the band structure of a wide variety of lattices belonging to the class of honeycomb and Kagome systems including several mixed forms combining both lattices. The band structure of these systems are made of a combination of dispersive and flat bands. The dispersive bands possess Dirac cones (linear dispersion) at the six corners (K points) of the Brillouin zone although in peculiar cases Dirac cones at the center of the zone [Formula: see text] point) appear. The flat bands can be of different nature. Most of them are tangent to the dispersive bands at the center of the zone but some, for symmetry reasons, do not hybridize with other states. The objective of our work is to provide an analysis of a wide class of so-called ligand-decorated honeycomb Kagome lattices that are observed in a 2D metal-organic framework where the ligand occupy honeycomb sites and the metallic atoms the Kagome sites. We show that the p x -p y graphene model is relevant in these systems and there exists four types of flat bands: Kagome flat (singly degenerate) bands, two kinds of ligand-centered flat bands (A2 like and E like, respectively doubly and singly degenerate) and metal-centered (three fold degenerate) flat bands.",3
Advanced capabilities for materials modelling with Quantum ESPRESSO.,"Quantum ESPRESSO is an integrated suite of open-source computer codes for quantum simulations of materials using state-of-the art electronic-structure techniques, based on density-functional theory, density-functional perturbation theory, and many-body perturbation theory, within the plane-wave pseudo-potential and projector-augmented-wave approaches. Quantum ESPRESSO owes its popularity to the wide variety of properties and processes it allows to simulate, to its performance on an increasingly broad array of hardware architectures, and to a community of researchers that rely on its capabilities as a core open-source development platform to implement theirs ideas. In this paper we describe recent extensions and improvements, covering new methodologies and property calculators, improved parallelization, code modularization, and extended interoperability both within the distribution and with external software.",3
Magnetization dynamics of weak stripe domains in Fe-N thin films: a multi-technique complementary approach.,"The resonant eigenmodes of a nitrogen-implanted iron alpha'-FeN characterized by weak stripe domains are investigated by Brillouin light scattering and broadband ferromagnetic resonance experiments, assisted by micromagnetic simulations. The spectrum of the dynamic eigenmodes in the presence of the weak stripes is very rich and two different families of modes can be selectively detected using different techniques or different experimental configurations. Attention is paid to the evolution of the mode frequencies and spatial profiles under the application of an external magnetic field, of variable intensity, in the direction parallel or transverse to the stripes. The different evolution of the modes with the external magnetic field is accompanied by a distinctive spatial localization in specific regions, such as the closure domains at the surface of the stripes and the bulk domains localized in the inner part of the stripes. The complementarity of BLS and FMR techniques, based on different selection rules, is found to be a fruitful tool for the study of the wealth of localized mag-netic excitations generally found in nanostructures.",3
A systematic study of <i>4d</i> and <i>5d</i> transition metal mediated exchange coupling between Fe and Gd nanolaminates.,"We present a systematic study of the magnetic coupling between iron and gadolinium layers&#13; intermediated by 4d and 5d transition metals using density functional theory. We demonstrate that&#13; it is possible to nd a magnetic coupling for most of them. In particular, for the early transition&#13; metals (d1, d2, d3 and d4) , a ferromagnetic coupling occurs even stronger than the 3d interlayers.&#13; Atomic size and the electronic conguration of the transition metals are crucial for the nature of the&#13; coupling. All the open shell transition metals present induced magnetic moments. By increasing the&#13; number of interlayers, an oscillating behavior in the magnetic coupling was found and the magnetic&#13; coupling goes to zero after four spacer layers. Using Monte carlo simulations, we demonstrate that&#13; the interlayer strongly enhances the critical temperature in the Gd layers closest to the interface.",3
Fermi surface map of large-scale single-orientation graphene on SiO2.,"Large scale tetraoctylammonium-assisted electrochemical transfer of graphene grown on single-crystalline Ir(1 1 1) films by chemical vapour deposition is reported. The transferred samples are characterized in air with optical microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and four point transport measurements, providing the sheet resistance and the Hall carrier concentration. In vacuum we apply low energy electron diffraction and photoelectron spectroscopy that indicate transferred large-scale single orientation graphene. Angular resolved photoemission reveals a Fermi surface and a Dirac point energy which are consistent with charge neutral graphene.",3
Hole dephasing caused by hole-hole interaction in a multilayered black phosphorus.,We study the magnetotransport of holes in a multilayered black phosphorus in a temperature range of 1.9 to 21.5 K. We observed a negative magnetoresistance at magnetic fields up to 1.5 T. This negative magetoresistance was analyzed by weak localization theory in diffusive regime. At the lowest temperature and the highest carrier density we found a phase coherence length of 48 nm. The linear temperature dependence of the dephasing rate shows that the hole-hole scattering processes with small energy transfer are the dominant contribution in breaking the carrier phase coherence.,3
Evidence for the Confinement of Magnetic Monopoles in Quantum Spin Ice.,"Magnetic monopoles are hypothesised elementary particles connected by Dirac strings that behave like infinitely thin solenoids [Dirac 1931 Proc. Roy. Soc. A 133 60]. Despite decades of searches, free magnetic monopoles and their Dirac strings have eluded experimental detection, although there is substantial evidence for deconfined magnetic monopole quasiparticles in spin ice materials [Castelnovo, Moessner & Sondhi 2008 Nature 326 411]. Here we report the detection of a hierarchy of unequally-spaced magnetic excitations via high resolution inelastic neutron spectroscopic measurements on the quantum spin ice candidate Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;. These excitations are well-described by a simple model of monopole pairs bound by a linear potential [Coldea et al. Science 327 177] with an effective tension of 0.7(1) K/Angstrom. The success of the linear potential model suggests that these low energy magnetic excitations are direct spectroscopic evidence for the confinement of magnetic monopole quasiparticles in the quantum spin ice candidate Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;.",3
Bilayers of Ni<sub>3</sub>C<sub>12</sub>S<sub>12</sub> and Pt<sub>3</sub>C<sub>12</sub>S<sub>12</sub>: graphene-like 2D topological insulators tunable by electric fields.,"In the present work we predict, through first-principles calculations, that bilayers of the recently synthesized Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; layered materials are topological insulators upon electron doping, and that that their topological insulator properties can be modulated by the application of electric fields with magnitudes achievable in devices. The electronic structures of both bilayers are characterized by spin-orbit split graphene-like bands, with gap magnitudes that are three orders of magnitude larger than graphene's. In ribbon geometries, chiral edge modes develop at each side with band dispersions similar to that of Kane-Mele graphene model. Surprisingly, the edge states' spin-propagation locking occurs even for very thin ribbons. We also find that the response of the electronic structure of both materials to applied electric fields are similar to both graphene and the Kane-Mele model with a Rashba term. All these findings indicate that these bilayer systems can be considered as large-spin-orbit graphene analogues with a strong sensitivity to applied electric fields.",3
Strain engineering on transmission carriers of monolayer phosphorene.,"The effects of uniaxial strain on the structure, band gap and transmission carriers of monolayer phosphorene were investigated by first-principles calculations. The strain induced semiconductor-metal as well as direct-indirect transitions were studied in monolayer phosphorene. The position of CBM which belonged to indirect gap shifts along the direction of the applied strain. We have concluded the change rules of the carrier effective mass when plane strains are applied. In band structure, the sudden decrease of band gap or the new formation of CBM (VBM) causes the unexpected change in carrier effective mass. The effects of zigzag and armchair strain on the effective electron mass in phosphorene are different. The strain along zigzag direction has effects on the electrons effective mass along both zigzag and armchair direction. By contrast, armchair-direction strain seems to affect only on the free electron mass along zigzag direction. For the holes, the effective masses along zigzag direction are largely affected by plane strains while the effective mass along armchair direction exhibits independence in strain processing. The carrier density of monolayer phosphorene at 300 K is calculated about [Formula: see text] cm(-2), which is greatly influenced by the temperature and strain. Strain engineering is an efficient method to improve the carrier density in phosphorene.",3
"Diffusion of interstitials in metallic systems, illustration of a complex study case: aluminum.","While diffusion mechanisms of interstitial elements in fcc systems are generally well-known, especially in the case of H atoms, we show in this work that even in the case of a simple metallic system (aluminum), the diffusion of interstitials exhibits a wide variety of paths and mechanisms that depend on the specie. We used an approach based on first-principles calculations associated with kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations and a multi-state diffusion formalism to compute the diffusion coefficients of five interstitial elements: hydrogen, boron, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. For instance, at the atomic scale, whilst we find that C atoms prefer to be located in octahedral sites (labeled $o$) rather than in tetrahedral positions (labeled $t$), we find one additional stable position in the lattice ($M$). The diffusion through these three stable positions are thus studied in detail. In the case of B atoms, for which the tetrahedral site is found unstable, the diffusion path is between $o$-$o$ sites. Similarly, in the case of oxygen, $t$ positions are found to be the only stable positions ($o$ are unstable) and the path of migration, along $t$-$t$ direction, is found through a twice degenerated asymmetric transition state. In the case of H and N atoms for which $t$ and $o$ sites are stable, we explain why the only path is along the $t$-$o$ direction. Finally, we discuss explicit formulas to compute coefficients of diffusion of interstitials in fcc structures.&#13.",3
Possible instability of the Fermi sea against surface plasma oscillations.,"We derive a generic formalism for studying the energy conversion processes in bounded metals. Using this formalism we show that in the collision-less limit the Fermi sea of metals should experience an instability against surface plasma oscillations, which opens for the latter an intrinsic self-amplification channel. The origin of the instability is clarified as arising from novel effects resulting from the translation symetry breaking due to the very presence of surface. The amplification rate of this channel is analytically evaluated on the basis of energy conservation and the effects of losses are discussed. In particular, the unique role played by the surface in energy conversion is unveiled. In contrast with common wisdom and in line with observations, Landau damping is shown as always overcompensated and therefore poses no serious issues in sub-wavelength plasmonics.",3
Squeezed Dirac and Topological Magnons in a Bosonic Honeycomb Optical Lattice.,"Quantum information storage using charge-neutral quasiparticles are expected to play a crucial role in the future of quantum computers. In this regard, magnons or collective spin-wave excitations in solid-state materials are promising candidates in the future of quantum computing. Here, we study the quantum squeezing of Dirac and topological magnons in a bosonic honeycomb optical lattice with spin-orbit interaction by utilizing the mapping to quantum spin-$1/2$ XYZ Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice with discrete Z$_2$ symmetry and a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We show that the squeezed magnons can be controlled by the Z$_2$ anisotropy and demonstrate how the noise in the system is periodically modified in the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases of the model. Our results also apply to solid-state honeycomb (anti)ferromagnetic insulators. &#13.",3
Optical properties of graphene nanocones under electric and magnetic fields.,Here we present a theoretical study of the optical properties of graphene nanocones tuned by external electric and magnetic fields. We investigate the effects of the size and topology of the carbon nanostructures on the density of states and on the electro- and magneto-absorption of linearly polarized electromagnetic radiation in different nanocone geometries. We find that the electric field induces changes in the electric charge distribution mainly at the cone edges. In the infrared range the absorption coefficient shows a peculiar dependence on the electric field (magnitude and direction) and on the photon polarization for all investigated structures. Our results suggest that the electric field may be used to control the electric charge at the apex and for a selective light absorption. The presence of an axial magnetic field induces new features in the nanocone density of states due to the induced localization effects. For high fields the density of states exhibits a sequence of peaks resembling the graphene Landau spectra. The magneto-absorption spectra present a series of resonances strongly sensitive to the photon polarization opening routes for manipulation of the optical responses.,3
Dipole-switch induced modification of the emissive response of carbon nanotubes.,"The interaction of carbon nanotubes with the molecular dipole switch spiropyran is expected to affect the optical response of the tubes. Until now, the need of anchor groups to immobilize the switches on the tubes has hindered experimental observation of effects of switching on the emission behavior of the tubes. Here we present spiropyran-carbon nanotubes complexes obtained by micelle swelling. This method does not require any anchor nor sophisticated chemistry to warrant close tube-switch proximity. For the first time we observe the shifts predicted theoretically and their effect on the tubes' excitation and emission energies.",3
Diverse carrier mobility of monolayer BNC<sub>x</sub>: A combined density functional theory and Boltzmann transport theory study.,"BNCX monolayer as a kind of two-dimensional material has numerous chemical atomic ratios and arrangements with different electronic structures. Via calculations on the basis of density functional theory and Boltzmann transport theory under deformation potential approximation, the band structures and carrier mobilities of BNCX (x=1,2,3,4) nanosheets are systematically investigated. The calculated results show that BNC2-1 is a material with very small band gap (0.02 eV) among all the structures while other BNCX monolayers are semiconductors with band gap ranging from 0.51 to 1.32 eV. The carrier mobility of BNCX varies considerably from tens to millions of cm2 V-1 s-1. For BNC2-1, the hole mobility and electron mobility along both x and y directions can reach 105 orders of magnitude, which is similar to the carrier mobility of graphene. Besides, all studied BNCX monolayers obviously have anisotropic hole mobility and electron mobility. In particular, for semiconductor BNC4, its hole mobility along y direction and electron mobility along x direction unexpectedly reach 106 orders of magnitude, even higher than that of graphene. Our findings suggest that BNCX layered materials with proper ratio and arrangement of carbon atoms will possess desirable charge transport properties, exhibiting potential applications in nanoelectronic devices.",3
Cavity QED with hybrid nanocircuits: from atomic-like physics to condensed matter phenomena.,"Circuit QED techniques have been instrumental in manipulating and probing with exquisite sensitivity the quantum state of superconducting quantum bits coupled to microwave cavities. Recently, it has become possible to fabricate new devices in which the superconducting quantum bits are replaced by hybrid mesoscopic circuits combining nanoconductors and metallic reservoirs. This mesoscopic QED provides a new experimental playground to study the light-matter interaction in electronic circuits. Here, we present the experimental state of the art of mesoscopic QED and its theoretical description. A first class of experiments focuses on the artificial atom limit, where some quasiparticles are trapped in nanocircuit bound states. In this limit, the circuit QED techniques can be used to manipulate and probe electronic degrees of freedom such as confined charges, spins, or Andreev pairs. A second class of experiments uses cavity photons to reveal the dynamics of electron tunneling between a nanoconductor and fermionic reservoirs. For instance, the Kondo effect, the charge relaxation caused by grounded metallic contacts, and the photo-emission caused by voltage-biased reservoirs have been studied. The tunnel coupling between nanoconductors and fermionic reservoirs also enable one to obtain split Cooper pairs, or Majorana bound states. Cavity photons represent a qualitatively new tool to study these exotic condensed matter states.",3
Numerical simulation of vortex dynamics in type-II superconductors in oscillating magnetic field using time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations.,"Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations were solved by the finite difference scheme for a superconducting sample in steady and oscillating magnetic fields for 3D geometry. The dynamic behaviour of penetrating and leaving magnetic vortices in superconductor with the oscillating magnetic field was simulated. Carrier concentration density and the average magnetization of the sample were studied as a function of the external oscillating magnetic field. Anomalies in carrier concentrations at certain magnetic field values were observed and discussed. It was also observed that the area swept by magnetization versus external magnetic field is magnetic oscillation frequency dependent, which increases with increasing frequencies. It was suggested that this effect may cause instability in the superconducting characteristics of the sample over a number of cycles. Calculated energy patterns showed consistency with vortex patterns in the steady magnetic field. Magnetic oscillations initiated oscillations in energy components, ripples in superconducting energy are subjected to the entrance and leaving of vortices, while instability observed in interaction energy is referred to vortex relaxation time.",3
Study on the regulation of focal adesions and cortical actin by matrix nanotopography in 3D environment.,"Matrix nanotopography plays an important role in regulating cell behaviors by providing spatial as well as mechanical cues for cells to sense. It has been proposed that nanoscale topography is possible to modulate the tensions which direct the formation of cytoskeleton and the organization of the membrane receptor within the cell, which in turn regulate intracellular mechanical and biochemical signaling. With current studies on this topic being performed mainly in 2D platforms, the question on how nanotopography can influence cell bahaviors in 3D environments has yet to be addressed. In this paper, we explored this question by placing cells in 3D hollow spherical polydimethylsiloxane scaffolds. After culturing rat embryonic fibroblast cells in two kinds of scaffold, one with smooth surface and the other with numerous nano-spikes, we observed that cells in the smooth scaffold have more anchoring sites and more focal adhesions than in the etched scaffold. Moreover, we found the presence of correlation between cortical actin, the important component for supporting cell attachment, and local cell geometry.",3
Monovacancy paramagnetism in neutron-irradiated graphite probed by <sup>13</sup>C NMR.,"We report on the magnetic properties of monovacancy defects in neutron-irradiated graphite, probed by $^{13}$C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The bulk paramagnetism of the defect moments is revealed by the temperature dependence of the NMR frequency shift and spectral linewidth, both of which follow a Curie behavior, in agreement with measurements of the macroscopic magnetization. Compared to pristine graphite, the fluctuating hyperfine fields generated by the defect moments lead to an enhancement of the $^{13}$C nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_{1}$ by about two orders of magnitude. With an applied magnetic field of 7.1 T, the temperature dependence of $1/T_{1}$ below about 10 K can well be described by a thermally activated form, $1/T_{1}\propto\exp(-\Delta/k_{B}T)$, yielding a singular Zeeman energy of ($0.41\pm0.01$) meV, in excellent agreement with the sole presence of polarized, non-interacting defect moments.",3
Revisiting local structural changes in GeO<sub>2</sub> glass at high pressure.,"Despite the great importance in fundamental and industrial fields, understanding structural changes for pressure-induced polyamorphism in network-forming glasses remains a formidable challenge. Here, we revisited the local structural transformations in GeO2 glass up to 54 GPa using x-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy via a combination diamond anvil cell and polycapillary half-lens. Three polyamorphic transitions can be clearly identified by XAFS structure refinement. First, a progressive increase of the nearest Ge-O distance and bond disorder to a maximum at ~5-16 GPa, in the same pressure region of previously observed tetrahedral-octahedral transformation. Second, a markedly decrease of the nearest Ge-O distance at ~16-22.6 GPa but a slight increase at ~22.6-32.7 GPa, with a concomitant decrease of bond disorder. This stage can be related to a second-order-like transition from less dense to dense octahedral glass. Third, another decrease in the nearest Ge-O distance at ~32.7-41.4 GPa but a slight increase up to 54 GPa, synchronized with a gradual increase of bond disorder. This stage provides strong evidence for ultrahigh-pressure polyamorphism with coordination number &gt;6. Furthermore, cooperative modification is observed in more distant shells. Those results provide a unified local structural picture for elucidating the polyamorphic transitions and densification process in GeO2 glass.",3
One-dimensional quantum matter: gold-induced nanowires on semiconductor surfaces.,"Interacting electrons confined to only one spatial dimension display a wide range of unusual many-body quantum phenomena, ranging from Peierls instabilities to the breakdown of the canonical Fermi liquid paradigm to even unusual spin phenomena. The underlying physics is not only of tremendous fundamental interest, but may also have bearing on device functionality in future micro- and nanoelectronics with lateral extensions reaching the atomic limit. Metallic adatoms deposited on semiconductor surfaces may form self-assembled atomic nanowires, thus representing highly interesting and well-controlled solid-state realizations of such 1D quantum systems. Here we review experimental and theoretical investigations on a few selected prototypical nanowire surface systems, specifically Ge(0 0 1)-Au and Si(hhk)-Au, and the search for 1D quantum states in them. We summarize the current state of research and identify open questions and issues.",3
Models and materials for generalized Kitaev magnetism.,"The exactly solvable Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice has recently received enormous attention linked to the hope of achieving novel spin-liquid states with fractionalized Majorana-like excitations. In this review, we analyze the mechanism proposed by Jackeli and Khaliullin to identify Kitaev materials based on spin-orbital dependent bond interactions and provide a comprehensive overview of its implications in real materials. We set the focus on experimental results and current theoretical understanding of planar honeycomb systems (Na2IrO3, alpha-Li2IrO3, and alpha-RuCl3), three-dimensional Kitaev materials (beta- and gamma-Li2IrO3), and other potential candidates, completing the review with the list of open questions awaiting new insights.",3
Effect of hydrostatic pressure on the superconducting properties of quasi-one-dimensional superconductor K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>3</sub>As<sub>3</sub>.,"K2Cr3As3 is a newly discovered quasi-one-dimensional superconductor with a Tc = 6.1 K and an upper critical field mu0Hc2(0) ~ 40 T three times larger than the Pauli paramagnetic limit mu0Hp that is suggestive of a spin-triplet Cooper pairing. In this paper, we have investigated the effects of hydrostatic pressure on its Tc and mu0Hc2 by measuring the ac magnetic susceptibility chi(T) under magnetic fields at various hydrostatic pressures up to 7.5 GPa. The major findings include: (1) Tc is suppressed gradually to below 2 K at 7.5 GPa; (2) the estimated mu0Hc2(0) decreases dramatically to below mu0Hp above ~2 GPa and becomes slight lower than the orbital limiting field mu0Hc2orb(0) estimated from the initial slope of upper critical field via mu0Hc2orb(0) = -0.73TcdHc2/dTc|Tc in the clean limit; (3) the estimated Maki parameter alpha = radical2Hc2orb(0)/Hp drops from 4 at ambient pressure to well below 1 at P &gt;2 GPa, suggesting the crossover from Pauli paramagnetic limiting to orbital limiting in the pair breaking process upon increasing pressure. These observations suggested that the application of hydrostatic pressure could drive K2Cr3As3 away from the ferromagnetic instability and lead to a breakdown of the spin-triplet pairing channel. We have also made a side-by-side comparison and discussed the distinct effects of chemical and physical pressures on the superconducting properties of K2Cr3As3.",3
First-principles study of Enhanced Magnetic Anisotropies in Transition-Metal Atoms Doped WS<sub>2</sub> Monolayer.,"Considerable progress in contemporary spintronics has been made in recent years for developing nanoscale data memory and quantum information processing. It is, however, still a great challenge to achieve the ultimate limit of storage bit. Two-dimensional materials, fortunately, provide an alternative solution to design materials with the expected miniaturizing scale, the chemical stability as well as the giant magnetic anisotropy energy. By performing first-principles calculations, we have examined two possible doping sites on WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; monolayer using three kind of transition metal (TM) atoms (Mn, Fe and Co). It is found that the TM atoms prefer to stay on the W atom site. Additionally, different from the case of Mn, doping Co and Fe atoms on the W vacancy can achieve perpendicular magnetic anisotropy with much larger magnitude, which provides a bright prospect for generating the atomic-scale magnets of storage devices.",3
Chiral quantum spin liquid on the repulsive Haldane-Hubbard model in square lattices.,"In this paper, we present a study on the repulsive Haldane-Hubbard model with spin-rotation symmetry in square lattices by deriving non-linear sigma model for magnetic states. It is found that a chiral spin liquid state as the ground state of the correlated system exists in the [Formula: see text] topological spin-density wave proposed by Wu et al (2016 J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 28 115602), of which the low energy physics can be determined by the Chern-Simons-Hopf gauge field theory.",3
Anomalous thermal conductance of graphyne under lower temperature.,"The thermal transport properties of graphyne are investigated via equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD) simulations and non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method. It is found that the room-temperature thermal conductivity of graphyne is 93% lower than that of graphene with a similar size and decreases steeply with increasing the number of acetylenic linkages, which agrees with the results obtained by NEGF method qualitatively. Lattice dynamics calculations reveal that these phenomena can be attributed to the reduction of both phonon group velocities and phonon lifetimes in graphyne at low-frequency region. However, when the temperature is less than 30 K, the thermal conductance of graphyne exceeds that of graphene. Moreover, the anomalous thermal conductance behavior is not sensitive to the system lateral size. The underlying mechanisms for such phenomena are elaborated by the normal mode analysis.",3
Structure of electric double layers in capacitive systems and to what extent (classical) density functional theory describes it.,"Ongoing scientific interest is aimed at the properties and structure of electric double layers (EDLs), which are crucial for capacitive energy storage, water treatment, and energy harvesting technologies like supercapacitors, desalination devices, blue engines, and thermocapacitive heat-to-current converters. A promising tool to describe their physics on a microscopic level is (classical) density functional theory (DFT), which can be applied in order to analyze pair correlations and charge ordering in the primitive model of charged hard spheres. This simple model captures the main properties of ionic liquids and solutions and it predicts many of the phenomena that occur in EDLs. The latter often lead to anomalous response in the differential capacitance of EDLs. This work constructively reviews the powerful theoretical framework of DFT and its recent developments regarding the description of EDLs. It explains to what extent current approaches in DFT describe structural ordering and in-plane transitions in EDLs, which occur when the corresponding electrodes are charged. Further, the review briefly summarizes the history of modeling EDLs, presents applications, and points out limitations and strengths in present theoretical approaches. It concludes that DFT as a sophisticated microscopic theory for ionic systems is expecting a challenging but promising future in both fundamental research and applications in supercapacitive technologies.",3
Strong second harmonic generation in two-dimensional ferroelectric IV-monochalcogenides.,"The two-dimensional ferroelectrics GeS, GeSe, SnS and SnSe are expected to have large spontaneous in-plane electric polarization and enhanced shift-current response. Using density functional methods, we show that these materials also exhibit the largest effective second harmonic generation reported so far. It can reach magnitudes up to [Formula: see text] which is about an order of magnitude larger than that of prototypical GaAs. To rationalize this result we model the optical response with a simple one-dimensional two-band model along the spontaneous polarization direction. Within this model the second-harmonic generation tensor is proportional to the shift-current response tensor. The large shift current and second harmonic responses of GeS, GeSe, SnS and SnSe make them promising non-linear materials for optoelectronic applications.",3
Charge transport by inverse micelles in non-polar media.,"Charged inverse micelles play an important role in the electrical charging and the electrodynamics of nonpolar colloidal dispersions relevant for applications such as electronic ink displays and liquid toner printing. This review examines the properties and the behavior of charged inverse micelles in microscale devices in the absence of colloidal particles. It is discussed how charge in nonpolar liquids is stabilized in inverse micelles and how conductivity depends on the inverse micelle size, water content and ionic impurities. Frequently used nonpolar surfactant systems are investigated with emphasis on aerosol-OT (AOT) and poly-isobutylene succinimide (PIBS) in dodecane. Charge generation in the bulk by disproportionation is studied from measurements of conductivity as a function of surfactant concentration and from generation currents in quasi steady-state. When a potential difference is applied, the steady-state situation can show electric field screening or complete charge separation. Different regimes of charge transport are identified when a voltage step is applied. It is shown how the transient and steady-state currents depend on the rate of bulk generation, on insulating layers and on the sticking or non-sticking behavior of charged inverse micelles at interfaces. For the cases of AOT and PIBS in dodecane, the magnitude of the generation rate and the type of interaction at the interface are very different.",3

Photonics surface waves on metamaterials interfaces.,"A surface wave (SW) in optics is a light wave, which is supported at an interface of two dissimilar media and propagates along the interface with its field amplitude exponentially decaying away from the boundary. The research on surface waves has been flourishing in last few decades thanks to their unique properties of surface sensitivity and field localization. These features have resulted in applications in nano-guiding, sensing, light-trapping and imaging based on the near-field techniques, contributing to the establishment of the nanophotonics as a field of research. Up to present, a wide variety of surface waves has been investigated in numerous material and structure settings. This paper reviews the recent progress and development in the physics of SWs localized at metamaterial interfaces, as well as bulk media in order to provide broader perspectives on optical surface waves in general. For each type of the surface waves, we discuss material and structural platforms. We mainly focus on experimental realizations in the visible and near-infrared wavelength ranges. We also address existing and potential application of SWs in chemical and biological sensing, and experimental excitation and characterization methods.",3
Anomalous cyclotron mass dependence on the magnetic field and Berry's phase in (Cd1-x-y Zn x Mn y )3As2 solid solutions.,"Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) effect and magnetoresistance measurements of single crystals of diluted II-V magnetic semiconductors (Cd1-x-y Zn x Mn y )3As2 (x + y = 0.4, y = 0.04 and 0.08) are investigated in the temperature range T = 4.2 / 300 K and in transverse magnetic field B = 0 / 25 T. The values of the cyclotron mass m c, the effective g-factor g*, and the Dingle temperature T D are defined. In one of the samples (y = 0.04) a strong dependence of the cyclotron mass on the magnetic field m c(B) = m c(0) + alphaB is observed. The value of a phase shift close to beta = 0.5 indicates the presence of Berry phase and 3D Dirac fermions in a single crystals of (Cd1-x-y Zn x Mn y )3As2 in one of the samples (y = 0.08).",3
Halogenation of SiC for band-gap engineering and excitonic functionalization.,"The optical excitation spectra and excitonic resonances are investigated in systematically functionalized SiC with Fluorine and/or Chlorine utilizing density functional theory in combination with many-body perturbation theory. The latter is required for a realistic description of the energy band-gaps as well as for the theoretical realization of excitons. Structural, electronic and optical properties are scrutinized and show the high stability of the predicted two-dimensional materials. Their realization in laboratory is thus possible. Large band-gaps of the order of 4 eV are found in the so-called GW approximation, with the occurrence of bright excitons, optically active in the four investigated materials. Their binding energies vary from 0.9 eV to 1.75 eV depending on the decoration choice and in one case, a dark exciton is foreseen to exist in the fully chlorinated SiC. The wide variety of opto-electronic properties suggest halogenated SiC as interesting materials with potential not only for solar cell applications, anti-reflection coatings or high-reflective systems but also for a possible realization of excitonic Bose-Einstein condensation.",3
Relaxation dynamics and polydispersivity associated with defects and ferroelectric correlations in Ba doped EuTiO3.,"We presented detailed frequency and temperature dependent dielectric response in Eu1-xBaxTiO3 (0 &lt; x &lt; 0.5). Excluding grain boundary effects, four relaxation mechanisms have been observed. Relaxation dynamics were observed to arise due to hopping conduction associated with defects namely, oxygen vacancies, Eu3+ and Ti3+ ions. Dielectric relaxation analysis led to identification of Ti ions in two different environments with different relaxation rates in the overall EuTiO3 perovskite structure. Emergence of another relaxation mechanism associated with ferroelectric order as a consequence of formation of polar regions have also been observed for higher Ba concentrations. Addition of Ba led to the identification of relaxation dynamics associated with hopping conduction between Eu ions, Ti ions (in the regions with and without oxygen vacancies) and with the formation of ferroelectric polar regions. Furthermore, polydispersivity and relaxation times have been extracted within the frame work of modified Debye model. Relaxation times have been observed to increase with decrease in temperature while larger values of polydispersivity revealed wide distribution of relaxation times due to the presence of lattice parameter and energy barrier distributions.",3
The offset droplet: a new methodology for studying the solid/water interface using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.,"The routine study of the solid-water interface by XPS is potentially revolutionary as this development opens up whole new areas of study for photoelectron spectroscopy. To date this has been realised by only a few groups worldwide and current techniques have significant restrictions on the type of samples which can be studied. Here we present a novel and uniquely flexible approach to the problem. By introducing a thin capillary into the NAP-XPS, a small droplet can be injected onto the sample surface, offset from the analysis area by several mm. By careful control of the droplet size a water layer of controllable thickness can be established in the analysis area-continuous with the bulk droplet. We present results from the solid-water interface on a vacuum prepared TiO2(110) single crystal and demonstrate that the solid/liquid interface is addressable.",3
"Electronic structure of ferromagnetic heavy fermion, YbPdSi, YbPdGe, and YbPtGe studied by photoelectron spectroscopy, x-ray emission spectroscopy, and DFT + DMFT calculations.","Electronic structures of ferromagnetic heavy fermion Yb compounds of YbPdSi, YbPdGe, and YbPtGe are studied by photoelectron spectroscopy around the Yb 4d-4f resonance, resonant x-ray emission spectroscopy at the Yb L 3 absorption edge, and density functional theory combined with dynamical mean field theory calculations. These compounds all have a temperature-independent intermediate Yb valence with large [Formula: see text] and small [Formula: see text] components. The magnitude of the Yb valence is evaluated to be YbPtGe [Formula: see text] YbPdGe [Formula: see text] YbPdSi, suggesting that YbPtGe is the closest to the quantum critical point among the three Yb compounds. Our results support the scenario of the coexistence of heavy fermion behavior and ferromagnetic ordering which is described by a magnetically-ordered Kondo lattice where the magnitude of the Kondo effect and the RKKY interaction are comparable.",3
Hybrid-DFT + V w method for band structure calculation of semiconducting transition metal compounds: the case of cerium dioxide.,"Hybrid functionals' non-local exchange-correlation potential contains a derivative discontinuity that improves on standard semi-local density functional theory (DFT) band gaps. Moreover, by careful parameterization, hybrid functionals can provide self-interaction reduced description of selected states. On the other hand, the uniform description of all the electronic states of a given system is a known drawback of these functionals that causes varying accuracy in the description of states with different degrees of localization. This limitation can be remedied by the orbital dependent exact exchange extension of hybrid functionals; the hybrid-DFT + V w method (Ivady et al 2014 Phys. Rev. B 90 035146). Based on the analogy of quasi-particle equations and hybrid-DFT single particle equations, here we demonstrate that parameters of hybrid-DFT + V w functional can be determined from approximate theoretical quasi-particle spectra without any fitting to experiment. The proposed method is illustrated on the charge self-consistent electronic structure calculation for cerium dioxide where itinerant valence states interact with well-localized 4f atomic like states, making this system challenging for conventional methods, either hybrid-DFT or LDA + U, and therefore allowing for a demonstration of the advantages of the proposed scheme.",3
Detection of suspended nanoparticles with near-ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.,"Two systems of suspended nanoparticles have been studied with near-ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy: silver nanoparticles in water and strontium fluoride-calcium fluoride core-shell nanoparticles in ethylene glycol. The corresponding dry samples were measured under ultra high vacuum for comparison. The results obtained under near-ambient pressure were overall comparable to those obtained under ultra high vacuum, although measuring silver nanoparticles in water requires a high pass energy and a long acquisition time. A shift towards higher binding energies was found for the silver nanoparticles in aqueous suspension compared to the corresponding dry sample, which can be assigned to a change of surface potential at the water-nanoparticle interface. The shell-thickness of the core-shell nanoparticles was estimated based on simulated spectra from the National Institute of Standards and Technology database for simulation of electron spectra for surface analysis. With the instrumental set-up presented in this paper, nanoparticle suspensions in a suitable container can be directly inserted into the analysis chamber and measured without prior sample preparation.",3
Evidence for thermal activation in the glassy dynamics of insulating granular aluminum conductance.,"Insulating granular aluminum is one of the proto-typical disordered insulators whose low temperature electrical conductance exhibits ubiquitous non-equilibrium phenomena. These include slow responses to temperature or gate voltage changes, characteristic field effect anomalies and ageing phenomena typical of a glass. In this system the influence of temperature on the glassy dynamics has remained elusive. A similar situation was met in insulating indium oxide and it was concluded that in high carrier density Anderson insulators, electronic slow relaxations essentially proceed via activationless processes. In this work we experimentally demonstrate that thermal effects do play a role and that the slow dynamics in granular aluminum is subject to thermal activation. We show how its signatures can be revealed and activation energy distributions can be extracted, providing a promising grasp on the nature of the microscopic mechanism at work in glassy Anderson insulators. We explain why some of the experimental protocols previously used in the literature fail to reveal thermal activation in these systems. Our results and analyses call for a reassessment of the emblematic case of indium oxide, and question the existence of purely activationless dynamics in any of the systems studied so far.",3
Confinement sensitivity in quantum dot singlet-triplet relaxation.,"Spin-orbit mediated phonon relaxation in a two-dimensional quantum dot is investigated using different confining potentials. Elliptical harmonic oscillator and cylindrical well results are compared to each other in the case of a two-electron GaAs quantum dot subjected to a tilted magnetic field. The lowest energy set of two-body singlet and triplet states are calculated including spin-orbit and magnetic effects. These are used to calculate the phonon induced transition rate from the excited triplet to the ground state singlet for magnetic fields up to where the states cross. The roll of the cubic Dresselhaus effect, which is found to be much more important than previously assumed, and the positioning of 'spin hot-spots' are discussed and relaxation rates for a few different systems are exhibited.",3
Spectroscopic evidence of a new energy scale for superconductivity in H3S.,"The discovery of a superconducting phase in sulfur hydride under high pressure with a critical temperature above 200 K has provided fresh impetus to the search for superconductors at ever higher temperatures. Although this systems displays all the hallmarks of superconductivity, the mechanism through which it arises remains to be determined. Here we provide a first optical spectroscopy study of this superconductor. Experimental results for the optical reflectivity of H3S, under hydrostatic pressure of 150 GPa, for several temperatures and over the range 60 to 600 meV of photon energies, are compared with theoretical calculations based on Eliashberg theory. Two significant features stand out: some remarkably strong infrared active phonons at around 160 meV, and a band with a depressed reflectance in the superconducting state in the region from 450 meV to 600 meV. In this energy range H3S becomes more reflecting with increasing temperature, a change that is traced to superconductivity originating from the electron-phonon interaction. The shape, magnitude, and energy dependence of this band at 150 K agrees with our calculations. This provides strong evidence of a conventional mechanism. However, the unusually strong optical phonon suggests a contribution of electronic degrees of freedom.",3
Nonlinear coherent structures in granular crystals.,"The study of granular crystals, which are nonlinear metamaterials that consist of closely packed arrays of particles that interact elastically, is a vibrant area of research that combines ideas from disciplines such as materials science, nonlinear dynamics, and condensed-matter physics. Granular crystals exploit geometrical nonlinearities in their constitutive microstructure to produce properties (such as tunability and energy localization) that are not conventional to engineering materials and linear devices. In this topical review, we focus on recent experimental, computational, and theoretical results on nonlinear coherent structures in granular crystals. Such structures-which include traveling solitary waves, dispersive shock waves, and discrete breathers-have fascinating dynamics, including a diversity of both transient features and robust, long-lived patterns that emerge from broad classes of initial data. In our review, we primarily discuss phenomena in one-dimensional crystals, as most research to date has focused on such scenarios, but we also present some extensions to two-dimensional settings. Throughout the review, we highlight open problems and discuss a variety of potential engineering applications that arise from the rich dynamic response of granular crystals.",3
Nonadiabatic exchange-correlation kernel for strongly correlated materials.,"We formulate a rigorous method for calculating a nonadiabatic (frequency-dependent) exchange-correlation (XC) kernel appropriate for accurate description of both equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of strongly correlated systems within the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) via the charge susceptibility, which is in turn obtained from dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) based on the effective multi-orbital Hubbard model. Application to the simple case of the one-orbital Hubbard model already shows the importance of the nonadiabatic kernel as it leads to significant modification of the excitation spectrum-shifting the (adiabatic) peak and disclosing another that is reminiscent of the solution from DMFT. The impact of dynamical effects, naturally included through the nonadiabaticity of the XC kernel, becomes even more transparent in our consideration of the nonequilibrium charge-density response of a multi-orbital perovskite, YTiO3, to a perturbation by a femtosecond (fs) laser pulse. These initial results indicate that electron-electron correlations and nonadiabatic features may significantly affect the spectrum and nonequilibrium properties of strongly correlated systems. We also propose an algorithm for extension of the approach to non-linear response. The transparency and computational efficiency of this non-adiabatic TDDFT+DMFT approach opens the door to examination of the spectra and response of multi-orbital systems with many nonequivalent atoms-bulk material, films and nanostructures.",3
Observation of pseudogap in MgB<sub>2</sub>.,"We investigate the electronic structure of a specially prepared highly dense conventional high temperature superconductor, MgB2 employing high resolution photoemission spectroscopy. The spectral evolution close to the Fermi energy is commensurate to BCS descriptions as expected. However, the spectra in the wider energy range reveal emergence of a pseudogap much above the superconducting transition temperature indicating apparent departure from the BCS scenario. The energy scale of the pseudogap is comparable to the energy of E2g phonon mode responsible for superconductivity in MgB2 and the pseudogap can be attributed to the effect of electron-phonon coupling on the electronic structure. These results reveal a scenario of the emergence of the superconducting gap within an electron-phonon coupling induced pseudogap and have significant implication in the study of high temperature superconductors.",3
Simulation study on exchange interaction and unique magnetization near ferromagnetic morphotropic phase boundary.,"Extensive efforts have been made in searching enhanced functionalities near the so-called morphotropic phase boundaries (MPBs) in both ferroelectric and ferromagnetic materials. Due to the exchange anti-symmetry of the wave function of fermions, it is widely recognized that the exchange interaction plays a critical role in ferromagnetism. As a quantum effect, the exchange interaction is magnitudes larger than electric interaction, leading to a fundamental difference between ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism. In this paper, we establish an energetic model capturing the interplay among the anisotropy energy, magnetostatic energy and the exchange energy to investigate systematically the effects of the exchange energy on the behavior of the ferromagnetic MPB. For the first time, it is found that the exchange energy can narrow the width of MPB region in the composition temperature phase diagram for ferromagnetic MPB systems. As temperature increases, MPB region becomes wider because of the weakening of the exchange interaction. Our simulation results suggest that the exchange energy play a critical role on the unique behavior of ferromagnetic MPB, which is in contrast different from that of ferroelectric MPB.",3
New understanding of nano-scale interstitial dislocation loops in BCC iron.,"Complex states of nanoscale interstitial dislocation loop can be described by its habit plane and Burgers vector. Using atomistic simulations, we provide direct evidences on the change of the habit plane of a 1/2<1 1 1> loop from {1 1 1} to {1 1 0} and {2 1 1}, in agreement with TEM observations. A new {1 0 0} habit plane of this loop is also predicted by simulations. The non-conservation of the Burgers vector is approved theoretically for: (1) dislocation reactions between loops with different Burgers vectors and (2) the transition between <1 0 0> loops and 1/2<1 1 1> loops. The rotation from a 1/2<1 1 1> to a <1 0 0> loop has also been explored, which occurs at 570 K for time on the order of 10 s. The dislocation-precipitate phase duality and change of habit plane are then proposed as new features for nano-scale dislocation loops.",3
The magnetic properties and structure of the quasi-two-dimensional antiferromagnet CoPS3.,"The magnetic properties and magnetic structure are presented for CoPS3, a quasi-two-dimensional antiferromagnet on a honeycomb lattice with a Neel temperature of [Formula: see text] K. The compound is shown to have XY-like anisotropy in its susceptibility, and the anisotropy is analysed to extract crystal field parameters. For temperatures between 2 K and 300 K, no phase transitions were observed in the field-dependent magnetization up to 10 Tesla. Single-crystal neutron diffraction shows that the magnetic propagation vector is k = [Formula: see text] with the moments mostly along the [Formula: see text] axis and with a small component along the [Formula: see text] axis, which largely verifies the previously-published magnetic structure for this compound. The magnetic Bragg peak intensity decreases with increasing temperature as a power law with exponent [Formula: see text] for [Formula: see text].",3
Ambient pressure phase transitions over Ir(1 1 1): at the onset of CO oxidation.,"In this study we report on the adsorbate structures on an Ir(1 1 1) surface during the phase transition from the inactive to the active state during CO oxidation. The CO oxidation over Pt(1 1 1) is used as a reference case. Where Pt(1 1 1) either is inactive and CO covered or active and O covered, Ir(1 1 1) exhibits a transition state with co-existing chemisorbed O and CO. The observed structural differences are explained in terms of DFT-calculated adsorption energies. For Pt(1 1 1) the repulsive CO-O interaction makes co-existing chemisorbed CO and O unfavourable, while for Ir(1 1 1) the stronger O and CO adsorption allows for overcoming the repulsive interaction. At the onset of CO oxidation over Ir(1 1 1), a CO structure containing defects forms, which enables O2 to dissociatively adsorb on the Ir(1 1 1) surface, thus enabling the CO oxidation reaction. At the mass transfer limit, the Ir(1 1 1) surface is covered by a chemisorbed O structure with defects; hence, the active surface is predominately chemisorbed O covered at a total pressure of 0.5 mbar and no oxide formation is observed.",3
Human-brain ferritin studied by muon spin rotation: a pilot study.,"Muon spin rotation is employed to investigate the spin dynamics of ferritin proteins isolated from the brain of an Alzheimer's disease (AD) patient and of a healthy control, using a sample of horse-spleen ferritin as a reference. A model based on the Neel theory of superparamagnetism is developed in order to interpret the spin relaxation rate of the muons stopped by the core of the protein. Using this model, our preliminary observations show that ferritins from the healthy control are filled with a mineral compatible with ferrihydrite, while ferritins from the AD patient contain a crystalline phase with a larger magnetocrystalline anisotropy, possibly compatible with magnetite or maghemite.",3
Quantum plasmon model for the terahertz photoconductivity in intrinsic semiconductor nanowires.,"A quantum plasmon model for the terahertz photoconductivity in intrinsic semiconductor nanowires is developed. The classical plasmon model assumes the excited electron in semiconductors feels a restoring force generated by a harmonic-oscillator potential. Although it is successfully applied to explain the terahertz photoconductivity in semiconductor nanowires, the classical treatment of the potential weakens accurate theoretical analysis. Here I treat the potential in a full quantum way and present an exact analytical formula for photoconductivity. The formula not only gives more reasonable photoconductivity, but also has the same conciseness when compared with that of the classical plasmon model. The validity of the quantum plasmon model is proved independently by numerical calculations in real space.",3
Spin-wave excitations in the spin-density wave state of doped iron pnictides.,"We investigate spin-wave excitations in the spin-density wave state of doped iron pnictides within a five-orbital model. We find that the excitations along ([Formula: see text]) --> ([Formula: see text]) are very sensitive to dopings whereas they do not exhibit a similar sensitivity along ([Formula: see text]) --> ([Formula: see text]). Secondly, the ellipticity of the elliptical ring-like excitations around ([Formula: see text]) is also very much dependent on doping. Thirdly, the spin-wave spectral weight shifts towards the low-energy region as it moves away from zero doping. We find several features to be in qualitative agreement with the inelastic neutron-scattering measurements for the doped pnictides.",3
Thermoelectric performance and the role of anti-site disorder in the 24-electron Heusler TiFe2Sn.,"Heusler compounds XY 2 Z with 24 valence electrons per formula unit are potential thermoelectric materials, given their thermal and chemical stability and their relatively earth-abundant constituent elements. We present results on the 24-electron compound TiFe2Sn here. First principles calculations on this compound suggest semiconducting behavior. A relatively flat conduction band that could be associated with a high Seebeck coefficient upon electron doping is found. A series of compounds have been prepared and characterized using a combination of synchrotron x-ray and neutron diffraction studies to understand the effects of site order/disorder phenomena and n-type doping. Samples fabricated by a three step processing approach were subjected to high temperature Seebeck and electrical resistivity measurements. Ti:Fe anti-site disorder is present in the stoichiometric compound and these defects are reduced when starting Ti-rich compositions are employed. Additionally, we investigate control of the Seebeck coefficient through the introduction of carriers through the substitution of Sb on the Sn site in these intrinsically p-type materials.",3
Novel boron channel-based structure of boron carbide at high pressures.,"Boron carbide (B4C) is one of the hardest materials known to date. The extreme hardness of B4C arises from architecturally efficient B12 or B11C icosahedrons and strong inter-icosahedral B-C bonding. As an excellent material for use in ballistic armor, the mechanic limit of B4C and possible phase transitions under extreme stress conditions are of great interest. Here we systematically explored the post-icosahedral solid structures of B4C under high pressure, using an unbiased structure search method. A new structure composed of extended framework of B and zigzag chains of C is predicted to be stable above 96 GPa. The new structure was predicted to have a high Vickers hardness of 55 GPa and simultaneously to retain a metallic ground state. The exceptional mechanical properties found in this structure are attributed to strong sp (3) covalent network formed under extreme pressure conditions. The predicted structure represents a new type of superhard boron carbides that form under high pressure without the presence of boron icosahedrons, which encourages experimental exploration in this direction.",3
Large scale calculations of thermoelectric transport coefficients: a case study of gamma-graphyne with point defects.,"Defects such as vacancies and impurities could have profound effects on the transport properties of thermoelectric materials. However, it is usually quite difficult to directly calculate the thermoelectric properties of defect-containing systems via first-principles method since very large supercell is required. In this work, based on the linear response theory and the kernel polynomial method, we present an efficient approach that can help to calculate the thermoelectric transport coefficients of a large system containing millions of atoms at arbitrary chemical potential and temperature. As a prototype example, we consider dilute vacancies and hydrogen impurities in a large scale gamma-graphyne sheet and discuss their effects on the thermoelectric transport properties.",3
Critical and compensation behavior of a mixed spin-5/2 and spin-3/2 Ising antiferromagnetic system in a core/shell nanowire.,"In this work, Monte Carlo simulations based on metropolis algorithm were performed to study the critical and compensation temperatures of a core-shell nanowire with spins [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], respectively, considering an Ising antiferromagnetic system. The influence of nearest neighbors exchange interactions and crystal field anisotropy on the critical and compensation behaviors of the system has been analyzed. The effects of the nanowire height in the critical and compensation temperatures were evaluated. The results show that, for a system with given values of exchange interaction constants and crystal field anisotropy, a compensation point only appears if two requirements are satisfied. First, the weight of the core magnetization in the total magnetization must be greater than the weight of the shell magnetization at zero temperature. And second, the exchange constant of shell ions must be greater than a certain value. This value is, at the same time, greater than the exchange constant of core ions. The critical and compensation temperatures are very sensitive to variations in the exchange constant of the shell ions and core ions, respectively, while the crystal field anisotropy affects both temperatures.",3
Two-probe STM experiments at the atomic level.,"Direct characterization of planar atomic or molecular scale devices and circuits on a supporting surface by multi-probe measurements requires unprecedented stability of single atom contacts and manipulation of scanning probes over large, nanometer scale area with atomic precision. In this work, we describe the full methodology behind atomically defined two-probe scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments performed on a model system: dangling bond dimer wire supported on a hydrogenated germanium (0 0 1) surface. We show that 70 nm long atomic wire can be simultaneously approached by two independent STM scanners with exact probe to probe distance reaching down to 30 nm. This allows direct wire characterization by two-probe I-V characteristics at distances below 50 nm. Our technical results presented in this work open a new area for multi-probe research, which can be now performed with precision so far accessible only by single-probe scanning probe microscopy (SPM) experiments.",3
Low-temperature thermal transport and thermopower of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors.,"We study the low temperature thermal conductivity of single-layer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). In the low temperature regime where heat is carried primarily through transport of electrons, thermal conductivity is linked to electrical conductivity through the Wiedemann-Franz law (WFL). Using a k.p Hamiltonian that describes the [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] valley edges, we compute the zero-frequency electric (Drude) conductivity using the Kubo formula to obtain a numerical estimate for the thermal conductivity. The impurity scattering determined transit time of electrons which enters the Drude expression is evaluated within the self-consistent Born approximation. The analytic expressions derived show that low temperature thermal conductivity (1) is determined by the band gap at the valley edges in monolayer TMDCs and (2) in presence of disorder which can give rise to the variable range hopping regime, there is a distinct reduction. Additionally, we compute the Mott thermopower and demonstrate that under a high frequency light beam, a valley-resolved thermopower can be obtained. A closing summary reviews the implications of results followed by a brief discussion on applicability of the WFL and its breakdown in context of the presented calculations.",3
Gutzwiller variational approach to the two-impurity Anderson model for a metallic host at particle-hole symmetry.,"We study Gutzwiller-correlated wave functions as variational ground states for the two-impurity Anderson model (TIAM) at particle-hole symmetry as a function of the impurity separation [Formula: see text]. Our variational state is obtained by applying the Gutzwiller many-particle correlator to a single-particle product state. We determine the optimal single-particle product state fully variationally from an effective non-interacting TIAM that contains a direct electron transfer between the impurities as variational degree of freedom. For a large Hubbard interaction U between the electrons on the impurities, the impurity spins experience a Heisenberg coupling proportional to [Formula: see text] where V parameterizes the strength of the on-site hybridization. For small Hubbard interactions we observe weakly coupled impurities. In general, for a three-dimensional simple cubic lattice we find discontinuous quantum phase transitions that separate weakly interacting impurities for small interactions from singlet pairs for large interactions.",3
Epitaxial strain driven crossover from Drude to Drude-Smith terahertz conductivity dynamics in LaNiO3 thin films.,"We investigate the hetero-epitaxial strain driven low-energy charge dynamics in compressive and tensile strained LaNiO3 thin films employing terahertz (THz) time-domain spectroscopy. The complex THz conductivity exhibits a crossover from Drude type metallic behavior for the compressive film to a Drude-Smith type disordered behavior for the tensile film. This demonstration of strain driven crossover in THz conductivity dynamics, while the two films have qualitatively similar dc conductivities, (i) brings out the potential of THz technology in distinguishing between similar dc electronic phases and (ii) suggests that LaNiO3 under compressive strain is a better candidate for applications as electrodes in oxides electronics.",3
Manipulation of native point defect behavior in rutile TiO2 via surfaces and extended defects.,"Semiconductor surfaces offer efficient pathways for exchanging native point defects with the underlying bulk. For rutile TiO2(1 1 0), isotopic self-diffusion studies of oxygen have suggested that the surface may act as a source for Oi while simultaneously acting as a sink for titanium interstitials Tii. Through self-diffusion measurements with labeled Ti as well as O, the present work develops a more complete picture of the diffusion-reaction network involving Oi and Tii, complete with the surface acting as a source for whichever elements are available from the gas phase and a sink for elements that are not. The picture points to the importance of extended defects such as platelets and crystallographic shear planes as reservoirs of Oi and Tii, acting as net sources or sinks of these species depending upon specific conditions. The results exemplify the combined roles of surfaces and extended defects in regulating point defect behavior even in macroscopic metal oxide crystals, and point to specific strategies for manipulating that behavior intentionally.",3
Relaxation dynamics of a driven two-level system coupled to a Bose-Einstein condensate: application to quantum dot-dipolar exciton gas hybrid systems.,"We develop a microscopic theory for the relaxation dynamics of an optically pumped two-level system (TLS) coupled to a bath of weakly interacting Bose gas. Using Keldysh formalism and diagrammatic perturbation theory, expressions for the relaxation times of the TLS Rabi oscillations are derived when the boson bath is in the normal state and the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) state. We apply our general theory to consider an irradiated quantum dot coupled with a boson bath consisting of a two-dimensional dipolar exciton gas. When the bath is in the BEC regime, relaxation of the Rabi oscillations is due to both condensate and non-condensate fractions of the bath bosons for weak TLS-light coupling and pre dominantly due to the non-condensate fraction for strong TLS-light coupling. Our theory also shows that a phase transition of the bath from the normal to the BEC state strongly influences the relaxation rate of the TLS Rabi oscillations. The TLS relaxation rate is approximately independent of the pump field frequency and monotonically dependent on the field strength when the bath is in the low-temperature regime of the normal phase. Phase transition of the dipolar exciton gas leads to a non-monotonic dependence of the TLS relaxation rate on both the pump field frequency and field strength, providing a characteristic signature for the detection of BEC phase transition of the coupled dipolar exciton gas.",3
Sonogashira cross-coupling over Au(1 1 1): from UHV to ambient pressure.,"We have studied the reaction of phenylacetylene (PA) with chloro-, bromo-, and iodobenzene on the Au(1 1 1) surface as a model system for the gold-catalysed Sonogashira cross-coupling. Both ultrahigh vacuum-based and ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy show that iodo- and chlorobenzene (IB and CB) undergo the cross-coupling reaction towards diphenylacetylene. Bromobenzene (BB), in contrast, does not react in the UHV experiments. Further, at ambient pressure signs are found for poisoning of the Au(1 1 1) surface by a carbon species formed in the reaction. The understanding obtained in the reaction experiments are based on a thorough investigation of the adsorption of PA, IB, CB, and BB on the Au(1 1 1) surface by soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy and temperature-dependent x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. In particular, the experiments provide the orientation of the intact adsorbates with respect to the surfaces at liquid nitrogen temperature. Dissociation in the temperature regime between -80 and -15 degrees C is observed for iodo- and chlorobenzene, but not for BB, in agreement with that only IB and CB, but not BB, react with PA to form diphenylacetylene. The difference is tentatively attributed to a difference in surface orientation of the different halobenzenes.",3
Electrical and thermoelectric transport properties of two-dimensional fermionic systems with <i>k</i>-cubic spin-orbit coupling.,"We investigate effect of &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-cubic spin-orbit interaction on electrical and thermoelectric transport properties of two-dimensional fermionic systems. We obtain exact analytical expressions of the inverse relaxation time (IRT) and the Drude conductivity for long-range Coulomb and short-range delta scattering potentials. The IRT reveals that the scattering is completely suppressed along the three directions theta = (2n+1)pi/3 with n=1,2,3. We also obtain analytical results of the thermopower and thermal conductivity at low temperature. The thermoelectric transport coefficients obey the Wiedemann-Franz law, even in the presence of &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-cubic Rashba spin-orbit interaction (RSOI) at low temperature. In the presence of quantizing magnetic field, the signature of the RSOI is revealed through the appearance of the beating pattern in the Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations of thermopower and thermal conductivity in low magnetic field regime. The empirical formulae for the SdH oscillation frequencies accurately describe the locations of the beating nodes. The beating pattern in magnetothermoelectric measurement can be used to extract the spin-orbit coupling constant.",3
Analytic approach to magneto-strain tuning of electronic transport through a graphene nanobubble: perspectives for a strain sensor.,"We consider the scattering of Dirac particles in graphene due to the superposition of an external magnetic field and mechanical strain. As a model for a graphene nanobubble, we find exact analytical solutions for single-particle states inside and outside a circular region submitted to the fields. Finally, we obtain analytical expressions for the scattering cross-section, as well as for the Landauer current through the circular region. Our results provide a fully-analytical treatment for electronic transport through a graphene nanobubble, showing that a combination of a physical magnetic field and strain leads to valley polarization and filtering of the electronic current. Moreover, our analytical model provides an explicit metrology principle to measure strain by performing conductance experiments under a controlled magnetic field imposed over the sample.",3
"Tuning the p-type Schottky barrier in 2D metal/semiconductor interface:boron-sheet on MoSe2, and WSe2.","Van der Waals (vdW) metal/semiconductor heterostructures have been investigated through first-principles calculations. We have considered the recently synthesized borophene (Mannix et al 2015 Science 350 1513), and the planar boron sheets (S1 and S2) (Feng et al 2016 Nat. Chem. 8 563) as the 2D metal layer, and the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) MoSe2, and WSe2 as the semiconductor monolayer. We find that the energetic stability of those 2D metal/semiconductor heterojunctions is mostly ruled by the vdW interactions; however, chemical interactions also take place in borophene/TMDC. The electronic charge transfer at the metal/semiconductor interface has been mapped, where we find a a net charge transfer from the TMDCs to the boron sheets. Further electronic structure calculations reveal that the metal/semiconductor interfaces, composed by planar boron sheets S1 and S2, present a p-type Schottky barrier which can be tuned to a p-type ohmic contact by an external electric field.",3
Spectral and magnetic properties of Na2RuO3.,"We present measurements of resistivity, x-ray absorption (XAS) and emission (XES) spectroscopy together with ab initio band structure calculations for quasi two dimensional ruthenate Na2RuO3. Density function calculations (DFT) and XAS and XES spectra both show that Na2RuO3 is a semiconductor with an activation energy of approximately 80 meV. Our DFT calculations reveal large magneto-elastic coupling in Na2RuO3 and predict that the ground state of Na2RuO3 should be antiferromagnetic zig-zag.",3
Anisotropic lattice thermal conductivity in three-fold degeneracy topological semimetal MoP: a first-principles study.,"Recently, three-component new fermions in topological semimetal MoP are experimentally observed (2017 Nature 546 627), which may have potential applications like topological qubits, low-power electronics and spintronics. These are closely related to thermal transport properties of MoP. In this work, the phonon transport of MoP is investigated by solving the linearized phonon Boltzmann equation within the single-mode relaxation time approximation (RTA). The calculated room-temperature lattice thermal conductivity is 18.41 [Formula: see text] and 34.71 [Formula: see text] along the in- and cross-plane directions, exhibiting very strong anisotropy. The isotope and size effects on the lattice thermal conductivity are also considered. It is found that isotope scattering produces little effect, and phonon has little contribution to the lattice thermal conductivity, when phonon mean free path (MFP) is larger than 0.15 [Formula: see text] at 300 K. It is noted that average room-temperature lattice thermal conductivity of MoP is lower than that of representative Weyl semimetal TaAs, which is due to smaller group velocities and larger Gruneisen parameters. Our works provide valuable informations for the thermal management of MoP-based nano-electronics devices, and motivate further experimental works to study thermal transport of MoP.",3
Effects of the Hubbard U on density functional-based predictions of BiFeO3 properties.,"First principles studies of multiferroic materials, such as bismuth ferrite (BFO), require methods that extend beyond standard density functional theory (DFT). The DFT + U method is one such extension that is widely used in the study of BFO. We present a systematic study of the effects of the U parameter on the structural, ferroelectric and electronic properties of BFO. We find that the structural and ferroelectric properties change negligibly in the range of U typically considered for BFO (3-5 eV). In contrast, the electronic structure varies significantly with U. In particular, we see large changes to the character and curvature of the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum, in addition to the expected increase in band gap, as U increases. Most significantly, we find that the [Formula: see text]/[Formula: see text] ordering at the conduction band minimum inverts for U values larger than 4 eV. We therefore recommend a U value of at most 4 eV to be applied to the Fe d orbitals in BFO. More generally, this study emphasises the need for systematic investigations of the effects of the U parameter not merely on band gaps but on the electronic structure as a whole, especially for strongly correlated materials.",3
RKKY interaction of magnetic impurities in multi-Weyl semimetals.,"We have systematically investigated the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction between two magnetic impurities in Weyl semimetals with arbitrary monopole charge Q. We find that the RKKY interaction becomes intrinsically anisotropic for [Formula: see text], and its dependence on Fermi energy and impurity separation is directly controlled by the monopole charge. With the increase of Q, the RKKY interaction becomes more long-ranged and more anisotropic, which makes interesting magnetic orders easier to form and thus may have important applications in spintronics.",3
Extracting the interfacial free energy and anisotropy from a smooth fluctuating dividing surface.,"Interfaces between different materials and phases play a crucial role in many physical and chemical phenomena. When performing simulations of matter at the atomic scale, however, it is often not trivial to characterize these interfaces, particularly when they are rough or diffuse. Here we discuss a generalization of a construction, due to Willard and Chandler, that allows one to obtain a smooth dividing surface that follows the irregular, ever changing shape of these fluctuating interfaces. We show how this construction can be used to study the surface that separates a solid material from its melt and how analyses of the Fourier modes for the capillary fluctuations of this instantaneous dividing surface can be performed. This particular analysis is useful as one can compute the specific free energy excess of the interface, and its dependence on orientation relative to the bulk phases, from the average amplitude of the Fourier modes. We therefore discuss the efficiency of this approach, both in terms of system size and statistical sampling.",3
Quantum many-body simulation using monolayer exciton-polaritons in coupled-cavities.,"Quantum simulation is a promising approach to understanding complex strongly correlated many-body systems using relatively simple and tractable systems. Photon-based quantum simulators have great advantages due to the possibility of direct measurements of multi-particle correlations and ease of simulating non-equilibrium physics. However, interparticle interaction in existing photonic systems is often too weak, limiting the potential for quantum simulation. Here we propose an approach to enhance the interparticle interaction using exciton-polaritons in MoS2 monolayer quantum dots embedded in 2D photonic crystal microcavities. Realistic calculation yields optimal repulsive interaction in the range of 1-10 meV-more than an order of magnitude greater than the state-of-the-art value. Such strong repulsive interaction is found to emerge neither in the photon-blockade regime for small quantum dot nor in the polariton-blockade regime for large quantum dot, but in the crossover between the two regimes with a moderate quantum-dot radius around 20 nm. The optimal repulsive interaction is found to be largest in MoS2 among commonly used optoelectronic materials. Quantum simulation of strongly correlated many-body systems in a finite chain of coupled cavities and its experimental signature are studied via the exact diagonalization of the many-body Hamiltonian. A method to simulate 1D superlattices for interacting exciton-polariton gases in serially coupled cavities is also proposed. Realistic considerations on experimental realizations reveal advantages of transition metal dichalcogenide monolayer quantum dots over conventional semiconductor quantum emitters.",3
Role of lattice inhomogeneities on the electronic properties of selenium deficient Bi2Se3.,"Inter-layer coupling is widely considered to play a crucial role in tuning electronic properties of 3D topological insulators. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of crystallographic defects on inter-layer coupling in the Se deficient Bi2Se3 (0 0 3) crystal using extended x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS) technique. EXAFS measurements at Se-K and Bi-L3 edges reveal distinct local geometry around these atomic sites. It has been observed that short inter-layer Bi-Se and Se-Se bonds emerge in the sample. This additional structural motif coexists with the conventional crystallographic arrangement. Within the quintuple layer Bi-Se bonds are preserved with slight compression in intra-planer Bi-Bi and Se-Se distance and overall reduction in c/a ratio. These findings suggest formation of deformed lattice region, localized and dispersed inhomogeneously within the sample. Such inhomogeneities have also resulted in interesting transport properties such as quantum Hall effect (QHE), large linear magnetoresistance and pi-Berry phase in Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations of bulk crystals. Detailed analyses of magnetotransport measurements suggest that tuning of inter-layer coupling by local lattice deformation is the key factor for unusual transport properties. Role of axial strain, and stacking faults generated due to defects and charged Se vacancies are discussed to understand the observed electronic properties.",3
Superconductivity at 7.4 K in few layer graphene by Li-intercalation.,"Superconductivity in graphene has been highly sought after for its promise in various device applications and for general scientific interest. Ironically, the simple electronic structure of graphene, which is responsible for novel quantum phenomena, hinders the emergence of superconductivity. Theory predicts that doping the surface of the graphene effectively alters the electronic structure, thus promoting propensity towards Cooper pair instability (Profeta et al (2012) Nat. Phys. 8 131-4; Nandkishore et al (2012) Nat. Phys. 8 158-63) [1, 2]. Here we report the emergence of superconductivity at 7.4 K in Li-intercalated few-layer-graphene (FLG). The absence of superconductivity in 3D Li-doped graphite underlines that superconductivity in Li-FLG arises from the novel electronic properties of the 2D graphene layer. These results are expected to guide future research on graphene-based superconductivity, both in theory and experiments. In addition, easy control of the Li-doping process holds promise for various device applications.",3
Photoactivity properties of ZnO doped with cerium ions: an EPR study.,"In the present study, we investigated the effect of cerium doping in zinc oxide matrix, used as photoactive material. Cerium ions into the matrix of ZnO can act like a 'trap' for the electrons, lowering the e (-)/h (+) recombination rate and so increasing the photocatalytic efficiency of the ZnO. We synthesised doped samples using a simple precipitation route. The amount of dopant used was, 1 and 10% molar. The samples have been studied via x-ray diffraction measurements for the structural characterisation; UV-visible diffuse reflectance was used for the optical analysis; Branauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) model for the measurement of the surface area. Finally, the samples have been analysed via electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy for the electronic characterisation and for testing their photoactivity. The spin trapping technique was also use to measure the amount of stable radical adducts formed via reaction of OH(*) radicals with molecules of the DMPO (5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide) spin probe.",3
Distinguishing advective and powered motion in self-propelled colloids.,"Self-powered motion in catalytic colloidal particles provides a compelling example of active matter, i.e. systems that engage in single-particle and collective behavior far from equilibrium. The long-time, long-distance behavior of such systems is of particular interest, since it connects their individual micro-scale behavior to macro-scale phenomena. In such analyses, it is important to distinguish motion due to subtle advective effects-which also has long time scales and length scales-from long-timescale phenomena that derive from intrinsically powered motion. Here, we develop a methodology to analyze the statistical properties of the translational and rotational motions of powered colloids to distinguish, for example, active chemotaxis from passive advection by bulk flow.",3
On the critical temperature discontinuity at the theoretical bcc-fcc phase transition in compressed selenium and tellurium superconductors.,"Recent hydrides-driven advent in the high-pressure phonon-mediated superconductivity motivates research on chemical elements which compound with hydrogen. It is desired that such elements should allow chemical pre-compression of hydrogen to assure the induction of the superconducting phase with the high transition temperature (T C). Herein, we present detailed theoretical insight into the properties of the superconducting state induced under pressure (p) in two of such component elements, namely selenium (Se) and tellurium (Te) at [Formula: see text] GPa and [Formula: see text] GPa, respectively. The assumed external pressure conditions allow us to conduct our analysis just above previously theoretically predicted bcc-fcc structural phase transition of Se and Te, and identify the possible associated discontinuity effect of the critical temperature. In particular, our numerical analysis is conducted within Migdal-Eliashberg formalism, due to the confirmed electron-phonon pairing mechanism and relatively high electron-phonon coupling constant in the materials of interest. We predict that T C values in Se and Te equal 8.13 K and 5.96 K, respectively, and mark the highest critical temperature values for these elements within the postulated fcc phase. Additionally, we supplement these results by the estimated maximum values of the superconducting energy band gap and the effective mass of electrons. We predict that all these parameters can be used as a guidelines for experimental observation of the critical temperature discontinuity and the corresponding bcc-fcc phase transition in Se and Te superconductors. Moreover, we show that the thermodynamics of superconducting phase in both elements may exhibit deviations from the conventional estimates of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory, and suggest existence of the strong-coupling and retardation effects. Finally, we note that our results can be also instructive for future screening of chemical elements for applications in superconducting hydrides.",3
Chemical states of surface oxygen during CO oxidation on Pt(110) surface revealed by ambient pressure XPS.,"The study of CO oxidation on Pt(110) surface is revisited using ambient pressure x-ray photoemission spectroscopy. When the surface temperature reaches the activation temperature for CO oxidation under elevated pressure condition, both the -phase of PtO2 oxide and chemisorbed oxygen are formed simultaneously on the surface. Due to exothermic nature of CO oxidation, the temperature of Pt surface increases as CO oxidation takes places. As the CO/O2 ratio increases, the production of CO2 increases continuously and the surface temperature also increases. Interestingly, during the mass transfer limiting regions, the amount of surface oxide changes little while the chemisorbed oxygen is being reduced. &#13.",3
Universal spectral signatures in pnictides and cuprates: the role of quasiparticle-pair coupling.,"Understanding the physical properties of a large variety of high-T c superconductors (SC), the cuprate family as well as the more recent iron-based superconductors, is still a major challenge. In particular, these materials exhibit the 'peak-dip-hump' structure in the quasiparticle density of states (DOS). The origin of this structure is explained within our pair-pair interaction (PPI) model: The non-superconducting state consists of incoherent pairs, a 'Cooper-pair glass' which, due to the PPI, undergoes a Bose-like condensation below T c to the coherent SC state. We derive the equations of motion for the quasiparticle operators showing that the DOS 'peak-dip-hump' is caused by the coupling between quasiparticles and excited pair states, or 'super-quasiparticles'. The renormalized SC gap function becomes energy-dependent and non retarded, reproducing accurately the experimental spectra of both pnictides and cuprates, despite the large difference in gap value.",3
Edge absorption and pure spin current in a 2D topological insulator in the Volkov-Pankratov model.,Light absorption due to transitions between the edge and two-dimensional (2D) states of a 2D topological insulator (TI) is considered in the Volkov-Pankratov model. It is shown that the transitions are allowed only for the in-plane electric field orthogonal to the TI edge. It is found that the absorption is accompanied by pure spin photocurrent along the TI edge. A possibility of spin current measurement using polarized luminescence from 2D TI quantum dots is discussed.,3
On the diffraction pattern of bundled rare-earth silicide nanowires on Si(0 0 1).,"Motivated by the complex diffraction pattern observed for bundled rare-earth silicide nanowires on the Si(0 0 1) surface, we investigate the influence of the width and the spacing distribution of the nanowires on the diffraction pattern. The diffraction pattern of the bundled rare-earth silicide nanowires is analyzed by the binary surface technique applying a kinematic approach to diffraction. Assuming a categorical distribution for the (individual) nanowire size and a Poisson distribution for the size of the spacing between adjacent nanowire-bundles, we are able to determine the parameters of these distributions and derive an expression for the distribution of the nanowire-bundle size. Additionally, the comparison of our simulations to the experimental diffraction pattern reveal that a (1 x 1)-periodicity on top of the nanowires has to be assumed for a good match.",3
Effect of Mo on the phase stability and elastic mechanical properties of Ti-Mo random alloys from ab initio calculations.,"Ti-Mo alloys are promising materials for shape memory alloys and biomedical materials. Whereas, the appearance of metastable omega phase can cause embrittlement and destroy the shape memory effect. In order to avoid the omega phase, the effect of Mo on the temperature dependent lattice parameters, phase stability and elastic mechanical properties of beta, alpha, and omega Ti1-x Mo x (x = 0-2.0) random alloys was systematically investigated by using the exact muffin-tin orbitals method in combination with the coherent potential approximation. The theoretical predictions for the lattice parameters are in good agreement with the available experiments. Results show that beta Ti0.96Mo0.04 can almost transform to omega phase without lattice deformation and volume change, which suggests that the athermal omega phase is easier to precipitate and grow near 4 at.% Mo content in the beta Ti1-x Mo x alloys. The critical content of Mo for the competed stabilization of beta phase at T = 300 K is ~11.2 at.%. Its valence electron concentration of 4.224 is viewed as a necessary criterion for the competed phase stability. The calculations of formation energy are used to explain successfully why the partitioning of Mo can be found in Ti0.91Mo0.09 alloy after annealing. Through the analysis of formation energy, both Mo addition and increasing temperature can stabilize the beta phase. The calculated Cauchy pressure, Pugh's ratio, Poisson ratio, and Young's modulus suggests that omega phase is intrinsically brittle and has large Young's modulus compared with beta and alpha phases.",3
Effect of molybdenum disulfide nanoribbon on quantum transport of graphene.,"Based on the density functional theory method in combination with the nonequilibrium green's function formalism, the quantum transport properties in graphene-[Formula: see text] vertical heterojunction were investigated in this work. The leads are boron doped graphene and seamlessly connect to the graphene nanoribbon in central scattering region. Although there is a weak graphene-[Formula: see text] interaction, molybdenum disulfide can smooth the electrostatic potential and enlarge the transport properties of the whole device. However, another competitive factor is that of the edge states of the [Formula: see text] nanoribbon. When the transport is along the zigzag direction of graphene, the armchair [Formula: see text] nanoribbon simply enlarges the transmission coefficient. Nevertheless, in the armchair transport system, there is an asymmetric electrostatic potential induced by the different atomic potentials of S and Mo atoms at both edges in the zigzag [Formula: see text] nanoribbon, whose potential can lead to obvious scattering from graphene to [Formula: see text] and suppress the transmission probability. Therefore, it also suppresses the influence of zigzag [Formula: see text] nanoribbon on the transmission coefficient. Our first principles simulations provide useful predictions for the application of graphene based emerging electronics, which may stimulate further experimental exploration.",3
Dielectric and diamagnetic susceptibilities near percolative superconductor-insulator transitions.,"Coarse-grained superconductor-insulator composites exhibit a superconductor-insulator transition governed by classical percolation, which should be describable by networks of inductors and capacitors. We study several classes of random inductor-capacitor networks on square lattices. We present a unifying framework for defining electric and magnetic response functions, and we extend the Frank-Lobb bond-propagation algorithm to compute these quantities by network reduction. We confirm that the superfluid stiffness scales approximately as [Formula: see text] as the superconducting bond fraction p approaches the percolation threshold p c . We find that the diamagnetic susceptibility scales as [Formula: see text] below percolation, and as [Formula: see text] above percolation. For models lacking self-capacitances, the electric susceptibility scales as [Formula: see text]. Including a self-capacitance on each node changes the critical behavior to approximately [Formula: see text].",3
Interface phenomena in magnetron sputtered Cu2O/ZnO heterostructures.,"The interface between ZnO and Cu2O has been predicted to be a good candidate for use in thin film solar cells. However, the high predicted conversion efficiency has yet to be fully realized experimentally. To explore the underlying causes of this we investigate the interface between ZnO and Cu2O in magnetron sputtered samples. Two different sample geometries were made: In the first set thin layers of ZnO were deposited on Cu2O (type A), while in the second set the order was reversed (type B). Using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), an intermediate CuO layer was identified regardless of the order in which the Cu2O and ZnO layers were deposited. The presence of a CuO layer was supported by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results. Changes in the electron hole screening conditions were observed in CuO near the interface with ZnO, manifested as changes in the relative peak-to-satellite ratio and the degree of asymmetric broadness in the Cu 2p peak. The suppression of the Cu 2p satellite characteristic of CuO may cause the CuO presence to be overlooked and cause errors in determinations of valence band offsets (VBOs). For the type A samples, we compare four different approaches to XPS-based determination of VBO and find that the most reliable results are obtained when the thin CuO layer and the altered screening conditions at the interface were taken into account. The VBOs were found to range between 2.5 eV and 2.8 eV. For the B type samples a reduction of the Cu 2p-LMM Auger parameter was found as compared to bulk Cu2O, indicative of quantum confinement in the Cu2O overlayer.",3
The uniform quantized electron gas revisited.,"In this article we continue and extend our recent work on the correlation energy of the quantized electron gas of uniform density at temperature [Formula: see text]. As before, we utilize the methods, properties, and results obtained by means of classical statistical mechanics. These were extended to quantized systems via the Feynman path integral formalism. The latter translates the quantum problem into a classical polymer problem in four dimensions. Again, the well known RPA (random phase approximation) is recovered as a basic result which we then modify and improve upon. Here we analyze the condition of thermodynamic self-consistency. Our numerical calculations exhibit a remarkable agreement with well known results of a standard parameterization of Monte Carlo correlation energies.",3

Statistics of twinning in strained ferroelastics.,"In this review, we show that the evolution of the microstructure and kinetics of ferroelastic crystals under external shear can be explored by computer simulations of 2D model materials. We find that the nucleation and propagation of twin boundaries in ferroelastics depend sensitively on temperature. In the plastic regime, the evolution of the ferroelastic microstructure under strain deformation maintains a stick-and-slip mechanism in all temperature regimes, whereas the dynamic behavior changes dramatically from power-law statistics at low temperature to a Kohlrausch law at intermediate temperature, and then to a Vogel-Fulcher law at high temperature. In the yield regime, the distribution of jerk energies follows power-law statistics in all temperature regimes for a large range of strain rates. The non-spanning avalanches in the yield regime follow a parabolic temporal profile. The changes of twin pattern and twin boundaries density represent an important step towards domain boundary engineering.",3
Prediction of huge magnetic anisotropies in 5d transition metallocenes.,"The stability, electronic structure and non-collinear magnetic properties of a series of 5d metallocenes, namely, two cyclopentadienyl (Cp) rings sandwiched with a single 5d transition metal atom, are investigated. Our first-principles calculations reveal that Cp rings not only provide a suitable ligand environment for metal atoms, but also result in tunable magnetism depending on the transition metal element. Among them, HfCp2 and WCp2 show a high preference for the magnetization axis perpendicular to the Cp plane, with large magnetic anisotropy energies (MAEs) around 10 meV. We further consider triple decker metallocenes (M2Cp3), and find a huge MAE of above 60 meV in Ta2Cp3. The orbital energy split and shifts induced by composition change in metallocenes is mainly responsible for the significant MAE enhancement. By choosing a suitable crystal field for transition metal atoms, we pave a feasible pathway for designing promising building blocks of future magnetic storage devices.",3
Magnetic correlations in the intermetallic antiferromagnet Nd3Co4Sn13.,"Specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, and neutron scattering have been used to investigate the nature of the spin system in the antiferromagnet Nd3Co4Sn13. At room temperature Nd3Co4Sn13 has a cubic, Pm-3n structure similar to Yb3Rh4Sn13. Antiferromagnetic interactions between, Nd(3+) ions dominate the magnetic character of this sample and at 2.4 K the Nd spins enter a long range order state with a magnetic propagation vector q = (0 0 0) with an ordered moment of 1.78(2) microB at 1.5 K. The magnetic Bragg intensity grows very slowly below 1 K, reaching ~2.4 microB at 350 mK. The average magnetic Nd(3+) configuration corresponds to the 3D irreducible representation Gamma7. This magnetic structure can be viewed as three sublattices of antiferromagnetic spin chains coupled with each other in the 120 degrees -configuration. A well-defined magnetic excitation was measured around the 1 1 1 zone centre and the resulting dispersion curve is appropriate for an antiferromagnet with a gap of 0.20(1) meV.",3
Spatial valley separation in strained graphene pn junction.,"Valleytronics in analogy to spintronics aims to use the electron valley degree of freedom to carry and manipulate information, and one of urgent tasks in this field is to generate valley-polarized electrons. In this work, we propose using the electron focusing effect in a strained graphene pn junction to separate valleys spatially through a beam of valley-unpolarized electrons, since the strain-induced pseudo-gauge potentials are opposite for K and [Formula: see text] valleys and severely affect the trajectories of K and [Formula: see text] electron propagation. We numerically simulate this valley-separated Veselago lens effect in a lattice model and demonstrate that pseudo-gauge potentials can efficiently control valley separation patterns.",3
Quantum mechanical force fields for condensed phase molecular simulations.,"Molecular simulations are powerful tools for providing atomic-level details into complex chemical and physical processes that occur in the condensed phase. For strongly interacting systems where quantum many-body effects are known to play an important role, density-functional methods are often used to provide the model with the potential energy used to drive dynamics. These methods, however, suffer from two major drawbacks. First, they are often too computationally intensive to practically apply to large systems over long time scales, limiting their scope of application. Second, there remain challenges for these models to obtain the necessary level of accuracy for weak non-bonded interactions to obtain quantitative accuracy for a wide range of condensed phase properties. Quantum mechanical force fields (QMFFs) provide a potential solution to both of these limitations. In this review, we address recent advances in the development of QMFFs for condensed phase simulations. In particular, we examine the development of QMFF models using both approximate and ab initio density-functional models, the treatment of short-ranged non-bonded and long-ranged electrostatic interactions, and stability issues in molecular dynamics calculations. Example calculations are provided for crystalline systems, liquid water, and ionic liquids. We conclude with a perspective for emerging challenges and future research directions.",3
Embedded-atom method potential for modeling hydrogen and hydrogen-defect interaction in tungsten.,"An embedded-atom method potential has been developed for modeling hydrogen in body-centered-cubic (bcc) tungsten by fitting to an extensive database of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Comprehensive evaluations of the new potential are conducted by comparing various hydrogen properties with DFT calculations and available experimental data, as well as all the other tungsten-hydrogen potentials. The new potential accurately reproduces the point defect properties of hydrogen, the interaction among hydrogen atoms, the interplay between hydrogen and a monovacancy, and the thermal diffusion of hydrogen in tungsten. The successful validation of the new potential confirms its good reliability and transferability, which enables large-scale atomistic simulations of tungsten-hydrogen system. The new potential is afterward employed to investigate the interplay between hydrogen and other defects, including [1 1 1] self-interstitial atoms (SIAs) and vacancy clusters in tungsten. It is found that both the [1 1 1] SIAs and the vacancy clusters exhibit considerable attraction for hydrogen. Hydrogen solution and diffusion in strained tungsten are also studied using the present potential, which demonstrates that tensile (compressive) stress facilitates (impedes) hydrogen solution, and isotropic tensile (compressive) stress impedes (facilitates) hydrogen diffusion while anisotropic tensile (compressive) stress facilitates (impedes) hydrogen diffusion.",3
Plasmon modes of bilayer molybdenum disulfide: a density functional study.,"We explore the collective electronic excitations of bilayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) using density functional theory together with random phase approximation. The many-body dielectric function and electron energy-loss spectra are calculated using an ab initio based model involving material-realistic physical properties. The electron energy-loss function of the bilayer MoS2 system is found to be sensitive to either electron or hole doping and this is due to the fact that the Kohn-Sham band dispersions are not symmetric for energies above and below the zero Fermi level. Three plasmon modes are predicted, a damped high-energy mode, one optical mode (in-phase mode) for which the plasmon dispersion exhibits [Formula: see text] in the long wavelength limit originating from low-energy electron scattering and finally a highly damped acoustic mode (out-of-phase mode).",3
Dynamics of microtubules: highlights of recent computational and experimental investigations.,"Microtubules are found in most eukaryotic cells, with homologs in eubacteria and archea, and they have functional roles in mitosis, cell motility, intracellular transport, and the maintenance of cell shape. Numerous efforts have been expended over the last two decades to characterize the interactions between microtubules and the wide variety of microtubule associated proteins that control their dynamic behavior in cells resulting in microtubules being assembled and disassembled where and when they are required by the cell. We present the main findings regarding microtubule polymerization and depolymerization and review recent work about the molecular motors that modulate microtubule dynamics by inducing either microtubule depolymerization or severing. We also discuss the main experimental and computational approaches used to quantify the thermodynamics and mechanics of microtubule filaments.",3
Assessing the performance of self-consistent hybrid functional for band gap calculation in oxide semiconductors.,"In this paper we assess the predictive power of the self-consistent hybrid functional scPBE0 in calculating the band gap of oxide semiconductors. The computational procedure is based on the self-consistent evaluation of the mixing parameter alpha by means of an iterative calculation of the static dielectric constant using the perturbation expansion after discretization method and making use of the relation [Formula: see text]. Our materials dataset is formed by 30 compounds covering a wide range of band gaps and dielectric properties, and includes materials with a wide spectrum of applications such as thermoelectrics, photocatalysis, photovoltaics, transparent conducting oxides, and refractory materials. Our results show that the scPBE0 functional provides better band gaps than the non self-consistent hybrids PBE0 and HSE06, but scPBE0 does not show significant improvement on the description of the static dielectric constants. Overall, the scPBE0 data exhibit a mean absolute percentage error of 14% (band gaps) and 10% ([Formula: see text]). For materials with weak dielectric screening and large excitonic biding energies scPBE0, unlike PBE0 and HSE06, overestimates the band gaps, but the value of the gap becomes very close to the experimental value when excitonic effects are included (e.g. for SiO2). However, special caution must be given to the compounds with small band gaps due to the tendency of scPBE0 to overestimate the dielectric constant in the proximity of the metallic limit.",3
Hidden symmetries in N-layer dielectric stacks.,"The optical properties of a multilayer system with arbitrary N layers of dielectric media are investigated. Each layer is one of two dielectric media, with a thickness one-quarter the wavelength of light in that medium, corresponding to a central frequency f 0. Using the transfer matrix method, the transmittance T is calculated for all possible 2 (N) sequences for small N. Unexpectedly, it is found that instead of 2 (N) different values of T at f 0 (T 0), there are only [Formula: see text] discrete values of T 0, for even N, and (N + 1) for odd N. We explain this high degeneracy in T 0 values by finding symmetry operations on the sequences that do not change T 0. Analytical formulae were derived for the T 0 values and their degeneracies as functions of N and an integer parameter for each sequence we call 'charge'. Additionally, the bandwidth at f 0 and filter response of the transmission spectra are investigated, revealing asymptotic behavior at large N.",3
Multiple timescales in the photoswitching kinetics of crystalline thin films of azobenzene-trimers.,"Functional materials that exhibit photoinduced structural phase transitions are highly interesting for applications in optomechanics and mechanochemistry. It is, however, still not fully understood how photochemical reactions, which are often accompanied by molecular motion, proceed in confined and crystalline environments. Here we show that thin films of azobenzene trimers exhibit high structural order and determine the crystallographic unit cell. We demonstrate that thin film can be switched partially reversibly between a crystalline and an amorphous phase. The time constant of the photoinduced amorphisation as measured with real-time x-ray diffraction ([Formula: see text]220 s) lies between the two time constants (120 s and 2870 s) of the ensemble photoisomerisation processes that are measured via optical spectroscopy. Our observation of a photoinduced shrinking of the crystalline domains indicates a cascading process, in which photoisomerisation starts at the surface of the thin film and propagates deeper into the crystalline layer by introducing disorder and generating free volume. This finding is important for the rapidly evolving research field of photoresponsive thin films and smart crystalline materials in general.",3
Improved electronic structure and magnetic exchange interactions in transition metal oxides.,"We discuss the application of the Agapito Curtarolo and Buongiorno Nardelli (ACBN0) pseudo-hybrid Hubbard density functional to several transition metal oxides. For simple binary metal oxides, ACBN0 is found to be a fast, reasonably accurate and parameter-free alternative to traditional DFT + U and hybrid exact exchange methods. In ACBN0, the Hubbard energy of DFT + U is calculated via the direct evaluation of the local Coulomb and exchange integrals in which the screening of the bare Coulomb potential is accounted for by a renormalization of the density matrix. We demonstrate the success of the ACBN0 approach for the electronic properties of a series technologically relevant mono-oxides (MnO, CoO, NiO, FeO, both at equilibrium and under pressure). We also present results on two mixed valence compounds, Co3O4 and Mn3O4. Our results for these binary oxides and all the materials we have investigated, obtained at the computational cost of a standard LDA/PBE calculation, are in excellent agreement with hybrid functionals, the GW approximation and experimental measurements.",3
Effect of functionalization of boron nitride flakes by main group metal clusters on their optoelectronic properties.,"The possibility of functionalizing boron nitride flakes (BNFs) with some selected main group metal clusters, viz. OLi4, NLi5, CLi6, BLI7 and Al12Be, has been analyzed with the aid of density functional theory (DFT) based computations. Thermochemical as well as energetic considerations suggest that all the metal clusters interact with the BNF moiety in a favorable fashion. As a result of functionalization, the static (first) hyperpolarizability ([Formula: see text]) values of the metal cluster supported BNF moieties increase quite significantly as compared to that in the case of pristine BNF. Time dependent DFT analysis reveals that the metal clusters can lower the transition energies associated with the dominant electronic transitions quite significantly thereby enabling the metal cluster supported BNF moieties to exhibit significant non-linear optical activity. Moreover, the studied systems demonstrate broad band absorption capability spanning the UV-visible as well as infra-red domains. Energy decomposition analysis reveals that the electrostatic interactions principally stabilize the metal cluster supported BNF moieties.",3
Electronic and magnetic properties of multiferroic ScFeO<sub>3</sub> available from diffraction experiments.,"Abstract&#13; Electronic and magnetic properties of ferric ions (3d5) in multiferroic ScFeO3 are puzzling, in part because they are different from the only other multiferroic known to possess the same polar chemical structure, BiFeO3. Open questions about ScFeO3 can be addressed by confronting observations with results for G-type antiferromagnetism allowed by the lithium niobate (LiNbO3)-like parent R3c structure. Calculated structure factors for resonant x-ray diffraction include all charge-like quadrupoles allowed by symmetry, and if experimental results for ScFeO3 subsequently imply they are different from zero then ferric ions cannot be in the high-spin 6S state. The same type of experiment can reveal the moment direction in the G-type antiferromagnetism, according to our calculations, and thereby contribute to understanding magnetic anisotropy. Furthermore, structure factors for magnetic neutron diffraction by ScFeO3 include Dirac multipoles that are time-odd and parity-odd, e.g., dipoles that are often called anapoles or toroidal moments. Apart from Dirac multipoles, the conventional approach to the interpretation of neutron Bragg diffraction data will be inadequate if ferric ions (Fe3) are not in the high-spin 6S state, because the scattering amplitude includes more than simple dipole moments in the general case. &#13; .&#13.",3
Magneto-optical properties of topological insulator thin films with broken inversion symmetry.,"We determine the optical response of ultrathin film topological insulators in the presence of a quantizing external magnetic field taking into account both hybridization between surface states, broken inversion symmetry and explicit time reversal symmetry breaking by the magnetic field. We find that breaking of inversion symmetry in the system, which can be due to interaction with a substrate or electrical gating, results in Landau level crossings and opening of additional optical transition channels that were previously forbidden. We show that by tuning the hybridization and symmetry breaking parameters, a transition from the normal to a topological insulator phase occurs with measureable signatures in both static (dc) and dynamic (optical) conductivity. Moreover, we find that these signatures in the optical Hall conductivity remain robust against a significant range of disorder strength.",3
Optics of exciton-plasmon nanomaterials.,"This review provides a brief introduction to the physics of coupled exciton-plasmon systems, the theoretical description and experimental manifestation of such phenomena, followed by an account of the state-of-the-art methodology for the numerical simulations of such phenomena and supplemented by a number of FORTRAN codes, by which the interested reader can introduce himself/herself to the practice of such simulations. Applications to CW light scattering as well as transient response and relaxation are described. Particular attention is given to so-called strong coupling limit, where the hybrid exciton-plasmon nature of the system response is strongly expressed. While traditional descriptions of such phenomena usually rely on analysis of the electromagnetic response of inhomogeneous dielectric environments that individually support plasmon and exciton excitations, here we explore also the consequences of a more detailed description of the molecular environment in terms of its quantum density matrix (applied in a mean field approximation level). Such a description makes it possible to account for characteristics that cannot be described by the dielectric response model: the effects of dephasing on the molecular response on one hand, and nonlinear response on the other. It also highlights the still missing important ingredients in the numerical approach, in particular its limitation to a classical description of the radiation field and its reliance on a mean field description of the many-body molecular system. We end our review with an outlook to the near future, where these limitations will be addressed and new novel applications of the numerical approach will be pursued.",3
Temperature dependent magnetic Compton profiles and first-principles strategies of quaternary half-Heusler alloy Co1-x Cu x MnSb(0 x 0.8).,"Temperature dependent experimental Compton profiles of quaternary alloys Co1-x Cu x MnSb (x = 0.0, 0.2, 0.6 and 0.8) when decomposed into constituent profiles show that the sp-electron spin polarization is antiferromagnetically coupled to Mn-3d moments. The orbital magnetic moments derived from combination of magnetic Compton profiles (MCPs) and magnetization measurements are found to be small. Moreover, the first-principles full potential-linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) calculations have been performed to validate the experimental investigations of spin moments and half-Heusler properties. Present experimental and theoretical work show major role of Mn atoms in building-up the absolute spin moments. Our MCP data and spin-projected density of states derived from FP-LAPW computations show an increase in sp-d interaction in conduction region on increasing the Cu concentration. Further, Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida-type hybridization and antiferromagnetic superexchange interactions are witnessed in the reported alloys.",3
Presenting a new kinetic model for methanol to light olefins reactions over a hierarchical SAPO-34 catalyst using the Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson mechanism.,"In this study, a new kinetic model for methanol to light olefins (MTO) reactions over a hierarchical SAPO-34 catalyst using the Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson (LHHW) mechanism was presented and the kinetic parameters was obtained using a genetic algorithm (GA) and genetic programming (GP). Several kinetic models for the MTO reactions have been presented. However, due to the complexity of the reactions, most reactions are considered lumped and elementary, which cannot be deemed a completely accurate kinetic model of the process. Therefore, in this study, the LHHW mechanism is presented as kinetic models of MTO reactions. Because of the non-linearity of the kinetic models and existence of many local optimal points, evolutionary algorithms (GA and GP) are used in this study to estimate the kinetic parameters in the rate equations. Via the simultaneous connection of the code related to modelling the reactor and the GA and GP codes in the MATLAB R2013a software, optimization of the kinetic models parameters was performed such that the least difference between the results from the kinetic models and experiential results was obtained and the best kinetic parameters of MTO process reactions were achieved. A comparison of the results from the model with experiential results showed that the present model possesses good accuracy.",3
Driving force of the orbital-relevant electronic nematicity in Fe-based superconductors.,"The electronic nematic responses in Fe-based superconductors have been observed ubiquitously in various experimental probes. One novel nematic character is the d-wave bond orbital-relevant nematic charge order which was firstly proposed by symmetry analysis and then conformed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. In this paper, we present a mechanism that the driving force of the orbital-relevant nematic charge order is the reduction of the large Hubbard energy in the particle-hole charge channel by virtual hopping processes. This is one scenario from strong-coupling consideration. The same virtual hopping processes can lead to a super-exchange interaction for the spin magnetic order in the particle-hole spin channel and a pairing interaction for the superconducting order in the particle-particle channel. Thus the electronic nematic order, the spin magnetic order and the pairing superconducting order are intrinsically entangled and they can all stem from the same microscopic virtual hopping processes in reduction of the Hubbard energy. The electronic nematicity, the spin magnetism and the pairing superconductivity in unconventional superconductors are proposed to be unified within this mechanism.",3
"Dielectric environment and/or random disorder effects on free, charged and localized excitonic states in monolayer WS2.","Excitonic effects play an important role on the optoelectronic behavior of atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) crystals of the WS2 transition metal dichalcogenide. In this paper, neutral and charged exciton behaviors in monolayer WS2 are handled within effective-mass approximation for which the critical parameters are ensured from our ab initio calculations. Firstly, we reveal an exciton series with a novel energy dependence on the orbital angular momentum. Considerable control of the dielectric environment on neutral and charged excitons binding energies is elucidated. We demonstrate that for accepted values of effective masses, the negative and positive trion binding energies should be identical. Secondly, localization of neutral exciton center of mass motion by random potential arising from monolayer defects is also studied. The results obtained are in agreement with available experimental work.",3
Low-temperature resonant Raman asymmetry in 2H-MoS2 under high pressure.,"We report on the combined effect of temperature (6 K-300 K) and high pressure (up to 6 GPa) on the resonant Raman scattering by A1g phonons in bulk 2H-MoS2, as the energy of the A exciton is tuned into resonance with an exciting laser at EL = 1.96 eV. As expected, the pressure to be applied for attaining resonant conditions decreases with decreasing temperature. A striking result concerns the combined effect of temperature and pressure on the strength of the incoming relative to the outgoing resonance of the A1g phonon. When its Raman intensity is normalized by that of the 'non-resonant' [Formula: see text] phonon (IA1g/I[Formula: see text]), we find that the contribution of the pressure-tuned outgoing resonance relative to that of the incoming channel changes with temperature. At room temperature both contributions are about equal, as expected. Interestingly, with decreasing temperature an asymmetry in the relative magnitude of the resonances develops, becoming the outgoing contribution about half of the incoming resonance below ~50 K. We discuss the different possibilities for the origin of this effect.",3
Photovoltaic efficiency of intermediate band solar cells based on CdTe/CdMnTe coupled quantum dots.,"In this work we show the calculation of optimized efficiencies of intermediate band solar cells (IBSCs) based on Mn-doped II-VI CdTe/CdMnTe coupled quantum dot (QD) structures. We focus our attention on the combined effects of geometrical and Mn-doping parameters on optical properties and solar cell efficiency. In the framework of [Formula: see text] theory, we accomplish detailed calculations of electronic structure, transition energies, optical selection rules and their corresponding intra- and interband oscillator strengths. With these results and by following the intermediate band model, we have developed a strategy which allows us to find optimal photovoltaic efficiency values. We also show that the effects of band admixture which can lead to degradation of optical transitions and reduction of efficiency can be partly minimized by a careful selection of the structural parameters and Mn-concentration. Thus, the improvement of band engineering is mandatory for any practical implementation of QD systems as IBSC hardware. Finally, our calculations show that it is possible to reach significant efficiency, up to approximately 26%, by selecting a restricted space of parameters such as quantum dot size and shape and Mn-concentration effects, to improve the modulation of optical absorption in the structures.",3
Close proximity electrostatic effect from small clusters of emitters.,"Using a numerical simulation based on the finite-element technique, this work investigates the field emission properties from clusters of a few emitters at close proximity, by analyzing the properties of the maximum local field enhancement factor ([Formula: see text]) and the corresponding emission current. At short distances between the emitters, we show the existence of a nonintuitive behavior, which consists of the increasing of [Formula: see text] as the distance c between the emitters decreases. Here we investigate this phenomenon for clusters with 2, 3, 4 and 7 identical emitters and study the influence of the proximity effect in the emission current, considering the role of the aspect ratio of the individual emitters. Importantly, our results show that peripheral emitters with high aspect-ratios in large clusters can, in principle, significantly increase the emitted current as a consequence only of the close proximity electrostatic effect (CPEE). This phenomenon can be seen as a physical mechanism to produce self-oscillations of individual emitters. We discuss new insights for understanding the nature of self-oscillations in emitters based on the CPEE, including applications to nanometric oscillators.",3
Anisotropic upper critical magnetic fields in Rb2Cr3As3 superconductor.,"Rb2Cr3As3 is a structurally one-dimensional superconductor containing Cr3As3 chains with a superconducting transition temperature of [Formula: see text] K. Here we report the electrical resistance measurements for Rb2Cr3As3 single crystals, under magnetic fields up to 29.5 T and at temperatures down to 0.36 K, from which the upper critical fields, [Formula: see text], can be obtained in a broad temperature range. For field parallel to the Cr3As3 chains, [Formula: see text] is paramagnetically limited with an initial slope of [Formula: see text]d[Formula: see text]/d[Formula: see text] T [Formula: see text] and a zero-temperature upper critical field of [Formula: see text] T. For field perpendicular to the Cr3As3 chains, however, [Formula: see text] is only limited by orbital pair-breaking effect with [Formula: see text]d[Formula: see text]/d[Formula: see text] T [Formula: see text]. As a consequence, the anisotropy [Formula: see text] decreases sharply near T c and reverses below 2 K. Remarkably, the low-temperature [Formula: see text] down to 0.075 [Formula: see text] remains to increase linearly up to over three times the Pauli paramagnetic limit, which strongly suggests dominant spin-triplet superconductivity in Rb2Cr3As3.",3
Evidence of magneto-structural coupling affecting magnetic anisotropy in a cobalt nano-composite.,"By investigating temperature dependent structural and magnetic properties of cobalt (Co) embedded within nanoporous anodized alumina template, we observe changes in the easy axis of Co magnetization and an unusual increase in its saturation magnetization below a temperature T cr. Analysis of our M(H) data reveals that the magnetized volume of the sample increases rapidly as T falls below T cr. To understand these features we perform micro-magnetic simulations for a single Co-nanopillar wherein by varying its magneto-crystalline anisotropy energy we are able to show that the changes observed near T cr are related to the changes in the magnetic anisotropy of the nanopillar. We propose crystallographic structural distortions trigger changes in the balance between shape and magneto-crystalline anisotropy in our nanopillar. Our results suggest interplay between magnetism, structure and magnetic anisotropy in low dimensional Co-nanopillars, which can be modified with temperature of the system.",3
First-principles investigation on Au n @(ZnO)42 (n = 6-16) core-shell nanoparticles: structure stability and catalytic activity.,"A family of Au n @(ZnO)[Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]-16) cluster-assembled nanoparticles are studied by density-functional theory calculations. Different sizes, up to 100 atoms, are considered for several compositions. For each n, we design and construct a converged model for Au n @(ZnO)[Formula: see text] to analyze the coupling effect of adding Au atoms into ZnO outer shell. Among the optimized geometrical structures, we find that [Formula: see text]@(ZnO)[Formula: see text] has the most stable structure. The electronic properties, optical properties and catalytic activity of the [Formula: see text]@(ZnO)[Formula: see text] core-shell have been systematically investigated, which also shows consistency with the experimental results. It is found that forming a core-shell structure enhances the visible-light photocatalytic ability and [Formula: see text]@(ZnO)[Formula: see text] core-shell structure has a high catalytic efficiency for the reaction CO oxidation.",3
Modeling shear-induced particle ordering and deformation in a dense soft particle suspension.,"We apply the lattice Boltzmann method and the bead-spring network model of deformable particles (DPs) to study shear-induced particle ordering and deformation and the corresponding rheological behavior for dense DP suspensions confined in a narrow gap under steady external shear. The particle configuration is characterized with small-angle scattering intensity, the real-space 2D local order parameter, and the particle shape factors including deformation, stretching and tilt angles. We investigate how particle ordering and deformation vary with the particle volume fraction varphi (=0.45-0.65) and the external shear rate characterized with the capillary number Ca (=0.003-0.191). The degree of particle deformation increases mildly with varphi but significantly with Ca. Under moderate shear rate (Ca = 0.105), the inter-particle structure evolves from string-like ordering to layered hexagonal close packing (HCP) as varphi increases. A long wavelength particle slithering motion emerges for sufficiently large varphi. For varphi = 0.61, the structure maintains layered HCP for Ca = 0.031-0.143 but gradually becomes disordered for larger and smaller Ca. The correlation in particle zigzag movements depends sensitively on varphi and particle ordering. Layer-by-layer analysis reveals how the non-slippery hard walls affect particle ordering and deformation. The shear-induced reconfiguration of DPs observed in the simulation agrees qualitatively with experimental results of sheared uniform emulsions. The apparent suspension viscosity increases with varphi but exhibits much weaker dependence compared to hard-sphere suspensions, indicating that particle deformation and unjamming under shear can significantly reduce the viscous stress. Furthermore, the suspension shear-thins, corresponding to increased inter-DP ordering and particle deformation with Ca. This work provides useful insights into the microstructure-rheology relationship of concentrated deformable particle suspensions.",3

Chiral discrimination in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.,"Chirality is a fundamental property of molecules whose spatial symmetry is characterized by the absence of improper rotations, making them not superimposable to their mirror image. Chiral molecules constitute the elementary building blocks of living species and one enantiomer is favoured in general (e.g. L-aminoacids and D-sugars pervade terrestrial homochiral biochemistry) because most chemical reactions producing natural substances are enantioselective. Since the effect of chiral chemicals and drugs on living beings can be markedly different between enantiomers, the quest for practical spectroscopical methods to scrutinize chirality is an issue of great importance and interest. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a topmost analytical technique, but spectrometers currently used are 'blind' to chirality, i.e. unable to discriminate the two mirror-image forms of a chiral molecule, because, in the absence of a chiral solvent, the spectral parameters, chemical shifts and spin-spin coupling constants are identical for enantiomers. Therefore, the development of new procedures for routine chiral recognition would offer basic support to scientists. However, in the presence of magnetic fields, a distinction between true and false chirality is mandatory. The former epitomizes natural optical activity, which is rationalized by a time-even pseudoscalar, i.e. the trace of a second-rank tensor, the mixed electric dipole/magnetic dipole polarizability. The Faraday effect, magnetic circular dichroism and magnetic optical activity are instead related to a time-odd axial vector. The present review summarizes recent theoretical and experimental efforts to discriminate enantiomers via NMR spectroscopy, with the focus on the deep connection between chirality and symmetry properties under the combined set of fundamental discrete operations, namely charge conjugation, parity (space inversion) and time (motion) reversal.",3
Wave vector dependent damping of THz collective modes in a liquid metal.,Well-defined damped collective modes have been observed in liquid metals over a wide range of wave vectors. Hydrodynamics predicts that viscosity and thermal conductivity are the cause for the damping of the collective modes. Here we present experimental data from neutron spectroscopy on the damping of collective modes of liquid rubidium over a wide range of wave vectors. We propose a phenomenological model derived from generalized hydrodynamics to describe the damping of the modes and the evolution with increasing wave vector based on the viscoelastic picture of liquid response. As necessary ingredients a wave vector dependent high frequency shear modulus and shear relaxation time appear. We obtain a remarkable good agreement on a quantitative basis between experiment and calculation over a wide range of wave vectors. The emergent picture is that the lifetime of the collective modes in the THz regime is mainly limited through the diffusion of momentum. The proposed methodology might be applicable to a wide range of liquids.,3
Mechanisms of photoinduced magnetization in Pr0.6Ca0.4MnO3 studied above and below charge-ordering transition temperature.,"We report the effect of photonic field on the electronic and magnetic structure of a low bandwidth manganite [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text]MnO3 (PCMO) thin film. In particular, the present study confirmed a mechanism that was recently proposed to explain how optical excitation can bias or directly activate the metamagnetic transition associated with the colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) effect of PCMO. The transition is characterized by a shift in the dynamic equilibrium between ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic clusters, explaining how it can be suddenly triggered by a sufficient external magnetic field. The film was always found to support some population of FM-clusters, the proportional size of which could be adjusted by the magnetic field and, especially in the vicinity of a thermomagnetic irreversibility, by optical excitation. The double exchange mechanism couples the magnetic degrees of freedom of manganites to their electronic structure, which is further coupled to the ion lattice via the Jahn-Teller mechanism. In accordance, it was found that producing optical phonons into the lattice could lower the free energy of the FM phase enough to significantly bias the CMR effect.",3
Mottness at finite doping and charge-instabilities in cuprates.,"The influence of the Mott physics on the doping-temperature phase diagram of copper oxides represents a major issue that is subject of intense theoretical and experimental effort. Here, we investigate the ultrafast electron dynamics in prototypical single-layer Bi-based cuprates at the energy scale of the O-2p-->Cu-3d charge-transfer (CT) process. We demonstrate a clear evolution of the CT excitations from incoherent and localized, as in a Mott insulator, to coherent and delocalized, as in a conventional metal. This reorganization of the high-energy degrees of freedom occurs at the critical doping pcr approximately 0.16 irrespective of the temperature, and it can be well described by dynamical mean field theory calculations. We argue that the onset of the low-temperature charge instabilities is the low-energy manifestation of the underlying Mottness that characterizes the p < pcr region of the phase diagram. This discovery sets a new framework for theories of charge order and low-temperature phases in underdoped copper oxides.",3
High-frequency microrheology reveals cytoskeleton dynamics in living cells.,"Living cells are viscoelastic materials, with the elastic response dominating at long timescales ( greater, similar1 ms)1. At shorter timescales, the dynamics of individual cytoskeleton filaments are expected to emerge, but active microrheology measurements on cells accessing this regime are scarce2. Here, we develop high-frequency microrheology (HF-MR) to probe the viscoelastic response of living cells from 1Hz to 100 kHz. We report the viscoelasticity of different cell types and upon cytoskeletal drug treatments. At previously inaccessible short timescales, cells exhibit rich viscoelastic responses that depend on the state of the cytoskeleton. Benign and malignant cancer cells revealed remarkably different scaling laws at high frequency, providing a univocal mechanical fingerprint. Microrheology over a wide dynamic range up to the frequency of action of the molecular components provides a mechanistic understanding of cell mechanics.",3
Hot spot-mediated non-dissipative and ultrafast plasmon passage.,"Plasmonic nanoparticles hold great promise as photon handling elements and as channels for coherent transfer of energy and information in future all-optical computing devices.1-5 Coherent energy oscillations between two spatially separated plasmonic entities via a virtual middle state exemplify electron-based population transfer, but their realization requires precise nanoscale positioning of heterogeneous particles.6-10 Here, we show the assembly and optical analysis of a triple particle system consisting of two gold nanoparticles with an inter-spaced silver island. We observe strong plasmonic coupling between the spatially separated gold particles mediated by the connecting silver particle with almost no dissipation of energy. As the excitation energy of the silver island exceeds that of the gold particles, only quasi-occupation of the silver transfer channel is possible. We describe this effect both with exact classical electrodynamic modeling and qualitative quantum-mechanical calculations. We identify the formation of strong hot spots between all particles as the main mechanism for the loss-less coupling and thus coherent ultra-fast energy transfer between the remote partners. Our findings could prove useful for quantum gate operations, but also for classical charge and information transfer processes.",3
Commensurability oscillations in a periodically modulated phosphorene.,"The recent experimental realization of high-quality phosphorene leads to novel electronic and optical properties with possible new device applications due to its huge direct band gap. We study the commensurability or Weiss oscillations in monolayer phosphorene in the presence of a weak perpendicular magnetic field B and a weak and periodic, electric or magnetic one-dimensional modulation. Either modulation broadens the Landau levels into bands, whose width oscillates with B, and the oscillations appear in the electrical conductivity perpendicular to the modulation taken along the direction (x) of the smaller effective mass. Compared with the oscillations of the diffusive conductivity in a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) for typical electron densities [Formula: see text], the ones in phosphorene, with typical [Formula: see text], have approximately similar height but a period significantly smaller when plotted versus [Formula: see text] while plotted versus B they occur at significantly higher fields. The Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations exhibit a similar behaviour. When the modulation is taken along the direction (y) of the larger effective mass, the oscillation period is close to that of a 2DEG. For equal modulation strengths the bandwidth due to a magnetic modulation is one order of magnitude larger than that due to an electric one and the amplitude of the oscillations in the diffusive conductivity about 50 times larger. Numerical results are presented for experimentally relevant parameters.",3
Is perpendicular magnetic anisotropy essential to all-optical ultrafast spin reversal in ferromagnets?,"All-optical spin reversal presents a new opportunity for spin manipulations, free of a magnetic field. Most of all-optical-spin-reversal ferromagnets are found to have a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), but it has been unknown whether PMA is necessary for spin reversal. Here we theoretically investigate magnetic thin films with either PMA or in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA). Our results show that spin reversal in IMA systems is possible, but only with a longer laser pulse and within a narrow laser parameter region. Spin reversal does not show a strong helicity dependence where the left- and right-circularly polarized light lead to the identical results. By contrast, the spin reversal in PMA systems is robust, provided both the spin angular momentum and laser field are strong enough while the magnetic anisotropy itself is not too strong. This explains why experimentally the majority of all-optical spin-reversal samples are found to have strong PMA and why spins in Fe nanoparticles only cant out of plane. It is the laser-induced spin-orbit torque that plays a key role in the spin reversal. Surprisingly, the same spin-orbit torque results in laser-induced spin rectification in spin-mixed configuration, a prediction that can be tested experimentally. Our results clearly point out that PMA is essential to spin reversal, though there is an opportunity for in-plane spin reversal.",3
Effects of Cu doping on the electronic structure and magnetic properties of MnCo2O4 nanostructures.,"Reported here are the results and their analysis from our detailed investigations of the effects of Cu doping ([Formula: see text]) on the electronic structure and magnetic properties of the spinel [Formula: see text]O4. A detailed comparison is given for the [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] cases for both the bulk-like samples and nanoparticles. The electronic structure determined from x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Rietveld analysis of x-ray diffraction patterns shows the structure to be: ([Formula: see text])A [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text]]B [Formula: see text] i.e. [Formula: see text] substitutes for [Formula: see text] on the octahedral B-sites. For the bulk samples, the ferrimagnetic [Formula: see text] K for [Formula: see text] is lowered to [Formula: see text] K for the [Formula: see text] sample, this decrease being due to the effect of Cu doping. For the nanosize [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]) sample, the lower [Formula: see text] K ([Formula: see text] K) is observed using [Formula: see text] analysis, this lowering being due to finite size effects. For [Formula: see text], fits of dc paramagnetic susceptibility data of [Formula: see text] versus T in nanosize samples to the Neel expression are used to determine the exchange interactions between the A and B sites with exchange constants: [Formula: see text] K (4.1 K), [Formula: see text] K (16.3 K) and [Formula: see text] K (13.8 K) for [Formula: see text]. The temperature dependence of ac susceptibilities [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] at different frequencies shows that in bulk samples of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], the transition at T C is the normal second order transition. But for the nanosize [Formula: see text] and 0.2 samples, analysis of the ac susceptibilities shows that the ferrimagnetic transition at T C is followed by a re-entrant spin-glass transition at lower temperatures [Formula: see text] K (138 K) for [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]). Analysis of the ac susceptibilities, [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], versus T data is done in terms of two scaling laws: (i) Vogel-Fulcher law [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text]; and (ii) power law of critical slowing-down [Formula: see text]. These fits confirm the existence of glassy behavior below T SG with the parameters [Formula: see text] (8.91), [Formula: see text] (9.6 x 10[Formula: see text]) and [Formula: see text] K ( approximately 138 K) for the samples [Formula: see text] (0.2), with similar results obtained for other samples. The linear behavior of the peak maximum in [Formula: see text] versus [Formula: see text] (AT-line) further supports the existence of glassy states in nanosize samples. For [Formula: see text], the temperature and composition dependence of the hysteresis loop parameters are investigated; all the samples with x 0.1 have the coercivity H C and remanence [Formula: see text]. Since the results reported here in these nanostructures are significantly different from those in bulk [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text], further investigations of their magnetic structures using neutron diffraction are warranted.",3
Better band gaps for wide-gap semiconductors from a locally corrected exchange-correlation potential that nearly eliminates self-interaction errors.,"This work constitutes a comprehensive and improved account of electronic-structure and mechanical properties of silicon-nitride ([Formula: see text] [Formula: see text]) polymorphs via van Leeuwen and Baerends (LB) exchange-corrected local density approximation (LDA) that enforces the exact exchange potential asymptotic behavior. The calculated lattice constant, bulk modulus, and electronic band structure of [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] polymorphs are in good agreement with experimental results. We also show that, for a single electron in a hydrogen atom, spherical well, or harmonic oscillator, the LB-corrected LDA reduces the (self-interaction) error to exact total energy to approximately 10%, a factor of three to four lower than standard LDA, due to a dramatically improved representation of the exchange-potential.",3
Charge transfer in time-dependent density functional theory.,"Charge transfer plays a crucial role in many processes of interest in physics, chemistry, and bio-chemistry. In many applications the size of the systems involved calls for time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) to be used in their computational modeling, due to its unprecedented balance between accuracy and efficiency. However, although exact in principle, in practise approximations must be made for the exchange-correlation functional in this theory, and the standard functional approximations perform poorly for excitations which have a long-range charge-transfer component. Intense progress has been made in developing more sophisticated functionals for this problem, which we review. We point out an essential difference between the properties of the exchange-correlation kernel needed for an accurate description of charge-transfer between open-shell fragments and between closed-shell fragments. We then turn to charge-transfer dynamics, which, in contrast to the excitation problem, is a highly non-equilibrium, non-perturbative, process involving a transfer of one full electron in space. This turns out to be a much more challenging problem for TDDFT functionals. We describe dynamical step and peak features in the exact functional evolving over time, that are missing in the functionals currently used. The latter underestimate the amount of charge transferred and manifest a spurious shift in the charge transfer resonance position. We discuss some explicit examples.",3
Perpendicularly magnetized Co20Fe60B20 layer sandwiched between Au with low Gilbert damping.,"Nowadays, the CoFeB thin layered film is intensively studied because of its potential applications in spintronic devices, especially devices based on spin-transfer torque phenomena. Hitherto, it has been shown that CoFeB may possess perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) when it is sandwiched between different layers (e.g. MgO, Pt, Pd, Ta, W). However, there is no experimental evidence that CoFeB, sandwiched between Au layers, has strong PMA. Moreover, in comparison with other noble metals, Au-based film systems exhibit the smallest spin pumping effect, which provides the main contribution to the damping in thin films in contact with heavy metals. Therefore, Au/CoFeB/Au may be a good candidate for future applications, where perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and low damping are required. Here, we show that PMA and low damping can be achieved in a Au/CoFeB/Au system without annealing.",3
MoS2-supported gold nanoparticle for CO hydrogenation.,"Employing dispersion-corrected density functional theory, we examine the geometry, electronic structure, and reactivity of 13-atom Au nanoparticle supported on defect-laden single-layer MoS2. The planar structure of Au13 favored in isolated phase, transforms into the three-dimensional structure when supported on MoS2. We find that charge is transferred from MoS2 to Au13, and that the electron density is also distributed away from the Au13/MoS2 interfacial region-making Au sites away from the interface catalytically active. Owing to effect of the support, the Au d states become narrower, and the frontier states appear close to the Fermi level. Consequently, in contrast to the reactivity of Au13/TiO2 toward methanol decomposition, Au13/MoS2 offers excellent activity toward methanol synthesis, as demonstrated here, via CO hydrogenation.",3
Skew scattering dominated anomalous Hall effect in Co x (MgO)100-x granular thin films.,"We investigated the mechanism(s) of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in magnetic granular materials by fabricating 100 nm-thick thin films of Co x (MgO)100-x with a Co volume fraction of 34 x 100 using co-sputtering at room temperature. We measured the temperature dependence of longitudinal resistivity ([Formula: see text]) and anomalous Hall resistivity ([Formula: see text]) from 5 K to 300 K in all samples. We found that when x decreases from 100 to 34, the values of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] respectively increased by about four and three orders in magnitude. By linearly fitting the data, obtained at 5 K, of anomalous Hall coefficient ([Formula: see text]) and of [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text], we found that our results perfectly fell on a straight line with a slope of [Formula: see text] 0.97 +/- 0.02. This fitting value of [Formula: see text] in [Formula: see text] clearly suggests that skew scattering dominated the AHE in this granular system. To explore the effect of the scattering on the AHE, we performed the same measurements on annealed samples. We found that although both [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] significantly reduced after annealing, the correlation between them was almost the same, which was confirmed by the fitted value, [Formula: see text] = 0.99 +/- 0.03. These data strongly suggest that the AHE originates from the skew scattering in Co-MgO granular thin films no matter how strong the scattering of electrons by the interfaces and defects is. This observation may be of importance to the development of spintronic devices based on MgO.",3
"Manifestation of hopping conductivity and granularity within phase diagrams of LaO1-x F x BiS2, Sr1-x La x FBiS2 and related BiS2-based compounds.","Layered BiS [Formula: see text] -based series, such as LaO [Formula: see text] F [Formula: see text] BiS [Formula: see text] and Sr [Formula: see text] La [Formula: see text] FBiS [Formula: see text] , offer ideal examples for studying normal and superconducting phase diagram of a solid solution that evolves from a nonmagnetic band-insulator parent. We constructed typical [Formula: see text] phase diagrams of these systems based on events occurring in thermal evolution of their electrical resistivity, [Formula: see text]. Overall evolution of these diagrams can be rationalized in terms of (i) Mott-Efros-Shklovskii scenario which, within the semiconducting [Formula: see text] regime ([Formula: see text] metal-insulator transition), describes the doping influence on the thermally activated hopping conductivity. (ii) A granular metal (superconductor) scenario which, within [Formula: see text], describes the evolution of normal and superconducting properties in terms of conductance g, Coulomb charging energy E c and Josephson coupling J; their joint influence is usually captured within a [Formula: see text] phase diagram. Based on analysis of the granular character of [Formula: see text], we converted the [Formula: see text] diagrams into projected g - T diagrams which, being fundamental, allow a better understanding of evolution of various granular-related properties (in particular the hallmarks of normal-state [Formula: see text] feature and superconductor-insulator transition) and how such properties are influenced by x, pressure or heat treatment.",3
Two-terminal transport measurements with cold atoms.,"In recent years, the ability of cold atom experiments to explore condensed-matter-related questions has dramatically progressed. Transport experiments, in particular, have expanded to the point in which conductance and other transport coefficients can now be measured in a way that is directly analogous to solid-state physics, extending cold-atom-based quantum simulations into the domain of quantum electronic devices. In this topical review, we describe the transport experiments performed with cold gases in the two-terminal configuration, with an emphasis on the specific features of cold atomic gases compared to solid-state physics. We present the experimental techniques and the main experimental findings, focusing on-but not restricted to-the recent experiments performed by our group. We finally discuss the perspectives opened up by this approach, the main technical and conceptual challenges for future developments, and potential applications in quantum simulation for transport phenomena and mesoscopic physics problems.",3
High resolution SPM imaging of organic molecules with functionalized tips.,"One of the most remarkable and exciting achievements in the field of scanning probe microscopy (SPM) in the last years is the unprecedented sub-molecular resolution of both atomic and electronic structures of single molecules deposited on solid state surfaces. Despite its youth, the technique has already brought many new possibilities to perform different kinds of measurements, which cannot be accomplished by other techniques. This opens new perspectives in advanced characterization of physical and chemical processes and properties of molecular structures on surfaces. Here, we discuss the history and recent progress of the high resolution imaging with a functionalized probe by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS). We describe the mechanisms responsible for the high-resolution AFM, STM and IETS-STM contrast. The complexity of this technique requires new theoretical approaches, where a relaxation of the functionalized probe is considered. We emphasise the similarities of the mechanism driving high-resolution SPM with other imaging methods. We also summarise briefly significant achievements and progress in different branches. Finally we provide brief perspectives and remaining challenges of the further refinement of these high-resolution methods.",3
Optical response in Weyl semimetal in model with gapped Dirac phase.,"We study the optical properties of Weyl semimetal (WSM) in a model which features, in addition to the usual term describing isolated Dirac cones proportional to the Fermi velocity v F, a gap term m and a Zeeman spin-splitting term b with broken time reversal symmetry. Transport is treated within Kubo formalism and particular attention is payed to the modifications that result from a finite m and b. We consider how these modifications change when a finite residual scattering rate [Formula: see text] is included. For [Formula: see text] the A.C. conductivity as a function of photon energy [Formula: see text] continues to display the two quasilinear energy regions of the clean limit for [Formula: see text] below the onset of the second electronic band which is gapped at ([Formula: see text]). For [Formula: see text] of the order m little trace of two distinct linear energy scales remain and the optical response has evolved towards that for [Formula: see text]. Although some quantitative differences remain there are no qualitative differences. The magnitude of the D.C. conductivity [Formula: see text] at zero temperature ([Formula: see text]) and chemical potential ([Formula: see text]) is altered. While it remains proportional to [Formula: see text] it becomes inversely dependent on an effective Fermi velocity out of the Weyl nodes equal to [Formula: see text] which decreases strongly as the phase boundary between Weyl semimetal and gapped Dirac phase (GDSM) is approached at [Formula: see text]. The leading term in the approach to [Formula: see text] for finite [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] is found to be quadratic. The coefficient of these corrections tracks closely the [Formula: see text] dependence of the [Formula: see text] limit with differences largest near to the WSM-GDSM boundary.",3
Probing dimensionality using a simplified 4-probe method.,"4-probe electrical measurements have been in existence for many decades. One of the most useful aspects of the 4-probe method is that it is not only possible to find the resistivity of a sample (independently of the contact resistances), but that it is also possible to probe the dimensionality of the sample. In theory, this is straightforward to achieve by measuring the 4-probe resistance as a function of probe separation. In practice, it is challenging to move all four probes with sufficient precision over the necessary range. Here, we present an alternative approach. We demonstrate that the dimensionality of the conductive path within a sample can be directly probed using a modified 4-probe method in which an unconventional geometry is exploited; three of the probes are rigidly fixed, and the position of only one probe is changed. This allows 2D and 3D (and other) contributions the to resistivity to be readily disentangled. The required experimental instrumentation can be vastly simplified relative to traditional variable spacing 4-probe instruments.",3
Investigation of the superconducting gap structure in kappa-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu(NCS)2 and kappa-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu[N(CN)2]Br by means of thermal-conductivity measurements.,"We report temperature-dependent thermal-conductivity, kappa, measurements on the layered quasi-two-dimensional organic superconductors kappa-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu(NCS)2 and kappa-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu[N(CN)2]Br down to 160 mK. The results for kappa-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu(NCS)2 may be consistent with a nodal superconducting (SC) gap structure as indicated by a non-negligible remnant linear contribution when [Formula: see text] is extrapolated to [Formula: see text]. For kappa-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu[N(CN)2]Br, contrary to expectations, higher kappa values are observed in the superconducting regime as compared to the normal, high-field state evidencing a dominant phonon contribution to kappa in the superconducting state. The strong increase of kappa in the normal state below T c for both samples indicates strong electron-phonon scattering. Our results highlight the need for thermal-conductivity measurements performed down to significantly lower temperatures to determine the symmetry of the SC gap.",3
Non-classical behaviour of higher valence dopants in chromium (III) oxide by a Cr vacancy compensation mechanism.,"Modification of metal oxides with dopants that have a stable oxidation in their parent oxides which is higher than the host system is expected to introduce extra electrons into the material to improve carrier mobility. This is essential for applications in catalysis, SOFCs and solar energy materials. Density functional theory calculations are used to investigate the change in electronic and geometric structure of chromium (III) oxide by higher valence dopants, namely; Ce, Ti, V and Zr. For single metal doping, we find that the dopants with variable oxidation states, Ce, Ti and V, adopt a valence state of +3, while Zr dopant has a +4 oxidation state and reduces a neighbouring Cr cation. Chromium vacancy formation is greatly enhanced for all dopants, and favoured over oxygen vacancy formation. The Cr vacancies generate holes which oxidise Ce, Ti and V from +3 to +4, while also oxidising lattice oxygen sites. For Zr doping, the generated holes oxidise the reduced Cr(2+) cation back to Cr(3+) and also two lattice oxygen atoms. Three metal atoms in the bulk lattice facilitate spontaneous Cr vacancy from charge compensation. A non-classical compensation mechanism is observed for Ce, Ti and V; all three metals are oxidised from +3 to +4, which explains experimental observations that these metals have a +4 oxidation state in Cr2O3. Charge compensation of the three Zr metals proceeds by a classical higher valence doping mechanism; the three dopants reduce three Cr cations, which are subsequently charge compensated by a Cr vacancy oxidising three Cr(2+) to Cr(3+). The compensated structures are the correct ground state electronic structure for these doped systems, and used as a platform to investigate cation/anion vacancy formation. Unlike the single metal doped bulks, preference is now given for oxygen vacancy formation over Cr vacancy formation, indicating that the dopants increase the reducibility of Cr2O3 with Ce doping showing the strongest enhancement. The importance of the correct ground state in determining the formation of defects is emphasised.",3
Engineering magnetism at functional oxides interfaces: manganites and beyond.,"The family of transition metal oxides (TMOs) is a large class of magnetic materials that has been intensively studied due to the rich physics involved as well as the promising potential applications in next generation electronic devices. In TMOs, the spin, charge, orbital and lattice are strongly coupled, and significant advances have been achieved to engineer the magnetism by different routes that manipulate these degrees of freedom. The family of manganites is a model system of strongly correlated magnetic TMOs. In this review, using manganites thin films and the heterostructures in conjunction with other TMOs as model systems, we review the recent progress of engineering magnetism in TMOs. We first discuss the role of the lattice that includes the epitaxial strain and the interface structural coupling. Then we look into the role of charge, focusing on the interface charge modulation. Having demonstrated the static effects, we continue to review the research on dynamical control of magnetism by electric field. Next, we review recent advances in heterostructures comprised of high T c cuprate superconductors and manganites. Following that, we discuss the emergent magnetic phenomena at interfaces between 3d TMOs and 5d TMOs with strong spin-orbit coupling. Finally, we provide our outlook for prospective future directions.",3
Advanced carbon nanotubes functionalization.,"Similar to graphene, carbon nanotubes are materials made of pure carbon in its sp(2) form. Their extended conjugated pi-network provides them with remarkable quantum optoelectronic properties. Frustratingly, it also brings drawbacks. The pi-pi stacking interaction makes as-produced tubes bundle together, blurring all their quantum properties. Functionalization aims at modifying and protecting the tubes while hindering pi-pi stacking. Several functionalization strategies have been developed to circumvent this limitation in order for nanotubes applications to thrive. In this review, we summarize the different approaches established so far, emphasizing the balance between functionalization efficacy and the preservation of the tubes' properties. Much attention will be given to a functionalization strategy overcoming the covalent-noncovalent dichotomy and to the implementation of two advanced functionalization schemes: (a) conjugation with molecular switches, to yield hybrid nanosystems with chemo-physical properties that can be tuned in a controlled and reversible way, and; (b) plasmonic nanosystems, whose ability to concentrate and enhance the electromagnetic fields can be taken advantage of to enhance the optical response of the tubes.",3
Demagnetization harmonic effects on the magnetization of granular systems on a macroscopic scale: the superconducting case.,"A model has been developed to determine the effective ac magnetic response of magnetic systems, taking into account the demagnetization effects arising from the sample geometry which determine the out-of-phase components of the applied fundamental frequency and higher harmonic components. Indeed, demagnetization fields and their intermodulation can significantly affect the ac magnetic response. This approach provides a system of self-consistent linear equations relating the magnetic response to the external magnetic field by means of nonlinear magnetic susceptibility. The model is extended to the magnetic response of granular systems in terms of the contributions of the individual grains and of the whole sample in the presence of demagnetization effects of the whole sample and of the grains on a macroscopic scale. In particular, our model is applied to a granular superconducting system. The comparison between the performed numerical simulations and the experimental data shows that the demagnetization fields of the single grains and of the whole sample, and their intermodulation, are relevant if magnetic measurements are used to extract detailed information about the analyzed material.",3
Suppressed Kondo effect and Kosterlitz-Thouless-type phase transition induced by level difference in a triple dot device.,"Quantum dot system provides an ideal platform for quantum information processing, within which to demonstrate the quantum states is one of the most important issue for quantum simulation and quantum computation. In this paper, we report a peculiar electron state in a parallel triple dot device where the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction is invalid when the level differences of the dots sweep into appropriate regime. This extraordinary tendency then results in an antiferromagnetic spin coupling between two of the dots and may lead to zero or full conductance, relying deeply on the relation of the two level spacings. e.g. when the level differences are kept equal, the Kondo effect is totally suppressed although the dots are triply occupied, since in this case a local inter-dot transport loop is found to play an important role in the transmission coefficient. By contrast, when the differences are retained symmetric, the Kondo peak reaches nearly to its unitary limit, owing to that the inter-dot transport process is significantly suppressed. To approach these problems, voltage controllable quantum phase transitions of Kosterlitz-Thouless type and first order are shown, and possible pictures related to the many-body effect and the effective Kondo model are given.",3
"Spanning the scales of mechanical metamaterials using time domain simulations in transformed crystals, graphene flakes and structured soils.","We begin with a brief historical survey of discoveries of quasi-crystals and graphene, and then introduce the concept of transformation crystallography, which consists of the application of geometric transforms to periodic structures. We consider motifs with three-fold, four-fold and six-fold symmetries according to the crystallographic restriction theorem. Furthermore, we define motifs with five-fold symmetry such as quasi-crystals generated by a cut-and-projection method from periodic structures in higher-dimensional space. We analyze elastic wave propagation in the transformed crystals and (Penrose-type) quasi-crystals with the finite difference time domain freeware SimSonic. We consider geometric transforms underpinning the design of seismic cloaks with square, circular, elliptical and peanut shapes in the context of honeycomb crystals that can be viewed as scaled-up versions of graphene. Interestingly, the use of morphing techniques leads to the design of cloaks with interpolated geometries reminiscent of Victor Vasarely's artwork. Employing the case of transformed graphene-like (honeycomb) structures allows one to draw useful analogies between large-scale seismic metamaterials such as soils structured with columns of concrete or grout with soil and nanoscale biochemical metamaterials. We further identify similarities in designs of cloaks for elastodynamic and hydrodynamic waves and cloaks for diffusion (heat or mass) processes, as these are underpinned by geometric transforms. Experimental data extracted from field test analysis of soil structured with boreholes demonstrates the application of crystallography to large scale phononic crystals, coined as seismic metamaterials, as they might exhibit low frequency stop bands. This brings us to the outlook of mechanical metamaterials, with control of phonon emission in graphene through extreme anisotropy, attenuation of vibrations of suspension bridges via low frequency stop bands and the concept of transformed meta-cities. We conclude that these novel materials hold strong applications spanning different disciplines or across different scales from biophysics to geophysics.",3
Dynamics and heat diffusion of Abrikosov's vortex-antivortex pairs during an annihilation process.,"The manipulation and control of vortex states in superconducting systems are of great interest in view of possible applications, for which mesoscopic materials are good candidates. In this work, we studied the annihilation dynamics and the dissipative aspects of an Abrikosov's vortex-antivortex pair in a mesoscopic superconducting system with a concentric hole. The generalized time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations were numerically solved. The main result is the appearance of a phase slip-like line due to the elongation of the vortex and antivortex cores. Under specific circumstances, thermal dissipation might be associated with a sizeable relaxation of the order parameter, so that the energy released in the annihilation of a vortex-antivortex pair might become detectable in measurements of the magnetization as a function of time.",3
Polar phase transitions in heteroepitaxial stabilized La0.5Y0.5AlO3 thin films.,"We report on the fabrication of epitaxial La0.5Y0.5AlO3 ultrathin films on (001) LaAlO3 substrates. Structural characterizations by scanning transmission electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction confirm the high quality of the film with a (-) b (+) c (-) AlO6 octahedral tilt pattern. Unlike either of the nonpolar parent compound, LaAlO3 and YAlO3, second harmonic generation measurements on the thin films suggest a nonpolar-polar phase transition at T c near 500 K, and a polar-polar phase transition at T a near 160 K. By fitting the angular dependence of the second harmonic intensities, we further propose that the two polar structures can be assigned to the Pmc2 1 and Pmn2 1 space group, while the high temperature nonpolar structure belongs to the Pbnm space group.",3
Cluster assembly route to a novel octagonal two-dimensional ZnO monolayer.,"To explore the possibility of cluster assembly resulting in a two-dimensional (2D) stable monolayer of ZnO, a systematic study is performed on the structural evolution of bare and passivated stoichiometric clusters of [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], using density-functional-theory-based first principles electronic structure calculations. The changes in hybridization are investigated with the aid of the site-projected partial density of states and partial charge density, while the effect of passivation and size on the ionicity of the cluster is studied using Bader charge analysis. The structural and chemical properties are found to be influenced by the coordination number of atoms in the clusters irrespective of the coordinating species. The physical parameters and hybridization of the states for the clusters on passivation resemble those of the bulk. Passivation thus provides an environment that leads to the stability of the clusters. Cluster assembly using the stable cluster geometries of passivated clusters (without the passivating atoms) has been shown to lead to stable 2D structures. This stability has been studied on the basis of binding energy, vibrational frequency, phonon dispersion and thermal properties. A new octagonal 2D monolayer planar geometry of ZnO is predicted.",3
Intrinsic plasmarons in warm graphene.,"Based on a self-consistent method, we predict theoretically that there exist intrinsic plasmarons in graphene at nonzero temperature, with a well defined mode, as shown by the result of Landau damping. We find that there are sharp differences between the discussed system and the QCD/QED system. Firstly, the thermal mass is proportional to [Formula: see text] but not [Formula: see text]. Secondly, at [Formula: see text], the fermion channel and plasmaron channel are nearly degenerate, and furthermore the energy difference between fermion and plasmaron becomes larger and larger with increasing q in the region [Formula: see text]. Thirdly, the fermion behaves as a 'relativistic particle' with nonzero mass, and the plasmaron exhibits an abnormal dispersion at moderate momentum.",3
Quantum transport across van der Waals domain walls in bilayer graphene.,"Bilayer graphene can exhibit deformations such that the two graphene sheets are locally detached from each other resulting in a structure consisting of domains with different van der Waals inter-layer coupling. Here we investigate how the presence of these domains affects the transport properties of bilayer graphene. We derive analytical expressions for the transmission probability, and the corresponding conductance, across walls separating different inter-layer coupling domains. We find that the transmission can exhibit a valley-dependent layer asymmetry and that the domain walls have a considerable effect on the chiral tunnelling properties of the charge carriers. We show that transport measurements allow one to obtain the strength with which the two layers are coupled. We perform numerical calculations for systems with two domain walls and find that the availability of multiple transport channels in bilayer graphene significantly modifies the conductance dependence on inter-layer potential asymmetry.",3
Tunable indirect-direct transition of few-layer SnSe via interface engineering.,"Tin selenide (SnSe) is one of the best thermoelectric materials reported to date. The possibility of growing few-layer SnSe helped boost the interest in this long-known, earth abundant material. Pristine SnSe in bulk, mono- and few-layer forms are reported to have indirect electronic bandgaps. Possible indirect-direct transition in SnSe is attractive for its optoelectronic-related applications. Based on the results from first principles density functional theory calculations, we carefully analyzed electronic band structures of bulk, and bilayer SnSe with various interlayer stackings. We report the possible stacking-dependent indirect-direct transition of bilayer SnSe. By further analysis, our results reveal that it is the directionality of interlayer interactions that determine the critical features of their electronic band structures. In fact, by engineering the interface stacking between layers, it is possible to achieve few-layer SnSe with direct electronic band gap. This study provides fundamental insights to design few-layer SnSe and SnSe heterostructures for electronic/optoelectronic applications, where the interface geometry plays a fundamental role in device performance.",3
Polymer models with optimal good-solvent behavior.,"We consider three different continuum polymer models, which all depend on a tunable parameter r that determines the strength of the excluded-volume interactions. In the first model, chains are obtained by concatenating hard spherocylinders of height b and diameter rb (we call them thick self-avoiding chains). The other two models are generalizations of the tangent hard-sphere and of the Kremer-Grest models. We show that for a specific value [Formula: see text], all models show optimal behavior: asymptotic long-chain behavior is observed for relatively short chains. For [Formula: see text], instead, the behavior can be parametrized by using the two-parameter model, which also describes the thermal crossover close to the theta point. The bonds of the thick self-avoiding chains cannot cross each other, and therefore the model is suited for the investigation of topological properties and for dynamical studies. Such a model also provides a coarse-grained description of double-stranded DNA, so that we can use our results to discuss under which conditions DNA can be considered as a model good-solvent polymer.",3
"Direct AFM observation of individual micelles, tile decorations and tiling rules of a dodecagonal liquid quasicrystal.","We performed an atomic force microscopy study of the dendron-based dodecagonal quasicrystal, the material that had been reported in 2004 as the first soft quasicrystal. We succeeded in orienting the 12-fold axis perpendicular to the substrate, which allowed the imaging of the quasiperiodic xy plane. Thus for the first time we have been able to obtain direct real-space information not only on the arrangement of the tiles, but also on their 'decorations' by the individual spherical micelles or 'nanoatoms'. The high-resolution patterns recorded confirm the square-triangle tiling, but the abundance of different nodes corresponds closely to random tiling rather than to any inflation rule. The previously proposed model of three types of decorated tiles, two triangular and one square, has been confirmed; the basic Frank-Kasper mode of alternating dense-sparse-dense-sparse layer stacking along z is confirmed too, each of the four sublayers being 2 nm thick. The consecutive dense layers are seen to be rotated by 90 degrees , as expected. The 2 nm steps on the surface correspond to one layer of spheres, nonetheless with a dense layer always remaining on top, which implies a layer slip underneath and possibly the existence of screw dislocations.",3
Local integrals of motion in the two-site Anderson-Hubbard model.,"It has been proposed that the states of fully many-body localized systems can be described in terms of conserved local pseudospins. Due to the multitude of ways to define these, the explicit identification of the optimally local pseudospins in specific systems is non-trivial. Given continuing intense interest in the role of disorder in strongly correlated systems, we consider the disordered Hubbard model. By studying a small system we provide concrete examples of the form of local integrals of motion in the Anderson-Hubbard model. Moreover, we are able not only to identify the most local choice but also to explore the nature of the distribution of possible choices. We track the evolution of the optimally localized pseudospins as hopping and interactions are varied to move the system away from the trivially localized atomic limit.",3
LiNbO3 surfaces from a microscopic perspective.,"A large number of oxides has been investigated in the last twenty years as possible new materials for various applications ranging from opto-electronics to heterogeneous catalysis. In this context, ferroelectric oxides are particularly promising. The electric polarization plays a crucial role at many oxide surfaces, and it largely determines their physical and chemical properties. Ferroelectrics offer in addition the possibility to control/switch the electric polarization and hence the surface chemistry, allowing for the realization of domain-engineered nanoscale devices such as molecular detectors or highly efficient catalysts. Lithium niobate (LiNbO3) is a ferroelectric with a high spontaneous polarization, whose surfaces have a huge and largely unexplored potential. Owing to recent advances in experimental techniques and sample preparation, peculiar and exclusive properties of LiNbO3 surfaces could be demonstrated. For example, water films freeze at different temperatures on differently polarized surfaces, and the chemical etching properties of surfaces with opposite polarization are strongly different. More important, the ferroelectric domain orientation affects temperature dependent surface stabilization mechanisms and molecular adsorption phenomena. Various ab initio theoretical investigations have been performed in order to understand the outcome of these experiments and the origin of the exotic behavior of the lithium niobate surfaces. Thanks to these studies, many aspects of their surface physics and chemistry could be clarified. Yet other puzzling features are still not understood. This review gives a resume on the present knowledge of lithium niobate surfaces, with a particular view on their microscopic properties, explored in recent years by means of ab initio calculations. Relevant aspects and properties of the surfaces that need further investigation are briefly discussed. The review is concluded with an outlook of challenges and potential payoff for LiNbO3 based applications.",3
High-performance electronic transport in the plane of 3D type-II Dirac semimetals.,"Recently, the type-II Dirac fermion, a new topological state, has been proposed in the Al3V family. It breaks Lorentz symmetry and has unique physical properties. We use first-principles calculations to investigate electronic transport limited by phonon scattering. The electronic resistivity in the xy plane is estimated to be 24.1 [Formula: see text] cm for Al3V and is much lower than that along the z direction. The heavy electronic effective mass along the z direction and the main electron-phonon coupling, originating from the phonon modes vibrating along the z direction, lead to anisotropic electronic transport, which is also found in other members of the Al3V family.",3
Separation of atomic-scale spin contrast on NiO(0 0 1) by magnetic resonance force microscopy.,"In magnetic exchange force microscopy, images contain the topographic contrast mixed with the spin contrast on the sample surface. In this study, we propose a new method of magnetic resonance force microscopy using ferromagnetic resonance to extract only the spin contrast. In this method, the magnetization of a magnetic cantilever is modulated by ferromagnetic resonance to separate the spin contrast and topographic contrast. We succeeded in obtaining a spin image of Ni atoms on a NiO (0 0 1) surface. Furthermore, we successfully detected the superexchange interaction between the tip apex atom and the second layer of Ni atoms.",3
"Magnetic properties of monoclinic lanthanide metaborates, Ln(BO2)3, Ln = Pr, Nd, Gd, Tb.","The bulk magnetic properties of the lanthanide metaborates, Ln(BO2)3, Ln = Pr, Nd, Gd, Tb are studied using magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity and isothermal magnetisation measurements. They are found to crystallise in a monoclinic structure containing chains of magnetic Ln (3+) and could therefore exhibit features of low-dimensional magnetism and frustration. Pr(BO2)3 is found to have a non-magnetic singlet ground state. No magnetic ordering is observed down to 0.4 K for Nd(BO2)3. Gd(BO2)3 exhibits a sharp magnetic transition at 1.1 K, corresponding to 3D magnetic ordering. Tb(BO2)3 shows two magnetic ordering features at 1.05 K and 1.95 K. A magnetisation plateau at a third of the saturation magnetisation is seen at 2 K for both Nd(BO2)3 and Tb(BO2)3, which persists in an applied field of 14 T. This is proposed to be a signature of quasi 1D behaviour in Nd(BO2)3 and Tb(BO2)3.",3
Correspondence between the electronic structure and phase separation in a K-doped FeSe system.,"Phase separated potassium intercalated FeSe thin films have been synthesized by pulsed laser deposition. The coexistence of FeSe phase and 245 phase was investigated both by x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and x-ray diffraction. The volume ratio of these two phases is sensitive to temperatures and amount of extra potassium dosing. The XPS and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy results indicated that these two phases shows the different hybridization strength between adjacent Fe layer and Se layer. We infer that the layered electronic structure is the necessary condition of superconductivity in potassium-doped FeSe system, and the phase separation is driven by competition between quasi-2D and 3D bonding mode within FeSe layer. Similar competition may also be able to interpret the phase seperation in K x Fe2-y Se2 bulk single crystal.",3
Canonical-ensemble extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics for the linear scaling density functional theory.,"We discuss the development and implementation of a constant temperature (NVT) molecular dynamics scheme that combines the Nose-Hoover chain thermostat with the extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) scheme, using a linear scaling density functional theory (DFT) approach. An integration scheme for this canonical-ensemble extended Lagrangian BOMD is developed and discussed in the context of the Liouville operator formulation. Linear scaling DFT canonical-ensemble extended Lagrangian BOMD simulations are tested on bulk silicon and silicon carbide systems to evaluate our integration scheme. The results show that the conserved quantity remains stable with no systematic drift even in the presence of the thermostat.",3
"Sensitivity of magnetic properties to chemical pressure in lanthanide garnets Ln 3 A 2 X 3O12, Ln = Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, A = Ga, Sc, In, Te, X = Ga, Al, Li.","A systematic study of the structural and magnetic properties of three-dimensionally frustrated lanthanide garnets Ln 3 A 2 X 3O12, Ln = Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, A = Ga, Sc, In, Te, X = Ga, Al, Li is presented. Garnets with Ln = Gd show magnetic behaviour consistent with isotropic Gd(3+) spins; no magnetic ordering is observed for T 0.4 K. Magnetic ordering features are seen for garnets with Ln = Tb, Dy, Ho in the temperature range 0.4 < T < 2.5 K, however the nature of the magnetic ordering varies for the different Ln as well as for different combinations of A and X. The magnetic behaviour can be explained by tuning of the magnetic interactions and changes in the single-ion anisotropy. The change in magnetic entropy is evaluated from isothermal magnetisation measurements to characterise the magnetocaloric effect in these materials. Among the Gd garnets, the maximum change in magnetic entropy per mole (15.45 J K(-1) [Formula: see text]) is observed for Gd3Sc2Ga3O12 at 2 K, in a field of 9 T. The performance of Dy3Ga5O12 as a magnetocaloric material surpasses the other garnets with Ln = Tb, Dy, Ho.",3
The influence of surface potential on the optical switching of spiropyran self assembled monolayers.,"Surfaces whose macroscopic properties can be switched by light are potentially useful in a wide variety of applications. One such promising application is electrochemical sensors that can be gated by optically switching the electrode on or off. One way to make such a switchable electrode is by depositing a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of bistable, optically switchable molecules onto an electrode surface. Quantitative application of any such sensor requires understanding how changes in interfacial field affect the composition of photostationary states, i.e. how does electrode potential affect the extent to which the electrode is on or off when irradiated, and the structure of the SAM. Here we address these questions for a SAM of a 6-nitro-substituted spiro[2H-1-benzopyran-2,2'-indoline] covalently attached through a dithiolane linker to an Au electrode immersed in a 0.1 M solution of Tetramethylammonium hexafluorophosphate in Acetonitrile using interface-specific vibrational spectroscopy. We find that in the absence of irradiation, when the SAM is dominated by the closed spiropyran form, variations in potential of 1 V have little effect on spiropyran relative stability. In contrast, under UV irradiation small changes in potential can have dramatic effects: changes in potential of 0.2 V can completely destabilize the open merocyanine form of the SAM relative to the spiropyran and dramatically change the chromophore orientation. Quantitatively accounting for these effects is necessary to employ this, or any other optically switchable bistable chromophore, in electrochemical applications.",3
Terahertz magnetoplasmon-polaritons with nonlocal corrections for lossy two dimensional electron gas in GaN-based heterostructures.,"The high electron concentration in GaN-based heterostructures necessitate the consideration of nonlocal corrections in the magnetoconductivity for the study of magnetoplasmon-polaritons (MPPs) in the lossy two dimensional electron gas system with grating couplers. With the complete set of Maxwell equations, the complex dispersion frequency and absorption spectrum are calculated numerically at different magnetic field (B max = 10 T) and plasmon wavevectors (k max = 5 x 10(7) m(-1)). Taking the AlGaN/GaN structure as a representative case, we observe the cyclotron resonance and its high order harmonics, as well as the MPP modes. The effective aspect ratio of the grating is determined according to the absorption spectrum. Effects of the nonlocal corrections on the dispersion frequency and absorption spectrum are analyzed in detail. The contributions of LO phonons, electron collisions, THz wave polarizations and retardations are also discussed.",3
Compressed H3S: inter-sublattice Coulomb coupling in a high-T C superconductor.,"Upon thermal annealing at or above room temperature (RT) and at high hydrostatic pressure P ~ 155 GPa, sulfur trihydride H3S exhibits a measured maximum superconducting transition temperature T C ~ 200 K. Various theoretical frameworks incorporating strong electron-phonon coupling and Coulomb repulsion have reproduced this record-level T C. Of particular relevance is that experimentally observed H-D isotopic correlations among T C, P, and annealed order indicate an H-D isotope effect exponent alpha limited to values 0.183, leaving open for consideration unconventional high-T C superconductivity with electronic-based enhancements. The work presented herein examines Coulombic pairing arising from interactions between neighboring S and H species on separate interlaced sublattices constituting H3S in the Im[Formula: see text]m structure. The optimal value of the transition temperature is calculated from T C0 = [Formula: see text]Lambdae (2)/[Formula: see text] zeta, with Lambda = 0.007465 A, inter-sublattice S-H separation spacing zeta = a 0/[Formula: see text], interaction charge linear spacing [Formula: see text] = a 0 (3/sigma)(1/2), average participating charge fraction sigma = 3.43 +/- 0.10 estimated from calculated H-projected electron states, and lattice parameter a 0 = 3.0823 A at P = 155 GPa. The resulting value of T C0 = 198.5 +/- 3.0 K is in excellent agreement with transition temperatures determined from resistivity (196-200 K onsets, 190-197 K midpoints), susceptibility (200 K onset), and critical magnetic fields (203.5 K by extrapolation). Analysis of mid-infrared reflectivity data confirms the expected correlation between boson energy and zeta (-1). Suppression of T C below T C0, correlating with increasing residual resistance for < RT annealing, is treated in terms of scattering-induced pair breaking. Correspondences between H3S and layered high-T C superconductor structures are also discussed, and a model considering Compton scattering of virtual photons of energies e (2)/zeta by inter-sublattice electrons is introduced, illustrating that Lambda proportional, variant C, where C is the reduced electron Compton wavelength.",3
Spin-dependent Seebeck effects in a graphene superlattice p-n junction with different shapes.,"We theoretically calculate the spin-dependent transmission probability and spin Seebeck coefficient for a zigzag-edge graphene nanoribbon p-n junction with periodically attached stubs under a perpendicular magnetic field and a ferromagnetic insulator. By using the nonequilibrium Green's function method combining with the tight-binding Hamiltonian, it is demonstrated that the spin-dependent transmission probability and spin Seebeck coefficient for two types of superlattices can be modulated by the potential drop, the magnetization strength, the number of periods of the superlattice, the strength of the perpendicular magnetic field, and the Anderson disorder strength. Interestingly, a metal to semiconductor transition occurs as the number of the superlattice for a crossed superlattice p-n junction increases, and its spin Seebeck coefficient is much larger than that for the T-shaped one around the zero Fermi energy. Furthermore, the spin Seebeck coefficient for crossed systems can be much pronounced and their maximum absolute value can reach 528 muV [Formula: see text] by choosing optimized parameters. Besides, the spin Seebeck coefficient for crossed p-n junction is strongly enhanced around the zero Fermi energy for a weak magnetic field. Our results provide theoretical references for modulating the thermoelectric properties of a graphene superlattice p-n junction by tuning its geometric structure and physical parameters.",3
"A comprehensive study of piezomagnetic response in CrPS4 monolayer: mechanical, electronic properties and magnetic ordering under strains.","We performed first-principles calculations to investigate the magnetic, mechanical and electronic properties of the tetrachalcogenide CrPS4. Although bulk CrPS4 has been shown to exhibit a low-dimensional antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state where ferromagnetic (FM) Cr-chains are coupled antiferromagnetically, our calculations indicated that the monolayer can be transformed to an FM material by applying a uniaxial tensile strain of 4% along the FM Cr-chain direction. The AFM-to-FM transition is explained to be driven by an increase of the exchange interaction induced by a decrease in the distance between the FM Cr-chains. A huge nonlinear piezomagnetism was predicted at the strain-induced magnetic phase boundary. Our study provides insight about rational design of single-layer magnetic materials for a wide range of spintronic devices and energy applications.",3
On the performance of natural orbital functional approximations in the Hubbard model.,"Strongly correlated materials are now under intense development, and natural orbital functional (NOF) methods seem to be able to capture the physics of these systems. We present a benchmark based on the Hubbard model for a class of commonly used NOF approximations (also known as reduced density matrix functional approximations). Our findings highlight the importance of imposing ensemble N-representability conditions in order to obtain consistent results in systems with either weak or strong electronic correlation, such as the Hubbard system with a varying two-particle interaction parameter. Based on the accuracy of the results obtained using PNOF7, which retrieves a large amount of the total strong nondynamic correlation, the Hubbard model points out that N-representability gives solid foundations for NOF development.",3
Valley precession and valley polarization in graphene with inter-valley coupling.,"We theoretically investigate the valley precession and valley polarization in graphene under inter-valley coupling. Our results show that the inter-valley coupling can induce valley polarization in graphene and also precess valleys in real space in a manner similar to the Rashba spin-orbit interaction rotating spins. Moreover, using strain modulation, we can achieve high valley polarization with large valley-polarized currents. These findings provide a new way to create and manipulate valley polarization in graphene.",3
"Stability, electronic and phononic properties of beta and 1T structures of SiTe x (x = 1, 2) and their vertical heterostructures.","By performing first-principles calculations, we predict a novel, stable single layer phase of silicon ditelluride, 1T-[Formula: see text], and its possible vertical heterostructures with single layer beta-SiTe. Structural optimization and phonon calculations reveal that 1T-[Formula: see text] structure has a dynamically stable ground state. Further analysis of the vibrational spectrum at the [Formula: see text] point shows that single layer 1T-[Formula: see text] has characteristic phonon modes at 80, 149, 191 and 294 [Formula: see text]. Electronic-band structure demonstrates that 1T-[Formula: see text] phase exhibits a nonmagnetic metallic ground state with a negligible intrinsic spin-orbit splitting. Moreover, it is shown that similar structural parameters of 1T-[Formula: see text] and existing beta-SiTe phases allows construction of 1T-beta heterostructures with a negligible lattice mismatch. In this regard, it is found that two energetically favorable stacking orders, namely AA and [Formula: see text]B, have distinctive shear and layer breathing phonon modes. It is important to note that the combination of semiconducting beta-SiTe and metallic 1T-[Formula: see text] building blocks forms ultra-thin Schottky barriers that can be used in nanoscale optoelectronic device technologies.",3
Tailoring of magnetic orderings in Fe substituted GdMnO3 bulk samples towards room temperature.,"The evolution of various magnetic ordering has been studied for the orthorhombic perovskite GdMn1-x Fe x O3 (0 x 0.7) system to obtain its comprehensive magnetic phase diagram. We observed that the substitution of Fe in GdMnO3 increases the antiferromagnetic Neel temperature (T N) from 40 K to above 400 K and importantly induces a spin-reorientation transition (T SR) for x 0.4. These transitions are close to room temperature at x = 0.5 and then gradually separated at a higher x value. The static orbital ordering induced by the Jahn-Teller distortion seems to play an important role in changing the T N. The variations of spin-reorientation ordering along with the competition between the magnetic orderings as a function of the composition were discussed with respect to antisymmetric exchange interactions and Mn(3+) single-ion anisotropy in detail. In addition, the correlation between structural and magnetic properties suggests that the subtle structural change at composition x = 0.4 may affect the magnetic ordering. The observed tunable T SR and T N in GdMn1-x Fe x O3 could add a practical value for these compositions in fields like spintronics and sensors.",3
Substitutional carbon doping of free-standing and Ru-supported BN sheets: a first-principles study.,"The development of spatially homogeneous mixed structures with boron (B), nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice is highly desirable, as they open the possibility of creating stable two-dimensional materials with tunable band gaps. However, at least in the free-standing form, the mixed BCN system is energetically driven towards phase segregation to graphene and hexagonal BN. It is possible to overcome the segregation when BCN material is grown on a particular metal substrate, for example Ru(0 0 0 1), but the stabilization mechanism is still unknown. With the use of density-functional theory we study the energetics of BN/Ru slabs, with different types of configurations of C substitutional defects introduced to the h-BN overlayer. The results are compared to the energetics of free-standing BCN materials. We found that the substrate facilitates the C substitution process in the h-BN overlayer. Thus, more homogeneous BCN material can be grown, overcoming the segregation into graphene and h-BN. In addition, we investigate the electronic and transport gaps in free-standing BCN structures, and assess their mechanical properties and stability. The band gap in mixed BCN free-standing material depends on the concentration of the constituent elements and ranges from zero in pristine graphene to nearly 5 eV in free-standing h-BN. This makes BCN attractive for application in modern electronics.",3
Hybridization effects on wave packet dynamics in topological insulator thin films.,"Theoretical study of electron wave packet dynamics in topological insulator (TI) thin films is presented. We have investigated real space trajectories and spin dynamics of electron wave packets in TI thin films. Our focus is on the role of hybridization between the electronic states of the two surfaces. This allows us to access the crossover regime of a thick film with no hybridization to a thin film with finite hybridization. We show that the electron wave packet undergoes side-jump motion in addition to zitterbewegung. The oscillation frequency of zitterbewegung can be tuned by the strength of hybridization, which in turn can be tuned by the thickness of the film. We find that the spin expectations also exhibit zitterbewegung tunable by hybridization. We also show that it is possible to obtain persistent zitterbewegung, oscillations which do not decay, in both the real space trajectories as well as spin dynamics. The zitterbewegung oscillation frequency in TI thin films falls in a parameter regime where it might be possible to observe these effects using present day experimental techniques.",3
Comparative analysis on resistance profiling along tapered semiconductor nanowires: multi-tip technique versus transmission line method.,"The detection of doping dependent values like contact- and path resistances along nanowires (NWs) still proves to be rather challenging compared to planar structures. Unfortunately, the usually used and well established TLM (transmission line measurement) setup exhibits some drawbacks. Complex preliminary preparation steps and the necessity of ohmic contacts limit the investigation to certain semiconductor materials. The simultaneous determination of contact- and path resistances with an unknown distribution makes an analysis on complex structures like tapered nanowires very challenging. Our approach is the utilization of a multi-tip scanning tunneling microscope (MT-STM) as a four point prober, which allows the investigation of freestanding nanowires with an increased spatial resolution. Here, the used measurement setup allows a local separation of current injection and potential measurement and thus a highly precise determination of path resistances. Tapered p-doped GaAs-NWs were used to compare both techniques. Whereas the evaluation of the axial doping profile by MT-STM was rather simple, correction factors had to be introduced for the TLM measurement to calculate the specific resistances and transfer length. By comparing the results of both methods for the very same NW-sample, the precision and accuracy of MT-STM measurements was demonstrated. We found an agreement, which allows the conclusion that both methods exhibit advantages; however the MT-STM was determined as the more precise setup, which enables additional characterization capabilities, such as surface, temperature or light dependent measurements.",3
"Magnetic behavior of metallic kagome lattices, Tb3Ru4Al12 and Er3Ru4Al12.","We report the magnetic behavior of two intermetallic-based kagome lattices, Tb3Ru4Al12 and Er3Ru4Al12, crystallizing in the Gd3Ru4Al2-type hexagonal crystal structure, by measurements in the range 1.8-300 K with bulk experimental techniques (ac and dc magnetization, heat capacity, and magnetoresistance). The main finding is that the Tb compound, known to order antiferromagnetically below (T N =) 22 K, shows glassy characteristics at lower temperatures ([Formula: see text]15 K), thus characterizing this compound as a re-entrant spin-glass. The data reveal that the glassy phase is quite complex and is of a cluster type. Since glassy behavior was not seen for the Gd analog in the past literature, this finding on the Tb compound emphasizes that this kagome family could provide an opportunity to explore the role of higher-order interactions (such as quadrupole) in bringing out magnetic frustration. Additional findings reported here for this compound are: (i) The plots of temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistivity data in the range 12-20 K, just below T N , are found to be hysteretic leading to a magnetic phase in this intermediate temperature range, mimicking disorder-broadened first-order magnetic phase transitions; (ii) features attributable to an interesting magnetic phase co-existence phenomenon in the isothermal magnetoresistance in zero field, after travelling across metamagnetic transition fields, are observed. With respect to the Er compound, we do not find any evidence for long-range magnetic ordering down to 2 K, but this compound appears to be on the verge of magnetic order at 2 K.",3
Non-contact lateral force microscopy.,"The goal of atomic force microscopy (AFM) is to measure the short-range forces that act between the tip and the surface. The signal recorded, however, includes long-range forces that are often an unwanted background. Lateral force microscopy (LFM) is a branch of AFM in which a component of force perpendicular to the surface normal is measured. If we consider the interaction between tip and sample in terms of forces, which have both direction and magnitude, then we can make a very simple yet profound observation: over a flat surface, long-range forces that do not yield topographic contrast have no lateral component. Short-range interactions, on the other hand, do. Although contact-mode is the most common LFM technique, true non-contact AFM techniques can be applied to perform LFM without the tip depressing upon the sample. Non-contact lateral force microscopy (nc-LFM) is therefore ideal to study short-range forces of interest. One of the first applications of nc-LFM was the study of non-contact friction. A similar setup is used in magnetic resonance force microscopy to detect spin flipping. More recently, nc-LFM has been used as a true microscopy technique to systems unsuitable for normal force microscopy.",3
Oscillatory deviations from Matthiessen's rule due to interacting dislocations.,"We theoretically examine the validity of Matthiessen's rule caused by strong dislocation-dislocation interaction using a fully quantized dislocation field, where its degree of deviation is quantified at arbitrary electron energy, dislocation-electron and dislocation-dislocation distances and interaction strengths. Contrary to intuition, we show that the electron relaxation rate deviates from the Matthiessen's rule in an oscillatory way as a function of inter-dislocation distance, instead of monotonically. In addition, we show quantitatively that the deviation is larger in a material with lower mass density, higher Poisson ratio and higher elastic moduli. This study could serve as a computational tool to investigate the electronic behavior of a highly-dislocated system at a full quantum field theoretical level.",3
Homogeneous crystal nucleation in polymers.,"The pathway of crystal nucleation significantly influences the structure and properties of semi-crystalline polymers. Crystal nucleation is normally heterogeneous at low supercooling, and homogeneous at high supercooling, of the polymer melt. Homogeneous nucleation in bulk polymers has been, so far, hardly accessible experimentally, and was even doubted to occur at all. This topical review summarizes experimental findings on homogeneous crystal nucleation in polymers. Recently developed fast scanning calorimetry, with cooling and heating rates up to 10(6) K s(-1), allows for detailed investigations of nucleation near and even below the glass transition temperature, including analysis of nuclei stability. As for other materials, the maximum homogeneous nucleation rate for polymers is located close to the glass transition temperature. In the experiments discussed here, it is shown that polymer nucleation is homogeneous at such temperatures. Homogeneous nucleation in polymers is discussed in the framework of the classical nucleation theory. The majority of our observations are consistent with the theory. The discrepancies may guide further research, particularly experiments to progress theoretical development. Progress in the understanding of homogeneous nucleation is much needed, since most of the modelling approaches dealing with polymer crystallization exclusively consider homogeneous nucleation. This is also the basis for advancing theoretical approaches to the much more complex phenomena governing heterogeneous nucleation.",3
Experimental realization and characterization of an electronic Lieb lattice.,"Geometry, whether on the atomic or nanoscale, is a key factor for the electronic band structure of materials. Some specific geometries give rise to novel and potentially useful electronic bands. For example, a honeycomb lattice leads to Dirac-type bands where the charge carriers behave as massless particles [1]. Theoretical predictions are triggering the exploration of novel 2D geometries [2-10], such as graphynes, Kagome and the Lieb lattice. The latter is the 2D analogue of the 3D lattice exhibited by perovskites [2]; it is a square-depleted lattice, which is characterised by a band structure featuring Dirac cones intersected by a flat band. Whereas photonic and cold-atom Lieb lattices have been demonstrated [11-17], an electronic equivalent in 2D is difficult to realize in an existing material. Here, we report an electronic Lieb lattice formed by the surface state electrons of Cu(111) confined by an array of CO molecules positioned with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). Using scanning tunneling microscopy, spectroscopy and wave-function mapping, we confirm the predicted characteristic electronic structure of the Lieb lattice. The experimental findings are corroborated by muffin-tin and tight-binding calculations. At higher energies, second-order electronic patterns are observed, which are equivalent to a super-Lieb lattice.",3
Effective spin Hamiltonian of a gated triple quantum dot in the presence of spin-orbit interaction.,"We derive and study the effective spin Hamiltonian of a gated triple quantum dot that includes the effects of spin-orbit interaction and an external magnetic field. In the analysis of the resulting spin interaction in linear and in general triangular geometry of the dots, we show that the pairwise spin interaction does depend on the position of the third dot. The spin-orbit induced anisotropy, in addition to changing its strength, also changes its symmetry with the motion of the third quantum dot outside the linear arrangement. Our results present a simplified model that may be used in the design of quantum computers based on three-spin qubits.",3
Properties of the antiferromagnetic selenite MnSeO3 and its non-magnetic analogue ZnSnO3 from first principles calculations.,"We report the properties of the antiferromagnetic selenite MnSeO3 and the non-magnetic analogue ZnSeO3, based on first principles calculations. These compounds are rare examples of ABO3 perovskites with a tetravalent A-site and a divalent B-site. The electronic structure is discussed in the context of the bonding and crystal structure. There is cross-gap hybridization between the O p states that form the valence bands of these compounds and the unoccupied p states of Se, reflecting the lone pair physics that leads to the strong off-centering of Se from the perovskite A-site. The G-type antiferromagnetism of MnSeO3 is a local moment in nature arising from high spin [Formula: see text] with short range interactions. Additionally, there is an interesting spin-dependent hybridization of Mn d and O p states analogous to that in colossal magnetoresistance manganites.",3
Pump-probe STM light emission spectroscopy for detection of photo-induced semiconductor-metal phase transition of VO2.,"We attempted to observe pump-probe scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)-light emission (LE) from a VO2 thin film grown on a rutile TiO2(0 0 1) substrate, with an Ag tip fixed over a semiconducting domain. Laser pulses from a Ti:sapphire laser (wavelength 920 nm; pulse width less than 1.5 ps) irradiated the tip-sample gap as pump and probe light sources. With a photon energy of 2.7 eV, suggesting phase transition from semiconducting monoclinic (M) to metallic rutile (R) phases in relation to the electronic band structure, faint LE was observed roughly 30 ps after the irradiation of the pump pulse, followed by retention for roughly 20 ps. The incident energy fluence of the pump pulse at the gap was five orders of magnitude lower than the threshold value for reported photo-induced M-R phase transition. The mechanism that makes it possible to reduce the threshold fluence is discussed.",3
Interfacial properties of hydrides in alpha-Zr: a theoretical study.,"In order to better understand hydride formation in zirconium alloys, heterophase interfaces between alpha-Zr and gamma-ZrH are investigated by means of ab initio atomic-scale simulations of multilayers coupled with continuous elasticity. Our approach allows us to separate out the elastic contribution, leading to basal and prismatic [Formula: see text] interface energies around 200 [Formula: see text] and 750 [Formula: see text] respectively, i.e. values noticeably higher than previously found for coherent particles such as zeta-Zr2H. By considering interfacial changes of H contents, the possibility of competing elasticity and chemistry effects for interface stability is analyzed. The effects of the strong anisotropy evident in [Formula: see text] interface energies on the important practical issue of preferential habit planes are discussed, allowing us to propose a plausible explanation for the experimental results.",3
Spin-orbit interaction and Kondo scattering at the PrAlO3/SrTiO3 interface: effects of oxygen content.,"We report the effects of oxygen pressure during growth ([Formula: see text]) on the electronic and magnetic properties of PrAlO3 films grown on [Formula: see text]-terminated SrTiO3 substrates. Resistivity measurements show an increase in the sheet resistance as [Formula: see text] is increased. The saturation of the sheet resistance down to 0.3 K is consistent with Kondo theory for [Formula: see text] torr. Resistivity data fits indicate Kondo temperatures of 16-18 K. For the [Formula: see text] sample, we measured a moderate positive magnetoresistance (MR) due to a strong spin-orbit (SO) interaction at low magnetic fields that evolves into a larger negative MR at high fields due to the Kondo effect. Analysis of the MR data permitted the extraction of the SO interaction critical field for the [Formula: see text] torr interface ([Formula: see text] T). We observed high positive MR for the least oxygenated sample, where a fraction of the n-type carriers are derived from oxygen vacancies and possible cation interdiffusion; for this [Formula: see text] torr sample, Hall effect data indicate a thick conducting layer. Its extremely high MR ( approximately [Formula: see text]) is attributed to classical behavior due to a distribution of mobilities.",3
Temperature behaviour of the average size of nanoparticle lattices co-deposited with an amorphous matrix. Analysis of Ge + Al2O3 and Ni + Al2O3 thin films.,"We theoretically interpret the thermal behaviour of the average radius versus substrate temperature of regular quantum dot/nanocluster arrays formed by sputtering semiconductor/metal atoms with oxide molecules. The analysis relies on a continuum theory for amorphous films with given surface quantities, perturbed by a nanoparticle lattice. An account of the basic thermodynamic contributions is given in terms of force-flux phenomenological coefficients of each phase (Ge, Ni, Al2O3). Average radii turn out to be expressible by a characteristic length scale and a dimensionless parameter, which mainly depend upon temperature through diffusion lengths, film pressures and finite-size corrections to interfacial tensions. The numerical agreement is good in both Ge ([Formula: see text]) and Ni ([Formula: see text]) lattices grown at temperatures [Formula: see text]800 K, despite the lower temperature behaviour of quantum dots seeming to suggest further driving forces taking part in such processes.",3
Direct observation of temperature-driven magnetic symmetry transitions by vectorial resolved MOKE magnetometry.,"Angle- and temperature-dependent vectorial magnetometry measurements are necessary to disentangle the effective magnetic symmetry in magnetic nanostructures. Here we present a detailed study on an Fe(1 0 0) thin film system with competing collinear biaxial (four-fold symmetry) and uniaxial (two-fold) magnetic anisotropies, carried out with our recently developed full angular/broad temperature range/vectorial-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect magnetometer, named TRISTAN. The data give direct views on the angular and temperature dependence of the magnetization reversal pathways, from which characteristic axes, remanences, critical fields, domain wall types, and effective magnetic symmetry are obtained. In particular, although the remanence shows four-fold angular symmetry for all investigated temperatures (15 K-400 K), the critical fields show strong temperature and angular dependencies and the reversal mechanism changes for specific angles at a given (angle-dependent) critical temperature, showing signatures of an additional collinear two-fold symmetry. This symmetry-breaking is more relevant as temperature increases to room temperature. It originates from the competition between two anisotropy contributions with different symmetry and temperature evolution. The results highlight the importance of combining temperature and angular studies, and the need to look at different magnetic parameters to unravel the underlying magnetic symmetries and temperature evolutions of the symmetry-breaking effects in magnetic nanostructures.",3
Effect of Tb(3+) doping in mixed-valence manganites and cobaltites.,"The magnetic ordering of four Tb(3+)-doped manganites and cobaltites, La0.7Tb0.1Sr0.2MnO3, La0.7Tb0.1Ca0.2MnO3, La0.7Tb0.1Sr0.2CoO3 and La0.7Tb0.1Ca0.2CoO3, have been studied by means of neutron diffraction and SQUID magnetometry. All the samples were prepared by sintering of sol-gel precursors and their orthorhombic or rhombohedral perovskite structures at room and low temperatures were refined. A long-range ferromagnetic (FM) order was detected at the Mn and Co sites. In addition, a small but significant ordered moment was observed at A sites of studied cobaltites, which was attributed to local Tb(3+) moments, aligned by exchange interactions due to FM ordered Co sublattice. No or minor Tb(3+) contribution was detected in studied manganites.",3
Magnetic impurity doping induced spin-glass state and short-range zigzag order in the honeycomb iridate Na2IrO3.,"Based on the modified Heisenberg-Kitaev model, the effects of magnetic substitution on the magnetic properties of the honeycomb-lattice iridate [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] are studied using Monte Carlo simulations. It is observed that the long-range zigzag state of the original system is rather fragile and can be replaced by a spin-glass state even for small substitution, well consistent with the experimental observation in Ru-substituted samples (Mehlawat et al 2015 Phys. Rev. B 92 134412). Both the disordered Heisenberg and Kitaev interactions caused by the magnetic ion-doping are suggested to be responsible for the magnetic phase transitions in the system. More interestingly, a short-range zigzag order is suggested to survive above the freezing temperature even at high magnetic impurity doping levels.",3
Revealing correlation effect of Co 3d electrons in La3Co4Sn13 and Ce3Co4Sn13 by infrared spectroscopy study.,"We report resistivity, specific heat and optical spectroscopy measurements on single crystal samples of [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text]. We observed clear temperature-induced spectral weight suppression below 4000 [Formula: see text] for both compounds in the conductivity spectra [Formula: see text], indicating the progressive formation of gap-like features with decreasing temperature. The suppressed spectral weight transfers mostly to the higher energy region. This observation reflects the presence of the correlation effect in the compounds. We attribute the correlation effect to the Co 3d electrons.",3
On the density of states of circular graphene quantum dots.,We suggest a simple approach to calculate the local density of states that effectively applies to any structure created by an axially symmetric potential on a continuous graphene sheet such as circular graphene quantum dots or rings. Calculations performed for the graphene quantum dot studied in a recent scanning tunneling microscopy measurement (Gutierrez et al 2016 Nat. Phys. 12 1069-75) show an excellent experimental-theoretical agreement.,3
Electronic and magnetic properties of low-dimensional system Co2TeO3Cl2.,"The electronic and magnetic properties of transition metal oxyhalide compound Co2TeO3Cl2 are investigated using first principle calculations within the framework of density functional theory. To find the underlying spin-lattice of this compound, various hopping integrals and exchange interactions are calculated. The calculations reveal that the dominant inter-chain and intra-chain interactions are in the ab plane. The exchange path is visualized by Wannier function plotting. The nearest neighbor and next nearest neighbor exchange interactions are antiferromagnetic, making the system frustrated in low dimension. Calculations are also done with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) to find out the effect of SOC on this compound. Calculation of magnetocrystalline anisotropy suggests that the easy axis is along the crystallographic b direction.",3
Isotropic shrinkage of the oxygen octahedron in SrTiO3 under uniaxial pressure.,"X-ray absorption spectra at the Ti K-edge of a SrTiO3 single crystal under uniaxial pressure were measured to obtain evidence of uniaxial pressure-induced polarization predicted in SrTiO3 from the electronic viewpoint. The pre-edge 3d-e g peak decreases in intensity with increasing uniaxial pressure, together with an energy shift to higher energy side. Contrary to uniaxial deformation, these changes were independent of incident x-ray polarization. This implies the presence of a mechanism that maintains the isotropic coordination environment around a Ti atom, i.e. a tilt and rotation of the TiO6 octahedron accompanied by its isotropic shrinkage, hence the local polarization essential to the ferroelectric order cannot be observed.",3
Stochastic learning via optimizing the variational inequalities.,"A wide variety of learning problems can be posed in the framework of convex optimization. Many efficient algorithms have been developed based on solving the induced optimization problems. However, there exists a gap between the theoretically unbeatable convergence rate and the practically efficient learning speed. In this paper, we use the variational inequality (VI) convergence to describe the learning speed. To this end, we avoid the hard concept of regret in online learning and directly discuss the stochastic learning algorithms. We first cast the regularized learning problem as a VI. Then, we present a stochastic version of alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs) to solve the induced VI. We define a new VI-criterion to measure the convergence of stochastic algorithms. While the rate of convergence for any iterative algorithms to solve nonsmooth convex optimization problems cannot be better than O(1/ radicalt), the proposed stochastic ADMM (SADMM) is proved to have an O(1/t) VI-convergence rate for the l1-regularized hinge loss problems without strong convexity and smoothness. The derived VI-convergence results also support the viewpoint that the standard online analysis is too loose to analyze the stochastic setting properly. The experiments demonstrate that SADMM has almost the same performance as the state-of-the-art stochastic learning algorithms but its O(1/t) VI-convergence rate is capable of tightly characterizing the real learning speed.",4
Synchronization of stochastic dynamical networks under impulsive control with time delays.,"In this paper, the stochastic synchronization problem is studied for a class of delayed dynamical networks under delayed impulsive control. Different from the existing results on the synchronization of dynamical networks under impulsive control, impulsive input delays are considered in our model. By assuming that the impulsive intervals belong to a certain interval and using the mathematical induction method, several conditions are derived to guarantee that complex networks are exponentially synchronized in mean square. The derived conditions reveal that the frequency of impulsive occurrence, impulsive input delays, and stochastic perturbations can heavily affect the synchronization performance. A control algorithm is then presented for synchronizing stochastic dynamical networks with delayed synchronizing impulses. Finally, two examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",4
A new learning algorithm for a fully connected neuro-fuzzy inference system.,"A traditional neuro-fuzzy system is transformed into an equivalent fully connected three layer neural network (NN), namely, the fully connected neuro-fuzzy inference systems (F-CONFIS). The F-CONFIS differs from traditional NNs by its dependent and repeated weights between input and hidden layers and can be considered as the variation of a kind of multilayer NN. Therefore, an efficient learning algorithm for the F-CONFIS to cope these repeated weights is derived. Furthermore, a dynamic learning rate is proposed for neuro-fuzzy systems via F-CONFIS where both premise (hidden) and consequent portions are considered. Several simulation results indicate that the proposed approach achieves much better accuracy and fast convergence.",4
Ensemble Manifold Rank Preserving for Acceleration-Based Human Activity Recognition.,"With the rapid development of mobile devices and pervasive computing technologies, acceleration-based human activity recognition, a difficult yet essential problem in mobile apps, has received intensive attention recently. Different acceleration signals for representing different activities or even a same activity have different attributes, which causes troubles in normalizing the signals. We thus cannot directly compare these signals with each other, because they are embedded in a nonmetric space. Therefore, we present a nonmetric scheme that retains discriminative and robust frequency domain information by developing a novel ensemble manifold rank preserving (EMRP) algorithm. EMRP simultaneously considers three aspects: 1) it encodes the local geometry using the ranking order information of intraclass samples distributed on local patches; 2) it keeps the discriminative information by maximizing the margin between samples of different classes; and 3) it finds the optimal linear combination of the alignment matrices to approximate the intrinsic manifold lied in the data. Experiments are conducted on the South China University of Technology naturalistic 3-D acceleration-based activity dataset and the naturalistic mobile-devices based human activity dataset to demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the new nonmetric scheme for acceleration-based human activity recognition.",4
Globally Stable Adaptive Backstepping Neural Network Control for Uncertain Strict-Feedback Systems With Tracking Accuracy Known a Priori.,"This paper addresses the problem of globally stable direct adaptive backstepping neural network (NN) tracking control design for a class of uncertain strict-feedback systems under the assumption that the accuracy of the ultimate tracking error is given a priori. In contrast to the classical adaptive backstepping NN control schemes, this paper analyzes the convergence of the tracking error using Barbalat's Lemma via some nonnegative functions rather than the positive-definite Lyapunov functions. Thus, the accuracy of the ultimate tracking error can be determined and adjusted accurately a priori, and the closed-loop system is guaranteed to be globally uniformly ultimately bounded. The main technical novelty is to construct three new n th-order continuously differentiable functions, which are used to design the control law, the virtual control variables, and the adaptive laws. Finally, two simulation examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed control method.",4
Adaptive Neural Control of Nonaffine Systems With Unknown Control Coefficient and Nonsmooth Actuator Nonlinearities.,"This brief considers the asymptotic tracking problem for a class of high-order nonaffine nonlinear dynamical systems with nonsmooth actuator nonlinearities. A novel transformation approach is proposed, which is able to systematically transfer the original nonaffine nonlinear system into an equivalent affine one. Then, to deal with the unknown dynamics and unknown control coefficient contained in the affine system, online approximator and Nussbaum gain techniques are utilized in the controller design. It is proven rigorously that asymptotic convergence of the tracking error and ultimate uniform boundedness of all the other signals can be guaranteed by the proposed control method. The control feasibility is further verified by numerical simulations.",4
Robust Exemplar Extraction Using Structured Sparse Coding.,"Robust exemplar extraction from the noisy sample set is one of the most important problems in pattern recognition. In this brief, we propose a novel approach for exemplar extraction through structured sparse learning. The new model accounts for not only the reconstruction capability and the sparsity, but also the diversity and robustness. To solve the optimization problem, we adopt the alternating directional method of multiplier technology to design an iterative algorithm. Finally, the effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by experiments of various examples including traffic sign sequences.",4
Incremental Generalized Discriminative Common Vectors for Image Classification.,"Subspace-based methods have become popular due to their ability to appropriately represent complex data in such a way that both dimensionality is reduced and discriminativeness is enhanced. Several recent works have concentrated on the discriminative common vector (DCV) method and other closely related algorithms also based on the concept of null space. In this paper, we present a generalized incremental formulation of the DCV methods, which allows the update of a given model by considering the addition of new examples even from unseen classes. Having efficient incremental formulations of well-behaved batch algorithms allows us to conveniently adapt previously trained classifiers without the need of recomputing them from scratch. The proposed generalized incremental method has been empirically validated in different case studies from different application domains (faces, objects, and handwritten digits) considering several different scenarios in which new data are continuously added at different rates starting from an initial model.",4
An Experimentation Platform for On-Chip Integration of Analog Neural Networks: A Pathway to Trusted and Robust Analog/RF ICs.,"We discuss the design of an experimentation platform intended for prototyping low-cost analog neural networks for on-chip integration with analog/RF circuits. The objective of such integration is to support various tasks, such as self-test, self-tuning, and trust/aging monitoring, which require classification of analog measurements obtained from on-chip sensors. Particular emphasis is given to cost-efficient implementation reflected in: 1) low energy and area budgets of circuits dedicated to neural networks; 2) robust learning in presence of analog inaccuracies; and 3) long-term retention of learned functionality. Our chip consists of a reconfigurable array of synapses and neurons operating below threshold and featuring sub-muW power consumption. The synapse circuits employ dual-mode weight storage: 1) a dynamic mode, for fast bidirectional weight updates during training and 2) a nonvolatile mode, for permanent storage of learned functionality. We discuss a robust learning strategy, and we evaluate the system performance on several benchmark problems, such as the XOR2-6 and two-spirals classification tasks.",4
Asynchronous Event-Based Multikernel Algorithm for High-Speed Visual Features Tracking.,"This paper presents a number of new methods for visual tracking using the output of an event-based asynchronous neuromorphic dynamic vision sensor. It allows the tracking of multiple visual features in real time, achieving an update rate of several hundred kilohertz on a standard desktop PC. The approach has been specially adapted to take advantage of the event-driven properties of these sensors by combining both spatial and temporal correlations of events in an asynchronous iterative framework. Various kernels, such as Gaussian, Gabor, combinations of Gabor functions, and arbitrary user-defined kernels, are used to track features from incoming events. The trackers described in this paper are capable of handling variations in position, scale, and orientation through the use of multiple pools of trackers. This approach avoids the N(2) operations per event associated with conventional kernel-based convolution operations with N x N kernels. The tracking performance was evaluated experimentally for each type of kernel in order to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed solution.",4
Global exponential synchronization of multiple memristive neural networks with time delay via nonlinear coupling.,"This paper presents theoretical results on the global exponential synchronization of multiple memristive neural networks with time delays. A novel coupling scheme is introduced, in a general topological structure described by a directed or undirected graph, with a linear diffusive term and discontinuous sign term. Several criteria are derived based on the Lyapunov stability theory to ascertain the global exponential stability of synchronization manifold in the coupling scheme. Simulation results for several examples are given to substantiate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.",4
A Novel Empirical Mode Decomposition With Support Vector Regression for Wind Speed Forecasting.,"Wind energy is a clean and an abundant renewable energy source. Accurate wind speed forecasting is essential for power dispatch planning, unit commitment decision, maintenance scheduling, and regulation. However, wind is intermittent and wind speed is difficult to predict. This brief proposes a novel wind speed forecasting method by integrating empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and support vector regression (SVR) methods. The EMD is used to decompose the wind speed time series into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and a residue. Subsequently, a vector combining one historical data from each IMF and the residue is generated to train the SVR. The proposed EMD-SVR model is evaluated with a wind speed data set. The proposed EMD-SVR model outperforms several recently reported methods with respect to accuracy or computational complexity.",4
Two-Stage Orthogonal Least Squares Methods for Neural Network Construction.,"A number of neural networks can be formulated as the linear-in-the-parameters models. Training such networks can be transformed to a model selection problem where a compact model is selected from all the candidates using subset selection algorithms. Forward selection methods are popular fast subset selection approaches. However, they may only produce suboptimal models and can be trapped into a local minimum. More recently, a two-stage fast recursive algorithm (TSFRA) combining forward selection and backward model refinement has been proposed to improve the compactness and generalization performance of the model. This paper proposes unified two-stage orthogonal least squares methods instead of the fast recursive-based methods. In contrast to the TSFRA, this paper derives a new simplified relationship between the forward and the backward stages to avoid repetitive computations using the inherent orthogonal properties of the least squares methods. Furthermore, a new term exchanging scheme for backward model refinement is introduced to reduce computational demand. Finally, given the error reduction ratio criterion, effective and efficient forward and backward subset selection procedures are proposed. Extensive examples are presented to demonstrate the improved model compactness constructed by the proposed technique in comparison with some popular methods.",4
Dimensionality Reduction for Hyperspectral Data Based on Class-Aware Tensor Neighborhood Graph and Patch Alignment.,"To take full advantage of hyperspectral information, to avoid data redundancy and to address the curse of dimensionality concern, dimensionality reduction (DR) becomes particularly important to analyze hyperspectral data. Exploring the tensor characteristic of hyperspectral data, a DR algorithm based on class-aware tensor neighborhood graph and patch alignment is proposed here. First, hyperspectral data are represented in the tensor form through a window field to keep the spatial information of each pixel. Second, using a tensor distance criterion, a class-aware tensor neighborhood graph containing discriminating information is obtained. In the third step, employing the patch alignment framework extended to the tensor space, we can obtain global optimal spectral-spatial information. Finally, the solution of the tensor subspace is calculated using an iterative method and low-dimensional projection matrixes for hyperspectral data are obtained accordingly. The proposed method effectively explores the spectral and spatial information in hyperspectral data simultaneously. Experimental results on 3 real hyperspectral datasets show that, compared with some popular vector- and tensor-based DR algorithms, the proposed method can yield better performance with less tensor training samples required.",4
Constructing Optimal Prediction Intervals by Using Neural Networks and Bootstrap Method.,"This brief proposes an efficient technique for the construction of optimized prediction intervals (PIs) by using the bootstrap technique. The method employs an innovative PI-based cost function in the training of neural networks (NNs) used for estimation of the target variance in the bootstrap method. An optimization algorithm is developed for minimization of the cost function and adjustment of NN parameters. The performance of the optimized bootstrap method is examined for seven synthetic and real-world case studies. It is shown that application of the proposed method improves the quality of constructed PIs by more than 28% over the existing technique, leading to narrower PIs with a coverage probability greater than the nominal confidence level.",4
Graph Theory-Based Approach for Stability Analysis of Stochastic Coupled Systems With Levy Noise on Networks.,"In this paper, a novel class of stochastic coupled systems with Levy noise on networks (SCSLNNs) is presented. Both white noise and Levy noise are considered in the networks. By exploiting graph theory and Lyapunov stability theory, criteria ensuring p th moment exponential stability and stability in probability of these SCSLNNs are established, respectively. These principles are closely related to the topology of the network and the perturbation intensity of white noise and Levy noise. Moreover, to verify the theoretical results, stochastic coupled oscillators with Levy noise on a network and stochastic Volterra predator-prey system with Levy noise are performed. Finally, a numerical example about oscillators' network is provided to illustrate the feasibility of our analytical results.",4
A Hybrid Constructive Algorithm for Single-Layer Feedforward Networks Learning.,"Single-layer feedforward networks (SLFNs) have been proven to be a universal approximator when all the parameters are allowed to be adjustable. It is widely used in classification and regression problems. The SLFN learning involves two tasks: determining network size and training the parameters. Most current algorithms could not be satisfactory to both sides. Some algorithms focused on construction and only tuned part of the parameters, which may not be able to achieve a compact network. Other gradient-based optimization algorithms focused on parameters tuning while the network size has to be preset by the user. Therefore, trial-and-error approach has to be used to search the optimal network size. Because results of each trial cannot be reused in another trial, it costs much computation. In this paper, a hybrid constructive (HC)algorithm is proposed for SLFN learning, which can train all the parameters and determine the network size simultaneously. At first, by combining Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and least-square method, a hybrid algorithm is presented for training SLFN with fixed network size. Then,with the hybrid algorithm, an incremental constructive scheme is proposed. A new randomly initialized neuron is added each time when the training entrapped into local minima. Because the training continued on previous results after adding new neurons, the proposed HC algorithm works efficiently. Several practical problems were given for comparison with other popular algorithms. The experimental results demonstrated that the HC algorithm worked more efficiently than those optimization methods with trial and error, and could achieve much more compact SLFN than those construction algorithms.",4
Two-Stage Regularized Linear Discriminant Analysis for 2-D Data.,"Fisher linear discriminant analysis (LDA) involves within-class and between-class covariance matrices. For 2-D data such as images, regularized LDA (RLDA) can improve LDA due to the regularized eigenvalues of the estimated within-class matrix. However, it fails to consider the eigenvectors and the estimated between-class matrix. To improve these two matrices simultaneously, we propose in this paper a new two-stage method for 2-D data, namely a bidirectional LDA (BLDA) in the first stage and the RLDA in the second stage, where both BLDA and RLDA are based on the Fisher criterion that tackles correlation. BLDA performs the LDA under special separable covariance constraints that incorporate the row and column correlations inherent in 2-D data. The main novelty is that we propose a simple but effective statistical test to determine the subspace dimensionality in the first stage. As a result, the first stage reduces the dimensionality substantially while keeping the significant discriminant information in the data. This enables the second stage to perform RLDA in a much lower dimensional subspace, and thus improves the two estimated matrices simultaneously. Experiments on a number of 2-D synthetic and real-world data sets show that BLDA+RLDA outperforms several closely related competitors.",4
A Convex Geometry-Based Blind Source Separation Method for Separating Nonnegative Sources.,"This paper presents a convex geometry (CG)-based method for blind separation of nonnegative sources. First, the unaccessible source matrix is normalized to be column-sum-to-one by mapping the available observation matrix. Then, its zero-samples are found by searching the facets of the convex hull spanned by the mapped observations. Considering these zero-samples, a quadratic cost function with respect to each row of the unmixing matrix, together with a linear constraint in relation to the involved variables, is proposed. Upon which, an algorithm is presented to estimate the unmixing matrix by solving a classical convex optimization problem. Unlike the traditional blind source separation (BSS) methods, the CG-based method does not require the independence assumption, nor the uncorrelation assumption. Compared with the BSS methods that are specifically designed to distinguish between nonnegative sources, the proposed method requires a weaker sparsity condition. Provided simulation results illustrate the performance of our method.",4
Learning a Probabilistic Topology Discovering Model for Scene Categorization.,"A recent advance in scene categorization prefers a topological based modeling to capture the existence and relationships among different scene components. To that effect, local features are typically used to handle photographing variances such as occlusions and clutters. However, in many cases, the local features alone cannot well capture the scene semantics since they are extracted from tiny regions (e.g., 4x4 patches) within an image. In this paper, we mine a discriminative topology and a low-redundant topology from the local descriptors under a probabilistic perspective, which are further integrated into a boosting framework for scene categorization. In particular, by decomposing a scene image into basic components, a graphlet model is used to describe their spatial interactions. Accordingly, scene categorization is formulated as an intergraphlet matching problem. The above procedure is further accelerated by introducing a probabilistic based representative topology selection scheme that makes the pairwise graphlet comparison trackable despite their exponentially increasing volumes. The selected graphlets are highly discriminative and independent, characterizing the topological characteristics of scene images. A weak learner is subsequently trained for each topology, which are boosted together to jointly describe the scene image. In our experiment, the visualized graphlets demonstrate that the mined topological patterns are representative to scene categories, and our proposed method beats state-of-the-art models on five popular scene data sets.",4
Missile Guidance Law Based on Robust Model Predictive Control Using Neural-Network Optimization.,"In this brief, the utilization of robust model-based predictive control is investigated for the problem of missile interception. Treating the target acceleration as a bounded disturbance, novel guidance law using model predictive control is developed by incorporating missile inside constraints. The combined model predictive approach could be transformed as a constrained quadratic programming (QP) problem, which may be solved using a linear variational inequality-based primal-dual neural network over a finite receding horizon. Online solutions to multiple parametric QP problems are used so that constrained optimal control decisions can be made in real time. Simulation studies are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed guidance control law for missile interception.",4
Self-Organizing Map With Time-Varying Structure to Plan and Control Artificial Locomotion.,"This paper presents an algorithm, self-organizing map-state trajectory generator (SOM-STG), to plan and control legged robot locomotion. The SOM-STG is based on an SOM with a time-varying structure characterized by constructing autonomously close-state trajectories from an arbitrary number of robot postures. Each trajectory represents a cyclical movement of the limbs of an animal. The SOM-STG was designed to possess important features of a central pattern generator, such as rhythmic pattern generation, synchronization between limbs, and swapping between gaits following a single command. The acquisition of data for SOM-STG is based on learning by demonstration in which the data are obtained from different demonstrator agents. The SOM-STG can construct one or more gaits for a simulated robot with six legs, can control the robot with any of the gaits learned, and can smoothly swap gaits. In addition, SOM-STG can learn to construct a state trajectory form observing an animal in locomotion. In this paper, a dog is the demonstrator agent.",4
An incremental design of radial basis function networks.,"This paper proposes an offline algorithm for incrementally constructing and training radial basis function (RBF) networks. In each iteration of the error correction (ErrCor) algorithm, one RBF unit is added to fit and then eliminate the highest peak (or lowest valley) in the error surface. This process is repeated until a desired error level is reached. Experimental results on real world data sets show that the ErrCor algorithm designs very compact RBF networks compared with the other investigated algorithms. Several benchmark tests such as the duplicate patterns test and the two spiral problem were applied to show the robustness of the ErrCor algorithm. The proposed ErrCor algorithm generates very compact networks. This compactness leads to greatly reduced computation times of trained networks.",4
Stability Analysis of Distributed Delay Neural Networks Based on Relaxed Lyapunov-Krasovskii Functionals.,"This paper revisits the problem of asymptotic stability analysis for neural networks with distributed delays. The distributed delays are assumed to be constant and prescribed. Since a positive-definite quadratic functional does not necessarily require all the involved symmetric matrices to be positive definite, it is important for constructing relaxed Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals, which generally lead to less conservative stability criteria. Based on this fact and using two kinds of integral inequalities, a new delay-dependent condition is obtained, which ensures that the distributed delay neural network under consideration is globally asymptotically stable. This stability criterion is then improved by applying the delay partitioning technique. Two numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the advantage of the presented stability criteria.",4
Multitask Classification Hypothesis Space With Improved Generalization Bounds.,"This paper presents a pair of hypothesis spaces (HSs) of vector-valued functions intended to be used in the context of multitask classification. While both are parameterized on the elements of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and impose a feature mapping that is common to all tasks, one of them assumes this mapping as fixed, while the more general one learns the mapping via multiple kernel learning. For these new HSs, empirical Rademacher complexity-based generalization bounds are derived, and are shown to be tighter than the bound of a particular HS, which has appeared recently in the literature, leading to improved performance. As a matter of fact, the latter HS is shown to be a special case of ours. Based on an equivalence to Group-Lasso type HSs, the proposed HSs are utilized toward corresponding support vector machine-based formulations. Finally, experimental results on multitask learning problems underline the quality of the derived bounds and validate this paper's analysis.",4
A Deterministic Analysis of an Online Convex Mixture of Experts Algorithm.,"We analyze an online learning algorithm that adaptively combines outputs of two constituent algorithms (or the experts) running in parallel to estimate an unknown desired signal. This online learning algorithm is shown to achieve and in some cases outperform the mean-square error (MSE) performance of the best constituent algorithm in the steady state. However, the MSE analysis of this algorithm in the literature uses approximations and relies on statistical models on the underlying signals. Hence, such an analysis may not be useful or valid for signals generated by various real-life systems that show high degrees of nonstationarity, limit cycles and that are even chaotic in many cases. In this brief, we produce results in an individual sequence manner. In particular, we relate the time-accumulated squared estimation error of this online algorithm at any time over any interval to the one of the optimal convex mixture of the constituent algorithms directly tuned to the underlying signal in a deterministic sense without any statistical assumptions. In this sense, our analysis provides the transient, steady-state, and tracking behavior of this algorithm in a strong sense without any approximations in the derivations or statistical assumptions on the underlying signals such that our results are guaranteed to hold. We illustrate the introduced results through examples.",4
A Spiking Neural Simulator Integrating Event-Driven and Time-Driven Computation Schemes Using Parallel CPU-GPU Co-Processing: A Case Study.,"Time-driven simulation methods in traditional CPU architectures perform well and precisely when simulating small-scale spiking neural networks. Nevertheless, they still have drawbacks when simulating large-scale systems. Conversely, event-driven simulation methods in CPUs and time-driven simulation methods in graphic processing units (GPUs) can outperform CPU time-driven methods under certain conditions. With this performance improvement in mind, we have developed an event-and-time-driven spiking neural network simulator suitable for a hybrid CPU-GPU platform. Our neural simulator is able to efficiently simulate bio-inspired spiking neural networks consisting of different neural models, which can be distributed heterogeneously in both small layers and large layers or subsystems. For the sake of efficiency, the low-activity parts of the neural network can be simulated in CPU using event-driven methods while the high-activity subsystems can be simulated in either CPU (a few neurons) or GPU (thousands or millions of neurons) using time-driven methods. In this brief, we have undertaken a comparative study of these different simulation methods. For benchmarking the different simulation methods and platforms, we have used a cerebellar-inspired neural-network model consisting of a very dense granular layer and a Purkinje layer with a smaller number of cells (according to biological ratios). Thus, this cerebellar-like network includes a dense diverging neural layer (increasing the dimensionality of its internal representation and sparse coding) and a converging neural layer (integration) similar to many other biologically inspired and also artificial neural networks.",4
An Interval Type-2 Neural Fuzzy System for Online System Identification and Feature Elimination.,"We propose an integrated mechanism for discarding derogatory features and extraction of fuzzy rules based on an interval type-2 neural fuzzy system (NFS)-in fact, it is a more general scheme that can discard bad features, irrelevant antecedent clauses, and even irrelevant rules. High-dimensional input variable and a large number of rules not only enhance the computational complexity of NFSs but also reduce their interpretability. Therefore, a mechanism for simultaneous extraction of fuzzy rules and reducing the impact of (or eliminating) the inferior features is necessary. The proposed approach, namely an interval type-2 Neural Fuzzy System for online System Identification and Feature Elimination (IT2NFS-SIFE), uses type-2 fuzzy sets to model uncertainties associated with information and data in designing the knowledge base. The consequent part of the IT2NFS-SIFE is of Takagi-Sugeno-Kang type with interval weights. The IT2NFS-SIFE possesses a self-evolving property that can automatically generate fuzzy rules. The poor features can be discarded through the concept of a membership modulator. The antecedent and modulator weights are learned using a gradient descent algorithm. The consequent part weights are tuned via the rule-ordered Kalman filter algorithm to enhance learning effectiveness. Simulation results show that IT2NFS-SIFE not only simplifies the system architecture by eliminating derogatory/irrelevant antecedent clauses, rules, and features but also maintains excellent performance.",4
Finite-Horizon Approximate Optimal Guaranteed Cost Control of Uncertain Nonlinear Systems With Application to Mars Entry Guidance.,"This paper studies the finite-horizon optimal guaranteed cost control (GCC) problem for a class of time-varying uncertain nonlinear systems. The aim of this problem is to find a robust state feedback controller such that the closed-loop system has not only a bounded response in a finite duration of time for all admissible uncertainties but also a minimal guaranteed cost. A neural network (NN) based approximate optimal GCC design is developed. Initially, by modifying the cost function to account for the nonlinear perturbation of system, the optimal GCC problem is transformed into a finite-horizon optimal control problem of the nominal system. Subsequently, with the help of the modified cost function together with a parametrized bounding function for all admissible uncertainties, the solution to the optimal GCC problem is given in terms of a parametrized Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (PHJB) equation. Then, a NN method is developed to solve offline the PHJB equation approximately and thus obtain the nearly optimal GCC policy. Furthermore, the convergence of approximate PHJB equation and the robust admissibility of nearly optimal GCC policy are also analyzed. Finally, by applying the proposed design method to the entry guidance problem of the Mars lander, the achieved simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed controller.",4
Neural Feedback Passivity of Unknown Nonlinear Systems via Sliding Mode Technique.,"Passivity method is very effective to analyze large-scale nonlinear systems with strong nonlinearities. However, when most parts of the nonlinear system are unknown, the published neural passivity methods are not suitable for feedback stability. In this brief, we propose a novel sliding mode learning algorithm and sliding mode feedback passivity control. We prove that for a wide class of unknown nonlinear systems, this neural sliding mode control can passify and stabilize them. This passivity method is validated with a simulation and real experiment tests.",4
Ordinal Distance Metric Learning for Image Ranking.,"Recently, distance metric learning (DML) has attracted much attention in image retrieval, but most previous methods only work for image classification and clustering tasks. In this brief, we focus on designing ordinal DML algorithms for image ranking tasks, by which the rank levels among the images can be well measured. We first present a linear ordinal Mahalanobis DML model that tries to preserve both the local geometry information and the ordinal relationship of the data. Then, we develop a nonlinear DML method by kernelizing the above model, considering of real-world image data with nonlinear structures. To further improve the ranking performance, we finally derive a multiple kernel DML approach inspired by the idea of multiple-kernel learning that performs different kernel operators on different kinds of image features. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate the power of the proposed algorithms against some related state-of-the-art methods.",4
Integral reinforcement learning for continuous-time input-affine nonlinear systems with simultaneous invariant explorations.,"This paper focuses on a class of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, named integral RL (I-RL), that solve continuous-time (CT) nonlinear optimal control problems with input-affine system dynamics. First, we extend the concepts of exploration, integral temporal difference, and invariant admissibility to the target CT nonlinear system that is governed by a control policy plus a probing signal called an exploration. Then, we show input-to-state stability (ISS) and invariant admissibility of the closed-loop systems with the policies generated by integral policy iteration (I-PI) or invariantly admissible PI (IA-PI) method. Based on these, three online I-RL algorithms named explorized I-PI and integral Q -learning I, II are proposed, all of which generate the same convergent sequences as I-PI and IA-PI under the required excitation condition on the exploration. All the proposed methods are partially or completely model free, and can simultaneously explore the state space in a stable manner during the online learning processes. ISS, invariant admissibility, and convergence properties of the proposed methods are also investigated, and related with these, we show the design principles of the exploration for safe learning. Neural-network-based implementation methods for the proposed schemes are also presented in this paper. Finally, several numerical simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.",4
Exponential Stabilization of Memristor-based Chaotic Neural Networks with Time-Varying Delays via Intermittent Control.,"This paper is concerned with the global exponential stabilization of memristor-based chaotic neural networks with both time-varying delays and general activation functions. Here, we adopt nonsmooth analysis and control theory to handle memristor-based chaotic neural networks with discontinuous right-hand side. In particular, several new sufficient conditions ensuring exponential stabilization of memristor-based chaotic neural networks are obtained via periodically intermittent control. In addition, the proposed results here are easy to verify and they also extend the earlier publications. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.",4
Phase Oscillatory Network and Visual Pattern Recognition.,"We explore a properly interconnected set of Kuramoto type oscillators that results in a new associative-memory network configuration, which includes second- and third-order additional terms in the Fourier expansion of the network's coupling. Investigation of the response of the network to different external stimuli indicates an increase in the network capability for coding and information retrieval. Comparison of the network output with that of an equivalent experiment with subjects, for recognizing perturbed binary patterns, shows comparable results between the two approaches. We also discuss the enhanced storage capacity of the network.",4
Optoelectronic Systems Trained With Backpropagation Through Time.,"Delay-coupled optoelectronic systems form promising candidates to act as powerful information processing devices. In this brief, we consider such a system that has been studied before in the context of reservoir computing (RC). Instead of viewing the system as a random dynamical system, we see it as a true machine-learning model, which can be fully optimized. We use a recently introduced extension of backpropagation through time, an optimization algorithm originally designed for recurrent neural networks, and use it to let the network perform a difficult phoneme recognition task. We show that full optimization of all system parameters of delay-coupled optoelectronics systems yields a significant improvement over the previously applied RC approach.",4
Adaptive NN Control of a Class of Nonlinear Systems With Asymmetric Saturation Actuators.,"In this note, adaptive neural network (NN) control is investigated for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems with asymmetric saturation actuators and external disturbances. To handle the effect of nonsmooth asymmetric saturation nonlinearity, a Gaussian error function-based continuous differentiable asymmetric saturation model is employed such that the backstepping technique can be used in the control design. The explosion of complexity in traditional backstepping design is avoided using dynamic surface control. Using radial basis function NN, adaptive control is developed to guarantee that all the signals in the closed-loop system are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded, and the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of origin by appropriately choosing design constants. The effectiveness of the proposed control is demonstrated in the simulation study.",4
Incremental Support Vector Learning for Ordinal Regression.,"Support vector ordinal regression (SVOR) is a popular method to tackle ordinal regression problems. However, until now there were no effective algorithms proposed to address incremental SVOR learning due to the complicated formulations of SVOR. Recently, an interesting accurate on-line algorithm was proposed for training nu -support vector classification (nu-SVC), which can handle a quadratic formulation with a pair of equality constraints. In this paper, we first present a modified SVOR formulation based on a sum-of-margins strategy. The formulation has multiple constraints, and each constraint includes a mixture of an equality and an inequality. Then, we extend the accurate on-line nu-SVC algorithm to the modified formulation, and propose an effective incremental SVOR algorithm. The algorithm can handle a quadratic formulation with multiple constraints, where each constraint is constituted of an equality and an inequality. More importantly, it tackles the conflicts between the equality and inequality constraints. We also provide the finite convergence analysis for the algorithm. Numerical experiments on the several benchmark and real-world data sets show that the incremental algorithm can converge to the optimal solution in a finite number of steps, and is faster than the existing batch and incremental SVOR algorithms. Meanwhile, the modified formulation has better accuracy than the existing incremental SVOR algorithm, and is as accurate as the sum-of-margins based formulation of Shashua and Levin.",4
On Equivalence of FIS and ELM for Interpretable Rule-Based Knowledge Representation.,"This paper presents a fuzzy extreme learning machine (F-ELM) that embeds fuzzy membership functions and rules into the hidden layer of extreme learning machine (ELM). Similar to the concept of ELM that employed the random initialization technique, three parameters of F-ELM are randomly assigned. They are the standard deviation of the membership functions, matrix-C (rule-combination matrix), and matrix-D [don't care (DC) matrix]. Fuzzy if-then rules are formulated by the rule-combination Matrix of F-ELM, and a DC approach is adopted to minimize the number of input attributes in the rules. Furthermore, F-ELM utilizes the output weights of the ELM to form the target class and confidence factor for each of the rules. This is to indicate that the corresponding consequent parameters are determined analytically. The operations of F-ELM are equivalent to a fuzzy inference system. Several benchmark data sets and a real world fault detection and diagnosis problem have been used to empirically evaluate the efficacy of the proposed F-ELM in handling pattern classification tasks. The results show that the accuracy rates of F-ELM are comparable (if not superior) to ELM with distinctive ability of providing explicit knowledge in the form of interpretable rule base.",4
Nonlinear Topological Component Analysis: Application to Age-Invariant Face Recognition.,We introduce a novel formalism that performs dimensionality reduction and captures topological features (such as the shape of the observed data) to conduct pattern classification. This mission is achieved by: 1) reducing the dimension of the observed variables through a kernelized radial basis function technique and expressing the latent variables probability distribution in terms of the observed variables; 2) disclosing the data manifold as a 3-D polyhedron via the alpha -shape constructor and extracting topological features; and 3) classifying a data set using a mixture of multinomial distributions. We have applied our methodology to the problem of age-invariant face recognition. Experimental results obtained demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methodology named nonlinear topological component analysis when compared with some state-of-the-art approaches.,4
FREL: A Stable Feature Selection Algorithm.,"Two factors characterize a good feature selection algorithm: its accuracy and stability. This paper aims at introducing a new approach to stable feature selection algorithms. The innovation of this paper centers on a class of stable feature selection algorithms called feature weighting as regularized energy-based learning (FREL). Stability properties of FREL using L1 or L2 regularization are investigated. In addition, as a commonly adopted implementation strategy for enhanced stability, an ensemble FREL is proposed. A stability bound for the ensemble FREL is also presented. Our experiments using open source real microarray data, which are challenging high dimensionality small sample size problems demonstrate that our proposed ensemble FREL is not only stable but also achieves better or comparable accuracy than some other popular stable feature weighting methods.",4
Discrete-Time Zhang Neural Network for Online Time-Varying Nonlinear Optimization With Application to Manipulator Motion Generation.,"In this brief, a discrete-time Zhang neural network (DTZNN) model is first proposed, developed, and investigated for online time-varying nonlinear optimization (OTVNO). Then, Newton iteration is shown to be derived from the proposed DTZNN model. In addition, to eliminate the explicit matrix-inversion operation, the quasi-Newton Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) method is introduced, which can effectively approximate the inverse of Hessian matrix. A DTZNN-BFGS model is thus proposed and investigated for OTVNO, which is the combination of the DTZNN model and the quasi-Newton BFGS method. In addition, theoretical analyses show that, with step-size h=1 and/or with zero initial error, the maximal residual error of the DTZNN model has an O(tau(2)) pattern, whereas the maximal residual error of the Newton iteration has an O(tau) pattern, with tau denoting the sampling gap. Besides, when h not equal 1 and h in (0,2) , the maximal steady-state residual error of the DTZNN model has an O(tau(2)) pattern. Finally, an illustrative numerical experiment and an application example to manipulator motion generation are provided and analyzed to substantiate the efficacy of the proposed DTZNN and DTZNN-BFGS models for OTVNO.",4
Adaptive Output-Feedback Neural Control of Switched Uncertain Nonlinear Systems With Average Dwell Time.,"This paper investigates the problem of adaptive neural tracking control via output-feedback for a class of switched uncertain nonlinear systems without the measurements of the system states. The unknown control signals are approximated directly by neural networks. A novel adaptive neural control technique for the problem studied is set up by exploiting the average dwell time method and backstepping. A switched filter and different update laws are designed to reduce the conservativeness caused by adoption of a common observer and a common update law for all subsystems. The proposed controllers of subsystems guarantee that all closed-loop signals remain bounded under a class of switching signals with average dwell time, while the output tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of the origin. As an application of the proposed design method, adaptive output feedback neural tracking controllers for a mass-spring-damper system are constructed.",4
The Connection Between Bayesian Estimation of a Gaussian Random Field and RKHS.,"Reconstruction of a function from noisy data is key in machine learning and is often formulated as a regularized optimization problem over an infinite-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The solution suitably balances adherence to the observed data and the corresponding RKHS norm. When the data fit is measured using a quadratic loss, this estimator has a known statistical interpretation. Given the noisy measurements, the RKHS estimate represents the posterior mean (minimum variance estimate) of a Gaussian random field with covariance proportional to the kernel associated with the RKHS. In this brief, we provide a statistical interpretation when more general losses are used, such as absolute value, Vapnik or Huber. Specifically, for any finite set of sampling locations (that includes where the data were collected), the maximum a posteriori estimate for the signal samples is given by the RKHS estimate evaluated at the sampling locations. This connection establishes a firm statistical foundation for several stochastic approaches used to estimate unknown regularization parameters. To illustrate this, we develop a numerical scheme that implements a Bayesian estimator with an absolute value loss. This estimator is used to learn a function from measurements contaminated by outliers.",4
Blind image quality assessment via deep learning.,"This paper investigates how to blindly evaluate the visual quality of an image by learning rules from linguistic descriptions. Extensive psychological evidence shows that humans prefer to conduct evaluations qualitatively rather than numerically. The qualitative evaluations are then converted into the numerical scores to fairly benchmark objective image quality assessment (IQA) metrics. Recently, lots of learning-based IQA models are proposed by analyzing the mapping from the images to numerical ratings. However, the learnt mapping can hardly be accurate enough because some information has been lost in such an irreversible conversion from the linguistic descriptions to numerical scores. In this paper, we propose a blind IQA model, which learns qualitative evaluations directly and outputs numerical scores for general utilization and fair comparison. Images are represented by natural scene statistics features. A discriminative deep model is trained to classify the features into five grades, corresponding to five explicit mental concepts, i.e., excellent, good, fair, poor, and bad. A newly designed quality pooling is then applied to convert the qualitative labels into scores. The classification framework is not only much more natural than the regression-based models, but also robust to the small sample size problem. Thorough experiments are conducted on popular databases to verify the model's effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness.",4
A Neurodynamic Optimization Method for Recovery of Compressive Sensed Signals With Globally Converged Solution Approximating to l0 Minimization.,"Finding the optimal solution to the constrained l0 -norm minimization problems in the recovery of compressive sensed signals is an NP-hard problem and it usually requires intractable combinatorial searching operations for getting the global optimal solution, unless using other objective functions (e.g., the l1 norm or lp norm) for approximate solutions or using greedy search methods for locally optimal solutions (e.g., the orthogonal matching pursuit type algorithms). In this paper, a neurodynamic optimization method is proposed to solve the l0 -norm minimization problems for obtaining the global optimum using a recurrent neural network (RNN) model. For the RNN model, a group of modified Gaussian functions are constructed and their sum is taken as the objective function for approximating the l0 norm and for optimization. The constructed objective function sets up a convexity condition under which the neurodynamic system is guaranteed to obtain the globally convergent optimal solution. An adaptive adjustment scheme is developed for improving the performance of the optimization algorithm further. Extensive experiments are conducted to test the proposed approach in this paper and the output results validate the effectiveness of the new method.",4
Randomized gradient-free method for multiagent optimization over time-varying networks.,"In this brief, we consider the multiagent optimization over a network where multiple agents try to minimize a sum of nonsmooth but Lipschitz continuous functions, subject to a convex state constraint set. The underlying network topology is modeled as time varying. We propose a randomized derivative-free method, where in each update, the random gradient-free oracles are utilized instead of the subgradients (SGs). In contrast to the existing work, we do not require that agents are able to compute the SGs of their objective functions. We establish the convergence of the method to an approximate solution of the multiagent optimization problem within the error level depending on the smoothing parameter and the Lipschitz constant of each agent's objective function. Finally, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.",4
Complex-Valued Recurrent Correlation Neural Networks.,"In this paper, we generalize the bipolar recurrent correlation neural networks (RCNNs) of Chiueh and Goodman for patterns whose components are in the complex unit circle. The novel networks, referred to as complex-valued RCNNs (CV-RCNNs), are characterized by a possible nonlinear function, which is applied on the real part of the scalar product of the current state and the original patterns. We show that the CV-RCNNs always converge to a stationary state. Thus, they have potential application as associative memories. In this context, we provide sufficient conditions for the retrieval of a memorized vector. Furthermore, computational experiments concerning the reconstruction of corrupted grayscale images reveal that certain CV-RCNNs exhibit an excellent noise tolerance.",4
Discriminative embedded clustering: a framework for grouping high-dimensional data.,"In many real applications of machine learning and data mining, we are often confronted with high-dimensional data. How to cluster high-dimensional data is still a challenging problem due to the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we try to address this problem using joint dimensionality reduction and clustering. Different from traditional approaches that conduct dimensionality reduction and clustering in sequence, we propose a novel framework referred to as discriminative embedded clustering which alternates them iteratively. Within this framework, we are able not only to view several traditional approaches and reveal their intrinsic relationships, but also to be stimulated to develop a new method. We also propose an effective approach for solving the formulated nonconvex optimization problem. Comprehensive analyses, including convergence behavior, parameter determination, and computational complexity, together with the relationship to other related approaches, are also presented. Plenty of experimental results on benchmark data sets illustrate that the proposed method outperforms related state-of-the-art clustering approaches and existing joint dimensionality reduction and clustering methods.",4
Complex support vector machines for regression and quaternary classification.,"The paper presents a new framework for complex support vector regression (SVR) as well as Support Vector Machines (SVM) for quaternary classification. The method exploits the notion of widely linear estimation to model the input-out relation for complex-valued data and considers two cases: 1) the complex data are split into their real and imaginary parts and a typical real kernel is employed to map the complex data to a complexified feature space and 2) a pure complex kernel is used to directly map the data to the induced complex feature space. The recently developed Wirtinger's calculus on complex reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces is employed to compute the Lagrangian and derive the dual optimization problem. As one of our major results, we prove that any complex SVM/SVR task is equivalent with solving two real SVM/SVR tasks exploiting a specific real kernel, which is generated by the chosen complex kernel. In particular, the case of pure complex kernels leads to the generation of new kernels, which have not been considered before. In the classification case, the proposed framework inherently splits the complex space into four parts. This leads naturally to solving the four class-task (quaternary classification), instead of the typical two classes of the real SVM. In turn, this rationale can be used in a multiclass problem as a split-class scenario based on four classes, as opposed to the one-versus-all method; this can lead to significant computational savings. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for regression and classification tasks that involve complex data.",4
Partially shared latent factor learning with multiview data.,"Multiview representations reveal the fundamental attributes of the studied instances from different perspectives. Some common perspectives are reviewed by multiple views simultaneously, while some specific ones are reflected by individual views. That is, there are two kinds of properties embedded in the multiview data: 1) consistency and 2) complementarity. Different from most multiview learning approaches only focusing on either consistency or complementarity, this paper proposes a novel semisupervised multiview learning algorithm, called partially shared latent factor (PSLF) learning, which jointly exploits both consistent and complementary information among multiple views. In PSLF, a nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF)-based formulation is adopted to learn a compact and comprehensive partially shared latent representation, which is composed of common latent factors shared by multiple views and some specific latent factors to each view. With the learned representations of multiview data, we introduce a robust sparse regression model to predict the cluster labels of labeled data. By integrating the NMF-based model and the regression model, we obtain a unified formulation and propose a multiplicative-based alternative algorithm for optimization. In addition, PSLF can learn the weights of different views adaptively according to the reconstruction precisions of data matrices. Our experimental study indicates different multiview data that contains consistent and complementary information in different degrees. In addition, the encouraging results of the proposed algorithm are achieved in comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms on real-world data sets.",4
Synchronization of chaotic Lur'e systems with time delays using sampled-data control.,"The asymptotical synchronization problem is investigated for two identical chaotic Lur'e systems with time delays. The sampled-data control method is employed for the system design. A new synchronization condition is proposed in the form of linear matrix inequalities. The error system is shown to be asymptotically stable with the constructed new piecewise differentiable Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF). Different from the existing work, the new LKF makes full use of the information in the nonlinear part of the system. The obtained stability condition is less conservative than some of the existing ones. A longer sampling period is achieved with the new method. The numerical examples are given and the simulations are performed on Chua's circuit. The results show the superiorities and effectiveness of the proposed control method.",4
Second-order global consensus in multiagent networks with random directional link failure.,"In this paper, we consider the second-order globally nonlinear consensus in a multiagent network with general directed topology and random interconnection failure by characterizing the behavior of stochastic dynamical system with the corresponding time-averaged system. A criterion for the second-order consensus is derived by constructing a Lyapunov function for the time-averaged network. By associating the solution of random switching nonlinear system with the constructed Lyapunov function, a sufficient condition for second-order globally nonlinear consensus in a multiagent network with random directed interconnections is also established. It is required that the second-order consensus can be achieved in the time-averaged network and the Lyapunov function decreases along the solution of the random switching nonlinear system at an infinite subsequence of the switching moments. A numerical example is presented to justify the correctness of the theoretical results.",4
Generalized multiple kernel learning with data-dependent priors.,"Multiple kernel learning (MKL) and classifier ensemble are two mainstream methods for solving learning problems in which some sets of features/views are more informative than others, or the features/views within a given set are inconsistent. In this paper, we first present a novel probabilistic interpretation of MKL such that maximum entropy discrimination with a noninformative prior over multiple views is equivalent to the formulation of MKL. Instead of using the noninformative prior, we introduce a novel data-dependent prior based on an ensemble of kernel predictors, which enhances the prediction performance of MKL by leveraging the merits of the classifier ensemble. With the proposed probabilistic framework of MKL, we propose a hierarchical Bayesian model to learn the proposed data-dependent prior and classification model simultaneously. The resultant problem is convex and other information (e.g., instances with either missing views or missing labels) can be seamlessly incorporated into the data-dependent priors. Furthermore, a variety of existing MKL models can be recovered under the proposed MKL framework and can be readily extended to incorporate these priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate the benefits of our proposed framework in supervised and semisupervised settings, as well as in tasks with partial correspondence among multiple views.",4
On recursive edit distance kernels with application to time series classification.,"This paper proposes some extensions to the work on kernels dedicated to string or time series global alignment based on the aggregation of scores obtained by local alignments. The extensions that we propose allow us to construct, from classical recursive definition of elastic distances, recursive edit distance (or time-warp) kernels that are positive definite if some sufficient conditions are satisfied. The sufficient conditions we end up with are original and weaker than those proposed in earlier works, although a recursive regularizing term is required to get proof of the positive definiteness as a direct consequence of the Haussler's convolution theorem. Furthermore, the positive definiteness is maintained when a symmetric corridor is used to reduce the search space, and thus the algorithmic complexity, which is quadratic in the worst case. The classification experiment we conducted on three classical time-warp distances (two of which are metrics), using support vector machine classifier, leads to the conclusion that when the pairwise distance matrix obtained from the training data is far from definiteness, the positive definite recursive elastic kernels outperform in general the distance substituting kernels for several classical elastic distances we have tested.",4
Is extreme learning machine feasible? A theoretical assessment (part II).,"An extreme learning machine (ELM) can be regarded as a two-stage feed-forward neural network (FNN) learning system that randomly assigns the connections with and within hidden neurons in the first stage and tunes the connections with output neurons in the second stage. Therefore, ELM training is essentially a linear learning problem, which significantly reduces the computational burden. Numerous applications show that such a computation burden reduction does not degrade the generalization capability. It has, however, been open that whether this is true in theory. The aim of this paper is to study the theoretical feasibility of ELM by analyzing the pros and cons of ELM. In the previous part of this topic, we pointed out that via appropriately selected activation functions, ELM does not degrade the generalization capability in the sense of expectation. In this paper, we launch the study in a different direction and show that the randomness of ELM also leads to certain negative consequences. On one hand, we find that the randomness causes an additional uncertainty problem of ELM, both in approximation and learning. On the other hand, we theoretically justify that there also exist activation functions such that the corresponding ELM degrades the generalization capability. In particular, we prove that the generalization capability of ELM with Gaussian kernel is essentially worse than that of FNN with Gaussian kernel. To facilitate the use of ELM, we also provide a remedy to such a degradation. We find that the well-developed coefficient regularization technique can essentially improve the generalization capability. The obtained results reveal the essential characteristic of ELM in a certain sense and give theoretical guidance concerning how to use ELM.",4
Learning from adaptive neural dynamic surface control of strict-feedback systems.,"Learning plays an essential role in autonomous control systems. However, how to achieve learning in the nonstationary environment for nonlinear systems is a challenging problem. In this paper, we present learning method for a class of n th-order strict-feedback systems by adaptive dynamic surface control (DSC) technology, which achieves the human-like ability of learning by doing and doing with learned knowledge. To achieve the learning, this paper first proposes stable adaptive DSC with auxiliary first-order filters, which ensures the boundedness of all the signals in the closed-loop system and the convergence of tracking errors in a finite time. With the help of DSC, the derivative of the filter output variable is used as the neural network (NN) input instead of traditional intermediate variables. As a result, the proposed adaptive DSC method reduces greatly the dimension of NN inputs, especially for high-order systems. After the stable DSC design, we decompose the stable closed-loop system into a series of linear time-varying perturbed subsystems. Using a recursive design, the recurrent property of NN input variables is easily verified since the complexity is overcome using DSC. Subsequently, the partial persistent excitation condition of the radial basis function NN is satisfied. By combining a state transformation, accurate approximations of the closed-loop system dynamics are recursively achieved in a local region along recurrent orbits. Then, the learning control method using the learned knowledge is proposed to achieve the closed-loop stability and the improved control performance. Simulation studies are performed to demonstrate the proposed scheme can not only reuse the learned knowledge to achieve the better control performance with the faster tracking convergence rate and the smaller tracking error but also greatly alleviate the computational burden because of reducing the number and complexity of NN input variables.",4
Is extreme learning machine feasible? A theoretical assessment (part I).,"An extreme learning machine (ELM) is a feedforward neural network (FNN) like learning system whose connections with output neurons are adjustable, while the connections with and within hidden neurons are randomly fixed. Numerous applications have demonstrated the feasibility and high efficiency of ELM-like systems. It has, however, been open if this is true for any general applications. In this two-part paper, we conduct a comprehensive feasibility analysis of ELM. In Part I, we provide an answer to the question by theoretically justifying the following: 1) for some suitable activation functions, such as polynomials, Nadaraya-Watson and sigmoid functions, the ELM-like systems can attain the theoretical generalization bound of the FNNs with all connections adjusted, i.e., they do not degrade the generalization capability of the FNNs even when the connections with and within hidden neurons are randomly fixed; 2) the number of hidden neurons needed for an ELM-like system to achieve the theoretical bound can be estimated; and 3) whenever the activation function is taken as polynomial, the deduced hidden layer output matrix is of full column-rank, therefore the generalized inverse technique can be efficiently applied to yield the solution of an ELM-like system, and, furthermore, for the nonpolynomial case, the Tikhonov regularization can be applied to guarantee the weak regularity while not sacrificing the generalization capability. In Part II, however, we reveal a different aspect of the feasibility of ELM: there also exists some activation functions, which makes the corresponding ELM degrade the generalization capability. The obtained results underlie the feasibility and efficiency of ELM-like systems, and yield various generalizations and improvements of the systems as well.",4
Kernel reconstruction ICA for sparse representation.,"Independent component analysis with soft reconstruction cost (RICA) has been recently proposed to linearly learn sparse representation with an overcomplete basis, and this technique exhibits promising performance even on unwhitened data. However, linear RICA may not be effective for the majority of real-world data because nonlinearly separable data structure pervasively exists in original data space. Meanwhile, RICA is essentially an unsupervised method and does not employ class information. Motivated by the success of the kernel trick that maps a nonlinearly separable data structure into a linearly separable case in a high-dimensional feature space, we propose a kernel RICA (kRICA) model to nonlinearly capture sparse representation in feature space. Furthermore, we extend the unsupervised kRICA to a supervised one by introducing a class-driven discrimination constraint, such that the data samples from the same class are well represented on the basis of the corresponding subset of basis vectors. This discrimination constraint minimizes inhomogeneous representation energy and maximizes homogeneous representation energy simultaneously, which is essentially equivalent to maximizing between-class scatter and minimizing within-class scatter at the same time in an implicit manner. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more effective than other state-of-the-art methods on several datasets.",4
"Memristor-based cellular nonlinear/neural network: design, analysis, and applications.","Cellular nonlinear/neural network (CNN) has been recognized as a powerful massively parallel architecture capable of solving complex engineering problems by performing trillions of analog operations per second. The memristor was theoretically predicted in the late seventies, but it garnered nascent research interest due to the recent much-acclaimed discovery of nanocrossbar memories by engineers at the Hewlett-Packard Laboratory. The memristor is expected to be co-integrated with nanoscale CMOS technology to revolutionize conventional von Neumann as well as neuromorphic computing. In this paper, a compact CNN model based on memristors is presented along with its performance analysis and applications. In the new CNN design, the memristor bridge circuit acts as the synaptic circuit element and substitutes the complex multiplication circuit used in traditional CNN architectures. In addition, the negative differential resistance and nonlinear current-voltage characteristics of the memristor have been leveraged to replace the linear resistor in conventional CNNs. The proposed CNN design has several merits, for example, high density, nonvolatility, and programmability of synaptic weights. The proposed memristor-based CNN design operations for implementing several image processing functions are illustrated through simulation and contrasted with conventional CNNs. Monte-Carlo simulation has been used to demonstrate the behavior of the proposed CNN due to the variations in memristor synaptic weights.",4
Output-feedback adaptive neural control for stochastic nonlinear time-varying delay systems with unknown control directions.,"This paper presents an adaptive output-feedback neural network (NN) control scheme for a class of stochastic nonlinear time-varying delay systems with unknown control directions. To make the controller design feasible, the unknown control coefficients are grouped together and the original system is transformed into a new system using a linear state transformation technique. Then, the Nussbaum function technique is incorporated into the backstepping recursive design technique to solve the problem of unknown control directions. Furthermore, under the assumption that the time-varying delays exist in the system output, only one NN is employed to compensate for all unknown nonlinear terms depending on the delayed output. Moreover, by estimating the maximum of NN parameters instead of the parameters themselves, the NN parameters to be estimated are greatly decreased and the online learning time is also dramatically decreased. It is shown that all the signals of the closed-loop system are bounded in probability. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by the simulation results.",4
Further result on guaranteed Hinfinity performance state estimation of delayed static neural networks.,"This brief considers the guaranteed Hinfinity performance state estimation problem of delayed static neural networks. An Arcak-type state estimator, which is more general than the widely adopted Luenberger-type one, is chosen to tackle this issue. A delay-dependent criterion is derived under which the estimation error system is globally asymptotically stable with a prescribed Hinfinity performance. It is shown that the design of suitable gain matrices and the optimal performance index are accomplished by solving a convex optimization problem subject to two linear matrix inequalities. Compared with some previous results, much better performance is achieved by our approach, which is greatly benefited from introducing an additional gain matrix in the domain of activation function. An example is finally given to demonstrate the advantage of the developed result.",4
Adaptive NN controller design for a class of nonlinear MIMO discrete-time systems.,"An adaptive neural network tracking control is studied for a class of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) nonlinear systems. The studied systems are in discrete-time form and the discretized dead-zone inputs are considered. In addition, the studied MIMO systems are composed of N subsystems, and each subsystem contains unknown functions and external disturbance. Due to the complicated framework of the discrete-time systems, the existence of the dead zone and the noncausal problem in discrete-time, it brings about difficulties for controlling such a class of systems. To overcome the noncausal problem, by defining the coordinate transformations, the studied systems are transformed into a special form, which is suitable for the backstepping design. The radial basis functions NNs are utilized to approximate the unknown functions of the systems. The adaptation laws and the controllers are designed based on the transformed systems. By using the Lyapunov method, it is proved that the closed-loop system is stable in the sense that the semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded of all the signals and the tracking errors converge to a bounded compact set. The simulation examples and the comparisons with previous approaches are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm.",4
Optimization of a multilayer neural network by using minimal redundancy maximal relevance-partial mutual information clustering with least square regression.,"In this paper, an optimized multilayer feed-forward network (MLFN) is developed to construct a soft sensor for controlling naphtha dry point. To overcome the two main flaws in the structure and weight of MLFNs, which are trained by a back-propagation learning algorithm, minimal redundancy maximal relevance-partial mutual information clustering (mPMIc) integrated with least square regression (LSR) is proposed to optimize the MLFN. The mPMIc can determine the location of hidden layer nodes using information in the hidden and output layers, as well as remove redundant hidden layer nodes. These selected nodes are highly related to output data, but are minimally correlated with other hidden layer nodes. The weights between the selected hidden layer nodes and output layer are then updated through LSR. When the redundant nodes from the hidden layer are removed, the ideal MLFN structure can be obtained according to the test error results. In actual applications, the naphtha dry point must be controlled accurately because it strongly affects the production yield and the stability of subsequent operational processes. The mPMIc-LSR MLFN with a simple network size performs better than other improved MLFN variants and existing efficient models.",4
Generalized single-hidden layer feedforward networks for regression problems.,"In this paper, traditional single-hidden layer feedforward network (SLFN) is extended to novel generalized SLFN (GSLFN) by employing polynomial functions of inputs as output weights connecting randomly generated hidden units with corresponding output nodes. The significant contributions of this paper are as follows: 1) a primal GSLFN (P-GSLFN) is implemented using randomly generated hidden nodes and polynomial output weights whereby the regression matrix is augmented by full or partial input variables and only polynomial coefficients are to be estimated; 2) a simplified GSLFN (S-GSLFN) is realized by decomposing the polynomial output weights of the P-GSLFN into randomly generated polynomial nodes and tunable output weights; 3) both P- and S-GSLFN are able to achieve universal approximation if the output weights are tuned by ridge regression estimators; and 4) by virtue of the developed batch and online sequential ridge ELM (BR-ELM and OSR-ELM) learning algorithms, high performance of the proposed GSLFNs in terms of generalization and learning speed is guaranteed. Comprehensive simulation studies and comparisons with standard SLFNs are carried out on real-world regression benchmark data sets. Simulation results demonstrate that the innovative GSLFNs using BR-ELM and OSR-ELM are superior to standard SLFNs in terms of accuracy, training speed, and structure compactness.",4
A two-layer recurrent neural network for nonsmooth convex optimization problems.,"In this paper, a two-layer recurrent neural network is proposed to solve the nonsmooth convex optimization problem subject to convex inequality and linear equality constraints. Compared with existing neural network models, the proposed neural network has a low model complexity and avoids penalty parameters. It is proved that from any initial point, the state of the proposed neural network reaches the equality feasible region in finite time and stays there thereafter. Moreover, the state is unique if the initial point lies in the equality feasible region. The equilibrium point set of the proposed neural network is proved to be equivalent to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality set of the original optimization problem. It is further proved that the equilibrium point of the proposed neural network is stable in the sense of Lyapunov. Moreover, from any initial point, the state is proved to be convergent to an equilibrium point of the proposed neural network. Finally, as applications, the proposed neural network is used to solve nonlinear convex programming with linear constraints and L1 -norm minimization problems.",4
Adaptive neural control of nonlinear MIMO systems with time-varying output constraints.,"In this paper, adaptive neural control is investigated for a class of unknown multiple-input multiple-output nonlinear systems with time-varying asymmetric output constraints. To ensure constraint satisfaction, we employ a system transformation technique to transform the original constrained (in the sense of the output restrictions) system into an equivalent unconstrained one, whose stability is sufficient to solve the output constraint problem. It is shown that output tracking is achieved without violation of the output constraint. More specifically, we can shape the system performance arbitrarily on transient and steady-state stages with the output evolving in predefined time-varying boundaries all the time. A single neural network, whose weights are tuned online, is used in our design to approximate the unknown functions in the system dynamics, while the singularity problem of the control coefficient matrix is avoided without assumption on the prior knowledge of control input's bound. All the signals in the closed-loop system are proved to be semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded via Lyapunov synthesis. Finally, the merits of the proposed controller are verified in the simulation environment.",4
Learning to track multiple targets.,"Monocular multiple-object tracking is a fundamental yet under-addressed computer vision problem. In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework for tracking multiple objects by detection. First, instead of heuristically defining a tracking algorithm, we learn that a discriminative structure prediction model from labeled video data captures the interdependence of multiple influence factors. Given the joint targets state from the last time step and the observation at the current frame, the joint targets state at the current time step can then be inferred by maximizing the joint probability score. Second, our detection results benefit from tracking cues. The traditional detection algorithms need a nonmaximal suppression postprocessing to select a subset from the total detection responses as the final output and a large number of selection mistakes are induced, especially under a congested circumstance. Our method integrates both detection and tracking cues. This integration helps to decrease the postprocessing mistake risk and to improve performance in tracking. Finally, we formulate the entire model training into a convex optimization problem and estimate its parameters using the cutting plane optimization. Experiments show that our method performs effectively in a large variety of scenarios, including pedestrian tracking in crowd scenes and vehicle tracking in congested traffic.",4
A new method for data stream mining based on the misclassification error.,"In this paper, a new method for constructing decision trees for stream data is proposed. First a new splitting criterion based on the misclassification error is derived. A theorem is proven showing that the best attribute computed in considered node according to the available data sample is the same, with some high probability, as the attribute derived from the whole infinite data stream. Next this result is combined with the splitting criterion based on the Gini index. It is shown that such combination provides the highest accuracy among all studied algorithms.",4
A one-class kernel fisher criterion for outlier detection.,"Recently, Dufrenois and Noyer proposed a one class Fisher's linear discriminant to isolate normal data from outliers. In this paper, a kernelized version of their criterion is presented. Originally on the basis of an iterative optimization process, alternating between subspace selection and clustering, I show here that their criterion has an upper bound making these two problems independent. In particular, the estimation of the label vector is formulated as an unconstrained binary linear problem (UBLP) which can be solved using an iterative perturbation method. Once the label vector is estimated, an optimal projection subspace is obtained by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem. Like many other kernel methods, the performance of the proposed approach depends on the choice of the kernel. Constructed with a Gaussian kernel, I show that the proposed contrast measure is an efficient indicator for selecting an optimal kernel width. This property simplifies the model selection problem which is typically solved by costly (generalized) cross-validation procedures. Initialization, convergence analysis, and computational complexity are also discussed. Lastly, the proposed algorithm is compared with recent novelty detectors on synthetic and real data sets.",4
Minimizing nearest neighbor classification error for nonparametric dimension reduction.,"In this brief, we show that minimizing nearest neighbor classification error (MNNE) is a favorable criterion for supervised linear dimension reduction (SLDR). We prove that MNNE is better than maximizing mutual information in the sense of being a proxy of the Bayes optimal criterion. Based on kernel density estimation, we derive a nonparametric algorithm for MNNE. Experiments on benchmark data sets show the superiority of MNNE over existing nonparametric SLDR methods.",4
Simulating dynamic plastic continuous neural networks by finite elements.,"We introduce dynamic plastic continuous neural network (DPCNN), which is comprised of neurons distributed in a nonlinear plastic medium where wire-like connections of neural networks are replaced with the continuous medium. We use finite element method to model the dynamic phenomenon of information processing within the DPCNNs. During the training, instead of weights, the properties of the continuous material at its different locations and some properties of neurons are modified. Input and output can be vectors and/or continuous functions over lines and/or areas. Delay and feedback from neurons to themselves and from outputs occur in the DPCNNs. We model a simple form of the DPCNN where the medium is a rectangular plate of bilinear material, and the neurons continuously fire a signal, which is a function of the horizontal displacement.",4
A minimum resource neural network framework for solving multiconstraint shortest path problems.,"Characterized by using minimum hard (structural) and soft (computational) resources, a novel parameter-free minimal resource neural network (MRNN) framework is proposed for solving a wide range of single-source shortest path (SP) problems for various graph types. The problems are the k-shortest time path problems with any combination of three constraints: time, hop, and label constraints, and the graphs can be directed, undirected, or bidirected with symmetric and/or asymmetric traversal time, which can be real and time dependent. Isomorphic to the graph where the SP is to be sought, the network is activated by generating autowave at source neuron and the autowave travels automatically along the paths with the speed of a hop in an iteration. Properties of the network are studied, algorithms are presented, and computation complexity is analyzed. The framework guarantees globally optimal solutions of a series of problems during the iteration process of the network, which provides insight into why even the SP is still too long to be satisfied. The network facilitates very large scale integrated circuit implementation and adapt to very large scale problems due to its massively parallel processing and minimum resource utilization. When implemented in a sequentially processing computer, experiments on synthetic graphs, road maps of cities of the USA, and vehicle routing with time windows indicate that the MRNN is especially efficient for large scale sparse graphs and even dense graphs with some constraints, e.g., the CPU time taken and the iteration number used for the road maps of cities of the USA is even less than approximately 2% and 0.5% that of the Dijkstra's algorithm.",4
On the complexity of neural network classifiers: a comparison between shallow and deep architectures.,"Recently, researchers in the artificial neural network field have focused their attention on connectionist models composed by several hidden layers. In fact, experimental results and heuristic considerations suggest that deep architectures are more suitable than shallow ones for modern applications, facing very complex problems, e.g., vision and human language understanding. However, the actual theoretical results supporting such a claim are still few and incomplete. In this paper, we propose a new approach to study how the depth of feedforward neural networks impacts on their ability in implementing high complexity functions. First, a new measure based on topological concepts is introduced, aimed at evaluating the complexity of the function implemented by a neural network, used for classification purposes. Then, deep and shallow neural architectures with common sigmoidal activation functions are compared, by deriving upper and lower bounds on their complexity, and studying how the complexity depends on the number of hidden units and the used activation function. The obtained results seem to support the idea that deep networks actually implements functions of higher complexity, so that they are able, with the same number of resources, to address more difficult problems.",4
Modified principal component analysis: an integration of multiple similarity subspace models.,"We modify the conventional principal component analysis (PCA) and propose a novel subspace learning framework, modified PCA (MPCA), using multiple similarity measurements. MPCA computes three similarity matrices exploiting the similarity measurements: 1) mutual information; 2) angle information; and 3) Gaussian kernel similarity. We employ the eigenvectors of similarity matrices to produce new subspaces, referred to as similarity subspaces. A new integrated similarity subspace is then generated using a novel feature selection approach. This approach needs to construct a kind of vector set, termed weak machine cell (WMC), which contains an appropriate number of the eigenvectors spanning the similarity subspaces. Combining the wrapper method and the forward selection scheme, MPCA selects a WMC at a time that has a powerful discriminative capability to classify samples. MPCA is very suitable for the application scenarios in which the number of the training samples is less than the data dimensionality. MPCA outperforms the other state-of-the-art PCA-based methods in terms of both classification accuracy and clustering result. In addition, MPCA can be applied to face image reconstruction. MPCA can use other types of similarity measurements. Extensive experiments on many popular real-world data sets, such as face databases, show that MPCA achieves desirable classification results, as well as has a powerful capability to represent data.",4
Instance-level constraint-based semisupervised learning with imposed space-partitioning.,"A new method for semisupervised learning from pairwise sample (must- and cannot-link) constraints is introduced. It addresses an important limitation of many existing methods, whose solutions do not achieve effective propagation of the constraint information to unconstrained samples. We overcome this limitation by constraining the solution to comport with a smooth (soft) class partition of the feature space, which necessarily entails constraint propagation and generalization to unconstrained samples. This is achieved via a parameterized mean-field approximation to the posterior distribution over component assignments, with the parameterization chosen to match the representation power of the chosen (generative) mixture density family. Unlike many existing methods, our method flexibly models classes using a variable number of components, which allows it to learn complex class boundaries. Also, unlike most of the methods, ours estimates the number of latent classes present in the data. Experiments on synthetic data and data sets from the UC Irvine machine learning repository show that, overall, our method achieves significant improvements in classification performance compared with the existing methods.",4
Distributed neural network control for adaptive synchronization of uncertain dynamical multiagent systems.,"This paper addresses the leader-follower synchronization problem of uncertain dynamical multiagent systems with nonlinear dynamics. Distributed adaptive synchronization controllers are proposed based on the state information of neighboring agents. The control design is developed for both undirected and directed communication topologies without requiring the accurate model of each agent. This result is further extended to the output feedback case where a neighborhood observer is proposed based on relative output information of neighboring agents. Then, distributed observer-based synchronization controllers are derived and a parameter-dependent Riccati inequality is employed to prove the stability. This design has a favorable decouple property between the observer and the controller designs for nonlinear multiagent systems. For both cases, the developed controllers guarantee that the state of each agent synchronizes to that of the leader with bounded residual errors. Two illustrative examples validate the efficacy of the proposed methods.",4
Cooperative tracking control of nonlinear multiagent systems using self-structuring neural networks.,"This paper considers a cooperative tracking problem for a group of nonlinear multiagent systems under a directed graph that characterizes the interaction between the leader and the followers. All the networked systems can have different dynamics and all the dynamics are unknown. A neural network (NN) with flexible structure is used to approximate the unknown dynamics at each node. Considering that the leader is a neighbor of only a subset of the followers and the followers have only local interactions, we introduce a cooperative dynamic observer at each node to overcome the deficiency of the traditional tracking control strategies. An observer-based cooperative controller design framework is proposed with the aid of graph tools, Lyapunov-based design method, self-structuring NN, and separation principle. It is proved that each agent can follow the active leader only if the communication graph contains a spanning tree. Simulation results on networked robots are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithms.",4
Global sensitivity analysis approach for input selection and system identification purposes--a new framework for feedforward neural networks.,"A new algorithm for the selection of input variables of neural network is proposed. This new method, applied after the training stage, ranks the inputs according to their importance in the variance of the model output. The use of a global sensitivity analysis technique, extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test, gives the total sensitivity index for each variable, which allows for the ranking and the removal of the less relevant inputs. Applied to some benchmarking problems in the field of features selection, the proposed approach shows good agreement in keeping the relevant variables. This new method is a useful tool for removing superfluous inputs and for system identification.",4
On the capabilities and computational costs of neuron models.,"We review the Hodgkin-Huxley, Izhikevich, and leaky integrate-and-fire neuron models in regular spiking modes solved with the forward Euler, fourth-order Runge-Kutta, and exponential Euler methods and determine the necessary time steps and corresponding computational costs required to make the solutions accurate. We conclude that the leaky integrate-and-fire needs the least number of computations, and that the Hodgkin-Huxley and Izhikevich models are comparable in computational cost.",4
Contact-force distribution optimization and control for quadruped robots using both gradient and adaptive neural networks.,"This paper investigates optimal feet forces' distribution and control of quadruped robots under external disturbance forces. First, we formulate a constrained dynamics of quadruped robots and derive a reduced-order dynamical model of motion/force. Consider an external wrench on quadruped robots; the distribution of required forces and moments on the supporting legs of a quadruped robot is handled as a tip-point force distribution and used to equilibrate the external wrench. Then, a gradient neural network is adopted to deal with the optimized objective function formulated as to minimize this quadratic objective function subjected to linear equality and inequality constraints. For the obtained optimized tip-point force and the motion of legs, we propose the hybrid motion/force control based on an adaptive neural network to compensate for the perturbations in the environment and approximate feedforward force and impedance of the leg joints. The proposed control can confront the uncertainties including approximation error and external perturbation. The verification of the proposed control is conducted using a simulation.",4
Efficient kernel sparse coding via first-order smooth optimization.,"We consider the problem of dictionary learning and sparse coding, where the task is to find a concise set of basis vectors that accurately represent the observation data with only small numbers of active bases. Typically formulated as an L1-regularized least-squares problem, the problem incurs computational difficulty originating from the nondifferentiable objective. Recent approaches to sparse coding thus have mainly focused on acceleration of the learning algorithm. In this paper, we propose an even more efficient and scalable sparse coding algorithm based on the first-order smooth optimization technique. The algorithm finds the theoretically guaranteed optimal sparse codes of the epsilon-approximate problem in a series of optimization subproblems, where each subproblem admits analytic solution, hence very fast and scalable with large-scale data. We further extend it to nonlinear sparse coding using kernel trick by showing that the representer theorem holds for the kernel sparse coding problem. This allows us to apply dual optimization, which essentially results in the same linear sparse coding problem in dual variables, highly beneficial compared with the existing methods that suffer from local minima and restricted forms of kernel function. The efficiency of our algorithms is demonstrated for natural stimuli data sets and several image classification problems.",4
Extensions of kmeans-type algorithms: a new clustering framework by integrating intracluster compactness and intercluster separation.,"Kmeans-type clustering aims at partitioning a data set into clusters such that the objects in a cluster are compact and the objects in different clusters are well separated. However, most kmeans-type clustering algorithms rely on only intracluster compactness while overlooking intercluster separation. In this paper, a series of new clustering algorithms by extending the existing kmeans-type algorithms is proposed by integrating both intracluster compactness and intercluster separation. First, a set of new objective functions for clustering is developed. Based on these objective functions, the corresponding updating rules for the algorithms are then derived analytically. The properties and performances of these algorithms are investigated on several synthetic and real-life data sets. Experimental studies demonstrate that our proposed algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art kmeans-type clustering algorithms with respect to four metrics: accuracy, RandIndex, Fscore, and normal mutual information.",4
GMM-based intermediate matching kernel for classification of varying length patterns of long duration speech using support vector machines.,"Dynamic kernel (DK)-based support vector machines are used for the classification of varying length patterns. This paper explores the use of intermediate matching kernel (IMK) as a DK for classification of varying length patterns of long duration speech represented as sets of feature vectors. The main issue in construction of IMK is the choice for the set of virtual feature vectors used to select the local feature vectors for matching. This paper proposes to use components of class-independent Gaussian mixture model (CIGMM) as a representation for the set of virtual feature vectors. For every component of CIGMM, a local feature vector each from the two sets of local feature vectors that has the highest probability of belonging to that component is selected and a base kernel is computed between the selected local feature vectors. The IMK is computed as the sum of all the base kernels corresponding to different components of CIGMM. It is proposed to use the responsibility term weighted base kernels in computation of IMK to improve its discrimination ability. This paper also proposes the posterior probability weighted DKs (including the proposed IMKs) to improve their classification performance and reduce the number of support vectors. The performance of the support vector machine (SVM)-based classifiers using the proposed IMKs is studied for speech emotion recognition and speaker identification tasks and compared with that of the SVM-based classifiers using the state-of-the-art DKs.",4
Sparse multivariate gaussian mixture regression.,"Fitting a multivariate Gaussian mixture to data represents an attractive, as well as challenging problem, in especial when sparsity in the solution is demanded. Achieving this objective requires the concurrent update of all parameters (weight, centers, and precisions) of all multivariate Gaussian functions during the learning process. Such is the focus of this paper, which presents a novel method founded on the minimization of the error of the generalized logarithmic utility function (GLUF). This choice, which allows us to move smoothly from the mean square error (MSE) criterion to the one based on the logarithmic error, yields an optimization problem that resembles a locally convex problem and can be solved with a quasi-Newton method. The GLUF framework also facilitates the comparative study between both extremes, concluding that the classical MSE optimization is not the most adequate for the task. The performance of the proposed novel technique is demonstrated on simulated as well as realistic scenarios.",4
Kernel association for classification and prediction: a survey.,"Kernel association (KA) in statistical pattern recognition used for classification and prediction have recently emerged in a machine learning and signal processing context. This survey outlines the latest trends and innovations of a kernel framework for big data analysis. KA topics include offline learning, distributed database, online learning, and its prediction. The structural presentation and the comprehensive list of references are geared to provide a useful overview of this evolving field for both specialists and relevant scholars.",4
Robust sensorimotor representation to physical interaction changes in humanoid motion learning.,"This paper proposes a learning from demonstration system based on a motion feature, called phase transfer sequence. The system aims to synthesize the knowledge on humanoid whole body motions learned during teacher-supported interactions, and apply this knowledge during different physical interactions between a robot and its surroundings. The phase transfer sequence represents the temporal order of the changing points in multiple time sequences. It encodes the dynamical aspects of the sequences so as to absorb the gaps in timing and amplitude derived from interaction changes. The phase transfer sequence was evaluated in reinforcement learning of sitting-up and walking motions conducted by a real humanoid robot and compatible simulator. In both tasks, the robotic motions were less dependent on physical interactions when learned by the proposed feature than by conventional similarity measurements. Phase transfer sequence also enhanced the convergence speed of motion learning. Our proposed feature is original primarily because it absorbs the gaps caused by changes of the originally acquired physical interactions, thereby enhancing the learning speed in subsequent interactions.",4
Transfer learning for visual categorization: a survey.,"Regular machine learning and data mining techniques study the training data for future inferences under a major assumption that the future data are within the same feature space or have the same distribution as the training data. However, due to the limited availability of human labeled training data, training data that stay in the same feature space or have the same distribution as the future data cannot be guaranteed to be sufficient enough to avoid the over-fitting problem. In real-world applications, apart from data in the target domain, related data in a different domain can also be included to expand the availability of our prior knowledge about the target future data. Transfer learning addresses such cross-domain learning problems by extracting useful information from data in a related domain and transferring them for being used in target tasks. In recent years, with transfer learning being applied to visual categorization, some typical problems, e.g., view divergence in action recognition tasks and concept drifting in image classification tasks, can be efficiently solved. In this paper, we survey state-of-the-art transfer learning algorithms in visual categorization applications, such as object recognition, image classification, and human action recognition.",4
GrDHP: a general utility function representation for dual heuristic dynamic programming.,"A general utility function representation is proposed to provide the required derivable and adjustable utility function for the dual heuristic dynamic programming (DHP) design. Goal representation DHP (GrDHP) is presented with a goal network being on top of the traditional DHP design. This goal network provides a general mapping between the system states and the derivatives of the utility function. With this proposed architecture, we can obtain the required derivatives of the utility function directly from the goal network. In addition, instead of a fixed predefined utility function in literature, we conduct an online learning process for the goal network so that the derivatives of the utility function can be adaptively tuned over time. We provide the control performance of both the proposed GrDHP and the traditional DHP approaches under the same environment and parameter settings. The statistical simulation results and the snapshot of the system variables are presented to demonstrate the improved learning and controlling performance. We also apply both approaches to a power system example to further demonstrate the control capabilities of the GrDHP approach.",4
An efficient topological distance-based tree kernel.,"Tree kernels proposed in the literature rarely use information about the relative location of the substructures within a tree. As this type of information is orthogonal to the one commonly exploited by tree kernels, the two can be combined to enhance state-of-the-art accuracy of tree kernels. In this brief, our attention is focused on subtree kernels. We describe an efficient algorithm for injecting positional information into a tree kernel and present ways to enlarge its feature space without affecting its worst case complexity. The experimental results on several benchmark datasets are presented showing that our method is able to reach state-of-the-art performances, obtaining in some cases better performance than computationally more demanding tree kernels.",4
Evolutionary fuzzy ARTMAP neural networks for classification of semiconductor defects.,"Wafer defect detection using an intelligent system is an approach of quality improvement in semiconductor manufacturing that aims to enhance its process stability, increase production capacity, and improve yields. Occasionally, only few records that indicate defective units are available and they are classified as a minority group in a large database. Such a situation leads to an imbalanced data set problem, wherein it engenders a great challenge to deal with by applying machine-learning techniques for obtaining effective solution. In addition, the database may comprise overlapping samples of different classes. This paper introduces two models of evolutionary fuzzy ARTMAP (FAM) neural networks to deal with the imbalanced data set problems in a semiconductor manufacturing operations. In particular, both the FAM models and hybrid genetic algorithms are integrated in the proposed evolutionary artificial neural networks (EANNs) to classify an imbalanced data set. In addition, one of the proposed EANNs incorporates a facility to learn overlapping samples of different classes from the imbalanced data environment. The classification results of the proposed evolutionary FAM neural networks are presented, compared, and analyzed using several classification metrics. The outcomes positively indicate the effectiveness of the proposed networks in handling classification problems with imbalanced data sets.",4
Nonsmooth ICA contrast minimization using a Riemannian Nelder-Mead method.,"This brief concerns the design and application of a Riemannian Nelder-Mead algorithm to minimize a Hartley-entropybased contrast function to reliably estimate the sources from their mixtures. Despite its nondifferentiability, the contrast function is endowed with attractive properties such as discriminacy, and hence warrants an effort to be effectively handled by a derivative-free optimizer. Aside from tailoring the Nelder-Mead technique to the constraint set, namely, oblique manifold, the source separation results attained in an empirical study with quasi-correlated synthetic signals and digital images are presented, which favor the proposed method on a comparative basis.",4
Multiclass support vector machines with example-dependent costs applied to plankton biomass estimation.,"In many applications, the mistakes made by an automatic classifier are not equal, they have different costs. These problems may be solved using a cost-sensitive learning approach. The main idea is not to minimize the number of errors, but the total cost produced by such mistakes. This brief presents a new multiclass cost-sensitive algorithm, in which each example has attached its corresponding misclassification cost. Our proposal is theoretically well-founded and is designed to optimize cost-sensitive loss functions. This research was motivated by a real-world problem, the biomass estimation of several plankton taxonomic groups. In this particular application, our method improves the performance of traditional multiclass classification approaches that optimize the accuracy.",4
Multilabel classification using error-correcting codes of hard or soft bits.,"We formulate a framework for applying error-correcting codes (ECCs) on multilabel classification problems. The framework treats some base learners as noisy channels and uses ECC to correct the prediction errors made by the learners. The framework immediately leads to a novel ECC-based explanation of the popular random k-label sets (RAKEL) algorithm using a simple repetition ECC. With the framework, we empirically compare a broad spectrum of off-the-shelf ECC designs for multilabel classification. The results not only demonstrate that RAKEL can be improved by applying some stronger ECC, but also show that the traditional binary relevance approach can be enhanced by learning more parity-checking labels. Our research on different ECCs also helps to understand the tradeoff between the strength of ECC and the hardness of the base learning tasks. Furthermore, we extend our research to ECC with either hard (binary) or soft (real-valued) bits by designing a novel decoder. We demonstrate that the decoder improves the performance of our framework.",4
Pseudo-orthogonalization of memory patterns for associative memory.,"A new method for improving the storage capacity of associative memory models on a neural network is proposed. The storage capacity of the network increases in proportion to the network size in the case of random patterns, but, in general, the capacity suffers from correlation among memory patterns. Numerous solutions to this problem have been proposed so far, but their high computational cost limits their scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel and simple solution that is locally computable without any iteration. Our method involves XNOR masking of the original memory patterns with random patterns, and the masked patterns and masks are concatenated. The resulting decorrelated patterns allow higher storage capacity at the cost of the pattern length. Furthermore, the increase in the pattern length can be reduced through blockwise masking, which results in a small amount of capacity loss. Movie replay and image recognition are presented as examples to demonstrate the scalability of the proposed method.",4
Transfer ordinal label learning.,"Designing a classifier in the absence of labeled data is becoming a common encounter as the acquisition of informative labels is often difficult or expensive, particularly on new uncharted target domains. The feasibility of attaining a reliable classifier for the task of interest is embarked by some in transfer learning, where label information from relevant source domains is considered for complimenting the design process. The core challenge arising from such endeavors, however, is the induction of source sample selection bias, such that the trained classifier has the tendency of steering toward the distribution of the source domain. In addition, this bias is deemed to become more severe on data involving multiple classes. Considering this cue, our interest in this paper is to address such a challenge in the target domain, where ordinal labeled data are unavailable. In contrast to the previous works, we propose a transfer ordinal label learning paradigm to predict the ordinal labels of target unlabeled data by spanning the feasible solution space with ensemble of ordinal classifiers from the multiple relevant source domains. Specifically, the maximum margin criterion is considered here for the construction of the target classifier from an ensemble of source ordinal classifiers. Theoretical analysis and extensive empirical studies on real-world data sets are presented to study the benefits of the proposed method.",4
Online learning of a Dirichlet process mixture of Beta-Liouville distributions via variational inference.,"A large class of problems can be formulated in terms of the clustering process. Mixture models are an increasingly important tool in statistical pattern recognition and for analyzing and clustering complex data. Two challenging aspects that should be addressed when considering mixture models are how to choose between a set of plausible models and how to estimate the model's parameters. In this paper, we address both problems simultaneously within a unified online nonparametric Bayesian framework that we develop to learn a Dirichlet process mixture of Beta-Liouville distributions (i.e., an infinite Beta-Liouville mixture model). The proposed infinite model is used for the online modeling and clustering of proportional data for which the Beta-Liouville mixture has been shown to be effective. We propose a principled approach for approximating the intractable model's posterior distribution by a tractable one-which we develop-such that all the involved mixture's parameters can be estimated simultaneously and effectively in a closed form. This is done through variational inference that enjoys important advantages, such as handling of unobserved attributes and preventing under or overfitting; we explain that in detail. The effectiveness of the proposed work is evaluated on three challenging real applications, namely facial expression recognition, behavior modeling and recognition, and dynamic textures clustering.",4
Negative correlation ensemble learning for ordinal regression.,"In this paper, two neural network threshold ensemble models are proposed for ordinal regression problems. For the first ensemble method, the thresholds are fixed a priori and are not modified during training. The second one considers the thresholds of each member of the ensemble as free parameters, allowing their modification during the training process. This is achieved through a reformulation of these tunable thresholds, which avoids the constraints they must fulfill for the ordinal regression problem. During training, diversity exists in different projections generated by each member is taken into account for the parameter updating. This diversity is promoted in an explicit way using a diversity-encouraging error function, extending the well-known negative correlation learning framework to the area of ordinal regression, and inheriting many of its good properties. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can achieve competitive generalization performance when considering four ordinal regression metrics.",4
Hierarchical similarity transformations between Gaussian mixtures.,"In this paper, we propose a method to estimate the density of a data space represented by a geometric transformation of an initial Gaussian mixture model. The geometric transformation is hierarchical, and it is decomposed into two steps. At first, the initial model is assumed to undergo a global similarity transformation modeled by translation, rotation, and scaling of the model components. Then, to increase the degrees of freedom of the model and allow it to capture fine data structures, each individual mixture component may be transformed by another, local similarity transformation, whose parameters are distinct for each component of the mixture. In addition, to constrain the order of magnitude of the local transformation (LT) with respect to the global transformation (GT), zero-mean Gaussian priors are imposed onto the local parameters. The estimation of both GT and LT parameters is obtained through the expectation maximization framework. Experiments on artificial data are conducted to evaluate the proposed model, with varying data dimensionality, number of model components, and transformation parameters. In addition, the method is evaluated using real data from a speech recognition task. The obtained results show a high model accuracy and demonstrate the potential application of the proposed method to similar classification problems.",4
Nonlinear systems identification and control via dynamic multitime scales neural networks.,"This paper deals with the adaptive nonlinear identification and trajectory tracking via dynamic multilayer neural network (NN) with different timescales. Two NN identifiers are proposed for nonlinear systems identification via dynamic NNs with different timescales including both fast and slow phenomenon. The first NN identifier uses the output signals from the actual system for the system identification. In the second NN identifier, all the output signals from nonlinear system are replaced with the state variables of the NNs. The online identification algorithms for both NN identifier parameters are proposed using Lyapunov function and singularly perturbed techniques. With the identified NN models, two indirect adaptive NN controllers for the nonlinear systems containing slow and fast dynamic processes are developed. For both developed adaptive NN controllers, the trajectory errors are analyzed and the stability of the systems is proved. Simulation results show that the controller based on the second identifier has better performance than that of the first identifier.",4
Finding potential support vectors in separable classification problems.,"This paper considers the classification problem using support vector (SV) machines and investigates how to maximally reduce the size of the training set without losing information. Under separable data set assumptions, we derive the exact conditions stating which observations can be discarded without diminishing the overall information content. For this purpose, we introduce the concept of potential SVs, i.e., those data that can become SVs when future data become available. To complement this, we also characterize the set of discardable vectors (DVs), i.e., those data that, given the current data set, can never become SVs. Thus, these vectors are useless for future training purposes and can eventually be removed without loss of information. Then, we provide an efficient algorithm based on linear programming that returns the potential and DVs by constructing a simplex tableau. Finally, we compare it with alternative algorithms available in the literature on some synthetic data as well as on data sets from standard repositories.",4
A new discrete-continuous algorithm for radial basis function networks construction.,"The construction of a radial basis function (RBF) network involves the determination of the model size, hidden nodes, and output weights. Least squares-based subset selection methods can determine a RBF model size and its parameters simultaneously. Although these methods are robust, they may not achieve optimal results. Alternatively, gradient methods are widely used to optimize all the parameters. The drawback is that most algorithms may converge slowly as they treat hidden nodes and output weights separately and ignore their correlations. In this paper, a new discrete-continuous algorithm is proposed for the construction of a RBF model. First, the orthogonal least squares (OLS)-based forward stepwise selection constructs an initial model by selecting model terms one by one from a candidate term pool. Then a new Levenberg-Marquardt (LM)-based parameter optimization is proposed to further optimize the hidden nodes and output weights in the continuous space. To speed up the convergence, the proposed parameter optimization method considers the correlation between the hidden nodes and output weights, which is achieved by translating the output weights to dependent parameters using the OLS method. The correlation is also used by the previously proposed continuous forward algorithm (CFA). However, unlike the CFA, the new method optimizes all the parameters simultaneously. In addition, an equivalent recursive sum of squared error is derived to reduce the computation demanding for the first derivatives used in the LM method. Computational complexity is given to confirm the new method is much more computationally efficient than the CFA. Different numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Further, Friedman statistical tests on 13 classification problems are performed, and the results demonstrate that RBF networks built by the new method are very competitive in comparison with some popular classifiers.",4
Neural network approaches for noisy language modeling.,"Text entry from people is not only grammatical and distinct, but also noisy. For example, a user's typing stream contains all the information about the user's interaction with computer using a QWERTY keyboard, which may include the user's typing mistakes as well as specific vocabulary, typing habit, and typing performance. In particular, these features are obvious in disabled users' typing streams. This paper proposes a new concept called noisy language modeling by further developing information theory and applies neural networks to one of its specific application-typing stream. This paper experimentally uses a neural network approach to analyze the disabled users' typing streams both in general and specific ways to identify their typing behaviors and subsequently, to make typing predictions and typing corrections. In this paper, a focused time-delay neural network (FTDNN) language model, a time gap model, a prediction model based on time gap, and a probabilistic neural network model (PNN) are developed. A 38% first hitting rate (HR) and a 53% first three HR in symbol prediction are obtained based on the analysis of a user's typing history through the FTDNN language modeling, while the modeling results using the time gap prediction model and the PNN model demonstrate that the correction rates lie predominantly in between 65% and 90% with the current testing samples, and 70% of all test scores above basic correction rates, respectively. The modeling process demonstrates that a neural network is a suitable and robust language modeling tool to analyze the noisy language stream. The research also paves the way for practical application development in areas such as informational analysis, text prediction, and error correction by providing a theoretical basis of neural network approaches for noisy language modeling.",4
Safety-aware semi-supervised classification.,"Though semi-supervised classification learning has attracted great attention over past decades, semi-supervised classification methods may show worse performance than their supervised counterparts in some cases, consequently reducing their confidence in real applications. Naturally, it is desired to develop a safe semi-supervised classification method that never performs worse than the supervised counterparts. However, to the best of our knowledge, few researches have been devoted to safe semi-supervised classification. To address this problem, in this paper, we invent a safety-control mechanism for safe semi-supervised classification by adaptive tradeoff between semi-supervised and supervised classification in terms of unlabeled data. In implementation, based on our recent semi-supervised classification method based on class memberships (SSCCM), we develop a safety-aware SSCCM (SA-SSCCM). SA-SSCCM, on the one hand, exploits the unlabeled data to help learning (as SSCCM does) under the assumption that unlabeled data can help learning, and on the other hand, restricts its prediction to approach that of its supervised counterpart least-square support vector machine (LS-SVM) under the assumption that unlabeled data can hurt learning. Therefore, prediction by SA-SSCCM becomes a tradeoff between those by semi-supervised SSCCM and supervised LS-SVM, respectively, in terms of the unlabeled data. As in SSCCM, the optimization problem in SA-SSCCM can be efficiently solved by the alternating iterative strategy, and the iteration convergence can theoretically be guaranteed. Experiments over several real datasets show the promising performance of SA-SSCCM compared with LS-SVM, SSCCM, and off-the-shelf safe semi-supervised classification methods.",4
Multistability of two kinds of recurrent neural networks with activation functions symmetrical about the origin on the phase plane.,"In this paper, we investigate multistability of two kinds of recurrent neural networks with time-varying delays and activation functions symmetrical about the origin on the phase plane. One kind of activation function is with zero slope at the origin on the phase plane, while the other is with nonzero slope at the origin on the phase plane. We derive sufficient conditions under which these two kinds of n-dimensional recurrent neural networks are guaranteed to have (2m+1)(n) equilibrium points, with (m+1)(n) of them being locally exponentially stable. These new conditions improve and extend the existing multistability results for recurrent neural networks. Finally, the validity and performance of the theoretical results are demonstrated through two numerical examples.",4
On the SVMpath singularity.,"This paper proposes a novel ridge-adding-based approach for handling singularities that are frequently encountered in the powerful SVMpath algorithm. Unlike the existing method that performs linear programming as an additional step to track the optimality condition path in a multidimensional feasible space, our new approach provides a simpler and computationally more efficient implementation, which needs no extra time-consuming procedures other than introducing a random ridge term to each data point. Contrary to the existing ridge-adding method, which fails to avoid singularities as the ridge terms tend to zero, our novel approach, for any small random ridge terms, guarantees the existence of the inverse matrix by ensuring that only one index is added into or removed from the active set. The performance of the proposed algorithm, in terms of both computational complexity and the ability of singularity avoidance, is manifested by rigorous mathematical analyses as well as experimental results.",4
Single-channel blind separation using pseudo-stereo mixture and complex 2-D histogram.,"A novel single-channel blind source separation (SCBSS) algorithm is presented. The proposed algorithm yields at least three benefits of the SCBSS solution: 1) resemblance of a stereo signal concept given by one microphone; 2) independent of initialization and a priori knowledge of the sources; and 3) it does not require iterative optimization. The separation process consists of two steps: 1) estimation of source characteristics, where the source signals are modeled by the autoregressive process and 2) construction of masks using only the single-channel mixture. A new pseudo-stereo mixture is formulated by weighting and time-shifting the original single-channel mixture. This creates an artificial mixing system whose parameters will be estimated through our proposed weighted complex 2-D histogram. In this paper, we derive the separability of the proposed mixture model. Conditions required for unique mask construction based on maximum likelihood are also identified. Finally, experimental testing on both synthetic and real-audio sources is conducted to verify that the proposed algorithm yields superior performance and is computationally very fast compared with existing methods.",4
Error surface of recurrent neural networks.,"We found in previous work that the error surfaces of recurrent networks have spurious valleys that can cause significant difficulties in training these networks. Our earlier work focused on single-layer networks. In this paper, we extend the previous results to general layered digital dynamic networks. We describe two types of spurious valleys that appear in the error surfaces of these networks. These valleys are not affected by the desired network output (or by the problem that the network is trying to solve). They depend only on the input sequence and the architecture of the network. The insights gained from this analysis suggest procedures for improving the training of recurrent neural networks.",4
New algebraic criteria for synchronization stability of chaotic memristive neural networks with time-varying delays.,"In this brief, we consider the exponential synchronization of chaotic memristive neural networks with time-varying delays using the Lyapunov functional method and inequality technique. The dynamic analysis here employs the theory of differential equations with discontinuous right-hand side as introduced by Filippov. The designing laws in the synchronization of neural networks are proposed via state or output coupling. In addition, the new proposed algebraic criteria are very easy to verify, and they also enrich and improve the earlier publications. Finally, an example is given to show the effectiveness of the obtained results.",4
EEG-based learning system for online motion sickness level estimation in a dynamic vehicle environment.,"Motion sickness is a common experience for many people. Several previous researches indicated that motion sickness has a negative effect on driving performance and sometimes leads to serious traffic accidents because of a decline in a person's ability to maintain self-control. This safety issue has motivated us to find a way to prevent vehicle accidents. Our target was to determine a set of valid motion sickness indicators that would predict the occurrence of a person's motion sickness as soon as possible. A successful method for the early detection of motion sickness will help us to construct a cognitive monitoring system. Such a monitoring system can alert people before they become sick and prevent them from being distracted by various motion sickness symptoms while driving or riding in a car. In our past researches, we investigated the physiological changes that occur during the transition of a passenger's cognitive state using electroencephalography (EEG) power spectrum analysis, and we found that the EEG power responses in the left and right motors, parietal, lateral occipital, and occipital midline brain areas were more highly correlated to subjective sickness levels than other brain areas. In this paper, we propose the use of a self-organizing neural fuzzy inference network (SONFIN) to estimate a driver's/passenger's sickness level based on EEG features that have been extracted online from five motion sickness-related brain areas, while either in real or virtual vehicle environments. The results show that our proposed learning system is capable of extracting a set of valid motion sickness indicators that originated from EEG dynamics, and through SONFIN, a neuro-fuzzy prediction model, we successfully translated the set of motion sickness indicators into motion sickness levels. The overall performance of this proposed EEG-based learning system can achieve an average prediction accuracy of ~82%.",4
A robust elicitation algorithm for discovering DNA motifs using fuzzy self-organizing maps.,"It is important to identify DNA motifs in promoter regions to understand the mechanism of gene regulation. Computational approaches for finding DNA motifs are well recognized as useful tools to biologists, which greatly help in saving experimental time and cost in wet laboratories. Self-organizing maps (SOMs), as a powerful clustering tool, have demonstrated good potential for problem solving. However, the current SOM-based motif discovery algorithms unfairly treat data samples lying around the cluster boundaries by assigning them to one of the nodes, which may result in unreliable system performance. This paper aims to develop a robust framework for discovering DNA motifs, where fuzzy SOMs, with an integration of fuzzy c-means membership functions and a standard batch-learning scheme, are employed to extract putative motifs with varying length in a recursive manner. Experimental results on eight real datasets show that our proposed algorithm outperforms the other searching tools such as SOMBRERO, SOMEA, MEME, AlignACE, and WEEDER in terms of the F-measure and algorithm reliability. It is observed that a remarkable 24.6% improvement can be achieved compared to the state-of-the-art SOMBRERO. Furthermore, our algorithm can produce a 20% and 6.6% improvement over SOMBRERO and SOMEA, respectively, in finding multiple motifs on five artificial datasets.",4
Tracking algorithms for multiagent systems.,"This paper is devoted to the consensus tracking issue on multiagent systems. Instead of enabling the networked agents to reach an agreement asymptotically as the time tends to infinity, the consensus tracking between agents is considered to be derived on a finite time interval as accurately as possible. We thus propose a learning algorithm with a gain operator to be determined. If the gain operator is designed in the form of a polynomial expression, a necessary and sufficient condition is obtained for the networked agents to accomplish the consensus tracking objective, regardless of the relative degree of the system model of agents. Moreover, the Hinfinity analysis approach is introduced to help establish conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) such that the resulting processes of the presented learning algorithm can be guaranteed to monotonically converge in an iterative manner. The established LMI conditions can also enable the iterative learning processes to converge with an exponentially fast speed. In addition, we extend the learning algorithm to address the relative formation problem for multiagent systems. Numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of learning algorithms in achieving both consensus tracking and relative formation objectives for the networked agents.",4
Single image super-resolution with multiscale similarity learning.,"Example learning-based image super-resolution (SR) is recognized as an effective way to produce a high-resolution (HR) image with the help of an external training set. The effectiveness of learning-based SR methods, however, depends highly upon the consistency between the supporting training set and low-resolution (LR) images to be handled. To reduce the adverse effect brought by incompatible high-frequency details in the training set, we propose a single image SR approach by learning multiscale self-similarities from an LR image itself. The proposed SR approach is based upon an observation that small patches in natural images tend to redundantly repeat themselves many times both within the same scale and across different scales. To synthesize the missing details, we establish the HR-LR patch pairs using the initial LR input and its down-sampled version to capture the similarities across different scales and utilize the neighbor embedding algorithm to estimate the relationship between the LR and HR image pairs. To fully exploit the similarities across various scales inside the input LR image, we accumulate the previous resultant images as training examples for the subsequent reconstruction processes and adopt a gradual magnification scheme to upscale the LR input to the desired size step by step. In addition, to preserve sharper edges and suppress aliasing artifacts, we further apply the nonlocal means method to learn the similarity within the same scale and formulate a nonlocal prior regularization term to well pose SR estimation under a reconstruction-based SR framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can produce compelling SR recovery both quantitatively and perceptually in comparison with other state-of-the-art baselines.",4
SVR learning-based spatiotemporal fuzzy logic controller for nonlinear spatially distributed dynamic systems.,"A data-driven 3-D fuzzy-logic controller (3-D FLC) design methodology based on support vector regression (SVR) learning is developed for nonlinear spatially distributed dynamic systems. Initially, the spatial information expression and processing as well as the fuzzy linguistic expression and rule inference of a 3-D FLC are integrated into spatial fuzzy basis functions (SFBFs), and then the 3-D FLC can be depicted by a three-layer network structure. By relating SFBFs of the 3-D FLC directly to spatial kernel functions of an SVR, an equivalence relationship of the 3-D FLC and the SVR is established, which means that the 3-D FLC can be designed with the help of the SVR learning. Subsequently, for an easy implementation, a systematic SVR learning-based 3-D FLC design scheme is formulated. In addition, the universal approximation capability of the proposed 3-D FLC is presented. Finally, the control of a nonlinear catalytic packed-bed reactor is considered as an application to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed 3-D FLC.",4
Ensemble learning in fixed expansion layer networks for mitigating catastrophic forgetting.,"Catastrophic forgetting is a well-studied attribute of most parameterized supervised learning systems. A variation of this phenomenon, in the context of feedforward neural networks, arises when nonstationary inputs lead to loss of previously learned mappings. The majority of the schemes proposed in the literature for mitigating catastrophic forgetting were not data driven and did not scale well. We introduce the fixed expansion layer (FEL) feedforward neural network, which embeds a sparsely encoding hidden layer to help mitigate forgetting of prior learned representations. In addition, we investigate a novel framework for training ensembles of FEL networks, based on exploiting an information-theoretic measure of diversity between FEL learners, to further control undesired plasticity. The proposed methodology is demonstrated on a basic classification task, clearly emphasizing its advantages over existing techniques. The architecture proposed can be enhanced to address a range of computational intelligence tasks, such as regression problems and system control.",4
Minimax sparse logistic regression for very high-dimensional feature selection.,"Because of the strong convexity and probabilistic underpinnings, logistic regression (LR) is widely used in many real-world applications. However, in many problems, such as bioinformatics, choosing a small subset of features with the most discriminative power are desirable for interpreting the prediction model, robust predictions or deeper analysis. To achieve a sparse solution with respect to input features, many sparse LR models are proposed. However, it is still challenging for them to efficiently obtain unbiased sparse solutions to very high-dimensional problems (e.g., identifying the most discriminative subset from millions of features). In this paper, we propose a new minimax sparse LR model for very high-dimensional feature selections, which can be efficiently solved by a cutting plane algorithm. To solve the resultant nonsmooth minimax subproblems, a smoothing coordinate descent method is presented. Numerical issues and convergence rate of this method are carefully studied. Experimental results on several synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed method can obtain better prediction accuracy with the same number of selected features and has better or competitive scalability on very high-dimensional problems compared with the baseline methods, including the l1-regularized LR.",4
Learning capability of relaxed greedy algorithms.,"In the practice of machine learning, one often encounters problems in which noisy data are abundant while the learning targets are imprecise and elusive. To these challenges, most of the traditional learning algorithms employ hypothesis spaces of large capacity. This has inevitably led to high computational burdens and caused considerable machine sluggishness. Utilizing greedy algorithms in this kind of learning environment has greatly improved machine performance. The best existing learning rate of various greedy algorithms is proved to achieve the order of (m/log m)(-1/2), where m is the sample size. In this paper, we provide a relaxed greedy algorithm and study its learning capability. We prove that the learning rate of the new relaxed greedy algorithm is faster than the order m(-1/2). Unlike many other greedy algorithms, which are often indecisive issuing a stopping order to the iteration process, our algorithm has a clearly established stopping criteria.",4
Coordination of multiagents interacting under independent position and velocity topologies.,"We consider the coordination control for multiagent systems in a very general framework where the position and velocity interactions among agents are modeled by independent graphs. Different algorithms are proposed and analyzed for different settings, including the case without leaders and the case with a virtual leader under fixed position and velocity interaction topologies, as well as the case with a group velocity reference signal under switching velocity interaction. It is finally shown that the proposed algorithms are feasible in achieving the desired coordination behavior provided the interaction topologies satisfy the weakest possible connectivity conditions. Such conditions relate only to the structure of the interactions among agents while irrelevant to their magnitudes and thus are easy to verify. Rigorous convergence analysis is preformed based on a combined use of tools from algebraic graph theory, matrix analysis as well as the Lyapunov stability theory.",4
Automated induction of heterogeneous proximity measures for supervised spectral embedding.,"Spectral embedding methods have played a very important role in dimensionality reduction and feature generation in machine learning. Supervised spectral embedding methods additionally improve the classification of labeled data, using proximity information that considers both features and class labels. However, these calculate the proximity information by treating all intraclass similarities homogeneously for all classes, and similarly for all interclass samples. In this paper, we propose a very novel and generic method which can treat all the intra- and interclass sample similarities heterogeneously by potentially using a different proximity function for each class and each class pair. To handle the complexity of selecting these functions, we employ evolutionary programming as an automated powerful formula induction engine. In addition, for computational efficiency and expressive power, we use a compact matrix tree representation equipped with a broad set of functions that can build most currently used similarity functions as well as new ones. Model selection is data driven, because the entire model is symbolically instantiated using only problem training data, and no user-selected functions or parameters are required. We perform thorough comparative experimentations with multiple classification datasets and many existing state-of-the-art embedding methods, which show that the proposed algorithm is very competitive in terms of classification accuracy and generalization ability.",4
RBF-based technique for statistical demodulation of pathological tremor.,"This paper presents an innovative technique based on the joint approximation capabilities of radial basis function (RBF) networks and the estimation capability of the multivariate iterated Hilbert transform (IHT) for the statistical demodulation of pathological tremor from electromyography (EMG) signals in patients with Parkinson's disease. We define a stochastic model of the multichannel high-density surface EMG by means of the RBF networks applied to the reconstruction of the stochastic process (characterizing the disease) modeled by the multivariate relationships generated by the Karhunen-Loeve transform in Hilbert spaces. Next, we perform a demodulation of the entire random field by means of the estimation capability of the multivariate IHT in a statistical setting. The proposed method is applied to both simulated signals and data recorded from three Parkinsonian patients and the results show that the amplitude modulation components of the tremor oscillation can be estimated with signal-to-noise ratio close to 30 dB with root-mean-square error for the estimates of the tremor instantaneous frequency. Additionally, the comparisons with a large number of techniques based on all the combinations of the RBF, extreme learning machine, backpropagation, support vector machine used in the first step of the algorithm; and IHT, empirical mode decomposition, multiband energy separation algorithm, periodic algebraic separation and energy demodulation used in the second step of the algorithm, clearly show the effectiveness of our technique. These results show that the proposed approach is a potential useful tool for advanced neurorehabilitation technologies that aim at tremor characterization and suppression.",4
Mean vector component analysis for visualization and clustering of nonnegative data.,"Mean vector component analysis (MVCA) is introduced as a new method for visualization and clustering of nonnegative data. The method is based on dimensionality reduction by preserving the squared length, and implicitly also the direction, of the mean vector of the original data. The optimal mean vector preserving basis is obtained from the spectral decomposition of the inner-product matrix, and it is shown to capture clustering structure. MVCA corresponds to certain uncentered principal component analysis (PCA) axes. Unlike traditional PCA, these axes are in general not corresponding to the top eigenvalues. MVCA is shown to produce different visualizations and sometimes considerably improved clustering results for nonnegative data, compared with PCA.",4
Rapid feedforward computation by temporal encoding and learning with spiking neurons.,"Primates perform remarkably well in cognitive tasks such as pattern recognition. Motivated by recent findings in biological systems, a unified and consistent feedforward system network with a proper encoding scheme and supervised temporal rules is built for solving the pattern recognition task. The temporal rules used for processing precise spiking patterns have recently emerged as ways of emulating the brain's computation from its anatomy and physiology. Most of these rules could be used for recognizing different spatiotemporal patterns. However, there arises the question of whether these temporal rules could be used to recognize real-world stimuli such as images. Furthermore, how the information is represented in the brain still remains unclear. To tackle these problems, a proper encoding method and a unified computational model with consistent and efficient learning rule are proposed. Through encoding, external stimuli are converted into sparse representations, which also have properties of invariance. These temporal patterns are then learned through biologically derived algorithms in the learning layer, followed by the final decision presented through the readout layer. The performance of the model with images of digits from the MNIST database is presented. The results show that the proposed model is capable of recognizing images correctly with a performance comparable to that of current benchmark algorithms. The results also suggest a plausibility proof for a class of feedforward models of rapid and robust recognition in the brain.",4
Lattice computing extension of the FAM neural classifier for human facial expression recognition.,"This paper proposes a fundamentally novel extension, namely, flrFAM, of the fuzzy ARTMAP (FAM) neural classifier for incremental real-time learning and generalization based on fuzzy lattice reasoning techniques. FAM is enhanced first by a parameter optimization training (sub)phase, and then by a capacity to process partially ordered (non)numeric data including information granules. The interest here focuses on intervals' numbers (INs) data, where an IN represents a distribution of data samples. We describe the proposed flrFAM classifier as a fuzzy neural network that can induce descriptive as well as flexible (i.e., tunable) decision-making knowledge (rules) from the data. We demonstrate the capacity of the flrFAM classifier for human facial expression recognition on benchmark datasets. The novel feature extraction as well as knowledge-representation is based on orthogonal moments. The reported experimental results compare well with the results by alternative classifiers from the literature. The far-reaching potential of fuzzy lattice reasoning in human-machine interaction applications is discussed.",4
Adaptive optimal control of unknown constrained-input systems using policy iteration and neural networks.,"This paper presents an online policy iteration (PI) algorithm to learn the continuous-time optimal control solution for unknown constrained-input systems. The proposed PI algorithm is implemented on an actor-critic structure where two neural networks (NNs) are tuned online and simultaneously to generate the optimal bounded control policy. The requirement of complete knowledge of the system dynamics is obviated by employing a novel NN identifier in conjunction with the actor and critic NNs. It is shown how the identifier weights estimation error affects the convergence of the critic NN. A novel learning rule is developed to guarantee that the identifier weights converge to small neighborhoods of their ideal values exponentially fast. To provide an easy-to-check persistence of excitation condition, the experience replay technique is used. That is, recorded past experiences are used simultaneously with current data for the adaptation of the identifier weights. Stability of the whole system consisting of the actor, critic, system state, and system identifier is guaranteed while all three networks undergo adaptation. Convergence to a near-optimal control law is also shown. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated with a simulation example.",4
Sequential blind identification of underdetermined mixtures using a novel deflation scheme.,"In this brief, we consider the problem of blind identification in underdetermined instantaneous mixture cases, where there are more sources than sensors. A new blind identification algorithm, which estimates the mixing matrix in a sequential fashion, is proposed. By using the rank-1 detecting device, blind identification is reformulated as a constrained optimization problem. The identification of one column of the mixing matrix hence reduces to an optimization task for which an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed. The identification of the other columns of the mixing matrix is then carried out by a generalized eigenvalue decomposition-based deflation method. The key merit of the proposed deflation method is that it does not suffer from error accumulation. The proposed sequential blind identification algorithm provides more flexibility and better robustness than its simultaneous counterpart. Comparative simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm over the simultaneous blind identification algorithm.",4
Linfinity analysis and state-feedback control of Hopfield networks.,"A nonsymmetric version of Hopfield networks subject to bounded disturbances is considered. Such networks arise in the context of visuo-motor control loops and may, therefore, be used to mimic their complex behavior. In this brief, we adopt the Lur'e-Postnikov systems approach to analyze the induced Linfinity gain of generalized Hopfield networks. A state-feedback control is then designed to accomplish the Linfinity-type performance for Hopfield networks. The results are illustrated through numerical examples.",4
On the optimal class representation in linear discriminant analysis.,"Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a widely used technique for supervised feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. LDA determines an optimal discriminant space for linear data projection based on certain assumptions, e.g., on using normal distributions for each class and employing class representation by the mean class vectors. However, there might be other vectors that can represent each class, to increase class discrimination. In this brief, we propose an optimization scheme aiming at the optimal class representation, in terms of Fisher ratio maximization, for LDA-based data projection. Compared with the standard LDA approach, the proposed optimization scheme increases class discrimination in the reduced dimensionality space and achieves higher classification rates in publicly available data sets.",4
Quantized kernel recursive least squares algorithm.,"In a recent paper, we developed a novel quantized kernel least mean square algorithm, in which the input space is quantized (partitioned into smaller regions) and the network size is upper bounded by the quantization codebook size (number of the regions). In this paper, we propose the quantized kernel least squares regression, and derive the optimal solution. By incorporating a simple online vector quantization method, we derive a recursive algorithm to update the solution, namely the quantized kernel recursive least squares algorithm. The good performance of the new algorithm is demonstrated by Monte Carlo simulations.",4
Controllability and observability of Boolean control networks with time-variant delays in states.,"This brief investigates the controllability and observability of Boolean control networks with (not necessarily bounded) time-variant delays in states. After a brief introduction to converting a Boolean control network to an equivalent discrete-time bilinear dynamical system via the semi-tensor product of matrices, the system is split into a finite number of subsystems (constructed forest) with no time delays by using the idea of splitting time that is proposed in this brief. Then, the controllability and observability of the system are investigated by verifying any so-called controllability constructed path and any so-called observability constructed paths in the above forest, respectively, which generalize some recent relevant results. Matrix test criteria for the controllability and observability are given. The corresponding control design algorithms based on the controllability theorems are given. We also show that the computing complexity of our algorithm is much less than that of the existing algorithms.",4
Effect of input noise and output node stochastic on Wang's kWTA.,"Recently, an analog neural network model, namely Wang's kWTA, was proposed. In this model, the output nodes are defined as the Heaviside function. Subsequently, its finite time convergence property and the exact convergence time are analyzed. However, the discovered characteristics of this model are based on the assumption that there are no physical defects during the operation. In this brief, we analyze the convergence behavior of the Wang's kWTA model when defects exist during the operation. Two defect conditions are considered. The first one is that there is input noise. The second one is that there is stochastic behavior in the output nodes. The convergence of the Wang's kWTA under these two defects is analyzed and the corresponding energy function is revealed.",4
Low-temperature fabrication of spiking soma circuits using nanocrystalline-silicon TFTs.,"Spiking neuron circuits consisting of ambipolar nanocrystalline-silicon (nc-Si) thin-film transistors (TFTs) have been fabricated using low temperature processing conditions (maximum of 250 degrees C) that allow the use of flexible substrates. These circuits display behaviors commonly observed in biological neurons such as millisecond spike duration, nonlinear frequency-current relationship, and spike frequency adaptation. The maximum drive capacity of a simple soma circuit was estimated to be approximately 9200 synapses. The effect of bias stress-induced threshold voltage degradation of component nc-Si TFTs on the spike frequency of soma circuits is explored. The measured power consumption of the circuit when spiking at 100 Hz was approximately 12 nW. Finally, the power consumption of the soma circuits at different spiking conditions and its implications on a large-scale system are discussed. The fabricated circuits can be employed as part of a compact multilayer learning network.",4
Combined convex technique on delay-dependent stability for delayed neural networks.,"In this brief, by employing an improved Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) and combining the reciprocal convex technique with the convex one, a new sufficient condition is derived to guarantee a class of delayed neural networks (DNNs) to be globally asymptotically stable. Since some previously ignored terms can be considered during the estimation of the derivative of LKF, a less conservative stability criterion is derived in the forms of linear matrix inequalities, whose solvability heavily depends on the information of addressed DNNs. Finally, we demonstrate by two numerical examples that our results reduce the conservatism more efficiently than some currently used methods.",4
Model of an excitatory synapse based on stochastic processes.,"We present a mathematical model of a biological synapse based on stochastic processes to establish the temporal behavior of the postsynaptic potential following a quantal synaptic transmission. This potential form is the basis of the neural code. We suppose that the release of neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft follows a Poisson process, and that they diffuse according to integrated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes in 3-D with random initial positions and velocities. The diffusion occurs in an isotropic environment between two infinite parallel planes representing the pre- and postsynaptic membrane. We state that the presynaptic membrane is perfectly reflecting and that the other is perfectly absorbing. The activation of the receptors polarizes the postsynaptic membrane according to a parallel RC circuit scheme. We present the results obtained by simulations according to a Gillespie algorithm and we show that our model exhibits realistic postsynaptic behaviors from a simple quantal occurrence.",4
Memory models of adaptive behavior.,"Adaptive response to varying environment is a common feature of biological organisms. Reproducing such features in electronic systems and circuits is of great importance for a variety of applications. We consider memory models inspired by an intriguing ability of slime molds to both memorize the period of temperature and humidity variations and anticipate the next variations to come, when appropriately trained. Effective circuit models of such behavior are designed using: 1) a set of LC contours with memristive damping and 2) a single memcapacitive system-based adaptive contour with memristive damping. We consider these two approaches in detail by comparing their results and predictions. Finally, possible biological experiments that would discriminate between the models are discussed. In this paper, we also introduce an effective description of certain memory circuit elements.",4
Real-time model predictive control using a self-organizing neural network.,"In this paper, a real-time model predictive control (RT-MPC) based on self-organizing radial basis function neural network (SORBFNN) is proposed for nonlinear systems. This RT-MPC has its simplicity in parallelism to model predictive control design and efficiency to deal with computational complexity. First, a SORBFNN with concurrent structure and parameter learning is developed as the predictive model of the nonlinear systems. The model performance can be significantly improved through SORBFNN, and the modeling error is uniformly ultimately bounded. Second, a fast gradient method (GM) is enhanced for the solution of optimal control problem. This proposed GM can reduce computational cost and suboptimize the RT-MPC online. Then, the conditions of the stability analysis and steady-state performance of the closed-loop systems are presented. Finally, numerical simulations reveal that the proposed control gives satisfactory tracking and disturbance rejection performances. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness.",4
Cube Kohonen self-organizing map (CKSOM) model with new equations in organizing unstructured data.,"Surface reconstruction by using 3-D data is used to represent the surface of an object and perform important tasks. The type of data used is important and can be described as either structured or unstructured. For unstructured data, there is no connectivity information between data points. As a result, incorrect shapes will be obtained during the imaging process. Therefore, the data should be reorganized by finding the correct topology so that the correct shape can be obtained. Previous studies have shown that the Kohonen self-organizing map (KSOM) could be used to solve data organizing problems. However, 2-D Kohonen maps are limited because they are unable to cover the whole surface of closed 3-D surface data. Furthermore, the neurons inside the 3-D KSOM structure should be removed in order to create a correct wireframe model. This is because only the outside neurons are used to represent the surface of an object. The aim of this paper is to use KSOM to organize unstructured data for closed surfaces. KSOM isused in this paper by testing its ability to organize medical image data because KSOM is mostly used in constructing engineering field data. Enhancements are added to the model by introducing class number and the index vector, and new equations are created. Various grid sizes and maximum iterations are tested in the experiments. Based on the results, the number of redundancies is found to be directly proportional to the grid size. When we increase the maximum iterations, the surface of the image becomes smoother. An area formula is used and manual calculations are performed to validate the results. This model is implemented and images are created using Dev C++ and GNUPlot.",4
Neural-adaptive control of single-master-multiple-slaves teleoperation for coordinated multiple mobile manipulators with time-varying communication delays and input uncertainties.,"In this paper, adaptive neural network control is investigated for single-master-multiple-slaves teleoperation in consideration of time delays and input dead-zone uncertainties for multiple mobile manipulators carrying a common object in a cooperative manner. Firstly, concise dynamics of teleoperation systems consisting of a single master robot, multiple coordinated slave robots, and the object are developed in the task space. To handle asymmetric time-varying delays in communication channels and unknown asymmetric input dead zones, the nonlinear dynamics of the teleoperation system are transformed into two subsystems through feedback linearization: local master or slave dynamics including the unknown input dead zones and delayed dynamics for the purpose of synchronization. Then, a model reference neural network control strategy based on linear matrix inequalities (LMI) and adaptive techniques is proposed. The developed control approach ensures that the defined tracking errors converge to zero whereas the coordination internal force errors remain bounded and can be made arbitrarily small. Throughout this paper, stability analysis is performed via explicit Lyapunov techniques under specific LMI conditions. The proposed adaptive neural network control scheme is robust against motion disturbances, parametric uncertainties, time-varying delays, and input dead zones, which is validated by simulation studies.",4
FPGA-based distributed computing microarchitecture for complex physical dynamics investigation.,"In this paper, we present a distributed computing system, called DCMARK, aimed at solving partial differential equations at the basis of many investigation fields, such as solid state physics, nuclear physics, and plasma physics. This distributed architecture is based on the cellular neural network paradigm, which allows us to divide the differential equation system solving into many parallel integration operations to be executed by a custom multiprocessor system. We push the number of processors to the limit of one processor for each equation. In order to test the present idea, we choose to implement DCMARK on a single FPGA, designing the single processor in order to minimize its hardware requirements and to obtain a large number of easily interconnected processors. This approach is particularly suited to study the properties of 1-, 2- and 3-D locally interconnected dynamical systems. In order to test the computing platform, we implement a 200 cells, Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation solver and perform a comparison between simulations conducted on a high performance PC and on our system. Since our distributed architecture takes a constant computing time to solve the equation system, independently of the number of dynamical elements (cells) of the CNN array, it allows us to reduce the elaboration time more than other similar systems in the literature. To ensure a high level of reconfigurability, we design a compact system on programmable chip managed by a softcore processor, which controls the fast data/control communication between our system and a PC Host. An intuitively graphical user interface allows us to change the calculation parameters and plot the results.",4
Learning sparse kernel classifiers for multi-instance classification.,"We propose a direct approach to learning sparse kernel classifiers for multi-instance (MI) classification to improve efficiency while maintaining predictive accuracy. The proposed method builds on a convex formulation for MI classification by considering the average score of individual instances for bag-level prediction. In contrast, existing formulations used the maximum score of individual instances in each bag, which leads to nonconvex optimization problems. Based on the convex MI framework, we formulate a sparse kernel learning algorithm by imposing additional constraints on the objective function to enforce the maximum number of expansions allowed in the prediction function. The formulated sparse learning problem for the MI classification is convex with respect to the classifier weights. Therefore, we can employ an effective optimization strategy to solve the optimization problem that involves the joint learning of both the classifier and the expansion vectors. In addition, the proposed formulation can explicitly control the complexity of the prediction model while still maintaining competitive predictive performance. Experimental results on benchmark data sets demonstrate that our proposed approach is effective in building very sparse kernel classifiers while achieving comparable performance to the state-of-the-art MI classifiers.",4
Transductive face sketch-photo synthesis.,"Face sketch-photo synthesis plays a critical role in many applications, such as law enforcement and digital entertainment. Recently, many face sketch-photo synthesis methods have been proposed under the framework of inductive learning, and these have obtained promising performance. However, these inductive learning-based face sketch-photo synthesis methods may result in high losses for test samples, because inductive learning minimizes the empirical loss for training samples. This paper presents a novel transductive face sketch-photo synthesis method that incorporates the given test samples into the learning process and optimizes the performance on these test samples. In particular, it defines a probabilistic model to optimize both the reconstruction fidelity of the input photo (sketch) and the synthesis fidelity of the target output sketch (photo), and efficiently optimizes this probabilistic model by alternating optimization. The proposed transductive method significantly reduces the expected high loss and improves the synthesis performance for test samples. Experimental results on the Chinese University of Hong Kong face sketch data set demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with representative inductive learning-based face sketch-photo synthesis methods.",4
Study of the convergence behavior of the complex kernel least mean square algorithm.,The complex kernel least mean square (CKLMS) algorithm is recently derived and allows for online kernel adaptive learning for complex data. Kernel adaptive methods can be used in finding solutions for neural network and machine learning applications. The derivation of CKLMS involved the development of a modified Wirtinger calculus for Hilbert spaces to obtain the cost function gradient. We analyze the convergence of the CKLMS with different kernel forms for complex data. The expressions obtained enable us to generate theory-predicted mean-square error curves considering the circularity of the complex input signals and their effect on nonlinear learning. Simulations are used for verifying the analysis results.,4
Phase-noise-induced resonance in arrays of coupled excitable neural models.,"Recently, it is observed that, in a single neural model, phase noise (time-varying signal phase) arising from an external stimulating signal can induce regular spiking activities even if the signal is subthreshold. In addition, it is also uncovered that there exists an optimal phase noise intensity at which the spiking rhythm coincides with the frequency of the subthreshold signal, resulting in a phase-noise-induced resonance phenomenon. However, neurons usually do not work alone, but are connected in the form of arrays or blocks. Therefore, we study the spiking activity induced by phase noise in arrays of globally and locally coupled excitable neural models. We find that there also exists an optimal phase noise intensity for generating large neural response and such an optimal value is significantly decreased compared to an isolated single neuron case, which means the detectability in response to the subthreshold signal of neurons is sharply improved because of the coupling. In addition, we reveal two new resonance behaviors in the neuron ensemble with the presence of phase noise: there exist optimal values of both coupling strength and system size, where the coupled neurons generate regular spikes under subthreshold stimulations, which are called as coupling strength and system size resonance, respectively. Finally, the dependence of phase-noise-induced resonance on signal frequency is also examined.",4
Analysis of boundedness and convergence of online gradient method for two-layer feedforward neural networks.,"This paper presents a theoretical boundedness and convergence analysis of online gradient method for the training of two-layer feedforward neural networks. The well-known linear difference equation is extended to apply to the general case of linear or nonlinear activation functions. Based on this extended difference equation, we investigate the boundedness and convergence of the parameter sequence of concern, which is trained by finite training samples with a constant learning rate. We show that the uniform upper bound of the parameter sequence, which is very important in the training procedure, is the solution of an inequality regarding the bound. It is further verified that, for the case of linear activation function, a solution always exists and, moreover, the parameter sequence can be uniformly upper bounded, while for the case of nonlinear activation function, some simple adjustment methods on the training set or the activation function can be derived to improve the boundedness property. Then, for the convergence analysis, it is shown that the parameter sequence can converge into a zone around an optimal solution at which the error function attains its global minimum, where the size of the zone is associated with the learning rate. Particularly, for the case of perfect modeling, a strong global convergence result, where the parameter sequence can always converge to an optimal solution, is proved.",4
Exponential synchronization of coupled switched neural networks with mode-dependent impulsive effects.,"This paper investigates the synchronization problem of coupled switched neural networks (SNNs) with mode-dependent impulsive effects and time delays. The main feature of mode-dependent impulsive effects is that impulsive effects can exist not only at the instants coinciding with mode switching but also at the instants when there is no system switching. The impulses considered here include those that suppress synchronization or enhance synchronization. Based on switching analysis techniques and the comparison principle, the exponential synchronization criteria are derived for coupled delayed SNNs with mode-dependent impulsive effects. Finally, simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the results.",4
Feasibility and finite convergence analysis for accurate on-line nu-support vector machine.,"The nu-support vector machine ( nu-SVM) for classification has the advantage of using a parameter nu on controlling the number of support vectors and margin errors. Recently, an interesting accurate on-line algorithm accurate on-line nu-SVM algorithm (AONSVM) is proposed for training nu-SVM. AONSVM can be viewed as a special case of parametric quadratic programming techniques. It is demonstrated that AONSVM avoids the infeasible updating path as far as possible, and successfully converges to the optimal solution based on experimental analysis. However, because of the differences between AONSVM and classical parametric quadratic programming techniques, there is no theoretical justification for these conclusions. In this paper, we prove the feasibility and finite convergence of AONSVM under two assumptions. The main results of feasibility analysis include: 1) the inverses of the two key matrices in AONSVM always exist; 2) the rules for updating the two key inverse matrices are reliable; 3) the variable zeta can control the adjustment of the sum of all the weights efficiently; and 4) a sample cannot migrate back and forth in successive adjustment steps among the set of margin support vectors, the set of error support vectors, and the set of the remaining vectors. Moreover, the analyses of AONSVM also provide the proofs of the feasibility and finite convergence for accurate on-line C-SVM learning directly.",4
Ranking graph embedding for learning to rerank.,"Dimensionality reduction is a key step to improving the generalization ability of reranking in image search. However, existing dimensionality reduction methods are typically designed for classification, clustering, and visualization, rather than for the task of learning to rank. Without using of ranking information such as relevance degree labels, direct utilization of conventional dimensionality reduction methods in ranking tasks generally cannot achieve the best performance. In this paper, we show that introducing ranking information into dimensionality reduction significantly increases the performance of image search reranking. The proposed method transforms graph embedding, a general framework of dimensionality reduction, into ranking graph embedding (RANGE) by modeling the global structure and the local relationships in and between different relevance degree sets, respectively. The proposed method also defines three types of edge weight assignment between two nodes: binary, reconstruction, and global. In addition, a novel principal components analysis based similarity calculation method is presented in the stage of global graph construction. Extensive experimental results on the MSRA-MM database demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed RANGE method and the image search reranking framework.",4
Hinging hyperplanes for time-series segmentation.,"Division of a time series into segments is a common technique for time-series processing, and is known as segmentation. Segmentation is traditionally done by linear interpolation in order to guarantee the continuity of the reconstructed time series. The interpolation-based segmentation methods may perform poorly for data with a level of noise because interpolation is noise sensitive. To handle the problem, this paper establishes an explicit expression for segmentation from a compact representation for piecewise linear functions using hinging hyperplanes. This expression enables the use of regression to obtain a continuous reconstructed signal and, as a consequence, application of advanced techniques in segmentation. In this paper, a least squares support vector machine with lasso using a hinging feature map is given and analyzed, based on which a segmentation algorithm and its online version are established. Numerical experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the advantages of our methods compared to existing segmentation algorithms.",4
Quantum-based algorithm for optimizing artificial neural networks.,"This paper presents a quantum-based algorithm for evolving artificial neural networks (ANNs). The aim is to design an ANN with few connections and high classification performance by simultaneously optimizing the network structure and the connection weights. Unlike most previous studies, the proposed algorithm uses quantum bit representation to codify the network. As a result, the connectivity bits do not indicate the actual links but the probability of the existence of the connections, thus alleviating mapping problems and reducing the risk of throwing away a potential candidate. In addition, in the proposed model, each weight space is decomposed into subspaces in terms of quantum bits. Thus, the algorithm performs a region by region exploration, and evolves gradually to find promising subspaces for further exploitation. This is helpful to provide a set of appropriate weights when evolving the network structure and to alleviate the noisy fitness evaluation problem. The proposed model is tested on four benchmark problems, namely breast cancer and iris, heart, and diabetes problems. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can produce compact ANN structures with good generalization ability compared to other algorithms.",4
Improving the quality of self-organizing maps by self-intersection avoidance.,"The quality of self-organizing maps is always a key issue to practitioners. Smooth maps convey information about input data sets in a clear manner. Here a method is presented to modify the learning algorithm of self-organizing maps to reduce the number of topology errors, hence the obtained map has better quality at the expense of increased quantization error. It is based on avoiding maps that self-intersect or nearly so, as these states are related to low quality. Our approach is tested with synthetic data and real data from visualization, pattern recognition and computer vision applications, with satisfactory results.",4
Fast neuromimetic object recognition using FPGA outperforms GPU implementations.,"Recognition of objects in still images has traditionally been regarded as a difficult computational problem. Although modern automated methods for visual object recognition have achieved steadily increasing recognition accuracy, even the most advanced computational vision approaches are unable to obtain performance equal to that of humans. This has led to the creation of many biologically inspired models of visual object recognition, among them the hierarchical model and X (HMAX) model. HMAX is traditionally known to achieve high accuracy in visual object recognition tasks at the expense of significant computational complexity. Increasing complexity, in turn, increases computation time, reducing the number of images that can be processed per unit time. In this paper we describe how the computationally intensive and biologically inspired HMAX model for visual object recognition can be modified for implementation on a commercial field-programmable aate Array, specifically the Xilinx Virtex 6 ML605 evaluation board with XC6VLX240T FPGA. We show that with minor modifications to the traditional HMAX model we can perform recognition on images of size 128 x 128 pixels at a rate of 190 images per second with a less than 1% loss in recognition accuracy in both binary and multiclass visual object recognition tasks.",4
Boundedness and complete stability of complex-valued neural networks with time delay.,"In this paper, the boundedness and complete stability of complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) with time delay are studied. Some conditions to guarantee the boundedness of the CVNNs are derived using local inhibition. Moreover, under the boundedness conditions, a compact set that globally attracts all the trajectories of the network is also given. Additionally, several conditions in terms of real-valued linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) for complete stability of the CVNNs are established via the energy minimization method and the approach that converts the complex-valued LMIs to real-valued ones. Examples with simulation results are given to show the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis.",4
A cognitive fault diagnosis system for distributed sensor networks.,"This paper introduces a novel cognitive fault diagnosis system (FDS) for distributed sensor networks that takes advantage of spatial and temporal relationships among sensors. The proposed FDS relies on a suitable functional graph representation of the network and a two-layer hierarchical architecture designed to promptly detect and isolate faults. The lower processing layer exploits a novel change detection test (CDT) based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) configured to detect variations in the relationships between couples of sensors. HMMs work in the parameter space of linear time-invariant dynamic systems, approximating, over time, the relationship between two sensors; changes in the approximating model are detected by inspecting the HMM likelihood. Information provided by the CDT layer is then passed to the cognitive one, which, by exploiting the graph representation of the network, aggregates information to discriminate among faults, changes in the environment, and false positives induced by the model bias of the HMMs.",4
Knowledge-leverage-based TSK Fuzzy System modeling.,"Classical fuzzy system modeling methods consider only the current scene where the training data are assumed to be fully collectable. However, if the data available from the current scene are insufficient, the fuzzy systems trained by using the incomplete datasets will suffer from weak generalization capability for the prediction in the scene. In order to overcome this problem, a knowledge-leverage-based fuzzy system (KL-FS) is studied in this paper from the perspective of transfer learning. The KL-FS intends to not only make full use of the data from the current scene in the learning procedure, but also effectively leverage the existing knowledge from the reference scenes. Specifically, a knowledge-leverage-based Takagi-Sugeno-Kang-type Fuzzy System (KL-TSK-FS) is proposed by integrating the corresponding knowledge-leverage mechanism. The new fuzzy system modeling technique is evaluated through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that KL-TSK-FS has better performance and adaptability than the traditional fuzzy modeling methods in scenes with insufficient data.",4
Dictionary learning-based subspace structure identification in spectral clustering.,"In this paper, we study dictionary learning (DL) approach to identify the representation of low-dimensional subspaces from high-dimensional and nonnegative data. Such representation can be used to provide an affinity matrix among different subspaces for data clustering. The main contribution of this paper is to consider both nonnegativity and sparsity constraints together in DL such that data can be represented effectively by nonnegative and sparse coding coefficients and nonnegative dictionary bases. In the algorithm, we employ the proximal point technique for the resulting DL and sparsity optimization problem. We make use of coding coefficients to perform spectral clustering (SC) for data partitioning. Extensive experiments on real-world high-dimensional and nonnegative data sets, including text, microarray, and image data demonstrate that the proposed method can discover their subspace structures. Experimental results also show that our algorithm is computationally efficient and effective for obtaining high SC performance and interpreting the clustering results compared with the other testing methods.",4
Sampled-data exponential synchronization of complex dynamical networks with time-varying coupling delay.,"This paper studies the problem of sampled-data exponential synchronization of complex dynamical networks (CDNs) with time-varying coupling delay and uncertain sampling. By combining the time-dependent Lyapunov functional approach and convex combination technique, a criterion is derived to ensure the exponential stability of the error dynamics, which fully utilizes the available information about the actual sampling pattern. Based on the derived condition, the design method of the desired sampled-data controllers is proposed to make the CDNs exponentially synchronized and obtain a lower-bound estimation of the largest sampling interval. Simulation examples demonstrate that the presented method can significantly reduce the conservatism of the existing results, and lead to wider applications.",4
A novel approach to the problem of non-uniqueness of the solution in hierarchical clustering.,"The existence of multiple solutions in clustering, and in hierarchical clustering in particular, is often ignored in practical applications. However, this is a non-trivial problem, as different data orderings can result in different cluster sets that, in turns, may lead to different interpretations of the same data. The method presented here offers a solution to this issue. It is based on the definition of an equivalence relation over dendrograms that allows developing all and only the significantly different dendrograms for the same dataset, thus reducing the computational complexity to polynomial from the exponential obtained when all possible dendrograms are considered. Experimental results in the neuroimaging and bioinformatics domains show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",4
Approximating Gaussian mixture model or radial basis function network with multilayer perceptron.,"Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) are both popular pattern classification techniques. This brief shows that a multilayer perceptron with quadratic inputs (MLPQ) can accurately approximate GMMs with diagonal covariance matrices. The mapping equations between the parameters of GMM and the weights of MLPQ are presented. A similar approach is applied to radial basis function networks (RBFNs) to show that RBFNs with Gaussian basis functions and Euclidean norm can be approximated accurately with MLPQ. The mapping equations between RBFN and MLPQ weights are presented. There are well-established training procedures for GMMs, such as the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. The GMM parameters obtained by the EM algorithm can be used to generate a set of initial weights of MLPQ. Similarly, a trained RBFN can be used to generate a set of initial weights of MLPQ. MLPQ training can be continued further with gradient-descent based methods, which can lead to improvement in performance compared to the GMM or RBFN from which it is initialized. Thus, the MLPQ can always perform as well as or better than the GMM or RBFN.",4
Structure of indicator function classes with finite Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimensions.,"The Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension is used to measure the complexity of a function class and plays an important role in a variety of fields, including artificial neural networks and machine learning. One major concern is the relationship between the VC dimension and inherent characteristics of the corresponding function class. According to Sauer's lemma, if the VC dimension of an indicator function class F is equal to D, the cardinality of the set F(S1(N)) will not be larger than Sigma(d=0)(D)C(N)(d). Therefore, there naturally arises a question about the VC dimension of an indicator function class: what kinds of elements will be contained in the function class F if F has a finite VC dimension? In this brief, we answer the above question. First, we investigate the structure of the function class F when the cardinality of the set F(S1(N)) reaches the maximum value Sigma(d=0)(D)C(N)(d). Based on the derived result, we then figure out what kinds of elements will be contained in F if F has a finite VC dimension.",4
Robust adaptive dynamic programming with an application to power systems.,"This brief presents a novel framework of robust adaptive dynamic programming (robust-ADP) aimed at computing globally stabilizing and suboptimal control policies in the presence of dynamic uncertainties. A key strategy is to integrate ADP theory with techniques in modern nonlinear control with a unique objective of filling up a gap in the past literature of ADP without taking into account dynamic uncertainties. Neither the system dynamics nor the system order are required to be precisely known. As an illustrative example, the computational algorithm is applied to the controller design of a two-machine power system.",4
Pinning consensus in networks of multiagents via a single impulsive controller.,"In this paper, we discuss pinning consensus in networks of multiagents via impulsive controllers. In particular, we consider the case of using only one impulsive controller. We provide a sufficient condition to pin the network to a prescribed value. It is rigorously proven that in case the underlying graph of the network has spanning trees, the network can reach consensus on the prescribed value when the impulsive controller is imposed on the root with appropriate impulsive strength and impulse intervals. Interestingly, we find that the permissible range of the impulsive strength completely depends on the left eigenvector of the graph Laplacian corresponding to the zero eigenvalue and the pinning node we choose. The impulses can be very sparse, with the impulsive intervals being lower bounded. Examples with numerical simulations are also provided to illustrate the theoretical results.",4
A quadratically constrained MAP classifier using the mixture of Gaussians models as a weight function.,"In this paper, we propose classifiers derived from quadratically constrained maximum a posteriori (QCMAP) estimation. The QCMAP consists of the maximization of the expectation of a cost function, which is derived from the maximum a posteriori probability and a quadratic constraint. This criterion is highly general since its forms include least squares regressions and a support vector machine. Furthermore, the criterion provides a novel classifier, the ""Gaussian QCMAP."" The QCMAP procedure still has large theoretical interest and its full extensibility has yet to be explored. In this paper, we propose using the mixture of Gaussian distributions as the QCMAP weight function. The mixture of Gaussian distributions has wide-ranging applicability, and encompasses forms, such as a normal distribution model and a kernel density model. We propose four types of mixture of Gaussian functions for QCMAP classifiers, and conduct experiments to demonstrate their advantages.",4
Exponential Hinfinity synchronization and state estimation for chaotic systems via a unified model.,"In this paper, Hinfinity synchronization and state estimation problems are considered for different types of chaotic systems. A unified model consisting of a linear dynamic system and a bounded static nonlinear operator is employed to describe these chaotic systems, such as Hopfield neural networks, cellular neural networks, Chua's circuits, unified chaotic systems, Qi systems, chaotic recurrent multilayer perceptrons, etc. Based on the Hinfinity performance analysis of this unified model using the linear matrix inequality approach, novel state feedback controllers are established not only to guarantee exponentially stable synchronization between two unified models with different initial conditions but also to reduce the effect of external disturbance on the synchronization error to a minimal Hinfinity norm constraint. The state estimation problem is then studied for the same unified model, where the purpose is to design a state estimator to estimate its states through available output measurements so that the exponential stability of the estimation error dynamic systems is guaranteed and the influence of noise on the estimation error is limited to the lowest level. The parameters of these controllers and filters are obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem. Most chaotic systems can be transformed into this unified model, and Hinfinity synchronization controllers and state estimators for these systems are designed in a unified way. Three numerical examples are provided to show the usefulness of the proposed Hinfinity synchronization and state estimation conditions.",4
Novel range-free localization based on multidimensional support vector regression trained in the primal space.,"A novel range-free localization algorithm based on the multidimensional support vector regression (MSVR) is proposed in this paper. The range-free localization problem is formulated as a multidimensional regression problem, and a new MSVR training method is proposed to solve the regression problem. Unlike standard support vector regression, the proposed MSVR allows multiple outputs and localizes the sensors without resorting to multilateration. The training of the MSVR is formulated directly in primal space and it can be solved in two ways. First, it is formulated as a second-order cone programming and trained by convex optimization. Second, its own training method is developed based on the Newton-Raphson method. A simulation is conducted for both isotropic and anisotropic networks, and the proposed method exhibits excellent and robust performance in both isotropic and anisotropic networks.",4
Incorporating privileged information through metric learning.,"In some pattern analysis problems, there exists expert knowledge, in addition to the original data involved in the classification process. The vast majority of existing approaches simply ignore such auxiliary (privileged) knowledge. Recently a new paradigm-learning using privileged information-was introduced in the framework of SVM+. This approach is formulated for binary classification and, as typical for many kernel-based methods, can scale unfavorably with the number of training examples. While speeding up training methods and extensions of SVM+ to multiclass problems are possible, in this paper we present a more direct novel methodology for incorporating valuable privileged knowledge in the model construction phase, primarily formulated in the framework of generalized matrix learning vector quantization. This is done by changing the global metric in the input space, based on distance relations revealed by the privileged information. Hence, unlike in SVM+, any convenient classifier can be used after such metric modification, bringing more flexibility to the problem of incorporating privileged information during the training. Experiments demonstrate that the manipulation of an input space metric based on privileged data improves classification accuracy. Moreover, our methods can achieve competitive performance against the SVM+ formulations.",4
Random sampler M-estimator algorithm with sequential probability ratio test for robust function approximation via feed-forward neural networks.,"This paper addresses the problem of fitting a functional model to data corrupted with outliers using a multilayered feed-forward neural network. Although it is of high importance in practical applications, this problem has not received careful attention from the neural network research community. One recent approach to solving this problem is to use a neural network training algorithm based on the random sample consensus (RANSAC) framework. This paper proposes a new algorithm that offers two enhancements over the original RANSAC algorithm. The first one improves the algorithm accuracy and robustness by employing an M-estimator cost function to decide on the best estimated model from the randomly selected samples. The other one improves the time performance of the algorithm by utilizing a statistical pretest based on Wald's sequential probability ratio test. The proposed algorithm is successfully evaluated on synthetic and real data, contaminated with varying degrees of outliers, and compared with existing neural network training algorithms.",4
Neural network-based optimal adaptive output feedback control of a helicopter UAV.,"Helicopter unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely used for both military and civilian operations. Because the helicopter UAVs are underactuated nonlinear mechanical systems, high-performance controller design for them presents a challenge. This paper introduces an optimal controller design via an output feedback for trajectory tracking of a helicopter UAV, using a neural network (NN). The output-feedback control system utilizes the backstepping methodology, employing kinematic and dynamic controllers and an NN observer. The online approximator-based dynamic controller learns the infinite-horizon Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation in continuous time and calculates the corresponding optimal control input by minimizing a cost function, forward-in-time, without using the value and policy iterations. Optimal tracking is accomplished by using a single NN utilized for the cost function approximation. The overall closed-loop system stability is demonstrated using Lyapunov analysis. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control design for trajectory tracking.",4
Bayesian learning for spatial filtering in an EEG-based brain-computer interface.,"Spatial filtering for EEG feature extraction and classification is an important tool in brain-computer interface. However, there is generally no established theory that links spatial filtering directly to Bayes classification error. To address this issue, this paper proposes and studies a Bayesian analysis theory for spatial filtering in relation to Bayes error. Following the maximum entropy principle, we introduce a gamma probability model for describing single-trial EEG power features. We then formulate and analyze the theoretical relationship between Bayes classification error and the so-called Rayleigh quotient, which is a function of spatial filters and basically measures the ratio in power features between two classes. This paper also reports our extensive study that examines the theory and its use in classification, using three publicly available EEG data sets and state-of-the-art spatial filtering techniques and various classifiers. Specifically, we validate the positive relationship between Bayes error and Rayleigh quotient in real EEG power features. Finally, we demonstrate that the Bayes error can be practically reduced by applying a new spatial filter with lower Rayleigh quotient.",4
Prediction intervals for a noisy nonlinear time series based on a bootstrapping reservoir computing network ensemble.,"Prediction intervals that provide estimated values as well as the corresponding reliability are applied to nonlinear time series forecast. However, constructing reliable prediction intervals for noisy time series is still a challenge. In this paper, a bootstrapping reservoir computing network ensemble (BRCNE) is proposed and a simultaneous training method based on Bayesian linear regression is developed. In addition, the structural parameters of the BRCNE, that is, the number of reservoir computing networks and the reservoir dimension, are determined off-line by the 0.632 bootstrap cross-validation. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, two kinds of time series data, including the multisuperimposed oscillator problem with additive noises and a practical gas flow in steel industry are employed here. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach has a satisfactory performance on prediction intervals for practical applications.",4
Sparse representation classifier steered discriminative projection with applications to face recognition.,"A sparse representation-based classifier (SRC) is developed and shows great potential for real-world face recognition. This paper presents a dimensionality reduction method that fits SRC well. SRC adopts a class reconstruction residual-based decision rule, we use it as a criterion to steer the design of a feature extraction method. The method is thus called the SRC steered discriminative projection (SRC-DP). SRC-DP maximizes the ratio of between-class reconstruction residual to within-class reconstruction residual in the projected space and thus enables SRC to achieve better performance. SRC-DP provides low-dimensional representation of human faces to make the SRC-based face recognition system more efficient. Experiments are done on the AR, the extended Yale B, and PIE face image databases, and results demonstrate the proposed method is more effective than other feature extraction methods based on the SRC.",4
Enhancing synchronizability of diffusively coupled dynamical networks: a survey.,"In this paper, we review the literature on enhancing synchronizability of diffusively coupled dynamical networks with identical nodes. The last decade has witnessed intensive investigations on the collective behavior over complex networks and synchronization of dynamical systems is the most common form of collective behavior. For many applications, it is desired that the synchronizability-the ability of networks in synchronizing activity of their individual dynamical units-is enhanced. There are a number of methods for improving the synchronization properties of dynamical networks through structural perturbation. In this paper, we survey such methods including adding/removing nodes and/or edges, rewiring the links, and graph weighting. These methods often try to enhance the synchronizability through minimizing the eigenratio of the Laplacian matrix of the connection graph-a synchronizability measure based on the master-stability-function formalism. We also assess the performance of the methods by numerical simulations on a number of real-world networks as well as those generated through models such as preferential attachment, Watts-Strogatz, and Erdos-Renyi.",4
Bogdanov-Takens singularity in tri-neuron network with time delay.,"This brief reports a retarded functional differential equation modeling tri-neuron network with time delay. The Bogdanov-Takens (B-T) bifurcation is investigated by using the center manifold reduction and the normal form method. We get the versal unfolding of the norm forms at the B-T singularity and show that the model can exhibit pitchfork, Hopf, homoclinic, and double-limit cycles bifurcations. Some numerical simulations are given to support the analytic results and explore chaotic dynamics. Finally, an algorithm is given to show that chaotic tri-neuron networks can be used for encrypting a color image.",4
Synchronization design of Boolean networks via the semi-tensor product method.,"We provide a general approach for the design of a response Boolean network (BN) to achieve complete synchronization with a given drive BN. The approach is based on the algebraic representation of BNs in terms of the semi-tensor product of matrices. Instead of designing the logical dynamic equations of a response BN directly, we first construct its algebraic representation and then convert the algebraic representation back to the logical form. The results are applied to a three-neuron network in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",4
Fast-convergent double-sigmoid Hopfield neural network as applied to optimization problems.,"The Hopfield neural network (HNN) has been widely used in numerous different optimization problems since the early 1980s. The convergence speed of the HNN (already in high gain) eventually plays a critical role in various real-time applications. In this brief, we propose and analyze a generalized HNN which drastically improves the convergence speed of the network, and thus allows benefiting from the HNN capabilities in solving the optimization problems in real time. By examining the channel allocation optimization problem in cellular radio systems, which is NP-complete and in which fast solution is necessary due to time-varying link gains, as well as the associative memory problem, computer simulations confirm the dramatic improvement in convergence speed at the expense of using a second nonlinear function in the proposed network.",4
Backtrackless walks on a graph.,"The aim of this paper is to explore the use of backtrackless walks and prime cycles for characterizing both labeled and unlabeled graphs. The reason for using backtrackless walks and prime cycles is that they avoid tottering, and can increase the discriminative power of the resulting graph representation. However, the use of such methods is limited in practice because of their computational cost. In this paper, we present efficient methods for computing graph kernels, which are based on backtrackless walks in a labeled graph and whose worst case running time is the same as that of kernels based on random walks. For clustering unlabeled graphs, we construct feature vectors using Ihara coefficients, since these coefficients are related to the frequencies of prime cycles in the graph. To efficiently compute the low order coefficients, we present an O(|V|(3)) algorithm which is better than the O(|V|(6)) worst case running time of previously known algorithms. In the experimental evaluation, we apply the proposed method to clustering both labeled and unlabeled graphs. The results show that using backtrackless walks and prime cycles instead of random walks can increase the accuracy of recognition.",4
Exponential family factors for Bayesian factor analysis.,"Expressing data as linear functions of a small number of unknown variables is a useful approach employed by several classical data analysis methods, e.g., factor analysis, principal component analysis, or latent semantic indexing. These models represent the data using the product of two factors. In practice, one important concern is how to link the learned factors to relevant quantities in the context of the application. To this end, various specialized forms of the factors have been proposed to improve interpretability. Toward developing a unified view and clarifying the statistical significance of the specialized factors, we propose a Bayesian model family. We employ exponential family distributions to specify various types of factors, which provide a unified probabilistic formulation. A Gibbs sampling procedure is constructed as a general computation routine. We verify the model by experiments, in which the proposed model is shown to be effective in both emulating existing models and motivating new model designs for particular problem settings.",4
Fractional norm regularization: learning with very few relevant features.,"Learning in the presence of a large number of irrelevant features is an important problem in high-dimensional tasks. Previous studies have shown that L1-norm regularization can be effective in such cases while L2-norm regularization is not. Furthermore, work in compressed sensing suggests that regularization by nonconvex (e.g., fractional) semi-norms may outperform L1-regularization. However, for classification it is largely unclear when this may or may not be the case. In addition, the nonconvex problem is harder to solve than the convex L1 problem. In this paper, we provide a more in-depth analysis to elucidate the potential advantages and pitfalls of nonconvex regularization in the context of logistic regression where the regularization term employs the family of Lq semi-norms. First, using results from the phenomenon of concentration of norms and distances in high dimensions, we gain intuition about the working of sparse estimation when the dimensionality is very high. Second, using the probably approximately correct (PAC)-Bayes methodology, we give a data-dependent bound on the generalization error of Lq-regularized logistic regression, which is applicable to any algorithm that implements this model, and may be used to predict its generalization behavior from the training set alone. Third, we demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by experiments and applications, where the PAC-Bayes bound is used to guide the choice of semi-norm in the regularization term. The results support the conclusion that the optimal choice of regularization depends on the relative fraction of relevant versus irrelevant features, and a fractional norm with a small exponent is most suitable when the fraction of relevant features is very small.",4
FSMRank: feature selection algorithm for learning to rank.,"In recent years, there has been growing interest in learning to rank. The introduction of feature selection into different learning problems has been proven effective. These facts motivate us to investigate the problem of feature selection for learning to rank. We propose a joint convex optimization formulation which minimizes ranking errors while simultaneously conducting feature selection. This optimization formulation provides a flexible framework in which we can easily incorporate various importance measures and similarity measures of the features. To solve this optimization problem, we use the Nesterov's approach to derive an accelerated gradient algorithm with a fast convergence rate O(1/T(2)). We further develop a generalization bound for the proposed optimization problem using the Rademacher complexities. Extensive experimental evaluations are conducted on the public LETOR benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed method shows: 1) significant ranking performance gain compared to several feature selection baselines for ranking, and 2) very competitive performance compared to several state-of-the-art learning-to-rank algorithms.",4
Sparse coding from a Bayesian perspective.,"Sparse coding is a promising theme in computer vision. Most of the existing sparse coding methods are based on either l0 or l1 penalty, which often leads to unstable solution or biased estimation. This is because of the nonconvexity and discontinuity of the l0 penalty and the over-penalization on the true large coefficients of the l1 penalty. In this paper, sparse coding is interpreted from a novel Bayesian perspective, which results in a new objective function through maximum a posteriori estimation. The obtained solution of the objective function can generate more stable results than the l0 penalty and smaller reconstruction errors than the l1 penalty. In addition, the convergence property of the proposed algorithm for sparse coding is also established. The experiments on applications in single image super-resolution and visual tracking demonstrate that the proposed method is more effective than other state-of-the-art methods.",4
Adaptive learning in tracking control based on the dual critic network design.,"In this paper, we present a new adaptive dynamic programming approach by integrating a reference network that provides an internal goal representation to help the systems learning and optimization. Specifically, we build the reference network on top of the critic network to form a dual critic network design that contains the detailed internal goal representation to help approximate the value function. This internal goal signal, working as the reinforcement signal for the critic network in our design, is adaptively generated by the reference network and can also be adjusted automatically. In this way, we provide an alternative choice rather than crafting the reinforcement signal manually from prior knowledge. In this paper, we adopt the online action-dependent heuristic dynamic programming (ADHDP) design and provide the detailed design of the dual critic network structure. Detailed Lyapunov stability analysis for our proposed approach is presented to support the proposed structure from a theoretical point of view. Furthermore, we also develop a virtual reality platform to demonstrate the real-time simulation of our approach under different disturbance situations. The overall adaptive learning performance has been tested on two tracking control benchmarks with a tracking filter. For comparative studies, we also present the tracking performance with the typical ADHDP, and the simulation results justify the improved performance with our approach.",4
Robust kernel representation with statistical local features for face recognition.,"Factors such as misalignment, pose variation, and occlusion make robust face recognition a difficult problem. It is known that statistical features such as local binary pattern are effective for local feature extraction, whereas the recently proposed sparse or collaborative representation-based classification has shown interesting results in robust face recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel robust kernel representation model with statistical local features (SLF) for robust face recognition. Initially, multipartition max pooling is used to enhance the invariance of SLF to image registration error. Then, a kernel-based representation model is proposed to fully exploit the discrimination information embedded in the SLF, and robust regression is adopted to effectively handle the occlusion in face images. Extensive experiments are conducted on benchmark face databases, including extended Yale B, AR (A. Martinez and R. Benavente), multiple pose, illumination, and expression (multi-PIE), facial recognition technology (FERET), face recognition grand challenge (FRGC), and labeled faces in the wild (LFW), which have different variations of lighting, expression, pose, and occlusions, demonstrating the promising performance of the proposed method.",4
Novel cost-sensitive approach to improve the multilayer perceptron performance on imbalanced data.,"Traditional learning algorithms applied to complex and highly imbalanced training sets may not give satisfactory results when distinguishing between examples of the classes. The tendency is to yield classification models that are biased towards the overrepresented (majority) class. This paper investigates this class imbalance problem in the context of multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks. The consequences of the equal cost (loss) assumption on imbalanced data are formally discussed from a statistical learning theory point of view. A new cost-sensitive algorithm (CSMLP) is presented to improve the discrimination ability of (two-class) MLPs. The CSMLP formulation is based on a joint objective function that uses a single cost parameter to distinguish the importance of class errors. The learning rule extends the Levenberg-Marquadt's rule, ensuring the computational efficiency of the algorithm. In addition, it is theoretically demonstrated that the incorporation of prior information via the cost parameter may lead to balanced decision boundaries in the feature space. Based on the statistical analysis of results on real data, our approach shows a significant improvement of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and G-mean measures of regular MLPs.",4
Effective neural network ensemble approach for improving generalization performance.,"This paper, with an aim at improving neural networks' generalization performance, proposes an effective neural network ensemble approach with two novel ideas. One is to apply neural networks' output sensitivity as a measure to evaluate neural networks' output diversity at the inputs near training samples so as to be able to select diverse individuals from a pool of well-trained neural networks; the other is to employ a learning mechanism to assign complementary weights for the combination of the selected individuals. Experimental results show that the proposed approach could construct a neural network ensemble with better generalization performance than that of each individual in the ensemble combining with all the other individuals, and than that of the ensembles with simply averaged weights.",4
"Impulsive control for existence, uniqueness, and global stability of periodic solutions of recurrent neural networks with discrete and continuously distributed delays.","In this paper, a class of recurrent neural networks with discrete and continuously distributed delays is considered. Sufficient conditions for the existence, uniqueness, and global exponential stability of a periodic solution are obtained by using contraction mapping theorem and stability theory on impulsive functional differential equations. The proposed method, which differs from the existing results in the literature, shows that network models may admit a periodic solution which is globally exponentially stable via proper impulsive control strategies even if it is originally unstable or divergent. Two numerical examples and their computer simulations are offered to show the effectiveness of our new results.",4
Algorithmic survey of parametric value function approximation.,"Reinforcement learning (RL) is a machine learning answer to the optimal control problem. It consists of learning an optimal control policy through interactions with the system to be controlled, the quality of this policy being quantified by the so-called value function. A recurrent subtopic of RL concerns computing an approximation of this value function when the system is too large for an exact representation. This survey reviews state-of-the-art methods for (parametric) value function approximation by grouping them into three main categories: bootstrapping, residual, and projected fixed-point approaches. Related algorithms are derived by considering one of the associated cost functions and a specific minimization method, generally a stochastic gradient descent or a recursive least-squares approach.",4
Self-tuning control with a filter and a neural compensator for a class of nonlinear systems.,"Considering the mismatching of model-process order, in this brief, a self-tuning proportional-integral-derivative (PID)-like controller is proposed by combining a pole assignment self-tuning PID controller with a filter and a neural compensator. To design the PID controller, a reduced order model is introduced, whose linear parameters are identified by a normalized projection algorithm with a deadzone. The higher order nonlinearity is estimated by a high order neural network. The gains of the PID controller are obtained by pole assignment, which together with other parameters are tuned on-line. The bounded-input bounded-output stability condition and convergence condition of the closed-loop system are presented. Simulations are conducted on the continuous stirred tank reactors system. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",4
Energy-efficient SVM learning control system for biped walking robots.,"An energy-efficient support vector machine (EE-SVM) learning control system considering the energy cost of each training sample of biped dynamic is proposed to realize energy-efficient biped walking. Energy costs of the biped walking samples are calculated. Then the samples are weighed with the inverses of the energy costs. An EE-SVM objective function with energy-related slack variables is proposed, which follows the principle that the sample with the lowest energy consumption is treated as the most important one in the training. That means the samples with lower energy consumption contribute more to the EE-SVM regression function learning, which highly increases the energy efficiency of the biped walking. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",4
Constraint verification with kernel machines.,"Based on a recently proposed framework of learning from constraints using kernel-based representations, in this brief, we naturally extend its application to the case of inferences on new constraints. We give examples for polynomials and first-order logic by showing how new constraints can be checked on the basis of given premises and data samples. Interestingly, this gives rise to a perceptual logic scheme in which the inference mechanisms do not rely only on formal schemes, but also on the data probability distribution. It is claimed that when using a properly relaxed computational checking approach, the complementary role of data samples makes it possible to break the complexity barriers of related formal checking mechanisms.",4
A one-layer projection neural network for nonsmooth optimization subject to linear equalities and bound constraints.,"This paper presents a one-layer projection neural network for solving nonsmooth optimization problems with generalized convex objective functions and subject to linear equalities and bound constraints. The proposed neural network is designed based on two projection operators: linear equality constraints, and bound constraints. The objective function in the optimization problem can be any nonsmooth function which is not restricted to be convex but is required to be convex (pseudoconvex) on a set defined by the constraints. Compared with existing recurrent neural networks for nonsmooth optimization, the proposed model does not have any design parameter, which is more convenient for design and implementation. It is proved that the output variables of the proposed neural network are globally convergent to the optimal solutions provided that the objective function is at least pseudoconvex. Simulation results of numerical examples are discussed to demonstrate the effectiveness and characteristics of the proposed neural network.",4
On stabilization of stochastic Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with mode-dependent mixed time-delays and Markovian switching.,"The globally exponential stabilization problem is investigated for a general class of stochastic Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with both Markovian jumping parameters and mixed mode-dependent time-delays. The mixed time-delays consist of both discrete and distributed delays. This paper aims to design a memoryless state feedback controller such that the closed-loop system is stochastically exponentially stable in the mean square sense. By introducing a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional that accounts for the mode-dependent mixed delays, stochastic analysis is conducted in order to derive delay-dependent criteria for the exponential stabilization problem. Three numerical examples are carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of our delay-dependent stabilization criteria.",4
Firing rate propagation through neuronal-astrocytic network.,"Understanding the underlying mechanism of the propagation of neuronal activities within the brain is a fundamental issue in neuroscience. Traditionally, communication and information processing have been exclusively considered as the province of synaptic coupling between neurons. Astrocytes, however, have recently been acknowledged as active partners in neuronal information processing. So, it is more reasonable and accurate to study the nature of neuronal signal propagation with the participation of astrocytes. In this paper, we first propose a feedforward neuronal-astrocytic network (FNAsN), which includes the mutual neuron-astrocyte interaction. Besides, we also consider the unreliability of both the synaptic transmission between neurons and the coupling between neurons and astrocytes. Then, the performance of firing rate propagation through the proposed FNAsN is studied through a series of simulations. Results show that the astrocytes can mediate neuronal activities, and consequently improve the performance of firing rate propagation, especially in a weak and noisy environment. From this point of view, astrocytes can be regarded as a realistic internal source of noise, which collaborates with an externally applied weak noise to prevent synchronous neuron firing within the same layer and thus to ensure reliable transmission.",4
Policy improvement by a model-free Dyna architecture.,"The objective of this paper is to accelerate the process of policy improvement in reinforcement learning. The proposed Dyna-style system combines two learning schemes, one of which utilizes a temporal difference method for direct learning; the other uses relative values for indirect learning in planning between two successive direct learning cycles. Instead of establishing a complicated world model, the approach introduces a simple predictor of average rewards to actor-critic architecture in the simulation (planning) mode. The relative value of a state, defined as the accumulated differences between immediate reward and average reward, is used to steer the improvement process in the right direction. The proposed learning scheme is applied to control a pendulum system for tracking a desired trajectory to demonstrate its adaptability and robustness. Through reinforcement signals from the environment, the system takes the appropriate action to drive an unknown dynamic to track desired outputs in few learning cycles. Comparisons are made between the proposed model-free method, a connectionist adaptive heuristic critic, and an advanced method of Dyna-Q learning in the experiments of labyrinth exploration. The proposed method outperforms its counterparts in terms of elapsed time and convergence rate.",4
Online learning control using adaptive critic designs with sparse kernel machines.,"In the past decade, adaptive critic designs (ACDs), including heuristic dynamic programming (HDP), dual heuristic programming (DHP), and their action-dependent ones, have been widely studied to realize online learning control of dynamical systems. However, because neural networks with manually designed features are commonly used to deal with continuous state and action spaces, the generalization capability and learning efficiency of previous ACDs still need to be improved. In this paper, a novel framework of ACDs with sparse kernel machines is presented by integrating kernel methods into the critic of ACDs. To improve the generalization capability as well as the computational efficiency of kernel machines, a sparsification method based on the approximately linear dependence analysis is used. Using the sparse kernel machines, two kernel-based ACD algorithms, that is, kernel HDP (KHDP) and kernel DHP (KDHP), are proposed and their performance is analyzed both theoretically and empirically. Because of the representation learning and generalization capability of sparse kernel machines, KHDP and KDHP can obtain much better performance than previous HDP and DHP with manually designed neural networks. Simulation and experimental results of two nonlinear control problems, that is, a continuous-action inverted pendulum problem and a ball and plate control problem, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed kernel ACD methods.",4
Soft margin multiple kernel learning.,"Multiple kernel learning (MKL) has been proposed for kernel methods by learning the optimal kernel from a set of predefined base kernels. However, the traditional L1MKL method often achieves worse results than the simplest method using the average of base kernels (i.e., average kernel) in some practical applications. In order to improve the effectiveness of MKL, this paper presents a novel soft margin perspective for MKL. Specifically, we introduce an additional slack variable called kernel slack variable to each quadratic constraint of MKL, which corresponds to one support vector machine model using a single base kernel. We first show that L1MKL can be deemed as hard margin MKL, and then we propose a novel soft margin framework for MKL. Three commonly used loss functions, including the hinge loss, the square hinge loss, and the square loss, can be readily incorporated into this framework, leading to the new soft margin MKL objective functions. Many existing MKL methods can be shown as special cases under our soft margin framework. For example, the hinge loss soft margin MKL leads to a new box constraint for kernel combination coefficients. Using different hyper-parameter values for this formulation, we can inherently bridge the method using average kernel, L1MKL, and the hinge loss soft margin MKL. The square hinge loss soft margin MKL unifies the family of elastic net constraint/regularizer based approaches; and the square loss soft margin MKL incorporates L2MKL naturally. Moreover, we also develop efficient algorithms for solving both the hinge loss and square hinge loss soft margin MKL. Comprehensive experimental studies for various MKL algorithms on several benchmark data sets and two real world applications, including video action recognition and event recognition demonstrate that our proposed algorithms can efficiently achieve an effective yet sparse solution for MKL.",4
Asynchronous cellular automaton-based neuron: theoretical analysis and on-FPGA learning.,"A generalized asynchronous cellular automaton-based neuron model is a special kind of cellular automaton that is designed to mimic the nonlinear dynamics of neurons. The model can be implemented as an asynchronous sequential logic circuit and its control parameter is the pattern of wires among the circuit elements that is adjustable after implementation in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) device. In this paper, a novel theoretical analysis method for the model is presented. Using this method, stabilities of neuron-like orbits and occurrence mechanisms of neuron-like bifurcations of the model are clarified theoretically. Also, a novel learning algorithm for the model is presented. An equivalent experiment shows that an FPGA-implemented learning algorithm enables an FPGA-implemented model to automatically reproduce typical nonlinear responses and occurrence mechanisms observed in biological and model neurons.",4
Stopped object detection by learning foreground model in videos.,"The automatic detection of objects that are abandoned or removed in a video scene is an interesting area of computer vision, with key applications in video surveillance. Forgotten or stolen luggage in train and airport stations and irregularly parked vehicles are examples that concern significant issues, such as the fight against terrorism and crime, and public safety. Both issues involve the basic task of detecting static regions in the scene. We address this problem by introducing a model-based framework to segment static foreground objects against moving foreground objects in single view sequences taken from stationary cameras. An image sequence model, obtained by learning in a self-organizing neural network image sequence variations, seen as trajectories of pixels in time, is adopted within the model-based framework. Experimental results on real video sequences and comparisons with existing approaches show the accuracy of the proposed stopped object detection approach.",4
Multiview vector-valued manifold regularization for multilabel image classification.,"In computer vision, image datasets used for classification are naturally associated with multiple labels and comprised of multiple views, because each image may contain several objects (e.g., pedestrian, bicycle, and tree) and is properly characterized by multiple visual features (e.g., color, texture, and shape). Currently, available tools ignore either the label relationship or the view complementarily. Motivated by the success of the vector-valued function that constructs matrix-valued kernels to explore the multilabel structure in the output space, we introduce multiview vector-valued manifold regularization (MV(3)MR) to integrate multiple features. MV(3)MR exploits the complementary property of different features and discovers the intrinsic local geometry of the compact support shared by different features under the theme of manifold regularization. We conduct extensive experiments on two challenging, but popular, datasets, PASCAL VOC' 07 and MIR Flickr, and validate the effectiveness of the proposed MV(3)MR for image classification.",4
Complex-valued filtering based on the minimization of complex-error entropy.,"In this paper, we consider the training of complex-valued filter based on the information theoretic method. We first generalize the error entropy criterion to complex domain to present the complex error entropy criterion (CEEC). Due to the difficulty in estimating the entropy of complex-valued error directly, the entropy bound minimization (EBM) method is used to compute the upper bounds of the entropy of the complex-valued error, and the tightest bound selected by the EBM algorithm is used as the estimator of the complex-error entropy. Then, based on the minimization of complex-error entropy (MCEE) and the complex gradient descent approach, complex-valued learning algorithms for both the (linear) transverse filter and the (nonlinear) neural network are derived. The algorithms are applied to complex-valued linear filtering and complex-valued nonlinear channel equalization to demonstrate their effectiveness and advantages.",4
Nonstationary source separation using sequential and variational Bayesian learning.,"Independent component analysis (ICA) is a popular approach for blind source separation where the mixing process is assumed to be unchanged with a fixed set of stationary source signals. However, the mixing system and source signals are nonstationary in real-world applications, e.g., the source signals may abruptly appear or disappear, the sources may be replaced by new ones or even moving by time. This paper presents an online learning algorithm for the Gaussian process (GP) and establishes a separation procedure in the presence of nonstationary and temporally correlated mixing coefficients and source signals. In this procedure, we capture the evolved statistics from sequential signals according to online Bayesian learning. The activity of nonstationary sources is reflected by an automatic relevance determination, which is incrementally estimated at each frame and continuously propagated to the next frame. We employ the GP to characterize the temporal structures of time-varying mixing coefficients and source signals. A variational Bayesian inference is developed to approximate the true posterior for estimating the nonstationary ICA parameters and for characterizing the activity of latent sources. The differences between this ICA method and the sequential Monte Carlo ICA are illustrated. In the experiments, the proposed algorithm outperforms the other ICA methods for the separation of audio signals in the presence of different nonstationary scenarios.",4
Ensemble pruning using spectral coefficients.,"Ensemble pruning aims to increase efficiency by reducing the number of base classifiers, without sacrificing and preferably enhancing performance. In this brief, a novel pruning paradigm is proposed. Two class supervised learning problems are pruned using a combination of first- and second-order Walsh coefficients. A comparison is made with other ordered aggregation pruning methods, using multilayer perceptron base classifiers. The Walsh pruning method is analyzed with the help of a model that shows the relationship between second-order coefficients and added classification error with respect to Bayes error.",4
Distributed consensus tracking for multiple uncertain nonlinear strict-feedback systems under a directed graph.,"In this brief, we study the distributed consensus tracking control problem for multiple strict-feedback systems with unknown nonlinearities under a directed graph topology. It is assumed that the leader's output is time-varying and has been accessed by only a small fraction of followers in a group. The distributed dynamic surface design approach is proposed to design local consensus controllers in order to guarantee the consensus tracking between the followers and the leader. The function approximation technique using neural networks is employed to compensate unknown nonlinear terms induced from the controller design procedure. From the Lyapunov stability theorem, it is shown that the consensus errors are cooperatively semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded and converge to an adjustable neighborhood of the origin.",4
New parameter-free simplified swarm optimization for artificial neural network training and its application in the prediction of time series.,"A new soft computing method called the parameter-free simplified swarm optimization (SSO)-based artificial neural network (ANN), or improved SSO for short, is proposed to adjust the weights in ANNs. The method is a modification of the SSO, and seeks to overcome some of the drawbacks of SSO. In the experiments, the iSSO is compared with five other famous soft computing methods, including the backpropagation algorithm, the genetic algorithm, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, cooperative random learning PSO, and the SSO, and its performance is tested on five famous time-series benchmark data to adjust the weights of two ANN models (multilayer perceptron and single multiplicative neuron model). The experimental results demonstrate that iSSO is robust and more efficient than the other five algorithms.",4
Dynamic sampling approach to training neural networks for multiclass imbalance classification.,"Class imbalance learning tackles supervised learning problems where some classes have significantly more examples than others. Most of the existing research focused only on binary-class cases. In this paper, we study multiclass imbalance problems and propose a dynamic sampling method (DyS) for multilayer perceptrons (MLP). In DyS, for each epoch of the training process, every example is fed to the current MLP and then the probability of it being selected for training the MLP is estimated. DyS dynamically selects informative data to train the MLP. In order to evaluate DyS and understand its strength and weakness, comprehensive experimental studies have been carried out. Results on 20 multiclass imbalanced data sets show that DyS can outperform the compared methods, including pre-sample methods, active learning methods, cost-sensitive methods, and boosting-type methods.",4
Least square regularized regression in sum space.,"This paper proposes a least square regularized regression algorithm in sum space of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) for nonflat function approximation, and obtains the solution of the algorithm by solving a system of linear equations. This algorithm can approximate the low- and high-frequency component of the target function with large and small scale kernels, respectively. The convergence and learning rate are analyzed. We measure the complexity of the sum space by its covering number and demonstrate that the covering number can be bounded by the product of the covering numbers of basic RKHSs. For sum space of RKHSs with Gaussian kernels, by choosing appropriate parameters, we tradeoff the sample error and regularization error, and obtain a polynomial learning rate, which is better than that in any single RKHS. The utility of this method is illustrated with two simulated data sets and five real-life databases.",4
Just-in-time classifiers for recurrent concepts.,"Just-in-time (JIT) classifiers operate in evolving environments by classifying instances and reacting to concept drift. In stationary conditions, a JIT classifier improves its accuracy over time by exploiting additional supervised information coming from the field. In nonstationary conditions, however, the classifier reacts as soon as concept drift is detected; the current classification setup is discarded and a suitable one activated to keep the accuracy high. We present a novel generation of JIT classifiers able to deal with recurrent concept drift by means of a practical formalization of the concept representation and the definition of a set of operators working on such representations. The concept-drift detection activity, which is crucial in promptly reacting to changes exactly when needed, is advanced by considering change-detection tests monitoring both inputs and classes distributions.",4
Optimizing spatial filters by minimizing within-class dissimilarities in electroencephalogram-based brain-computer interface.,"A major challenge in electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) is the inherent nonstationarities in the EEG data. Variations of the signal properties from intra and inter sessions often lead to deteriorated BCI performances, as features extracted by methods such as common spatial patterns (CSP) are not invariant against the changes. To extract features that are robust and invariant, this paper proposes a novel spatial filtering algorithm called Kullback-Leibler (KL) CSP. The CSP algorithm only considers the discrimination between the means of the classes, but does not consider within-class scatters information. In contrast, the proposed KLCSP algorithm simultaneously maximizes the discrimination between the class means, and minimizes the within-class dissimilarities measured by a loss function based on the KL divergence. The performance of the proposed KLCSP algorithm is compared against two existing algorithms, CSP and stationary CSP (sCSP), using the publicly available BCI competition III dataset IVa and a large dataset from stroke patients performing neuro-rehabilitation. The results show that the proposed KLCSP algorithm significantly outperforms both the CSP and the sCSP algorithms, in terms of classification accuracy, by reducing within-class variations. This results in more compact and separable features.",4
Online support vector machine based on convex hull vertices selection.,"The support vector machine (SVM) method, as a promising classification technique, has been widely used in various fields due to its high efficiency. However, SVM cannot effectively solve online classification problems since, when a new sample is misclassified, the classifier has to be retrained with all training samples plus the new sample, which is time consuming. According to the geometric characteristics of SVM, in this paper we propose an online SVM classifier called VS-OSVM, which is based on convex hull vertices selection within each class. The VS-OSVM algorithm has two steps: 1) the samples selection process, in which a small number of skeleton samples constituting an approximate convex hull in each class of the current training samples are selected and 2) the online updating process, in which the classifier is updated with newly arriving samples and the selected skeleton samples. From the theoretical point of view, the first d+1 (d is the dimension of the input samples) selected samples are proved to be vertices of the convex hull. This guarantees that the selected samples in our approach keep the greatest amount of information of the convex hull. From the application point of view, the new algorithm can update the classifier without reducing its classification performance. Experimental results on benchmark data sets have shown the validity and effectiveness of the VS-OSVM algorithm.",4
Common nature of learning between back-propagation and Hopfield-type neural networks for generalized matrix inversion with simplified models.,"In this paper, two simple-structure neural networks based on the error back-propagation (BP) algorithm (i.e., BP-type neural networks, BPNNs) are proposed, developed, and investigated for online generalized matrix inversion. Specifically, the BPNN-L and BPNN-R models are proposed and investigated for the left and right generalized matrix inversion, respectively. In addition, for the same problem-solving task, two discrete-time Hopfield-type neural networks (HNNs) are developed and investigated in this paper. Similar to the classification of the presented BPNN-L and BPNN-R models, the presented HNN-L and HNN-R models correspond to the left and right generalized matrix inversion, respectively. Comparing the BPNN weight-updating formula with the HNN state-transition equation for the specific (i.e., left or right) generalized matrix inversion, we show that such two derived learning-expressions turn out to be the same (in mathematics), although the BP and Hopfield-type neural networks are evidently different from each other a great deal, in terms of network architecture, physical meaning, and training patterns. Numerical results with different illustrative examples further demonstrate the efficacy of the presented BPNNs and HNNs for online generalized matrix inversion and, more importantly, their common natures of learning.",4
Cluster consensus in discrete-time networks of multiagents with inter-cluster nonidentical inputs.,"In this paper, cluster consensus of multiagent systems is studied via inter-cluster nonidentical inputs. Here, we consider general graph topologies, which might be time-varying. The cluster consensus is defined by two aspects: intracluster synchronization, the state at which differences between each pair of agents in the same cluster converge to zero, and inter-cluster separation, the state at which agents in different clusters are separated. For intra-cluster synchronization, the concepts and theories of consensus, including the spanning trees, scramblingness, infinite stochastic matrix product, and Hajnal inequality, are extended. As a result, it is proved that if the graph has cluster spanning trees and all vertices self-linked, then the static linear system can realize intra-cluster synchronization. For the time-varying coupling cases, it is proved that if there exists T > 0 such that the union graph across any T-length time interval has cluster spanning trees and all graphs has all vertices self-linked, then the time-varying linear system can also realize intra-cluster synchronization. Under the assumption of common inter-cluster influence, a sort of inter-cluster nonidentical inputs are utilized to realize inter-cluster separation, such that each agent in the same cluster receives the same inputs and agents in different clusters have different inputs. In addition, the boundedness of the infinite sum of the inputs can guarantee the boundedness of the trajectory. As an application, we employ a modified non-Bayesian social learning model to illustrate the effectiveness of our results.",4
Noise-shaping gradient descent-based online adaptation algorithms for digital calibration of analog circuits.,"Analog circuits that are calibrated using digital-to-analog converters (DACs) use a digital signal processor-based algorithm for real-time adaptation and programming of system parameters. In this paper, we first show that this conventional framework for adaptation yields suboptimal calibration properties because of artifacts introduced by quantization noise. We then propose a novel online stochastic optimization algorithm called noise-shaping or SigmaDelta gradient descent, which can shape the quantization noise out of the frequency regions spanning the parameter adaptation trajectories. As a result, the proposed algorithms demonstrate superior parameter search properties compared to floating-point gradient methods and better convergence properties than conventional quantized gradient-methods. In the second part of this paper, we apply the SigmaDelta gradient descent algorithm to two examples of real-time digital calibration: 1) balancing and tracking of bias currents, and 2) frequency calibration of a band-pass Gm-C biquad filter biased in weak inversion. For each of these examples, the circuits have been prototyped in a 0.5-mum complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor process, and we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to find the optimal solution even in the presence of spurious local minima, which are introduced by the nonlinear and non-monotonic response of calibration DACs.",4
Granular neural networks: concepts and development schemes.,"In this paper, we introduce a concept of a granular neural network and develop its comprehensive design process. The proposed granular network is formed on the basis of a given (numeric) neural network whose structure is augmented by the formation of granular connections (being realized as intervals) spanned over the numeric ones. Owing to its simplicity of the underlying processing, the interval connections become an appealing alternative of information granules to clarify the main idea. We introduce a concept of information granularity and its quantification (viewed as a level of information granularity). Being treated as an essential design asset, the assumed level of information granularity is distributed (allocated) among the connections of the network in several different ways so that certain performance index becomes maximized. Due to the high dimensionality nature of some protocols of allocation of information granularity and the nature of the allocation process itself, single-objective versions of particle swarm optimization is considered a suitable optimization vehicle. As we are concerned with the granular output of the network, which has to be evaluated with regard to the numeric target of data, two criteria are considered; namely, coverage of numeric data and specificity of information granules (intervals). A series of numeric studies completed for synthetic data and data coming from the machine learning and StatLib repositories provide a useful insight into the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",4
Projection-based fast learning fully complex-valued relaxation neural network.,"This paper presents a fully complex-valued relaxation network (FCRN) with its projection-based learning algorithm. The FCRN is a single hidden layer network with a Gaussian-like sech activation function in the hidden layer and an exponential activation function in the output layer. For a given number of hidden neurons, the input weights are assigned randomly and the output weights are estimated by minimizing a nonlinear logarithmic function (called as an energy function) which explicitly contains both the magnitude and phase errors. A projection-based learning algorithm determines the optimal output weights corresponding to the minima of the energy function by converting the nonlinear programming problem into that of solving a set of simultaneous linear algebraic equations. The resultant FCRN approximates the desired output more accurately with a lower computational effort. The classification ability of FCRN is evaluated using a set of real-valued benchmark classification problems from the University of California, Irvine machine learning repository. Here, a circular transformation is used to transform the real-valued input features to the complex domain. Next, the FCRN is used to solve three practical problems: a quadrature amplitude modulation channel equalization, an adaptive beamforming, and a mammogram classification. Performance results from this paper clearly indicate the superior classification/approximation performance of the FCRN.",4
Factor analysis of auto-associative neural networks with application in speaker verification.,"Auto-associative neural network (AANN) is a fully connected feed-forward neural network, trained to reconstruct its input at its output through a hidden compression layer, which has fewer numbers of nodes than the dimensionality of input. AANNs are used to model speakers in speaker verification, where a speaker-specific AANN model is obtained by adapting (or retraining) the universal background model (UBM) AANN, an AANN trained on multiple held out speakers, using corresponding speaker data. When the amount of speaker data is limited, this adaptation procedure may lead to overfitting as all the parameters of UBM-AANN are adapted. In this paper, we introduce and develop the factor analysis theory of AANNs to alleviate this problem. We hypothesize that only the weight matrix connecting the last nonlinear hidden layer and the output layer is speaker-specific, and further restrict it to a common low-dimensional subspace during adaptation. The subspace is learned using large amounts of development data, and is held fixed during adaptation. Thus, only the coordinates in a subspace, also known as i-vector, need to be estimated using speaker-specific data. The update equations are derived for learning both the common low-dimensional subspace and the i-vectors corresponding to speakers in the subspace. The resultant i-vector representation is used as a feature for the probabilistic linear discriminant analysis model. The proposed system shows promising results on the NIST-08 speaker recognition evaluation (SRE), and yields a 23% relative improvement in equal error rate over the previously proposed weighted least squares-based subspace AANNs system. The experiments on NIST-10 SRE confirm that these improvements are consistent and generalize across datasets.",4
Stability analysis for neural networks with time-varying delay based on quadratic convex combination.,"In this paper, a novel method is developed for the stability problem of a class of neural networks with time-varying delay. New delay-dependent stability criteria in terms of linear matrix inequalities for recurrent neural networks with time-varying delay are derived by the newly proposed augmented simple Lyapunov-Krasovski functional. Different from previous results by using the first-order convex combination property, our derivation applies the idea of second-order convex combination and the property of quadratic convex function which is given in the form of a lemma without resorting to Jensen's inequality. A numerical example is provided to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the presented results.",4
Data-driven MFAC for a class of discrete-time nonlinear systems with RBFNN.,"A novel model-free adaptive control method is proposed for a class of discrete-time single input single output (SISO) nonlinear systems, where the equivalent dynamic linearization technique is used on the ideal nonlinear controller. With radial basis function neural network, the controller parameters are tuned on-line directly using the measured input and output data of the plant, when the plant model is unavailable. The stability of the proposed method is guaranteed by rigorous theoretical analysis, and the effectiveness and applicability are verified by numerical simulation and further demonstrated by the experiment on three tanks water level control process.",4
A scalable stagewise approach to large-margin multiclass loss-based boosting.,"We present a scalable and effective classification model to train multiclass boosting for multiclass classification problems. A direct formulation of multiclass boosting had been introduced in the past in the sense that it directly maximized the multiclass margin. The major problem of that approach is its high computational complexity during training, which hampers its application to real-world problems. In this paper, we propose a scalable and simple stagewise multiclass boosting method which also directly maximizes the multiclass margin. Our approach offers the following advantages: 1) it is simple and computationally efficient to train. The approach can speed up the training time by more than two orders of magnitude without sacrificing the classification accuracy and 2) like traditional AdaBoost, it is less sensitive to the choice of parameters and empirically demonstrates excellent generalization performance. Experimental results on challenging multiclass machine learning and vision tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach substantially improves the convergence rate and accuracy of the final visual detector at no additional computational cost compared to existing multiclass boosting.",4
Incipient interturn fault diagnosis in induction machines using an analytic wavelet-based optimized Bayesian inference.,"Interturn fault diagnosis of induction machines has been discussed using various neural network-based techniques. The main challenge in such methods is the computational complexity due to the huge size of the network, and in pruning a large number of parameters. In this paper, a nearly shift insensitive complex wavelet-based probabilistic neural network (PNN) model, which has only a single parameter to be optimized, is proposed for interturn fault detection. The algorithm constitutes two parts and runs in an iterative way. In the first part, the PNN structure determination has been discussed, which finds out the optimum size of the network using an orthogonal least squares regression algorithm, thereby reducing its size. In the second part, a Bayesian classifier fusion has been recommended as an effective solution for deciding the machine condition. The testing accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity values are highest for the product rule-based fusion scheme, which is obtained under load, supply, and frequency variations. The point of overfitting of PNN is determined, which reduces the size, without compromising the performance. Moreover, a comparative evaluation with traditional discrete wavelet transform-based method is demonstrated for performance evaluation and to appreciate the obtained results.",4
Storing sparse messages in networks of neural cliques.,"An extension to a recently introduced binary neural network is proposed to allow the storage of sparse messages, in large numbers and with high memory efficiency. This new network is justified both in biological and informational terms. The storage and retrieval rules are detailed and illustrated by various simulation results.",4
Modeling of batch processes using explicitly time-dependent artificial neural networks.,"A neural network architecture incorporating time dependency explicitly, proposed recently, for modeling nonlinear nonstationary dynamic systems is further developed in this paper, and three alternate configurations are proposed to represent the dynamics of batch chemical processes. The first configuration consists of L subnets, each having M inputs representing the past samples of process inputs and output; each subnet has a hidden layer with polynomial activation function; the outputs of the hidden layer are combined and acted upon by an explicitly time-dependent modulation function. The outputs of all the subnets are summed to obtain the output prediction. In the second configuration, additional weights are incorporated to obtain a more generalized model. In the third configuration, the subnets are eliminated by incorporating an additional hidden layer consisting of L nodes. Backpropagation learning algorithm is formulated for each of the proposed neural network configuration to determine the weights, the polynomial coefficients, and the modulation function parameters. The modeling capability of the proposed neural network configuration is evaluated by employing it to represent the dynamics of a batch reactor in which a consecutive reaction takes place. The results show that all the three time-varying neural networks configurations are able to represent the batch reactor dynamics accurately, and it is found that the third configuration is exhibiting comparable or better performance over the other two configurations while requiring much smaller number of parameters. The modeling ability of the third configuration is further validated by applying to modeling a semibatch polymerization reactor challenge problem. This paper illustrates that the proposed approach can be applied to represent dynamics of any batch/semibatch process.",4
Simplified interval type-2 fuzzy neural networks.,"This paper describes a self-evolving interval type-2 fuzzy neural network (FNN) for various applications. As type-1 fuzzy systems cannot effectively handle uncertainties in information within the knowledge base, we propose a simple interval type-2 FNN, which uses interval type-2 fuzzy sets in the premise and the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) type in the consequent of the fuzzy rule. The TSK-type consequent of fuzzy rule is a linear combination of exogenous input variables. Given an initially empty the rule-base, all rules are generated with on-line type-2 fuzzy clustering. Instead of the time-consuming K-M iterative procedure, the design factors ql and qr are learned to adaptively adjust the upper and lower positions on the left and right limit outputs, using the parameter update rule based on a gradient descent algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach yields fewer test errors and less computational complexity than other type-2 FNNs.",4
Adaptive neural tracking control for a class of nonstrict-feedback stochastic nonlinear systems with unknown backlash-like hysteresis.,"This paper considers the problem of adaptive neural control of stochastic nonlinear systems in nonstrict-feedback form with unknown backlash-like hysteresis nonlinearities. To overcome the design difficulty of nonstrict-feedback structure, variable separation technique is used to decompose the unknown functions of all state variables into a sum of smooth functions of each error dynamic. By combining radial basis function neural networks' universal approximation capability with an adaptive backstepping technique, an adaptive neural control algorithm is proposed. It is shown that the proposed controller guarantees that all the signals in the closed-loop system are four-moment semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded, and the tracking error eventually converges to a small neighborhood of the origin in the sense of mean quartic value. Simulation results further show the effectiveness of the presented control scheme.",4
On the impact of approximate computation in an analog DeSTIN architecture.,"Deep machine learning (DML) holds the potential to revolutionize machine learning by automating rich feature extraction, which has become the primary bottleneck of human engineering in pattern recognition systems. However, the heavy computational burden renders DML systems implemented on conventional digital processors impractical for large-scale problems. The highly parallel computations required to implement large-scale deep learning systems are well suited to custom hardware. Analog computation has demonstrated power efficiency advantages of multiple orders of magnitude relative to digital systems while performing nonideal computations. In this paper, we investigate typical error sources introduced by analog computational elements and their impact on system-level performance in DeSTIN--a compositional deep learning architecture. These inaccuracies are evaluated on a pattern classification benchmark, clearly demonstrating the robustness of the underlying algorithm to the errors introduced by analog computational elements. A clear understanding of the impacts of nonideal computations is necessary to fully exploit the efficiency of analog circuits.",4
Fidelity-based probabilistic Q-learning for control of quantum systems.,"The balance between exploration and exploitation is a key problem for reinforcement learning methods, especially for Q-learning. In this paper, a fidelity-based probabilistic Q-learning (FPQL) approach is presented to naturally solve this problem and applied for learning control of quantum systems. In this approach, fidelity is adopted to help direct the learning process and the probability of each action to be selected at a certain state is updated iteratively along with the learning process, which leads to a natural exploration strategy instead of a pointed one with configured parameters. A probabilistic Q-learning (PQL) algorithm is first presented to demonstrate the basic idea of probabilistic action selection. Then the FPQL algorithm is presented for learning control of quantum systems. Two examples (a spin-1/2 system and a Lambda-type atomic system) are demonstrated to test the performance of the FPQL algorithm. The results show that FPQL algorithms attain a better balance between exploration and exploitation, and can also avoid local optimal policies and accelerate the learning process.",4
An online outlier identification and removal scheme for improving fault detection performance.,"Measured data or states for a nonlinear dynamic system is usually contaminated by outliers. Identifying and removing outliers will make the data (or system states) more trustworthy and reliable since outliers in the measured data (or states) can cause missed or false alarms during fault diagnosis. In addition, faults can make the system states nonstationary needing a novel analytical model-based fault detection (FD) framework. In this paper, an online outlier identification and removal (OIR) scheme is proposed for a nonlinear dynamic system. Since the dynamics of the system can experience unknown changes due to faults, traditional observer-based techniques cannot be used to remove the outliers. The OIR scheme uses a neural network (NN) to estimate the actual system states from measured system states involving outliers. With this method, the outlier detection is performed online at each time instant by finding the difference between the estimated and the measured states and comparing its median with its standard deviation over a moving time window. The NN weight update law in OIR is designed such that the detected outliers will have no effect on the state estimation, which is subsequently used for model-based fault diagnosis. In addition, since the OIR estimator cannot distinguish between the faulty or healthy operating conditions, a separate model-based observer is designed for fault diagnosis, which uses the OIR scheme as a preprocessing unit to improve the FD performance. The stability analysis of both OIR and fault diagnosis schemes are introduced. Finally, a three-tank benchmarking system and a simple linear system are used to verify the proposed scheme in simulations, and then the scheme is applied on an axial piston pump testbed. The scheme can be applied to nonlinear systems whose dynamics and underlying distribution of states are subjected to change due to both unknown faults and operating conditions.",4
"A spiking self-organizing map combining STDP, oscillations, and continuous learning.","The self-organizing map (SOM) is a neural network algorithm to create topographically ordered spatial representations of an input data set using unsupervised learning. The SOM algorithm is inspired by the feature maps found in mammalian cortices but lacks some important functional properties of its biological equivalents. Neurons have no direct access to global information, transmit information through spikes and may be using phasic coding of spike times within synchronized oscillations, receive continuous input from the environment, do not necessarily alter network properties such as learning rate and lateral connectivity throughout training, and learn through relative timing of action potentials across a synaptic connection. In this paper, a network of integrate-and-fire neurons is presented that incorporates solutions to each of these issues through the neuron model and network structure. Results of the simulated experiments assessing map formation using artificial data as well as the Iris and Wisconsin Breast Cancer datasets show that this novel implementation maintains fundamental properties of the conventional SOM, thereby representing a significant step toward further understanding of the self-organizational properties of the brain while providing an additional method for implementing SOMs that can be utilized for future modeling in software or special purpose spiking neuron hardware.",4
Robust adaptive dynamic programming and feedback stabilization of nonlinear systems.,"This paper studies the robust optimal control design for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems from a perspective of robust adaptive dynamic programming (RADP). The objective is to fill up a gap in the past literature of adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) where dynamic uncertainties or unmodeled dynamics are not addressed. A key strategy is to integrate tools from modern nonlinear control theory, such as the robust redesign and the backstepping techniques as well as the nonlinear small-gain theorem, with the theory of ADP. The proposed RADP methodology can be viewed as an extension of ADP to uncertain nonlinear systems. Practical learning algorithms are developed in this paper, and have been applied to the controller design problems for a jet engine and a one-machine power system.",4
Efficient algorithms for exact inference in sequence labeling SVMs.,"The task of structured output prediction deals with learning general functional dependencies between arbitrary input and output spaces. In this context, two loss-sensitive formulations for maximum-margin training have been proposed in the literature, which are referred to as margin and slack rescaling, respectively. The latter is believed to be more accurate and easier to handle. Nevertheless, it is not popular due to the lack of known efficient inference algorithms; therefore, margin rescaling--which requires a similar type of inference as normal structured prediction--is the most often used approach. Focusing on the task of label sequence learning, we here define a general framework that can handle a large class of inference problems based on Hamming-like loss functions and the concept of decomposability for the underlying joint feature map. In particular, we present an efficient generic algorithm that can handle both rescaling approaches and is guaranteed to find an optimal solution in polynomial time.",4
Classification in the presence of label noise: a survey.,"Label noise is an important issue in classification, with many potential negative consequences. For example, the accuracy of predictions may decrease, whereas the complexity of inferred models and the number of necessary training samples may increase. Many works in the literature have been devoted to the study of label noise and the development of techniques to deal with label noise. However, the field lacks a comprehensive survey on the different types of label noise, their consequences and the algorithms that consider label noise. This paper proposes to fill this gap. First, the definitions and sources of label noise are considered and a taxonomy of the types of label noise is proposed. Second, the potential consequences of label noise are discussed. Third, label noise-robust, label noise cleansing, and label noise-tolerant algorithms are reviewed. For each category of approaches, a short discussion is proposed to help the practitioner to choose the most suitable technique in its own particular field of application. Eventually, the design of experiments is also discussed, what may interest the researchers who would like to test their own algorithms. In this paper, label noise consists of mislabeled instances: no additional information is assumed to be available like e.g., confidences on labels.",4
Sparse Bayesian extreme learning machine for multi-classification.,"Extreme learning machine (ELM) has become a popular topic in machine learning in recent years. ELM is a new kind of single-hidden layer feedforward neural network with an extremely low computational cost. ELM, however, has two evident drawbacks: 1) the output weights solved by Moore-Penrose generalized inverse is a least squares minimization issue, which easily suffers from overfitting and 2) the accuracy of ELM is drastically sensitive to the number of hidden neurons so that a large model is usually generated. This brief presents a sparse Bayesian approach for learning the output weights of ELM in classification. The new model, called Sparse Bayesian ELM (SBELM), can resolve these two drawbacks by estimating the marginal likelihood of network outputs and automatically pruning most of the redundant hidden neurons during learning phase, which results in an accurate and compact model. The proposed SBELM is evaluated on wide types of benchmark classification problems, which verifies that the accuracy of SBELM model is relatively insensitive to the number of hidden neurons; and hence a much more compact model is always produced as compared with other state-of-the-art neural network classifiers.",4
"Local stability analysis of discrete-time, continuous-state, complex-valued recurrent neural networks with inner state feedback.","Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are well known for their capability to minimize suitable cost functions without the need for a training phase. This is possible because they can be Lyapunov stable. Although the global stability analysis has attracted a lot of interest, local stability is desirable for specific applications. In this brief, we investigate the local asymptotical stability of two classes of discrete-time, continuous-state, complex-valued RNNs with parallel update and inner state feedback. We show that many already known results are special cases of the results obtained here. We also generalize some known results from the real-valued case to the complex-valued one. Finally, we investigate the stability in the presence of time-variant activation functions. Complex-valued activation functions in this brief are separable with respect to the real and imaginary parts.",4
A recurrent neural network for solving bilevel linear programming problem.,"In this brief, based on the method of penalty functions, a recurrent neural network (NN) modeled by means of a differential inclusion is proposed for solving the bilevel linear programming problem (BLPP). Compared with the existing NNs for BLPP, the model has the least number of state variables and simple structure. Using nonsmooth analysis, the theory of differential inclusions, and Lyapunov-like method, the equilibrium point sequence of the proposed NNs can approximately converge to an optimal solution of BLPP under certain conditions. Finally, the numerical simulations of a supply chain distribution model have shown excellent performance of the proposed recurrent NNs.",4
"Self-organization in autonomous, recurrent, firing-rate CrossNets with quasi-Hebbian plasticity.","We have performed extensive numerical simulations of the autonomous evolution of memristive neuromorphic networks (CrossNets) with the recurrent InBar topology. The synaptic connections were assumed to have the quasi-Hebbian plasticity that may be naturally implemented using a stochastic multiplication technique. When somatic gain g exceeds its critical value g(t), the trivial fixed point of the system becomes unstable, and it enters a self-excitory transient process that eventually leads to a stable static state with equal magnitudes of all the action potentials x(j) and synaptic weights w(jk). However, even in the static state, the spatial distribution of the action potential signs and their correlation with the distribution of initial values x(j)(0) may be rather complicated because of the activation function's nonlinearity. We have quantified such correlation as a function of g, cell connectivity M, and plasticity rate eta, for a random distribution of initial values of x(j) and w(jk), by numerical simulation of network dynamics, using a high-performance graphical processing unit system. Most interestingly, the autocorrelation function of action potentials is a nonmonotonic function of g because of a specific competition between self-excitation of the potentials and self-adaptation of synaptic weights.",4
Feature-based ordering algorithm for data presentation of fuzzy ARTMAP ensembles.,"This brief presents a new ordering algorithm for data presentation of fuzzy ARTMAP (FAM) ensembles. The proposed ordering algorithm manipulates the presentation order of the training data for each member of a FAM ensemble such that the categories created in each ensemble member are biased toward the vector of the chosen input feature. Diversity is created by varying the training presentation order based on the ascending order of the values from the most uncorrelated input features. Analysis shows that the categories created in two FAMs are compulsively diverse when the chosen input features used to determine the presentation order of the training data are uncorrelated. The proposed ordering algorithm was tested on 10 classification benchmark problems from the University of California, Irvine, machine learning repository and a cervical cancer problem as a case study. The experimental results show that the proposed method can produce a diverse, yet well generalized, FAM ensemble.",4
Online motor fault detection and diagnosis using a hybrid FMM-CART model.,"In this brief, a hybrid model combining the fuzzy min-max (FMM) neural network and the classification and regression tree (CART) for online motor detection and diagnosis tasks is described. The hybrid model, known as FMM-CART, exploits the advantages of both FMM and CART for undertaking data classification and rule extraction problems. To evaluate the applicability of the proposed FMM-CART model, an evaluation with a benchmark data set pertaining to electrical motor bearing faults is first conducted. The results obtained are equivalent to those reported in the literature. Then, a laboratory experiment for detecting and diagnosing eccentricity faults in an induction motor is performed. In addition to producing accurate results, useful rules in the form of a decision tree are extracted to provide explanation and justification for the predictions from FMM-CART. The experimental outcome positively shows the potential of FMM-CART in undertaking online motor fault detection and diagnosis tasks.",4
L1-norm kernel discriminant analysis via Bayes error bound optimization for robust feature extraction.,"A novel discriminant analysis criterion is derived in this paper under the theoretical framework of Bayes optimality. In contrast to the conventional Fisher's discriminant criterion, the major novelty of the proposed one is the use of L1 norm rather than L2 norm, which makes it less sensitive to the outliers. With the L1-norm discriminant criterion, we propose a new linear discriminant analysis (L1-LDA) method for linear feature extraction problem. To solve the L1-LDA optimization problem, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm, in which a novel surrogate convex function is introduced such that the optimization problem in each iteration is to simply solve a convex programming problem and a close-form solution is guaranteed to this problem. Moreover, we also generalize the L1-LDA method to deal with the nonlinear robust feature extraction problems via the use of kernel trick, and hereafter proposed the L1-norm kernel discriminant analysis (L1-KDA) method. Extensive experiments on simulated and real data sets are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparing with the state-of-the-art methods.",4
A unified learning framework for single image super-resolution.,"It has been widely acknowledged that learning- and reconstruction-based super-resolution (SR) methods are effective to generate a high-resolution (HR) image from a single low-resolution (LR) input. However, learning-based methods are prone to introduce unexpected details into resultant HR images. Although reconstruction-based methods do not generate obvious artifacts, they tend to blur fine details and end up with unnatural results. In this paper, we propose a new SR framework that seamlessly integrates learning- and reconstruction-based methods for single image SR to: 1) avoid unexpected artifacts introduced by learning-based SR and 2) restore the missing high-frequency details smoothed by reconstruction-based SR. This integrated framework learns a single dictionary from the LR input instead of from external images to hallucinate details, embeds nonlocal means filter in the reconstruction-based SR to enhance edges and suppress artifacts, and gradually magnifies the LR input to the desired high-quality SR result. We demonstrate both visually and quantitatively that the proposed framework produces better results than previous methods from the literature.",4
RandomBoost: simplified multiclass boosting through randomization.,"We propose a novel boosting approach to multiclass classification problems, in which multiple classes are distinguished by a set of random projection matrices in essence. The approach uses random projections to alleviate the proliferation of binary classifiers typically required to perform multiclass classification. The result is a multiclass classifier with a single vector-valued parameter, irrespective of the number of classes involved. Two variants of this approach are proposed. The first method randomly projects the original data into new spaces, while the second method randomly projects the outputs of learned weak classifiers. These methods are not only conceptually simple but also effective and easy to implement. A series of experiments on synthetic, machine learning, and visual recognition data sets demonstrate that our proposed methods could be compared favorably with existing multiclass boosting algorithms in terms of both the convergence rate and classification accuracy.",4
A stochastic mean field model for an excitatory and inhibitory synaptic drive cortical neuronal network.,"With the advances in biochemistry, molecular biology, and neurochemistry there has been impressive progress in understanding the molecular properties of anesthetic agents. However, there has been little focus on how the molecular properties of anesthetic agents lead to the observed macroscopic property that defines the anesthetic state, that is, lack of responsiveness to noxious stimuli. In this paper, we develop a mean field synaptic drive firing rate cortical neuronal model and demonstrate how the induction of general anesthesia can be explained using multistability; the property whereby the solutions of a dynamical system exhibit multiple attracting equilibria under asymptotically slowly changing inputs or system parameters. In particular, we demonstrate multistability in the mean when the system initial conditions or the system coefficients of the neuronal connectivity matrix are random variables. Uncertainty in the system coefficients is captured by representing system uncertain parameters by a multiplicative white noise model wherein stochastic integration is interpreted in the sense of Ito. Modeling a priori system parameter uncertainty using a multiplicative white noise model is motivated by means of the maximum entropy principle of Jaynes and statistical analysis.",4
"Artificial neural networks for control of a grid-connected rectifier/inverter under disturbance, dynamic and power converter switching conditions.","Three-phase grid-connected converters are widely used in renewable and electric power system applications. Traditionally, grid-connected converters are controlled with standard decoupled d-q vector control mechanisms. However, recent studies indicate that such mechanisms show limitations in their applicability to dynamic systems. This paper investigates how to mitigate such restrictions using a neural network to control a grid-connected rectifier/inverter. The neural network implements a dynamic programming algorithm and is trained by using back-propagation through time. To enhance performance and stability under disturbance, additional strategies are adopted, including the use of integrals of error signals to the network inputs and the introduction of grid disturbance voltage to the outputs of a well-trained network. The performance of the neural-network controller is studied under typical vector control conditions and compared against conventional vector control methods, which demonstrates that the neural vector control strategy proposed in this paper is effective. Even in dynamic and power converter switching environments, the neural vector controller shows strong ability to trace rapidly changing reference commands, tolerate system disturbances, and satisfy control requirements for a faulted power system.",4
An ordered-patch-based image classification approach on the image Grassmannian manifold.,"This paper presents an ordered-patch-based image classification framework integrating the image Grassmannian manifold to address handwritten digit recognition, face recognition, and scene recognition problems. Typical image classification methods explore image appearances without considering the spatial causality among distinctive domains in an image. To address the issue, we introduce an ordered-patch-based image representation and use the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model to characterize the representation. First, each image is encoded as a sequence of ordered patches, integrating both the local appearance information and spatial relationships of the image. Second, the sequence of these ordered patches is described by an ARMA model, which can be further identified as a point on the image Grassmannian manifold. Then, image classification can be conducted on such a manifold under this manifold representation. Furthermore, an appropriate Grassmannian kernel for support vector machine classification is developed based on a distance metric of the image Grassmannian manifold. Finally, the experiments are conducted on several image data sets to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other existing image classification methods.",4
Novel neural control for a class of uncertain pure-feedback systems.,"This paper is concerned with the problem of adaptive neural tracking control for a class of uncertain pure-feedback nonlinear systems. Using the implicit function theorem and backstepping technique, a practical robust adaptive neural control scheme is proposed to guarantee that the tracking error converges to an adjusted neighborhood of the origin by choosing appropriate design parameters. In contrast to conventional Lyapunov-based design techniques, an alternative Lyapunov function is constructed for the development of control law and learning algorithms. Differing from the existing results in the literature, the control scheme does not need to compute the derivatives of virtual control signals at each step in backstepping design procedures. Furthermore, the scheme requires the desired trajectory and its first derivative rather than its first n derivatives. In addition, the useful property of the basis function of the radial basis function, which will be used in control design, is explored. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.",4
Attractivity analysis of memristor-based cellular neural networks with time-varying delays.,"This paper presents new theoretical results on the invariance and attractivity of memristor-based cellular neural networks (MCNNs) with time-varying delays. First, sufficient conditions to assure the boundedness and global attractivity of the networks are derived. Using state-space decomposition and some analytic techniques, it is shown that the number of equilibria located in the saturation regions of the piecewise-linear activation functions of an n-neuron MCNN with time-varying delays increases significantly from 2(n) to 2(2n2)+n) (2(2n2) times) compared with that without a memristor. In addition, sufficient conditions for the invariance and local or global attractivity of equilibria or attractive sets in any designated region are derived. Finally, two illustrative examples are given to elaborate the characteristics of the results in detail.",4
Lagrange stability of memristive neural networks with discrete and distributed delays.,"Memristive neuromorphic system is a good candidate for creating artificial brain. In this paper, a general class of memristive neural networks with discrete and distributed delays is introduced and studied. Some Lagrange stability criteria dependent on the network parameters are derived via nonsmooth analysis and control theory. In particular, several succinct criteria are provided to ascertain the Lagrange stability of memristive neural networks with and without delays. The proposed Lagrange stability criteria are the improvement and extension of the existing results in the literature. Three numerical examples are given to show the superiority of theoretical results.",4
Adaptive quasi-Newton algorithm for source extraction via CCA approach.,"This paper addresses the problem of adaptive source extraction via the canonical correlation analysis (CCA) approach. Based on Liu's analysis of CCA approach, we propose a new criterion for source extraction, which is proved to be equivalent to the CCA criterion. Then, a fast and efficient online algorithm using quasi-Newton iteration is developed. The stability of the algorithm is also analyzed using Lyapunov's method, which shows that the proposed algorithm asymptotically converges to the global minimum of the criterion. Simulation results are presented to prove our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the merits of the proposed algorithm in terms of convergence speed and successful rate for source extraction.",4
T2FELA: type-2 fuzzy extreme learning algorithm for fast training of interval type-2 TSK fuzzy logic system.,"A challenge in modeling type-2 fuzzy logic systems is the development of efficient learning algorithms to cope with the ever increasing size of real-world data sets. In this paper, the extreme learning strategy is introduced to develop a fast training algorithm for interval type-2 Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy logic systems. The proposed algorithm, called type-2 fuzzy extreme learning algorithm (T2FELA), has two distinctive characteristics. First, the parameters of the antecedents are randomly generated and parameters of the consequents are obtained by a fast learning method according to the extreme learning mechanism. In addition, because the obtained parameters are optimal in the sense of minimizing the norm, the resulting fuzzy systems exhibit better generalization performance. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that the training speed of the proposed T2FELA algorithm is superior to that of the existing state-of-the-art algorithms. The proposed algorithm also shows competitive performance in generalization abilities.",4
"Dynamic uncertain causality graph for knowledge representation and probabilistic reasoning: statistics base, matrix, and application.","Graphical models for probabilistic reasoning are now in widespread use. Many approaches have been developed such as Bayesian network. A newly developed approach named as dynamic uncertain causality graph (DUCG) is initially presented in a previous paper, in which only the inference algorithm in terms of individual events and probabilities is addressed. In this paper, we first explain the statistic basis of DUCG. Then, we extend the algorithm to the form of matrices of events and probabilities. It is revealed that the representation of DUCG can be incomplete and the exact probabilistic inference may still be made. A real application of DUCG for fault diagnoses of a generator system of a nuclear power plant is demonstrated, which involves > 600 variables. Most inferences take < 1 s with a laptop computer. The causal logic between inference result and observations is graphically displayed to users so that they know not only the result, but also why the result obtained.",4
Reinforcement learning output feedback NN control using deterministic learning technique.,"In this brief, a novel adaptive-critic-based neural network (NN) controller is investigated for nonlinear pure-feedback systems. The controller design is based on the transformed predictor form, and the actor-critic NN control architecture includes two NNs, whereas the critic NN is used to approximate the strategic utility function, and the action NN is employed to minimize both the strategic utility function and the tracking error. A deterministic learning technique has been employed to guarantee that the partial persistent excitation condition of internal states is satisfied during tracking control to a periodic reference orbit. The uniformly ultimate boundedness of closed-loop signals is shown via Lyapunov stability analysis. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control.",4
Policy iteration adaptive dynamic programming algorithm for discrete-time nonlinear systems.,"This paper is concerned with a new discrete-time policy iteration adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) method for solving the infinite horizon optimal control problem of nonlinear systems. The idea is to use an iterative ADP technique to obtain the iterative control law, which optimizes the iterative performance index function. The main contribution of this paper is to analyze the convergence and stability properties of policy iteration method for discrete-time nonlinear systems for the first time. It shows that the iterative performance index function is nonincreasingly convergent to the optimal solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. It is also proven that any of the iterative control laws can stabilize the nonlinear systems. Neural networks are used to approximate the performance index function and compute the optimal control law, respectively, for facilitating the implementation of the iterative ADP algorithm, where the convergence of the weight matrices is analyzed. Finally, the numerical results and analysis are presented to illustrate the performance of the developed method.",4
ERNN: a biologically inspired feedforward neural network to discriminate emotion from EEG signal.,"Emotions play an important role in human cognition, perception, decision making, and interaction. This paper presents a six-layer biologically inspired feedforward neural network to discriminate human emotions from EEG. The neural network comprises a shift register memory after spectral filtering for the input layer, and the estimation of coherence between each pair of input signals for the hidden layer. EEG data are collected from 57 healthy participants from eight locations while subjected to audio-visual stimuli. Discrimination of emotions from EEG is investigated based on valence and arousal levels. The accuracy of the proposed neural network is compared with various feature extraction methods and feedforward learning algorithms. The results showed that the highest accuracy is achieved when using the proposed neural network with a type of radial basis function.",4
A robust and scalable neuromorphic communication system by combining synaptic time multiplexing and MIMO-OFDM.,"This paper describes a novel architecture for enabling robust and efficient neuromorphic communication. The architecture combines two concepts: 1) synaptic time multiplexing (STM) that trades space for speed of processing to create an intragroup communication approach that is firing rate independent and offers more flexibility in connectivity than cross-bar architectures and 2) a wired multiple input multiple output (MIMO) communication with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) techniques to enable a robust and efficient intergroup communication for neuromorphic systems. The MIMO-OFDM concept for the proposed architecture was analyzed by simulating large-scale spiking neural network architecture. Analysis shows that the neuromorphic system with MIMO-OFDM exhibits robust and efficient communication while operating in real time with a high bit rate. Through combining STM with MIMO-OFDM techniques, the resulting system offers a flexible and scalable connectivity as well as a power and area efficient solution for the implementation of very large-scale spiking neural architectures in hardware.",4
A constrained backpropagation approach for the adaptive solution of partial differential equations.,"This paper presents a constrained backpropagation (CPROP) methodology for solving nonlinear elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) adaptively, subject to changes in the PDE parameters or external forcing. Unlike existing methods based on penalty functions or Lagrange multipliers, CPROP solves the constrained optimization problem associated with training a neural network to approximate the PDE solution by means of direct elimination. As a result, CPROP reduces the dimensionality of the optimization problem, while satisfying the equality constraints associated with the boundary and initial conditions exactly, at every iteration of the algorithm. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through several examples, including nonlinear elliptic and parabolic PDEs with changing parameters and nonhomogeneous terms.",4
Nonbinary associative memory with exponential pattern retrieval capacity and iterative learning.,"We consider the problem of neural association for a network of nonbinary neurons. Here, the task is to first memorize a set of patterns using a network of neurons whose states assume values from a finite number of integer levels. Later, the same network should be able to recall the previously memorized patterns from their noisy versions. Prior work in this area consider storing a finite number of purely random patterns, and have shown that the pattern retrieval capacities (maximum number of patterns that can be memorized) scale only linearly with the number of neurons in the network. In our formulation of the problem, we concentrate on exploiting redundancy and internal structure of the patterns to improve the pattern retrieval capacity. Our first result shows that if the given patterns have a suitable linear-algebraic structure, i.e., comprise a subspace of the set of all possible patterns, then the pattern retrieval capacity is exponential in terms of the number of neurons. The second result extends the previous finding to cases where the patterns have weak minor components, i.e., the smallest eigenvalues of the correlation matrix tend toward zero. We will use these minor components (or the basis vectors of the pattern null space) to increase both the pattern retrieval capacity and error correction capabilities. An iterative algorithm is proposed for the learning phase, and two simple algorithms are presented for the recall phase. Using analytical methods and simulations, we show that the proposed methods can tolerate a fair amount of errors in the input while being able to memorize an exponentially large number of patterns.",4
"Neural network for nonsmooth, nonconvex constrained minimization via smooth approximation.","A neural network based on smoothing approximation is presented for a class of nonsmooth, nonconvex constrained optimization problems, where the objective function is nonsmooth and nonconvex, the equality constraint functions are linear and the inequality constraint functions are nonsmooth, convex. This approach can find a Clarke stationary point of the optimization problem by following a continuous path defined by a solution of an ordinary differential equation. The global convergence is guaranteed if either the feasible set is bounded or the objective function is level bounded. Specially, the proposed network does not require: 1) the initial point to be feasible; 2) a prior penalty parameter to be chosen exactly; 3) a differential inclusion to be solved. Numerical experiments and comparisons with some existing algorithms are presented to illustrate the theoretical results and show the efficiency of the proposed network.",4
A class of quaternion Kalman filters.,"The existing Kalman filters for quaternion-valued signals do not operate fully in the quaternion domain, and are combined with the real Kalman filter to enable the tracking in 3-D spaces. Using the recently introduced HR-calculus, we develop the fully quaternion-valued Kalman filter (QKF) and quaternion-extended Kalman filter (QEKF), allowing for the tracking of 3-D and 4-D signals directly in the quaternion domain. To consider the second-order noncircularity of signals, we employ the recently developed augmented quaternion statistics to derive the widely linear QKF (WL-QKF) and widely linear QEKF (WL-QEKF). To reduce computational requirements of the widely linear algorithms, their efficient implementation are proposed and it is shown that the quaternion widely linear model can be simplified when processing 3-D data, further reducing the computational requirements. Simulations using both synthetic and real-world circular and noncircular signals illustrate the advantages offered by widely linear over strictly linear quaternion Kalman filters.",4
Learning Harmonium models with infinite latent features.,"Undirected latent variable models represent an important class of graphical models that have been successfully developed to deal with various tasks. One common challenge in learning such models is to determine the number of hidden units that are unknown a priori. Although Bayesian nonparametrics have provided promising results in bypassing the model selection problem in learning directed Bayesian Networks, very little effort has been made toward applying Bayesian nonparametrics to learn undirected latent variable models. In this paper, we present the infinite exponential family Harmonium (iEFH), a bipartite undirected latent variable model that automatically determines the number of latent units from an unbounded pool. We also present two important extensions of iEFH to 1) multiview iEFH for dealing with heterogeneous data, and 2) infinite maximum-margin Harmonium (iMMH) for incorporating supervising side information to learn predictive latent features. We develop variational inference algorithms to learn model parameters. Our methods are computationally competitive because of the avoidance of selecting the number of latent units. Our extensive experiments on real image datasets and text datasets appear to demonstrate the benefits of iEFH and iMMH inherited from Bayesian nonparametrics and max-margin learning. Such results were not available until now and contribute to expanding the scope of Bayesian nonparametrics to learn the structures of undirected latent variable models.",4
Active learning of Pareto fronts.,"This paper introduces the active learning of Pareto fronts (ALP) algorithm, a novel approach to recover the Pareto front of a multiobjective optimization problem. ALP casts the identification of the Pareto front into a supervised machine learning task. This approach enables an analytical model of the Pareto front to be built. The computational effort in generating the supervised information is reduced by an active learning strategy. In particular, the model is learned from a set of informative training objective vectors. The training objective vectors are approximated Pareto-optimal vectors obtained by solving different scalarized problem instances. The experimental results show that ALP achieves an accurate Pareto front approximation with a lower computational effort than state-of-the-art estimation of distribution algorithms and widely known genetic techniques.",4
Function approximation using combined unsupervised and supervised learning.,"Function approximation is one of the core tasks that are solved using neural networks in the context of many engineering problems. However, good approximation results need good sampling of the data space, which usually requires exponentially increasing volume of data as the dimensionality of the data increases. At the same time, often the high-dimensional data is arranged around a much lower dimensional manifold. Here we propose the breaking of the function approximation task for high-dimensional data into two steps: (1) the mapping of the high-dimensional data onto a lower dimensional space corresponding to the manifold on which the data resides and (2) the approximation of the function using the mapped lower dimensional data. We use over-complete self-organizing maps (SOMs) for the mapping through unsupervised learning, and single hidden layer neural networks for the function approximation through supervised learning. We also extend the two-step procedure by considering support vector machines and Bayesian SOMs for the determination of the best parameters for the nonlinear neurons in the hidden layer of the neural networks used for the function approximation. We compare the approximation performance of the proposed neural networks using a set of functions and show that indeed the neural networks using combined unsupervised and supervised learning outperform in most cases the neural networks that learn the function approximation using the original high-dimensional data.",4
Adaptive identifier for uncertain complex nonlinear systems based on continuous neural networks.,"This paper presents the design of a complex-valued differential neural network identifier for uncertain nonlinear systems defined in the complex domain. This design includes the construction of an adaptive algorithm to adjust the parameters included in the identifier. The algorithm is obtained based on a special class of controlled Lyapunov functions. The quality of the identification process is characterized using the practical stability framework. Indeed, the region where the identification error converges is derived by the same Lyapunov method. This zone is defined by the power of uncertainties and perturbations affecting the complex-valued uncertain dynamics. Moreover, this convergence zone is reduced to its lowest possible value using ideas related to the so-called ellipsoid methodology. Two simple but informative numerical examples are developed to show how the identifier proposed in this paper can be used to approximate uncertain nonlinear systems valued in the complex domain.",4
Multi-level fuzzy min-max neural network classifier.,"In this paper a multi-level fuzzy min-max neural network classifier (MLF), which is a supervised learning method, is described. MLF uses basic concepts of the fuzzy min-max (FMM) method in a multi-level structure to classify patterns. This method uses separate classifiers with smaller hyperboxes in different levels to classify the samples that are located in overlapping regions. The final output of the network is formed by combining the outputs of these classifiers. MLF is capable of learning nonlinear boundaries with a single pass through the data. According to the obtained results, the MLF method, compared to the other FMM networks, has the highest performance and the lowest sensitivity to maximum size of the hyperbox parameter (theta), with a training accuracy of 100% in most cases.",4
Robust model predictive control of nonlinear systems with unmodeled dynamics and bounded uncertainties based on neural networks.,"This paper presents a neural network approach to robust model predictive control (MPC) for constrained discrete-time nonlinear systems with unmodeled dynamics affected by bounded uncertainties. The exact nonlinear model of underlying process is not precisely known, but a partially known nominal model is available. This partially known nonlinear model is first decomposed to an affine term plus an unknown high-order term via Jacobian linearization. The linearization residue combined with unmodeled dynamics is then modeled using an extreme learning machine via supervised learning. The minimax methodology is exploited to deal with bounded uncertainties. The minimax optimization problem is reformulated as a convex minimization problem and is iteratively solved by a two-layer recurrent neural network. The proposed neurodynamic approach to nonlinear MPC improves the computational efficiency and sheds a light for real-time implementability of MPC technology. Simulation results are provided to substantiate the effectiveness and characteristics of the proposed approach.",4
A survey on CPG-inspired control models and system implementation.,"This paper surveys the developments of the last 20 years in the field of central pattern generator (CPG) inspired locomotion control, with particular emphasis on the fast emerging robotics-related applications. Functioning as a biological neural network, CPGs can be considered as a group of coupled neurons that generate rhythmic signals without sensory feedback; however, sensory feedback is needed to shape the CPG signals. The basic idea in engineering endeavors is to replicate this intrinsic, computationally efficient, distributed control mechanism for multiple articulated joints, or multi-DOF control cases. In terms of various abstraction levels, existing CPG control models and their extensions are reviewed with a focus on the relative advantages and disadvantages of the models, including ease of design and implementation. The main issues arising from design, optimization, and implementation of the CPG-based control as well as possible alternatives are further discussed, with an attempt to shed more light on locomotion control-oriented theories and applications. The design challenges and trends associated with the further advancement of this area are also summarized.",4
Novel adaptive strategies for synchronization of linearly coupled neural networks with reaction-diffusion terms.,"In this paper, two types of linearly coupled neural networks with reaction-diffusion terms are proposed. We respectively investigate the adaptive synchronization of these two types of complex network models. With local information of node dynamics, some novel adaptive strategies to tune the coupling strengths among network nodes are designed. By constructing appropriate Lyapunov functionals and using inequality techniques, several sufficient conditions are given for reaching synchronization by using the designed adaptive laws. Finally, two examples with numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.",4
Decentralized stabilization for a class of continuous-time nonlinear interconnected systems using online learning optimal control approach.,"In this paper, using a neural-network-based online learning optimal control approach, a novel decentralized control strategy is developed to stabilize a class of continuous-time nonlinear interconnected large-scale systems. First, optimal controllers of the isolated subsystems are designed with cost functions reflecting the bounds of interconnections. Then, it is proven that the decentralized control strategy of the overall system can be established by adding appropriate feedback gains to the optimal control policies of the isolated subsystems. Next, an online policy iteration algorithm is presented to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations related to the optimal control problem. Through constructing a set of critic neural networks, the cost functions can be obtained approximately, followed by the control policies. Furthermore, the dynamics of the estimation errors of the critic networks are verified to be uniformly and ultimately bounded. Finally, a simulation example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the present decentralized control scheme.",4
Event-based visual flow.,"This paper introduces a new methodology to compute dense visual flow using the precise timings of spikes from an asynchronous event-based retina. Biological retinas, and their artificial counterparts, are totally asynchronous and data-driven and rely on a paradigm of light acquisition radically different from most of the currently used frame-grabber technologies. This paper introduces a framework to estimate visual flow from the local properties of events' spatiotemporal space. We will show that precise visual flow orientation and amplitude can be estimated using a local differential approach on the surface defined by coactive events. Experimental results are presented; they show the method adequacy with high data sparseness and temporal resolution of event-based acquisition that allows the computation of motion flow with microsecond accuracy and at very low computational cost.",4
Efficient dual approach to distance metric learning.,"Distance metric learning is of fundamental interest in machine learning because the employed distance metric can significantly affect the performance of many learning methods. Quadratic Mahalanobis metric learning is a popular approach to the problem, but typically requires solving a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem, which is computationally expensive. The worst case complexity of solving an SDP problem involving a matrix variable of size DxD with O(D) linear constraints is about O(D(6.5)) using interior-point methods, where D is the dimension of the input data. Thus, the interior-point methods only practically solve problems exhibiting less than a few thousand variables. Because the number of variables is D(D+1)/2, this implies a limit upon the size of problem that can practically be solved around a few hundred dimensions. The complexity of the popular quadratic Mahalanobis metric learning approach thus limits the size of problem to which metric learning can be applied. Here, we propose a significantly more efficient and scalable approach to the metric learning problem based on the Lagrange dual formulation of the problem. The proposed formulation is much simpler to implement, and therefore allows much larger Mahalanobis metric learning problems to be solved. The time complexity of the proposed method is roughly O(D(3)), which is significantly lower than that of the SDP approach. Experiments on a variety of data sets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an accuracy comparable with the state of the art, but is applicable to significantly larger problems. We also show that the proposed method can be applied to solve more general Frobenius norm regularized SDP problems approximately.",4
Robust pole assignment for synthesizing feedback control systems using recurrent neural networks.,"This paper presents a neurodynamic optimization approach to robust pole assignment for synthesizing linear control systems via state and output feedback. The problem is formulated as a pseudoconvex optimization problem with robustness measure: i.e., the spectral condition number as the objective function and linear matrix equality constraints for exact pole assignment. Two coupled recurrent neural networks are applied for solving the formulated problem in real time. In contrast to existing approaches, the exponential convergence of the proposed neurodynamics to global optimal solutions can be guaranteed even with lower model complexity in terms of the number of variables. Simulation results of the proposed neurodynamic approach for 11 benchmark problems are reported to demonstrate its superiority.",4
Zhang neural network for online solution of time-varying linear matrix inequality aided with an equality conversion.,"In this paper, for online solution of time-varying linear matrix inequality (LMI), such an LMI is first converted to a time-varying matrix equation by introducing a time-varying matrix, of which each element is greater than or equal to zero. Then, by employing Zhang et al.'s neural dynamic method, a special recurrent neural network termed Zhang neural network (ZNN) is proposed and investigated for solving online the converted time-varying matrix equation as well as the time-varying LMI. Such a ZNN model showed in an explicit dynamics exploits the time-derivative information of time-varying coefficients. In addition, theoretical analysis and results of the proposed ZNN model are discussed and presented to show its excellent performance on solving the time-varying LMI. Computer simulation results further demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed ZNN model for online solution of the time-varying LMI and the converted time-varying matrix equation.",4
Efficient probabilistic classification vector machine with incremental basis function selection.,"Probabilistic classification vector machine (PCVM) is a sparse learning approach aiming to address the stability problems of relevance vector machine for classification problems. Because PCVM is based on the expectation maximization algorithm, it suffers from sensitivity to initialization, convergence to local minima, and the limitation of Bayesian estimation making only point estimates. Another disadvantage is that PCVM was not efficient for large data sets. To address these problems, this paper proposes an efficient PCVM (EPCVM) by sequentially adding or deleting basis functions according to the marginal likelihood maximization for efficient training. Because of the truncated prior used in EPCVM, two approximation techniques, i.e., Laplace approximation and expectation propagation (EP), have been used to implement EPCVM to obtain full Bayesian solutions. We have verified Laplace approximation and EP with a hybrid Monte Carlo approach. The generalization performance and computational effectiveness of EPCVM are extensively evaluated. Theoretical discussions using Rademacher complexity reveal the relationship between the sparsity and the generalization bound of EPCVM.",4
Nanophotonic reservoir computing with photonic crystal cavities to generate periodic patterns.,"Reservoir computing (RC) is a technique in machine learning inspired by neural systems. RC has been used successfully to solve complex problems such as signal classification and signal generation. These systems are mainly implemented in software, and thereby they are limited in speed and power efficiency. Several optical and optoelectronic implementations have been demonstrated, in which the system has signals with an amplitude and phase. It is proven that these enrich the dynamics of the system, which is beneficial for the performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel optical architecture based on nanophotonic crystal cavities. This allows us to integrate many neurons on one chip, which, compared with other photonic solutions, closest resembles a classical neural network. Furthermore, the components are passive, which simplifies the design and reduces the power consumption. To assess the performance of this network, we train a photonic network to generate periodic patterns, using an alternative online learning rule called first-order reduced and corrected error. For this, we first train a classical hyperbolic tangent reservoir, but then we vary some of the properties to incorporate typical aspects of a photonics reservoir, such as the use of continuous-time versus discrete-time signals and the use of complex-valued versus real-valued signals. Then, the nanophotonic reservoir is simulated and we explore the role of relevant parameters such as the topology, the phases between the resonators, the number of nodes that are biased and the delay between the resonators. It is important that these parameters are chosen such that no strong self-oscillations occur. Finally, our results show that for a signal generation task a complex-valued, continuous-time nanophotonic reservoir outperforms a classical (i.e., discrete-time, real-valued) leaky hyperbolic tangent reservoir (normalized root-mean-square errors=0.030 versus NRMSE=0.127).",4
Sliding-mode control design for nonlinear systems using probability density function shaping.,"In this paper, we propose a sliding-mode-based stochastic distribution control algorithm for nonlinear systems, where the sliding-mode controller is designed to stabilize the stochastic system and stochastic distribution control tries to shape the sliding surface as close as possible to the desired probability density function. Kullback-Leibler divergence is introduced to the stochastic distribution control, and the parameter of the stochastic distribution controller is updated at each sample interval rather than using a batch mode. It is shown that the estimated weight vector will converge to its ideal value and the system will be asymptotically stable under the rank-condition, which is much weaker than the persistent excitation condition. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is illustrated by simulation.",4
HRLSim: a high performance spiking neural network simulator for GPGPU clusters.,"Modeling of large-scale spiking neural models is an important tool in the quest to understand brain function and subsequently create real-world applications. This paper describes a spiking neural network simulator environment called HRL Spiking Simulator (HRLSim). This simulator is suitable for implementation on a cluster of general purpose graphical processing units (GPGPUs). Novel aspects of HRLSim are described and an analysis of its performance is provided for various configurations of the cluster. With the advent of inexpensive GPGPU cards and compute power, HRLSim offers an affordable and scalable tool for design, real-time simulation, and analysis of large-scale spiking neural networks.",4
Short-term load and wind power forecasting using neural network-based prediction intervals.,"Electrical power systems are evolving from today's centralized bulk systems to more decentralized systems. Penetrations of renewable energies, such as wind and solar power, significantly increase the level of uncertainty in power systems. Accurate load forecasting becomes more complex, yet more important for management of power systems. Traditional methods for generating point forecasts of load demands cannot properly handle uncertainties in system operations. To quantify potential uncertainties associated with forecasts, this paper implements a neural network (NN)-based method for the construction of prediction intervals (PIs). A newly introduced method, called lower upper bound estimation (LUBE), is applied and extended to develop PIs using NN models. A new problem formulation is proposed, which translates the primary multiobjective problem into a constrained single-objective problem. Compared with the cost function, this new formulation is closer to the primary problem and has fewer parameters. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) integrated with the mutation operator is used to solve the problem. Electrical demands from Singapore and New South Wales (Australia), as well as wind power generation from Capital Wind Farm, are used to validate the PSO-based LUBE method. Comparative results show that the proposed method can construct higher quality PIs for load and wind power generation forecasts in a short time.",4
"Multiclass from binary: expanding one-versus-all, one-versus-one and ECOC-based approaches.","Recently, there has been a lot of success in the development of effective binary classifiers. Although many statistical classification techniques have natural multiclass extensions, some, such as the support vector machines, do not. The existing techniques for mapping multiclass problems onto a set of simpler binary classification problems run into serious efficiency problems when there are hundreds or even thousands of classes, and these are the scenarios where this paper's contributions shine. We introduce the concept of correlation and joint probability of base binary learners. We learn these properties during the training stage, group the binary leaner's based on their independence and, with a Bayesian approach, combine the results to predict the class of a new instance. Finally, we also discuss two additional strategies: one to reduce the number of required base learners in the multiclass classification, and another to find new base learners that might best complement the existing set. We use these two new procedures iteratively to complement the initial solution and improve the overall performance. This paper has two goals: finding the most discriminative binary classifiers to solve a multiclass problem and keeping up the efficiency, i.e., small number of base learners. We validate and compare the method with a diverse set of methods of the literature in several public available datasets that range from small (10 to 26 classes) to large multiclass problems (1000 classes) always using simple reproducible scenarios.",4
Quantum neural network-based EEG filtering for a brain-computer interface.,"A novel neural information processing architecture inspired by quantum mechanics and incorporating the well-known Schrodinger wave equation is proposed in this paper. The proposed architecture referred to as recurrent quantum neural network (RQNN) can characterize a nonstationary stochastic signal as time-varying wave packets. A robust unsupervised learning algorithm enables the RQNN to effectively capture the statistical behavior of the input signal and facilitates the estimation of signal embedded in noise with unknown characteristics. The results from a number of benchmark tests show that simple signals such as dc, staircase dc, and sinusoidal signals embedded within high noise can be accurately filtered and particle swarm optimization can be employed to select model parameters. The RQNN filtering procedure is applied in a two-class motor imagery-based brain-computer interface where the objective was to filter electroencephalogram (EEG) signals before feature extraction and classification to increase signal separability. A two-step inner-outer fivefold cross-validation approach is utilized to select the algorithm parameters subject-specifically for nine subjects. It is shown that the subject-specific RQNN EEG filtering significantly improves brain-computer interface performance compared to using only the raw EEG or Savitzky-Golay filtered EEG across multiple sessions.",4
Multikernel least mean square algorithm.,"The multikernel least-mean-square algorithm is introduced for adaptive estimation of vector-valued nonlinear and nonstationary signals. This is achieved by mapping the multivariate input data to a Hilbert space of time-varying vector-valued functions, whose inner products (kernels) are combined in an online fashion. The proposed algorithm is equipped with novel adaptive sparsification criteria ensuring a finite dictionary, and is computationally efficient and suitable for nonstationary environments. We also show the ability of the proposed vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space to serve as a feature space for the class of multikernel least-squares algorithms. The benefits of adaptive multikernel (MK) estimation algorithms are illuminated in the nonlinear multivariate adaptive prediction setting. Simulations on nonlinear inertial body sensor signals and nonstationary real-world wind signals of low, medium, and high dynamic regimes support the approach.",4
What are the differences between Bayesian classifiers and mutual-information classifiers?,"In this paper, both Bayesian and mutual-information classifiers are examined for binary classifications with or without a reject option. The general decision rules are derived for Bayesian classifiers with distinctions on error types and reject types. A formal analysis is conducted to reveal the parameter redundancy of cost terms when abstaining classifications are enforced. The redundancy implies an intrinsic problem of nonconsistency for interpreting cost terms. If no data are given to the cost terms, we demonstrate the weakness of Bayesian classifiers in class-imbalanced classifications. On the contrary, mutual-information classifiers are able to provide an objective solution from the given data, which shows a reasonable balance among error types and reject types. Numerical examples of using two types of classifiers are given for confirming the differences, including the extremely class-imbalanced cases. Finally, we briefly summarize the Bayesian and mutual-information classifiers in terms of their application advantages and disadvantages, respectively.",4
Continuous dynamical combination of short and long-term forecasts for nonstationary time series.,"This brief generalizes the forecasting method that has been awarded first-place winner in the International Competition of Time Series Forecasting (ICTSF 2012). It is based on a short-term forecasting approach of multilayer perceptrons (MLP) ensembles, combined dynamically with a long-term forecasting. The main feature of this general approach is the original concept of continuous dynamical combination of forecasts, in which the weights of the forecasting combination are a function of forecast horizon. Experiments in ICTSFs and NN5s nonstationary time series show that this new combination method improves the performance in multistep forecasting of MLP ensembles when compared to the MLP ensembles alone.",4
Learning geotemporal nonstationary failure and recovery of power distribution.,"Smart energy grid is an emerging area for new applications of machine learning in a nonstationary environment. Such a nonstationary environment emerges when large-scale failures occur at power networks because of external disruptions such as hurricanes and severe storms. Power distribution networks lie at the edge of the grid, and are especially vulnerable to external disruptions. Quantifiable approaches are lacking and needed to learn nonstationary behaviors of large-scale failure and recovery of power distribution. This paper studies such nonstationary behaviors in three aspects. First, a novel formulation is derived for an entire life cycle of large-scale failure and recovery of power distribution. Second, spatial-temporal models of failure and recovery of power distribution are developed as geolocation-based multivariate nonstationary GI(t)/G(t)/infinity queues. Third, the nonstationary spatial-temporal models identify a small number of parameters to be learned. Learning is applied to two real-life examples of large-scale disruptions. One is from Hurricane Ike, where data from an operational network is exact on failures and recoveries. The other is from Hurricane Sandy, where aggregated data is used for inferring failure and recovery processes at one of the impacted areas. Model parameters are learned using real data. Two findings emerge as results of learning: 1) failure rates behave similarly at the two different provider networks for two different hurricanes but differently at the geographical regions and 2) both the rapid and slow-recovery are present for Hurricane Ike but only slow recovery is shown for a regional distribution network from Hurricane Sandy.",4
An interval type-2 neural fuzzy chip with on-chip incremental learning ability for time-varying data sequence prediction and system control.,"This paper proposes a new circuit to implement a Mamdani-type interval type-2 neural fuzzy chip with on-chip incremental learning ability (IT2NFC-OL) for applications in changing environments. Traditional interval type-2 fuzzy systems use an iterative procedure to find the system outputs, which is computationally expensive, especially for hardware implementation. To address this problem, the IT2NFC-OL uses a simplified type reduction operation to reduce the hardware implementation cost without degrading the learning performance. The software-implemented IT2NFC-OL is characterized by online structure learning and parameter learning using a gradient descent algorithm. The learned fuzzy model is then implemented in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chip. The FPGA-implemented IT2NFC-OL performs not only fuzzy inference but also online consequent parameter learning for applications in changing environments. Novel circuits for the computation of system outputs and the update of interval consequent values are proposed. The learning performance of the software-implemented IT2NFC-OL and the on-chip learning ability are verified with applications to time-varying data sequence prediction and system control problems and by comparisons with different software-implemented type-1 and type-2 neural fuzzy systems and interval type-2 fuzzy chips.",4
Linguistic decision making for robot route learning.,"Machine learning enables the creation of a nonlinear mapping that describes robot-environment interaction, whereas computing linguistics make the interaction transparent. In this paper, we develop a novel application of a linguistic decision tree for a robot route learning problem by dynamically deciding the robot's behavior, which is decomposed into atomic actions in the context of a specified task. We examine the real-time performance of training and control of a linguistic decision tree, and explore the possibility of training a machine learning model in an adaptive system without dual CPUs for parallelization of training and control. A quantified evaluation approach is proposed, and a score is defined for the evaluation of a model's robustness regarding the quality of training data. Compared with the nonlinear system identification nonlinear auto-regressive moving average with eXogeneous inputs model structure with offline parameter estimation, the linguistic decision tree model with online linguistic ID3 learning achieves much better performance, robustness, and reliability.",4
Developmental perception of the self and action.,"This paper describes a developmental framework for action-driven perception in anthropomorphic robots. The key idea of the framework is that action generation develops the agent's perception of its own body and actions. Action-driven development is critical for identifying changing body parts and understanding the effects of actions in unknown or nonstationary environments. We embedded minimal knowledge into the robot's cognitive system in the form of motor synergies and actions to allow motor exploration. The robot voluntarily generates actions and develops the ability to perceive its own body and the effect that it generates on the environment. The robot, in addition, can compose this kind of learned primitives to perform complex actions and characterize them in terms of their sensory effects. After learning, the robot can recognize manipulative human behaviors with cross-modal anticipation for recovery of unavailable sensory modality, and reproduce the recognized actions afterward. We evaluated the proposed framework in the experiments with a real robot. In the experiments, we achieved autonomous body identification, learning of fixation, reaching and grasping actions, and developmental recognition of human actions as well as their reproduction.",4
Adaptive convex combination approach for the identification of improper quaternion processes.,"Data-adaptive optimal modeling and identification of real-world vector sensor data is provided by combining the fractional tap-length (FT) approach with model order selection in the quaternion domain. To account rigorously for the generality of such processes, both second-order circular (proper) and noncircular (improper), the proposed approach in this paper combines the FT length optimization with both the strictly linear quaternion least mean square (QLMS) and widely linear QLMS (WL-QLMS). A collaborative approach based on QLMS and WL-QLMS is shown to both identify the type of processes (proper or improper) and to track their optimal parameters in real time. Analysis shows that monitoring the evolution of the convex mixing parameter within the collaborative approach allows us to track the improperness in real time. Further insight into the properties of those algorithms is provided by establishing a relationship between the steady-state error and optimal model order. The approach is supported by simulations on model order selection and identification of both strictly linear and widely linear quaternion-valued systems, such as those routinely used in renewable energy (wind) and human-centered computing (biomechanics).",4
Dealing with concept drifts in process mining.,"Although most business processes change over time, contemporary process mining techniques tend to analyze these processes as if they are in a steady state. Processes may change suddenly or gradually. The drift may be periodic (e.g., because of seasonal influences) or one-of-a-kind (e.g., the effects of new legislation). For the process management, it is crucial to discover and understand such concept drifts in processes. This paper presents a generic framework and specific techniques to detect when a process changes and to localize the parts of the process that have changed. Different features are proposed to characterize relationships among activities. These features are used to discover differences between successive populations. The approach has been implemented as a plug-in of the ProM process mining framework and has been evaluated using both simulated event data exhibiting controlled concept drifts and real-life event data from a Dutch municipality.",4
Adaptive approximation for multiple sensor fault detection and isolation of nonlinear uncertain systems.,"This paper presents an adaptive approximation-based design methodology and analytical results for distributed detection and isolation of multiple sensor faults in a class of nonlinear uncertain systems. During the initial stage of the nonlinear system operation, adaptive approximation is used for online learning of the modeling uncertainty. Then, local sensor fault detection and isolation (SFDI) modules are designed using a dedicated nonlinear observer scheme. The multiple sensor fault isolation process is enhanced by deriving a combinatorial decision logic that integrates information from local SFDI modules. The performance of the proposed diagnostic scheme is analyzed in terms of conditions for ensuring fault detectability and isolability. A simulation example of a single-link robotic arm is used to illustrate the application of the adaptive approximation-based SFDI methodology and its effectiveness in detecting and isolating multiple sensor faults.",4
Learning in the model space for cognitive fault diagnosis.,"The emergence of large sensor networks has facilitated the collection of large amounts of real-time data to monitor and control complex engineering systems. However, in many cases the collected data may be incomplete or inconsistent, while the underlying environment may be time-varying or unformulated. In this paper, we develop an innovative cognitive fault diagnosis framework that tackles the above challenges. This framework investigates fault diagnosis in the model space instead of the signal space. Learning in the model space is implemented by fitting a series of models using a series of signal segments selected with a sliding window. By investigating the learning techniques in the fitted model space, faulty models can be discriminated from healthy models using a one-class learning algorithm. The framework enables us to construct a fault library when unknown faults occur, which can be regarded as cognitive fault isolation. This paper also theoretically investigates how to measure the pairwise distance between two models in the model space and incorporates the model distance into the learning algorithm in the model space. The results on three benchmark applications and one simulated model for the Barcelona water distribution network confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",4
Dynamic learning from adaptive neural network control of a class of nonaffine nonlinear systems.,"This paper studies the problem of learning from adaptive neural network (NN) control of a class of nonaffine nonlinear systems in uncertain dynamic environments. In the control design process, a stable adaptive NN tracking control design technique is proposed for the nonaffine nonlinear systems with a mild assumption by combining a filtered tracking error with the implicit function theorem, input-to-state stability, and the small-gain theorem. The proposed stable control design technique not only overcomes the difficulty in controlling nonaffine nonlinear systems but also relaxes constraint conditions of the considered systems. In the learning process, the partial persistent excitation (PE) condition of radial basis function NNs is satisfied during tracking control to a recurrent reference trajectory. Under the PE condition and an appropriate state transformation, the proposed adaptive NN control is shown to be capable of acquiring knowledge on the implicit desired control input dynamics in the stable control process and of storing the learned knowledge in memory. Subsequently, an NN learning control design technique that effectively exploits the learned knowledge without re-adapting to the controller parameters is proposed to achieve closed-loop stability and improved control performance. Simulation studies are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design techniques.",4
Mining recurring concepts in a dynamic feature space.,"Most data stream classification techniques assume that the underlying feature space is static. However, in real-world applications the set of features and their relevance to the target concept may change over time. In addition, when the underlying concepts reappear, reusing previously learnt models can enhance the learning process in terms of accuracy and processing time at the expense of manageable memory consumption. In this paper, we propose mining recurring concepts in a dynamic feature space (MReC-DFS), a data stream classification system to address the challenges of learning recurring concepts in a dynamic feature space while simultaneously reducing the memory cost associated with storing past models. MReC-DFS is able to detect and adapt to concept changes using the performance of the learning process and contextual information. To handle recurring concepts, stored models are combined in a dynamically weighted ensemble. Incremental feature selection is performed to reduce the combined feature space. This contribution allows MReC-DFS to store only the features most relevant to the learnt concepts, which in turn increases the memory efficiency of the technique. In addition, an incremental feature selection method is proposed that dynamically determines the threshold between relevant and irrelevant features. Experimental results demonstrating the high accuracy of MReC-DFS compared with state-of-the-art techniques on a variety of real datasets are presented. The results also show the superior memory efficiency of MReC-DFS.",4
Reacting to different types of concept drift: the Accuracy Updated Ensemble algorithm.,"Data stream mining has been receiving increased attention due to its presence in a wide range of applications, such as sensor networks, banking, and telecommunication. One of the most important challenges in learning from data streams is reacting to concept drift, i.e., unforeseen changes of the stream's underlying data distribution. Several classification algorithms that cope with concept drift have been put forward, however, most of them specialize in one type of change. In this paper, we propose a new data stream classifier, called the Accuracy Updated Ensemble (AUE2), which aims at reacting equally well to different types of drift. AUE2 combines accuracy-based weighting mechanisms known from block-based ensembles with the incremental nature of Hoeffding Trees. The proposed algorithm is experimentally compared with 11 state-of-the-art stream methods, including single classifiers, block-based and online ensembles, and hybrid approaches in different drift scenarios. Out of all the compared algorithms, AUE2 provided best average classification accuracy while proving to be less memory consuming than other ensemble approaches. Experimental results show that AUE2 can be considered suitable for scenarios, involving many types of drift as well as static environments.",4
PCA feature extraction for change detection in multidimensional unlabeled data.,"When classifiers are deployed in real-world applications, it is assumed that the distribution of the incoming data matches the distribution of the data used to train the classifier. This assumption is often incorrect, which necessitates some form of change detection or adaptive classification. While there has been a lot of work on change detection based on the classification error monitored over the course of the operation of the classifier, finding changes in multidimensional unlabeled data is still a challenge. Here, we propose to apply principal component analysis (PCA) for feature extraction prior to the change detection. Supported by a theoretical example, we argue that the components with the lowest variance should be retained as the extracted features because they are more likely to be affected by a change. We chose a recently proposed semiparametric log-likelihood change detection criterion that is sensitive to changes in both mean and variance of the multidimensional distribution. An experiment with 35 datasets and an illustration with a simple video segmentation demonstrate the advantage of using extracted features compared to raw data. Further analysis shows that feature extraction through PCA is beneficial, specifically for data with multiple balanced classes.",4
PANFIS: a novel incremental learning machine.,"Most of the dynamics in real-world systems are compiled by shifts and drifts, which are uneasy to be overcome by omnipresent neuro-fuzzy systems. Nonetheless, learning in nonstationary environment entails a system owning high degree of flexibility capable of assembling its rule base autonomously according to the degree of nonlinearity contained in the system. In practice, the rule growing and pruning are carried out merely benefiting from a small snapshot of the complete training data to truncate the computational load and memory demand to the low level. An exposure of a novel algorithm, namely parsimonious network based on fuzzy inference system (PANFIS), is to this end presented herein. PANFIS can commence its learning process from scratch with an empty rule base. The fuzzy rules can be stitched up and expelled by virtue of statistical contributions of the fuzzy rules and injected datum afterward. Identical fuzzy sets may be alluded and blended to be one fuzzy set as a pursuit of a transparent rule base escalating human's interpretability. The learning and modeling performances of the proposed PANFIS are numerically validated using several benchmark problems from real-world or synthetic datasets. The validation includes comparisons with state-of-the-art evolving neuro-fuzzy methods and showcases that our new method can compete and in some cases even outperform these approaches in terms of predictive fidelity and model complexity.",4
Online Bayesian learning with natural sequential prior distribution.,"Online Bayesian learning has been successfully applied to online learning for multilayer perceptrons and radial basis functions. In online Bayesian learning, typically, the conventional transition model has been used. Although the conventional transition model is based on the squared norm of the difference between the current parameter vector and the previous parameter vector, the transition model does not adequately consider the difference between the current observation model and the previous observation model. To adequately consider this difference between the observation models, we propose a natural sequential prior. The proposed transition model uses a Fisher information matrix to consider the difference between the observation models more naturally. For validation, the proposed transition model is applied to an online learning problem for a three-layer perceptron.",4
Active learning with drifting streaming data.,"In learning to classify streaming data, obtaining true labels may require major effort and may incur excessive cost. Active learning focuses on carefully selecting as few labeled instances as possible for learning an accurate predictive model. Streaming data poses additional challenges for active learning, since the data distribution may change over time (concept drift) and models need to adapt. Conventional active learning strategies concentrate on querying the most uncertain instances, which are typically concentrated around the decision boundary. Changes occurring further from the boundary may be missed, and models may fail to adapt. This paper presents a theoretically supported framework for active learning from drifting data streams and develops three active learning strategies for streaming data that explicitly handle concept drift. They are based on uncertainty, dynamic allocation of labeling efforts over time, and randomization of the search space. We empirically demonstrate that these strategies react well to changes that can occur anywhere in the instance space and unexpectedly.",4
COMPOSE: A semisupervised learning framework for initially labeled nonstationary streaming data.,"An increasing number of real-world applications are associated with streaming data drawn from drifting and nonstationary distributions that change over time. These applications demand new algorithms that can learn and adapt to such changes, also known as concept drift. Proper characterization of such data with existing approaches typically requires substantial amount of labeled instances, which may be difficult, expensive, or even impractical to obtain. In this paper, we introduce compacted object sample extraction (COMPOSE), a computational geometry-based framework to learn from nonstationary streaming data, where labels are unavailable (or presented very sporadically) after initialization. We introduce the algorithm in detail, and discuss its results and performances on several synthetic and real-world data sets, which demonstrate the ability of the algorithm to learn under several different scenarios of initially labeled streaming environments. On carefully designed synthetic data sets, we compare the performance of COMPOSE against the optimal Bayes classifier, as well as the arbitrary subpopulation tracker algorithm, which addresses a similar environment referred to as extreme verification latency. Furthermore, using the real-world National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration weather data set, we demonstrate that COMPOSE is competitive even with a well-established and fully supervised nonstationary learning algorithm that receives labeled data in every batch.",4
Nonlinear projection trick in kernel methods: an alternative to the kernel trick.,"In kernel methods such as kernel principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machines, the so called kernel trick is used to avoid direct calculations in a high (virtually infinite) dimensional kernel space. In this brief, based on the fact that the effective dimensionality of a kernel space is less than the number of training samples, we propose an alternative to the kernel trick that explicitly maps the input data into a reduced dimensional kernel space. This is easily obtained by the eigenvalue decomposition of the kernel matrix. The proposed method is named as the nonlinear projection trick in contrast to the kernel trick. With this technique, the applicability of the kernel methods is widened to arbitrary algorithms that do not use the dot product. The equivalence between the kernel trick and the nonlinear projection trick is shown for several conventional kernel methods. In addition, we extend PCA-L1, which uses L1-norm instead of L2-norm (or dot product), into a kernel version and show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",4
Semisupervised multitask learning with Gaussian processes.,"We present a probabilistic framework for transferring learning across tasks and between labeled and unlabeled data. The approach is based on Gaussian process (GP) prediction and incorporates both the geometry of the data and the similarity between tasks within a GP covariance, allowing Bayesian prediction in a natural way. We discuss the transfer of learning in a multitask scenario in the two cases where the underlying geometry is assumed to be the same across tasks and where different tasks are assumed to have independent geometric structures. We demonstrate the method on a number of real datasets, indicating that the semisupervised multitask approach can result in very significant improvements in performance when very few labeled training examples are available.",4
An equivalence between adaptive dynamic programming with a critic and backpropagation through time.,"We consider the adaptive dynamic programming technique called Dual Heuristic Programming (DHP), which is designed to learn a critic function, when using learned model functions of the environment. DHP is designed for optimizing control problems in large and continuous state spaces. We extend DHP into a new algorithm that we call Value-Gradient Learning, VGL(lambda), and prove equivalence of an instance of the new algorithm to Backpropagation Through Time for Control with a greedy policy. Not only does this equivalence provide a link between these two different approaches, but it also enables our variant of DHP to have guaranteed convergence, under certain smoothness conditions and a greedy policy, when using a general smooth nonlinear function approximator for the critic. We consider several experimental scenarios including some that prove divergence of DHP under a greedy policy, which contrasts against our proven-convergent algorithm.",4
Neural network architecture for cognitive navigation in dynamic environments.,"Navigation in time-evolving environments with moving targets and obstacles requires cognitive abilities widely demonstrated by even simplest animals. However, it is a long-standing challenging problem for artificial agents. Cognitive autonomous robots coping with this problem must solve two essential tasks: 1) understand the environment in terms of what may happen and how I can deal with this and 2) learn successful experiences for their further use in an automatic subconscious way. The recently introduced concept of compact internal representation (CIR) provides the ground for both the tasks. CIR is a specific cognitive map that compacts time-evolving situations into static structures containing information necessary for navigation. It belongs to the class of global approaches, i.e., it finds trajectories to a target when they exist but also detects situations when no solution can be found. Here we extend the concept of situations with mobile targets. Then using CIR as a core, we propose a closed-loop neural network architecture consisting of conscious and subconscious pathways for efficient decision-making. The conscious pathway provides solutions to novel situations if the default subconscious pathway fails to guide the agent to a target. Employing experiments with roving robots and numerical simulations, we show that the proposed architecture provides the robot with cognitive abilities and enables reliable and flexible navigation in realistic time-evolving environments. We prove that the subconscious pathway is robust against uncertainty in the sensory information. Thus if a novel situation is similar but not identical to the previous experience (because of, e.g., noisy perception) then the subconscious pathway is able to provide an effective solution.",4
Hardware friendly probabilistic spiking neural network with long-term and short-term plasticity.,"This paper proposes a probabilistic spiking neural network (PSNN) with unimodal weight distribution, possessing long- and short-term plasticity. The proposed algorithm is derived by both the arithmetic gradient decent calculation and bioinspired algorithms. The algorithm is benchmarked by the Iris and Wisconsin breast cancer (WBC) data sets. The network features fast convergence speed and high accuracy. In the experiment, the PSNN took not more than 40 epochs for convergence. The average testing accuracy for Iris and WBC data is 96.7% and 97.2%, respectively. To test the usefulness of the PSNN to real world application, the PSNN was also tested with the odor data, which was collected by our self-developed electronic nose (e-nose). Compared with the algorithm (K-nearest neighbor) that has the highest classification accuracy in the e-nose for the same odor data, the classification accuracy of the PSNN is only 1.3% less but the memory requirement can be reduced at least 40%. All the experiments suggest that the PSNN is hardware friendly. First, it requires only nine-bits weight resolution for training and testing. Second, the PSNN can learn complex data sets with a little number of neurons that in turn reduce the cost of VLSI implementation. In addition, the algorithm is insensitive to synaptic noise and the parameter variation induced by the VLSI fabrication. Therefore, the algorithm can be implemented by either software or hardware, making it suitable for wider application.",4
Accelerated canonical polyadic decomposition using mode reduction.,"CANonical polyadic DECOMPosition (CANDECOMP, CPD), also known as PARAllel FACtor analysis (PARAFAC) is widely applied to Nth-order (N >/= 3) tensor analysis. Existing CPD methods mainly use alternating least squares iterations and hence need to unfold tensors to each of their N modes frequently, which is one major performance bottleneck for large-scale data, especially when the order N is large. To overcome this problem, in this paper, we propose a new CPD method in which the CPD of a high-order tensor (i.e., N > 3) is realized by applying CPD to a mode reduced one (typically, third-order tensor) followed by a Khatri-Rao product projection procedure. This way is not only quite efficient as frequently unfolding to N modes is avoided, but also promising to conquer the bottleneck problem caused by high collinearity of components. We show that, under mild conditions, any Nth-order CPD can be converted to an equivalent third-order one but without destroying essential uniqueness, and theoretically they simply give consistent results. Besides, once the CPD of any unfolded lower order tensor is essentially unique, it is also true for the CPD of the original higher order tensor. Error bounds of truncated CPD are also analyzed in the presence of noise. Simulations show that, compared with state-of-the-art CPD methods, the proposed method is more efficient and is able to escape from local solutions more easily.",4
Goal representation heuristic dynamic programming on maze navigation.,"Goal representation heuristic dynamic programming (GrHDP) is proposed in this paper to demonstrate online learning in the Markov decision process. In addition to the (external) reinforcement signal in literature, we develop an adaptively internal goal/reward representation for the agent with the proposed goal network. Specifically, we keep the actor-critic design in heuristic dynamic programming (HDP) and include a goal network to represent the internal goal signal, to further help the value function approximation. We evaluate our proposed GrHDP algorithm on two 2-D maze navigation problems, and later on one 3-D maze navigation problem. Compared to the traditional HDP approach, the learning performance of the agent is improved with our proposed GrHDP approach. In addition, we also include the learning performance with two other reinforcement learning algorithms, namely Sarsa(lambda) and Q-learning, on the same benchmarks for comparison. Furthermore, in order to demonstrate the theoretical guarantee of our proposed method, we provide the characteristics analysis toward the convergence of weights in neural networks in our GrHDP approach.",4
Hinfinity state estimation for complex networks with uncertain inner coupling and incomplete measurements.,"In this paper, the Hinfinity state estimation problem is investigated for a class of complex networks with uncertain coupling strength and incomplete measurements. With the aid of the interval matrix approach, we make the first attempt to characterize the uncertainties entering into the inner coupling matrix. The incomplete measurements under consideration include sensor saturations, quantization, and missing measurements, all of which are assumed to occur randomly. By introducing a stochastic Kronecker delta function, these incomplete measurements are described in a unified way and a novel measurement model is proposed to account for these phenomena occurring with individual probability. With the measurement model, a set of Hinfinity state estimators is designed such that, for all admissible incomplete measurements as well as the uncertain coupling strength, the estimation error dynamics is exponentially mean-square stable and the Hinfinity performance requirement is satisfied. The characterization of the desired estimator gains is derived in terms of the solution to a convex optimization problem that can be easily solved using the semidefinite program method. Finally, a numerical simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed design approach.",4
Universal blind image quality assessment metrics via natural scene statistics and multiple kernel learning.,"Universal blind image quality assessment (IQA) metrics that can work for various distortions are of great importance for image processing systems, because neither ground truths are available nor the distortion types are aware all the time in practice. Existing state-of-the-art universal blind IQA algorithms are developed based on natural scene statistics (NSS). Although NSS-based metrics obtained promising performance, they have some limitations: 1) they use either the Gaussian scale mixture model or generalized Gaussian density to predict the nonGaussian marginal distribution of wavelet, Gabor, or discrete cosine transform coefficients. The prediction error makes the extracted features unable to reflect the change in nonGaussianity (NG) accurately. The existing algorithms use the joint statistical model and structural similarity to model the local dependency (LD). Although this LD essentially encodes the information redundancy in natural images, these models do not use information divergence to measure the LD. Although the exponential decay characteristic (EDC) represents the property of natural images that large/small wavelet coefficient magnitudes tend to be persistent across scales, which is highly correlated with image degradations, it has not been applied to the universal blind IQA metrics; and 2) all the universal blind IQA metrics use the same similarity measure for different features for learning the universal blind IQA metrics, though these features have different properties. To address the aforementioned problems, we propose to construct new universal blind quality indicators using all the three types of NSS, i.e., the NG, LD, and EDC, and incorporating the heterogeneous property of multiple kernel learning (MKL). By analyzing how different distortions affect these statistical properties, we present two universal blind quality assessment models, NSS global scheme and NSS two-step scheme. In the proposed metrics: 1) we exploit the NG of natural images using the original marginal distribution of wavelet coefficients; 2) we measure correlations between wavelet coefficients using mutual information defined in information theory; 3) we use features of EDC in universal blind image quality prediction directly; and 4) we introduce MKL to measure the similarity of different features using different kernels. Thorough experimental results on the Laboratory for Image and Video Engineering database II and the Tampere Image Database2008 demonstrate that both metrics are in remarkably high consistency with the human perception, and overwhelm representative universal blind algorithms as well as some standard full reference quality indexes for various types of distortions.",4
