Surface effects on exciton diffusion in non polar ZnO/ZnMgO heterostructures.,"The diffusion of excitons injected in ZnO/Zn0.92Mg0.08O quantum well heterostructures grown by metal-organic-vapor-phase-epitaxy on non-polar ZnO substrates is investigated at room temperature. Cathodoluminescence linescans in a field-emission-gun scanning-electron-microscope are performed across cleaved cross-sections. A 55 nm diffusion length is assessed for excitons in bulk ZnMgO. When prepared as small angle bevels using focused ion beam (FIB), the effective diffusion length of excitons is shown to decrease down to 8 nm in the thinner part of the slab. This effect is attributed to non-radiative surface recombinations, with a 7 x 10(4) cm s(-1) recombination velocity estimated at the FIB-machined ZnMgO surface. The strong reduction of the diffusion extent in such thin lamellae usually used for transmission electron microscopy could be use improve the spatial resolution of cathodoluminescence images, often limited by diffusion processes.",3
Doping effect on the physical properties of Ca10Pt3As8(Fe2As2)5 single crystals.,"Ca10Pt3As8(Fe2As2)5 is a unique parent compound for superconductivity, which consists of both semiconducting Pt3As8 and metallic FeAs layers. We report the observation of superconductivity induced via chemical doping in either Ca site using rare-earth (RE) elements (RE = La, Gd) or Fe site using Pt. The interlayer distance and the normal-state physical properties of the doped system change correspondingly. The coupled changes include (1) superconducting transition temperature T c increases with increasing both doping concentration and interlayer distance, (2) our T c value is higher than previously reported maximum value for Pt doping in the Fe site, (3) both the normal-state in-plane resistivity and out-of-plane resistivity change from non-metallic to metallic behavior with increasing doping concentration and T c, and (4) the transverse in-plane magnetoresistance (MRab) changes from linear-field dependence to quadratic behavior upon increasing T c. For La-doped compound with the highest T c (~35 K), upper critical fields ([Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]), coherence lengths (xi ab, xi c), and in-plane penetration depth (lambda ab) are estimated. We discuss the relationship between chemical doping, interlayer distance, and physical properties in this system.",3
Atomic-scale distortions and temperature-dependent large pseudogap in thin films of the parent iron-chalcogenide superconductor Fe1+y Te.,"We investigate with scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations the surface structures and the electronic properties of Fe1+y Te thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition. Contrary to the regular arrangement of antiferromagnetic nanostripes previously reported on cleaved single-crystal samples, the surface of Fe1+y Te thin films displays a peculiar distribution of spatially inhomogeneous nanostripes. Both STM and DFT calculations show the bias-dependent nature of such features and support the interpretation of spin-polarized tunneling between the FeTe surface and an unintentionally magnetized tip. In addition, the spatial inhomogeneity is interpreted as a purely electronic effect related to changes in hybridization and Fe-Fe bond length driven by local variations in the concentration of excess interstitial Fe cations. Unexpectedly, the surface density of states measured by STS strongly evolves with temperature in close proximity to the antiferromagnetic-paramagnetic first-order transition, and reveals a large pseudogap of 180-250 meV at about 50-65 K. We believe that in this temperature range a phase transition takes place, and the system orders and locks into particular combinations of orbitals and spins because of the interplay between excess interstitial magnetic Fe and strongly correlated d-electrons.",3
"Anharmonic, dimensionality and size effects in phonon transport.","We have developed and employed a numerically efficient semi- ab initio theory, based on density-functional and relaxation-time schemes, to examine anharmonic, dimensionality and size effects in phonon transport in three- and two-dimensional solids of different crystal symmetries. Our method uses third- and fourth-order terms in crystal Hamiltonian expressed in terms of a temperature-dependent Gruneisen's constant. All input to numerical calculations are generated from phonon calculations based on the density-functional perturbation theory. It is found that four-phonon processes make important and measurable contribution to lattice thermal resistivity above the Debye temperature. From our numerical results for bulk Si, bulk Ge, bulk MoS2 and monolayer MoS2 we find that the sample length dependence of phonon conductivity is significantly stronger in low-dimensional solids.",3
Temperature dependent structural evolution in liquid Ag<sub>50</sub>Ga<sub>50</sub> alloy.,"The temperature dependence of atomic structural evolution in the liquid Ag50Ga50 alloy has been studied by using in situ high energy X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiment combined with the first-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulations. The experimental data show a reversible structural crossover at the temperature about 1050 K. Changes in both electrical resistivity and absolute thermoelectric power at about 1100 K strongly support the XRD results. Additionally, FPMD simulations reveal an abnormal temperature dependent behavior of partial coordination number and atomic diffusivity at about 1200 K, elucidating that the partition experimentally observed changes in structure and properties could be linked with the repartition between Ag and Ga atoms in the liquid at around 1050-1200 K. This finding will trigger more studies on the structural evolution of noble-polyvalent metals in particular and metallic liquids in general.",3
"Lanthanide stannate pyrochlores (Ln<sub>2</sub>Sn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>; Ln = Nd, Gd, Er) at high pressure.","Lanthanide stannate pyrochlores (Ln2Sn2O7; Ln=Nd, Gd, and Er) were investigated in situ to 50 GPa in order to determine their structural response to compression and compare it to that of lanthanide titanate, zirconate, and hafnate pyrochlores. The cation radius ratio of A3+/B4+ in pyrochlore oxides (A2B2O7) is thought to be the dominant property that influences their compression response. The ionic radius of Sn4+ is intermediate to that of Ti4+, Zr4+, and Hf4+, but the &lt;Sn-O&gt; bond in stannate pyrochlore is more covalent than the &lt;B-O&gt; bonds in titanates, zirconate, and hafnates. In stannates, the pyrochlore cation and anion sublattices begin to disorder at 0.3 GPa. The extent of sublattice disorder vs. pressure is greater in stannates with a smaller Ln3+ cation. Stannate pyrochlores (Fd-3m) begin a sluggish transformation to a cotunnite-like structure (Pnma) at ~28 GPa; similar transitions have been observed in titanate, zirconate, and hafnate pyrochlore at varying pressures with cation radius ratio. The extent of the phase transition vs. pressure varies directly with the size of the Ln3+ cation. Post-decompression from ~50 GPa, Er2Sn2O7 and Gd2Sn2O7 adopt a pyrochlore structure, rather than the multiscale defect-fluorite + weberite structure adopted by Nd2Sn2O7 that is characteristic of titanate, zirconate, and hafnate pyrochlore treated to similar conditions. Like pyrochlore titanates, zirconates, and hafnates, the bulk modulus, B0, of stannates varies linearly and inversely with cation radius ratio. The trends of bulk moduli in stannates in this study are in excellent agreement with previous experimental studies on stannates, and suggest that the size of the Ln3+ cation is a primary determining factor of B0. Additionally, when normalized to rA/rB, the bulk moduli of stannates are comparable to those of zirconates and hafnates, which vary from titanates. Our results suggest that the cation radius ratio strongly influences the bulk moduli of stannates as well as their overall compression response.",3
Relaxation processes and physical aging in metallic glasses.,"Since their discovery in the 1960s, metallic glasses have continuously attracted much interest across the physics and materials science communities. In the forefront are their unique properties, which hold the alluring promise of broad application in fields as diverse as medicine, environmental science and engineering. However, a major obstacle to their wide-spread commercial use is their inherent temporal instability arising from underlying relaxation processes that can dramatically alter their physical properties. The result is a physical aging process which can bring about degradation of mechanical properties, namely through embrittlement and catastrophic mechanical failure. Understanding and controlling the effects of aging will play a decisive role in our on-going endeavor to advance the use of metallic glasses as structural materials, as well as in the more general comprehension of out-of-equilibrium dynamics in complex systems. This review presents an overview of the current state of the art in the experimental advances probing physical aging and relaxation processes in metallic glasses. Similarities and differences between other hard and soft matter glasses are highlighted. The topic is discussed in a multiscale approach, first presenting the key features obtained in macroscopic studies, then connecting them to recent novel microscopic investigations. Particular emphasis is put on the occurrence of distinct relaxation processes beyond the main structural process in viscous metallic melts and their fate upon entering the glassy state, trying to disentangle results and formalisms employed by the different groups of the glass-science community. A microscopic viewpoint is presented, in which physical aging manifests itself in irreversible atomic-scale processes such as avalanches and intermittent dynamics, ascribed to the existence of a plethora of metastable glassy states across a complex energy landscape. Future experimental challenges and the comparison with recent theoretical and numerical simulations are discussed as well.",3
Microfluidic multiplexing of solid-state nanopores.,"Although solid-state nanopores enable electronic analysis of many clinically and biologically relevant molecular structures, there are few existing device architectures that enable high-throughput measurement of solid-state nanopores. Herein, we report a method for microfluidic integration of multiple solid-state nanopores at a high density of one nanopore per (35 microm(2)). By configuring microfluidic devices with microfluidic valves, the nanopores can be rinsed from a single fluid input while retaining compatibility for multichannel electrical measurements. The microfluidic valves serve the dual purpose of fluidic switching and electric switching, enabling serial multiplexing of the eight nanopores with a single pair of electrodes. Furthermore, the device architecture exhibits low noise and is compatible with electroporation-based in situ nanopore fabrication, providing a scalable platform for automated electronic measurement of a large number of integrated solid-state nanopores.",3
Origin of the magnetic transition at 100 K in epsilon-Fe2O3 nanoparticles studied by x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy.,"The current study unveils the structural origin of the magnetic transition of the epsilon-Fe2O3 polymorph from an incommensurate magnetic order to a collinear ferrimagnetic state at low temperature. The high crystallinity of the samples and the absence of other iron oxide polymorphs have allowed us to carry out temperature-dependent x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy experiments out. The deformation of the structure is followed by the Debye-Waller factor for each selected Fe-O and Fe-Fe sub-shell. For nanoparticle sizes between 7 and 15 nm, the structural distortions between the Fete and Fe-D1oc sites are localized in a temperature range before the magnetic transition starts. On the contrary, the inherent interaction between the other sub-shells (named Fe-O1,2 and Fe-Fe1) provokes cooperative magneto-structural changes in the same temperature range. This means that the Fete with Fe-D1oc polyhedron interaction seems to be uncoupled with temperature dealing with these nanoparticle sizes wherein the structural distortions are likely moderate due to surface effects.",3
Spin-flip transitions in self-assembled quantum dots.,"Detailed realistic calculations of the spin-flip time (T 1) for an electron in a self-assembled quantum dot (SAQD) due to emission of an acoustic phonon, using only bulk properties with no fitting parameters, are presented. Ellipsoidal lens shaped [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text]As quantum dots, with electronic states calculated using 8-band strain dependent [Formula: see text] theory, are considered. The phonons are treated as bulk acoustic phonons coupled to the electron by both deformation potential and piezoelectric interactions. The dependence of T 1 on the geometry of SAQD, on the applied external magnetic field and on the lattice temperature is highlighted. The theoretical results are close to the experimental measurements on the spin-flip times for a single electron in QD.",3
Indium selenide monolayer: strain-enhanced optoelectronic response and dielectric environment-tunable 2D excitons features.,"Electronic and optical performances of beta-InSe monolayer (ML) are considerably boosted by tuning the corresponding band energies through the lattice in-plane compressive strain engineering. First principle calculations show an indirect-direct gap transition with large band gap size. The crossover is due to different responses of the near-gap state energies with respect to strain. This is explained by the variation of In-Se bond length, the bond nature of near-band-edge electronic orbital and of the momentum angular contribution versus in-plane compressive strain. Effective masses of charge carriers are also found to be highly modulated and significantly light at the indirect-direct gap transition. Tuned optical response of the resulting direct gap ML beta-InSe is evaluated versus applied energy to infer the allowed optical transitions, dielectric constants, semiconductor-metal behavior and refractive index. Environmental dielectric engineering of exciton behavior of the resulting direct gap ML beta-InSe is handled within the effective mass Wannier-Mott model and is expected to be important. Our results highlight the increase of binding energy and red-shifted exciton energy with decreasing screening substrates resulting in a stable exciton at room temperature .Intensity and energy of the ground state exciton emission are expected to be strongly influenced under substrates screening effect. According to our findings, the direct gap ML beta-InSe assures a tremendous 2D optoelectronic and nanoelectronic merits that could overcome several limitations of unstrained ML beta-InSe.",3
Fast and slow thermal processes in harmonic scalar lattices.,"An approach for analytical description of thermal processes in harmonic lattices is presented. We cover longitudinal and transverse vibrations of chains and out-of-plane vibrations of two-dimensional lattices with interactions of an arbitrary number of neighbors. The motion of each particle is governed by a single scalar equation and therefore the notion 'scalar lattice' is used. The evolution of initial temperature field in an infinite lattice is investigated. An exact equation describing the evolution is derived. Continualization of this equation with respect to spatial coordinates is carried out. The resulting continuum equation is solved analytically. The solution shows that the kinetic temperature is represented as the sum of two terms, one describing short time behavior, the other large time behavior. At short times, the temperature performs high-frequency oscillations caused by redistribution of energy among kinetic and potential forms (fast process). Characteristic time of this process is of the order of ten periods of atomic vibrations. At large times, changes of the temperature are caused by ballistic heat transfer (slow process). The temperature field is represented as a superposition of waves having the shape of initial temperature distribution and propagating with group velocities dependent on the wave vector. Expressions describing fast and slow processes are invariant with respect to substitution t by [Formula: see text]. However, examples considered in the paper demonstrate that these processes are irreversible. Numerical simulations show that presented theory describes the evolution of temperature field at short and large time scales with high accuracy.",3
Machine learning and data science in soft materials engineering.,"In many branches of materials science it is now routine to generate data sets of such large size and dimensionality that conventional methods of analysis fail. Paradigms and tools from data science and machine learning can provide scalable approaches to identify and extract trends and patterns within voluminous data sets, perform guided traversals of high-dimensional phase spaces, and furnish data-driven strategies for inverse materials design. This topical review provides an accessible introduction to machine learning tools in the context of soft and biological materials by 'de-jargonizing' data science terminology, presenting a taxonomy of machine learning techniques, and surveying the mathematical underpinnings and software implementations of popular tools, including principal component analysis, independent component analysis, diffusion maps, support vector machines, and relative entropy. We present illustrative examples of machine learning applications in soft matter, including inverse design of self-assembling materials, nonlinear learning of protein folding landscapes, high-throughput antimicrobial peptide design, and data-driven materials design engines. We close with an outlook on the challenges and opportunities for the field.",3
Metastable ultracondensed hydrogenous materials.,"The primary purpose of this paper is to stimulate theoretical predictions of how to retain metastably hydrogenous materials made at high pressure P on release to ambient. Ultracondensed metallic hydrogen has been made at high pressures in the fluid and reported made probably in the solid. Because the long quest for metallic hydrogen is likely to be concluded in the relatively near future, a logical question is whether another research direction, comparable in scale to the quest for metallic H, will arise in high pressure research. One possibility is retention of metastable solid metallic hydrogen and other hydrogenous materials on release of dynamic and static high pressures P to ambient. If hydrogenous materials could be retained metastably on release, those materials would be a new class of materials for scientific investigations and technological applications. This paper is a review of the current situation with the synthesis of metallic hydrogen, potential technological applications of metastable metallic H and other hydrogenous materials at ambient, and general background of published experimental and theoretical work on what has been accomplished with metastable phases in the past and thus what might be accomplished in the future.",3
Geometrical frustration yields fiber formation in self-assembly.,"Controlling the self-assembly of supramolecular structures is vital for living cells, and a central challenge for engineering at the nano- and microscales [1, 2]. Nevertheless, even particles without optimized shapes can robustly form well-defined morphologies. This is the case in numerous medical conditions where normally soluble proteins aggregate into fibers [3, 4]. Beyond the diversity of molecular mechanisms involved [5, 6], we propose that fibers generically arise from the aggregation of irregular particles with short-range interactions. Using a minimal model of ill-fitting, sticky particles, we demonstrate robust fiber formation for a variety of particle shapes and aggregation conditions. Geometrical frustration plays a crucial role in this process, and accounts for the range of parameters in which fibers form as well as for their metastable character.",3
Spin reorientation and disordered rare earth magnetism in Ho2FeCoO6.,"We report the experimental observation of spin reorientation in the double perovskite Ho2FeCoO6. The magnetic phase transitions in this compound are characterized and studied through magnetization and specific heat, and the magnetic structures are elucidated through neutron powder diffraction. Two magnetic phase transitions are observed in this compound-one at [Formula: see text] K, from paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic, and the other at [Formula: see text] K, from a phase with mixed magnetic structures to a single phase through a spin reorientation process. The magnetic structure in the temperature range 200-45 K is a mixed phase of the irreducible representations [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], both of which are antiferromagnetic. The phase with mixed magnetic structures that exists in Ho2FeCoO6 gives rise to a large thermal hysteresis in magnetization that extends from 200 K down to the spin reorientation temperature. At T N2, the magnetic structure transforms to [Formula: see text]. Though long-range magnetic order is established in the transition metal lattice, it is seen that only short-range magnetic order prevails in the Ho(3+) lattice. Our results should motivate further detailed studies on single crystals in order to explore the spin reorientation process, spin switching and the possibility of anisotropic magnetic interactions giving rise to electric polarization in Ho2FeCoO6.",3
Quasiparticle conductance-voltage characteristics for break junctions involving d-wave superconductors: charge-density-wave effects.,"Quasiparticle tunnel conductance-voltage characteristics (CVCs), [Formula: see text], were calculated for break junctions (BJs) made up of layered d-wave superconductors partially gapped by charge-density waves (CDWs). The current is assumed to flow in the ab-plane of electrodes. The influence of CDWs is analyzed by comparing the resulting CVCs with CVCs calculated for BJs made up of pure d-wave superconductors with relevant parameters. The main CDW-effects were found to be the appearance of new CVC peculiarities and the loss of CVC symmetry with respect to the V-sign. Tunnel directionality was shown to be one of the key factors in the formation of [Formula: see text] dependences. In particular, the orientation of electrodes with respect to the current channel becomes very important. As a result, [Formula: see text] can acquire a large variety of forms similar to those for tunnel junctions between superconductors with s-wave, d-wave, and mixed symmetry of their order parameters. The diversity of peculiarities is especially striking at finite temperatures. In the case of BJs made up of pure d-wave superconductors, the resulting CVC can include a two-peak gap-driven structure. The results were compared with the experimental BJ data for a number of high-T c oxides. It was shown that the large variety of the observed current-voltage characteristics can be interpreted in the framework of our approach. Thus, quasiparticle tunnel currents in the ab-plane can be used as an additional mean to detect CDWs competing with superconductivity in cuprates or other layered superconductors.",3
Absence of single critical dose for the amorphization of quartz under ion irradiation.,"In this work, we first simulated the amorphization of crystalline quartz under 50 keV [Formula: see text]Na ion irradiation with classical molecular dynamics (MD). We then used binary collision approximation algorithms to simulate the Rutherford backscattering spectrometry in channeling conditions (RBS-C) from these irradiated MD cells, and compared the RBS-C spectra with experiments. The simulated RBS-C results show an agreement with experiments in the evolution of amorphization as a function of dose, showing what appears to be (by this measure) full amorphization at about 2.2 eV[Formula: see text]. We also applied other analysis methods, such as angular structure factor, Wigner-Seitz, coordination analysis and topological analysis, to analyze the structural evolution of the irradiated MD cells. The results show that the atomic-level structure of the sample keeps evolving after the RBS signal has saturated, until the dose of about 5 eV[Formula: see text]. The continued evolution of the [Formula: see text] structure makes the definition of what is, on the atomic level, an amorphized quartz ambiguous.",3
STM contrast of a CO dimer on a Cu(1 1 1) surface: a wave-function analysis.,"We present a method used to intuitively interpret the scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) contrast by investigating individual wave functions originating from the substrate and tip side. We use localized basis orbital density functional theory, and propagate the wave functions into the vacuum region at a real-space grid, including averaging over the lateral reciprocal space. Optimization by means of the method of Lagrange multipliers is implemented to perform a unitary transformation of the wave functions in the middle of the vacuum region. The method enables (i) reduction of the number of contributing tip-substrate wave function combinations used in the corresponding transmission matrix, and (ii) to bundle up wave functions with similar symmetry in the lateral plane, so that (iii) an intuitive understanding of the STM contrast can be achieved. The theory is applied to a CO dimer adsorbed on a Cu(1 1 1) surface scanned by a single-atom Cu tip, whose STM image is discussed in detail by the outlined method.",3
Manifestation of intra-atomic 5d6s-4f exchange coupling in photoexcited gadolinium.,"Intra-atomic exchange couplings (IECs) between 5d6s and 4f electrons are ubiquitous in rare-earth metals and play a critical role in spin dynamics. However, detecting them in real time domain has been difficult. Here we show the direct evidence of IEC between 5d6s and 4f electrons in gadolinium. Upon femtosecond laser excitation, 5d6s electrons are directly excited; their majority bands shift toward the Fermi level while their minority bands do the opposite. For the first time, our first-principles minority shift now agrees with the experiment quantitatively. Excited 5d6s electrons lower the exchange potential barrier for 4f electrons, so the 4f states are also shifted in energy, a prediction that can be tested experimentally. Although a significant number of 5d6s electrons, some several eV below the Fermi level, are excited out of the Fermi sea, there is no change in the 4f states, a clear manifestation of intra-atomic exchange coupling.",3
Filamentous phages as building blocks for reconfigurable and hierarchical self-assembly.,"Filamentous bacteriophages such as fd-like viruses are monodisperse rod-like colloids that have well defined properties of diameter, length, rigidity, charge and chirality. Engineering these viruses leads to a library of colloidal rods, which can be used as building blocks for reconfigurable and hierarchical self-assembly. Their condensation in an aqueous solution with additive polymers, which act as depletants to induce attraction between the rods, leads to a myriad of fluid-like micronic structures ranging from isotropic/nematic droplets, colloid membranes, achiral membrane seeds, twisted ribbons, pi-wall, pores, colloidal skyrmions, Mobius anchors, scallop membranes to membrane rafts. These structures, and the way that they shape-shift, not only shed light on the role of entropy, chiral frustration and topology in soft matter, but also mimic many structures encountered in different fields of science. On the one hand, filamentous phages being an experimental realization of colloidal hard rods, their condensation mediated by depletion interactions constitutes a blueprint for the self-assembly of rod-like particles and provides a fundamental foundation for bio- or material-oriented applications. On the other hand, the chiral properties of the viruses restrict the generalities of some results but vastly broaden the self-assembly possibilities.",3
Two-gap superconductivity in Ag1-x Mo6S8 Chevrel phase.,"The superconducting properties of [Formula: see text]Mo6S8 [[Formula: see text]] Chevrel phase [[Formula: see text] K] are studied on a sample compacted by spark plasma sintering. Both lower ([Formula: see text] mT) and the upper [[Formula: see text] T] critical magnetic fields are obtained from magnetization and electrical resistivity measurements for the first time. The analysis of the low-temperature electronic specific heat indicates [Formula: see text]Mo6S8 to be a two band superconductor with the energy gaps [Formula: see text] meV (95%) and [Formula: see text] meV (5%). Theoretical DFT calculations reveal a much stronger electron-phonon coupling in the studied Chevrel phase compared to earlier reports. Similar to MgB2, the Fermi surface of studied Chevrel phase is formed by two hole-like and one electron-like bands.",3
Investigating the thermal dissociation of viral capsid by lattice model.,"The dissociation of icosahedral viral capsids was investigated by a homogeneous and a heterogeneous lattice model. In thermal dissociation experiments with cowpea chlorotic mottle virus and probed by small-angle neutron scattering, we observed a slight shrinkage of viral capsids, which can be related to the strengthening of the hydrophobic interaction between subunits at increasing temperature. By considering the temperature dependence of hydrophobic interaction in the homogeneous lattice model, we were able to give a better estimate of the effective charge. In the heterogeneous lattice model, two sets of lattice sites represented different capsid subunits with asymmetric interaction strengths. In that case, the dissociation of capsids was found to shift from a sharp one-step transition to a gradual two-step transition by weakening the hydrophobic interaction between AB and CC subunits. We anticipate that such lattice models will shed further light on the statistical mechanics underlying virus assembly and disassembly.",3
Quasielastic and low-energy inelastic neutron scattering study of HoCrO3 by high resolution time-of-flight neutron spectroscopy.,"In order to understand the origin of the huge quasielastic magnetic scattering observed previously with a back-scattering neutron spectrometer, we have re-investigated the low energy excitations in HoCrO3 by inelastic neutron scattering in a much wider energy range with time-of-flight neutron spectrometers. The inelastic signals are due to the excitations between the ground state doublet of the Ho ion. The quasielastic signal is due to the fluctuation of the disordered Ho moments. At low temperature the intensity of quasielastic scattering is small. It starts increasing as the temperature increases above 30 K. At the same temperature, the elastic intensity due to Ho moment ordering decreases in a similar way. This observation strengthens the hypothesis that the quasielastic scattering is due the fluctuations of the disordered Ho moments. The time scale of fluctuations has been determine from the quasielastic scattering and was found to vary from about 22 ps at [Formula: see text] K to about 2.5 ps at [Formula: see text] K. The stretched exponential line shape indicates a distribution of decay rates at low temperatures.",3
Linear magnetoresistance and surface to bulk coupling in topological insulator thin films.,"We explore the temperature dependent magnetoresistance of bulk insulating topological insulator thin films. Thin films of Bi2Se2Te and BiSbTeSe1.6 were grown using the pulsed laser deposition technique and subjected to transport measurements. Magnetotransport measurements indicate a non-saturating linear magnetoresistance (LMR) behavior at high magnetic field values. We present a careful analysis to explain the origin of LMR taking into consideration all the existing models of LMR. Here we consider that the bulk insulating states and the metallic surface states constitute two parallel conduction channels. Invoking this, we were able to explain linear magnetoresistance behavior as a competition between these parallel channels. We observe that the cross-over field, where LMR sets in, decreases with increasing temperature. We propose that this cross-over field can be used phenomenologically to estimate the strength of surface to bulk coupling.",3
Temperature dependent electron paramagnetic resonance study on magnetoelectric YCrO<sub>3</sub>.,"We report temperature dependent electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies on polycrystalline YCrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; samples at X-band (9.46 GHz) in the temperature range of 120 K to 298 K. The EPR spectra exhibit a single broad line across the whole temperature range, attributed to Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. The variation of EPR spectra parameters (line width, integrated intensity, and g-factor) as a function of temperature was analyzed to understand the nature of spin-dynamics in the paramagnetic region of YCrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. A peak in the g-factor suggests the presence of a new phase within the paramagnetic state at an intermediate point of temperature &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;IP&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 230 K, attributed to the onset of short range canted antiferromagnetic correlations in the material much above 140 K, Neel temperature (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;) of YCrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The EPR intensity increases with a decrease in temperature up to &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; due to the renormalization of the magnetic moments arising from the appearance of canted antiferromagnetic correlations. Further, temperature dependent dielectric measurements also exhibit an anomaly at ~ 230 K suggesting the presence of magnetodielectric coupling in YCrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, with a possibility towards a relatively high temperature magnetodielectric system.",3
Electrical controllable spin pump based on a zigzag silicene nanoribbon junction.,"We propose a possible electrical controllable spin pump based on a zigzag silicene nanoribbon ferromagnetic junction by applying two time-dependent perpendicular electric fields. By using the Keldysh Green's function method, we derive the analytic expression of the spin-resolved current at the adiabatic approximation and demonstrate that two asymmetric spin up and spin down currents can be pumped out in the device without an external bias. The pumped currents mainly come from the interplay between the photon-assisted spin pump effect and the electrically-modulated energy band structure of the tunneling junction. The spin valve phenomena are not only related to the energy gap opened by two perpendicular staggered potentials, but also dependent on the system parameters such as the pumping frequency, the pumping phase difference, the spin-orbit coupling and the Fermi level, which can be tuned by the electrical methods. The proposed device can also be used to produce a pure spin current and a 100% polarized spin current through the photon-assisted pumping process. Our investigations may provide an electrical manipulation of spin-polarized electrons in graphene-like pumping devices.",3
First-principles study of enhanced magnetic anisotropies in transition-metal atoms doped WS2 monolayer.,"Considerable progress in contemporary spintronics has been made in recent years for developing nanoscale data memory and quantum information processing. It is, however, still a great challenge to achieve the ultimate limit of storage bit. 2D materials, fortunately, provide an alternative solution for designing materials with the expected miniaturizing scale, chemical stability as well as giant magnetic anisotropy energy. By performing first-principles calculations, we have examined two possible doping sites on a WS2 monolayer using three kinds of transition metal (TM) atoms (Mn, Fe and Co). It is found that the TM atoms prefer to stay on the W atom site. Additionally, differently from the case of Mn, doping Co and Fe atoms on the W vacancy can achieve perpendicular magnetic anisotropy with a much larger magnitude, which provides a bright prospect for generating atomic-scale magnets of storage devices.",3
Stability of charged density waves in InAs nanowires in an external magnetic field.,We report on magnetotransport measurements at [Formula: see text] K in a high-quality InAs nanowire ([Formula: see text] kOmega) in the presence of the charged tip of an atomic force microscope serving as a mobile gate. We demonstrate the crucial role of the external magnetic field on the amplitude of the charge density waves with a wavelength of 0.8 mum. The observed suppression rate of their amplitude is similar or slightly higher than the one for weak localization correction in our investigated InAs nanowire.,3
"The magnetic structures of GdCuSn, GdAgSn and GdAuSn.","We have determined the magnetic structures of GdCuSn, GdAgSn and GdAuSn using a combination of [Formula: see text]Gd Mossbauer spectroscopy and neutron powder diffraction. Each compound shows the same antiferromagnetic ordering of the Gd sublattice. The magnetic cell is doubled along the crystallographic a-axis (propagation vector [Formula: see text]) with the moments aligned along the hexagonal c-axis, forming alternating ferromagnetic sheets of up/down Gd moments along the a-axis.",3
An empirical potential for simulating vacancy clusters in tungsten.,"We present an empirical interatomic potential for tungsten, particularly well suited for simulations of vacancy-type defects. We compare energies and structures of vacancy clusters generated with the empirical potential with an extensive new database of values computed using density functional theory, and show that the new potential predicts low-energy defect structures and formation energies with high accuracy. A significant difference to other popular embedded-atom empirical potentials for tungsten is the correct prediction of surface energies. Interstitial properties and short-range pairwise behaviour remain similar to the Ackford-Thetford potential on which it is based, making this potential well-suited to simulations of microstructural evolution following irradiation damage cascades. Using atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we predict vacancy cluster dissociation in the range 1100-1300 K, the temperature range generally associated with stage IV recovery.",3
Raman signatures of ferroic domain walls captured by principal component analysis.,"Ferroic domain walls are currently investigated by several state-of-the art techniques in order to get a better understanding of their distinct, functional properties. Here, principal component analysis (PCA) of Raman maps is used to study ferroelectric domain walls (DWs) in LiNbO3 and ferroelastic DWs in NdGaO3. It is shown that PCA allows us to quickly and reliably identify small Raman peak variations at ferroelectric DWs and that the value of a peak shift can be deduced-accurately and without a priori-from a first order Taylor expansion of the spectra. The ability of PCA to separate the contribution of ferroelastic domains and DWs to Raman spectra is emphasized. More generally, our results provide a novel route for the statistical analysis of any property mapped across a DW.",3
Self-learning kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of diffusion in ferromagnetic alpha-Fe-Si alloys.,"Diffusion of Si atom and vacancy in the A2-phase of alpha-Fe-Si alloys in the ferromagnetic state, with and without magnetic order and in various temperature ranges, are studied using AKSOME, an on-lattice self-learning KMC code. Diffusion of the Si atom and the vacancy are studied in the dilute limit and up to 12 at.% Si, respectively, in the temperature range 350-700 K. Local Si neighborhood dependent activation energies for vacancy hops were calculated on-the-fly using a broken-bond model based on pairwise interaction. The migration barrier and prefactor for the Si diffusion in the dilute limit were obtained and found to agree with published data within the limits of uncertainty. Simulations results show that the prefactor and the migration barrier for the Si diffusion are approximately an order of magnitude higher, and a tenth of an electron-volt higher, respectively, in the magnetic disordered state than in the fully ordered state. However, the net result is that magnetic disorder does not have a significant effect on Si diffusivity within the range of parameters studied in this work. Nevertheless, with increasing temperature, the magnetic disorder increases and its effect on the Si diffusivity also increases. In the case of vacancy diffusion, with increasing Si concentration, its diffusion prefactor decreases while the migration barrier more or less remained constant and the effect of magnetic disorder increases with Si concentration. Important vacancy-Si/Fe atom exchange processes and their activation barriers were identified, and the effect of energetics on ordered phase formation in Fe-Si alloys are discussed.",3
Spin-polarized confined states in Ag films on Fe(1 1 0).,"Spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of thin Ag(1 1 1) films on ferromagnetic Fe(1 1 0) shows a series of spin-polarized peaks. These features derive from Ag sp-bands, which form quantum well states and resonances due to confinement by a spin-dependent interface potential barrier. The spin-up states are broader and located at higher binding energy than the corresponding spin-down states at [Formula: see text], although the differences attenuate near the Fermi level. The spin-down states display multiple gap openings, which interrupt their parabolic-like dispersion. First-principles calculations attribute these findings to the symmetry- and spin-selective hybridization of the Ag states with the exchange-split bands of the substrate.",3
Glassy magnetic ground state and Kondo-like behaviour in Mn<sub>10</sub>FeGe<sub>8</sub> alloy.,"We report detailed investigation on the ground-state magnetic properties of newly synthesized Mn10FeGe8 alloy. The sample can be thought of being derived by substituting one Mn atom by Fe of the parent compound Mn11Ge8. Fe-substitution leads to drastic change in the magnetic ground state as well as to the magnetotransport properties of the parent alloy. On cooling below 250 K,Mn10FeGe8 undergoes a transition from paramagnetic phase to a state having significant ferromagnetic correlations. The ground state is found to be canonical spin glass (CSG) type in nature as evident from the dc magnetization and ac susceptibility measurements. Interestingly, the resistivity data shows an upturn at low temperature below about 30 K mimicking the Kondo-like behaviour. Mn10FeGe8 is turned out to be a rare example among 3d transition metal alloys, where a Kondo like state coexists within a CSG phase.",3
Spin-transfer torque in multiferroic tunnel junctions with composite dielectric/ferroelectric barriers.,"Using model calculations, we demonstrate a very high level of control of the spin-transfer torque (STT) by electric field in multiferroic tunnel junctions with composite dielectric/ferroelectric barriers. We find that, for particular device parameters, toggling the polarization direction can switch the voltage-induced part of STT between a finite value and a value close to zero, i.e. quench and release the torque. Additionally, we demonstrate that under certain conditions the zero-voltage STT, i.e. the interlayer exchange coupling, can switch sign with polarization reversal, which is equivalent to reversing the magnetic ground state of the tunnel junction. This bias- and polarization-tunability of the STT could be exploited to engineer novel functionalities such as softening/hardening of the bit or increasing the signal-to-noise ratio in magnetic sensors, which can have important implications for magnetic random access memories or for combined memory and logic devices.",3
Low field induced large magnetocaloric effect in Tm<sub>2</sub>Ni<sub>0.93</sub>Si<sub>2.93</sub> : influence of short range magnetic correlation.,"In this work, we report successful synthesis of a new intermetallic compound Tm&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.93&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2.93&lt;/sub& gt; that forms in single phase only in defect crystal structure. The compound does not show any long range magnetic ordering down to 2 K. The material exhibits large magnetic entropy change (-DeltaS&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 13.7 J/kg K) and adiabatic temperature change (DeltaT&lt;sub&gt;ad&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 4.4 K) at 2.2 K for a field change of 20 kOe which can be realized by permanent magnets, thus being very beneficial for application purpose. In the absence of long range magnetic ordering down to 2 K, metastable nature of the low temperature spin dynamics and short range magnetic correlations are considered to be responsible for such large magnetocaloric effect (MCE) over a wide temperature region.",3
"Effect of Gd and Cr substitution on the structural, electronic and magnetic phases of SrRuO3: a case study of doping and chemical phase separation.","We explore the crystal structure, electrical resistivity and magnetic behavior of the compositional series (SrRuO3)[Formula: see text] (GdCrO3) x (where [Formula: see text]), which resides between orthorhombic ferromagnetic (FM) metal SrRuO3 ([Formula: see text] K) and orthorhombic antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulator GdCrO3 ([Formula: see text] K). Crystal structure analysis reveals that complete solid solution exists only up to [Formula: see text], above which chemical phase separation of two/three phases occurs, and persists up to [Formula: see text]. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurement also corroborates the existence of [Formula: see text] for the intermediate composition [Formula: see text], which reinforces the astonishing scheelite-type GdCrO4 formation (at ambient pressure) for [Formula: see text] compositions. Electrical resistivity measurements affirm the temperature driven metal to insulator (M-I) transition for [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] samples. Low temperature insulating state in these samples is interpreted by electron-electron interaction of weak disordered systems. Precise analysis of temperature dependent resistivity for [Formula: see text] samples (which have insulating ground state) dictate that the transport phenomenon is mainly associated with Arrhenius-type charge conduction, Mott's variable range hopping, short-range and long-range Coulomb interaction mediated hopping processes, due to the high degree of randomness. Interruption of magnetic Ru-O-Ru interaction by Ru-O-Cr and Cr-O-Cr interactions lowers the FM transition temperature (T C), and thereby introduces Griffiths phase in phase separated samples. Furthermore, we believe that a sharp rise in magnetization at low temperature for [Formula: see text] samples is due to the formation of AFM GdCrO4 phase. Prominent thermal hysteresis in temperature dependent magnetization curves for [Formula: see text], and appearance of spin-reorientation transition for [Formula: see text] are the distinct indications for transformation into canted AFM GdCrO3 oxide at higher x. The effective magnetic moment ([Formula: see text]) continuously increases with the incorporation of higher moment elements (Gd and Cr); while coercive field (H C) exhibits an abrupt variation as a function of x at the onset of phase separation.",3
Accuracy of dielectric-dependent hybrid functionals in the prediction of optoelectronic properties of metal oxide semiconductors: a comprehensive comparison with many-body GW and experiments.,"Understanding the electronic structure of metal oxide semiconductors is crucial to their numerous technological applications, such as photoelectrochemical water splitting and solar cells. The needed experimental and theoretical knowledge goes beyond that of pristine bulk crystals, and must include the effects of surfaces and interfaces, as well as those due to the presence of intrinsic defects (e.g. oxygen vacancies), or dopants for band engineering. In this review, we present an account of the recent efforts in predicting and understanding the optoelectronic properties of oxides using ab initio theoretical methods. In particular, we discuss the performance of recently developed dielectric-dependent hybrid functionals, providing a comparison against the results of many-body GW calculations, including G 0 W 0 as well as more refined approaches, such as quasiparticle self-consistent GW. We summarize results in the recent literature for the band gap, the band level alignment at surfaces, and optical transition energies in defective oxides, including wide gap oxide semiconductors and transition metal oxides. Correlated transition metal oxides are also discussed. For each method, we describe successes and drawbacks, emphasizing the challenges faced by the development of improved theoretical approaches. The theoretical section is preceded by a critical overview of the main experimental techniques needed to characterize the optoelectronic properties of semiconductors, including absorption and reflection spectroscopy, photoemission, and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS).",3
Conformational effects in photoelectron circular dichroism.,"Photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) is a novel type of spectroscopy, which presents surprising sensitivity to conformational effects in chiral systems. While classical photoelectron spectroscopy mainly responds to conformational effects in terms of energy level shifts, PECD provides a rich and detailed response to tiny changes in electronic and structural properties by means of the intensity dispersion of the circular dichroism as a function of photoelectron kinetic energy. In this work, the basics of PECD will be outlined, emphasizing the role of interference from the [Formula: see text] outgoing partial wave of the photoelectron in the PECD transition matrix element, which is responsible for the extreme sensitivity to conformational effects. Examples using molecular systems and interfaces will shed light on the powerful application of PECD to classical conformational effects such as group substitution, isomerism, conformer population and clustering. Moreover, the PECD results will be reported in challenging new fields where conformations play a key role, such as vibrational effects, transient chirality and time- resolved experiments. To date, PECD has mostly been based on synchrotron radiation facilities, but it also has a future as a table-top lab experiment by means of multiphoton ionization. An important application of PECD as an analytical tool will be reported. The aim of this review is to illustrate that in PECD, the presence of conformational effects is essential for understanding a wide range of effects from a new perspective, making it different from classical spectroscopy.",3
Observation of pseudogap in MgB2.,"We investigate the electronic structure of a specially prepared highly dense conventional high temperature superconductor, MgB2, employing high resolution photoemission spectroscopy. The spectral evolution close to the Fermi energy is commensurate to BCS descriptions as expected. However, the spectra in the wider energy range reveal the emergence of a pseudogap much above the superconducting transition temperature indicating an apparent departure from the BCS scenario. The energy scale of the pseudogap is comparable to the energy of the [Formula: see text] phonon mode responsible for superconductivity in MgB2 and the pseudogap can be attributed to the effect of electron-phonon coupling on the electronic structure. These results reveal a scenario of the emergence of the superconducting gap within an electron-phonon coupling induced pseudogap and have significant implications in the study of high temperature superconductors.",3
Assembly/disassembly of a complex icosahedral virus to incorporate heterologous nucleic acids.,"Hollow protein containers are widespread in nature, and include virus capsids as well as eukaryotic and bacterial complexes. Protein cages are studied extensively for applications in nanotechnology, nanomedicine and materials science. Their inner and outer surfaces can be modified chemically or genetically, and the internal cavity can be used to template, store and/or arrange molecular cargos. Virus capsids and virus-like particles (VLP, noninfectious particles) provide versatile platforms for nanoscale bioengineering. Study of capsid protein self-assembly into monodispersed particles, and of VLP structure and biophysics is necessary not only to understand natural processes, but also to infer how these platforms can be redesigned to furnish novel functional VLP. Here we address the assembly dynamics of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), a complex icosahedral virus. IBDV has a ~70 nm-diameter T = 13 capsid with VP2 trimers as the only structural subunits. During capsid assembly, VP2 is synthesized as a precursor (pVP2) whose C terminus is cleaved. The pVP2 C terminus has an amphipathic helix that controls VP2 polymorphism. In the absence of the VP3 scaffolding protein, necessary for control of assembly, 466/456-residue pVP2 intermediates bearing this helix assemble into VLP only when expressed with an N-terminal His6 tag (the HT-VP2-466 protein). HT-VP2-466 capsids are optimal for genetic insertion of proteins (cargo space ~78 000 nm(3)). We established an in vitro assembly/disassembly system of HT-VP2-466-based VLP for heterologous nucleic acid packaging and/or encapsulation of drugs and other molecules. HT-VP2-466 (empty) capsids were disassembled and reassembled by dialysis against low-salt/basic pH and high-salt/acid pH buffers, respectively, thus illustrating the reversibility in vitro of IBDV capsid assembly. HT-VP2-466 VLP also packed heterologous DNA by non-specific confinement during assembly. These and previous results establish the bases for biotechnological applications based on the IBDV capsid and its ability to incorporate exogenous proteins and nucleic acids.",3
Current-induced instability of domain walls in cylindrical nanowires.,"We study the current-driven domain wall (DW) motion in cylindrical nanowires using micromagnetic simulations by implementing the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with nonlocal spin-transfer torque in a finite difference micromagnetic package. We find that in the presence of DW, Gaussian wave packets (spin waves) will be generated when the charge current is suddenly applied to the system. This effect is excluded when using the local spin-transfer torque. The existence of spin waves emission indicates that transverse domain walls can not move arbitrarily fast in cylindrical nanowires although they are free from the Walker limit. We establish an upper velocity limit for DW motion by analyzing the stability of Gaussian wave packets using the local spin-transfer torque. Micromagnetic simulations show that the stable region obtained by using nonlocal spin-transfer torque is smaller than that by using its local counterpart. This limitation is essential for multiple DWs since the instability of Gaussian wave packets will break the structure of multiple DWs.",3
Alternative long-ranged charge optimized many-body potential for aluminium.,"A new COMB3 potential was developed for aluminium, which focuses on long-range interaction and phase transition. The potential was developed by fitting the equilibrium lattice properties of different phases and defects to ensure its transferability to general systems. The quality of the potential was tested in several problems and compared with the EAM potential as well as the published COMB3 potential, the effect of the cutoff method was studied in detail to demonstrate the necessity to extend the cutoff region. Systems of strong deformations along the Bain path, under a trigonal strain and with planar stacking faults were calculated and the present potential performed as well as the EAM potential. At last, a surface process that involves adsorption and diffusion was studied using the present potential.",3
Experimental observation of hysteresis in a coherent metal-hydride phase transition.,"We investigate the hysteresis obtained in the hydrogen absorption and desorption cycle for a single crystal [Formula: see text] superlattice. Below the critical temperature, a small but clear hysteresis is observed in the pressure-composition isotherms, while it is absent above. The experimental results thereby prove the relevance of macroscopic energy barriers for obtaining hysteresis in coherent structural transformations. The textured Pd layer exhibits substantially larger hysteresis effects, which can be related to an irreversible energy loss caused by defect generation in Pd.",3
Temperature and impurity effect on parallel field magnetoconductance of bulk insulating topological insulator (Bi<sub>1-x</sub>Sb<sub>x</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>.,"We have performed a systematic parallel field magnetotransport studies of (Bi&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T e&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to understand the temperature and impurity effect on interference of bulk conductance on the surface states of highly insulating topologically insulating compound Bi2Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The compound exhibits a weak antilocalization effect (WAL) at low temperature and low magnetic field. WAL weakens and weak localization (WL) effect is observed to be developed in the compound with the increase in the temperature due to the creation of topologically trivial 2D electron gas (2DEG) states. Strong interlayer interference and coupling of bulk carriers with surface states are observed at low temperature. Similar kind of temperature effect is observed for all the concentrations of Sb. Topologically protected surface states enhance with the increase in Sb contents up to x=0.3, however, further increase in the Sb concentration leads to decrease in the surface states. The data has been analysed by the generalised Altshuler and Aronov model for parallel field transport anticipating weak antilocalization and interlayer interference.",3
Anisotropic thermal and electrical transport of Weyl semimetal TaAs.,"We report on anisotropic electrical, thermal as well as thermoelectric properties of the prototypical Weyl semimetal TaAs. Compared to the normal metallic behavior along a axis, TaAs is more electrically resistive along c axis and exhibits a semiconductor-like resistivity upturn below [Formula: see text] K. In the same temperature range, the thermal conductivity along c axis shows a pronounced maximum of 183 [Formula: see text] characteristic of a crystalline solid, three times higher than that of a axis. The thermoelectric power, while exhibiting enhanced values around room temperature, becomes diminished in a substantial range of temperature ([Formula: see text] K) for both axes. Together with the enhanced Nernst signals, this hints at a dominating ambipolar diffusion as is frequently seen in a compensated semimetal. An in-depth investigation of the anisotropic transport quantities is expected to yield deep insights into the propagating Weyl fermions in TaAs.",3
Effect of increasing disorder on domains of the 2d Coulomb glass.,"We have studied a two dimensional lattice model of Coulomb glass for a wide range of disorders at [Formula: see text]. The system was first annealed using Monte Carlo simulation. Further minimization of the total energy of the system was done using an algorithm developed by Baranovskii et al, followed by cluster flipping to obtain the pseudo-ground states. We have shown that the energy required to create a domain of linear size L in d dimensions is proportional to [Formula: see text]. Using Imry-Ma arguments given for random field Ising model, one gets critical dimension [Formula: see text] for Coulomb glass. The investigation of domains in the transition region shows a discontinuity in staggered magnetization which is an indication of a first-order type transition from charge-ordered phase to disordered phase. The structure and nature of random field fluctuations of the second largest domain in Coulomb glass are inconsistent with the assumptions of Imry and Ma, as was also reported for random field Ising model. The study of domains showed that in the transition region there were mostly two large domains, and that as disorder was increased the two large domains remained, but a large number of small domains also opened up. We have also studied the properties of the second largest domain as a function of disorder. We furthermore analysed the effect of disorder on the density of states, and showed a transition from hard gap at low disorders to a soft gap at higher disorders. At [Formula: see text], we have analysed the soft gap in detail, and found that the density of states deviates slightly ([Formula: see text]) from the linear behaviour in two dimensions. Analysis of local minima show that the pseudo-ground states have similar structure.",3
Magnetization dynamics of weak stripe domains in Fe-N thin films: a multi-technique complementary approach.,"The resonant eigenmodes of an alpha'-FeN thin film characterized by weak stripe domains are investigated by Brillouin light scattering and broadband ferromagnetic resonance experiments, assisted by micromagnetic simulations. The spectrum of the dynamic eigenmodes in the presence of the weak stripes is very rich and two different families of modes can be selectively detected using different techniques or different experimental configurations. Attention is paid to the evolution of the mode frequencies and spatial profiles under the application of an external magnetic field, of variable intensity, in the direction parallel or transverse to the stripes. The different evolution of the modes with the external magnetic field is accompanied by a distinctive spatial localization in specific regions, such as the closure domains at the surface of the stripes and the bulk domains localized in the inner part of the stripes. The complementarity of BLS and FMR techniques, based on different selection rules, is found to be a fruitful tool for the study of the wealth of localized magnetic excitations generally found in nanostructures.",3
Electrical and thermoelectric transport properties of two-dimensional fermionic systems with k-cubic spin-orbit coupling.,"We investigate the effect of k-cubic spin-orbit interaction on the electrical and thermoelectric transport properties of two-dimensional fermionic systems. We obtain exact analytical expressions of the inverse relaxation time (IRT) and the Drude conductivity for long-range Coulomb and short-range delta scattering potentials. The IRT reveals that the scattering is completely suppressed along the three directions [Formula: see text] with [Formula: see text]. We also obtain analytical results of the thermopower and thermal conductivity at low temperature. The thermoelectric transport coefficients obey the Wiedemann-Franz law, even in the presence of k-cubic Rashba spin-orbit interaction (RSOI) at low temperature. In the presence of a quantizing magnetic field, the signature of the RSOI is revealed through the appearance of the beating pattern in the Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations of thermopower and thermal conductivity in the low magnetic field regime. The empirical formulae for the SdH oscillation frequencies accurately describe the locations of the beating nodes. The beating pattern in magnetothermoelectric measurement can be used to extract the spin-orbit coupling constant.",3
Advanced capabilities for materials modelling with Quantum ESPRESSO.,"Quantum EXPRESSO is an integrated suite of open-source computer codes for quantum simulations of materials using state-of-the-art electronic-structure techniques, based on density-functional theory, density-functional perturbation theory, and many-body perturbation theory, within the plane-wave pseudopotential and projector-augmented-wave approaches. Quantum EXPRESSO owes its popularity to the wide variety of properties and processes it allows to simulate, to its performance on an increasingly broad array of hardware architectures, and to a community of researchers that rely on its capabilities as a core open-source development platform to implement their ideas. In this paper we describe recent extensions and improvements, covering new methodologies and property calculators, improved parallelization, code modularization, and extended interoperability both within the distribution and with external software.",3
Doping Effect on the Physical Properties of Ca<sub>10</sub>Pt<sub>3</sub>As<sub>8</sub>(Fe<sub>2</sub>As<sub>2</sub>)<sub>5</ sub> Single Crystals.,"Ca10Pt3As8(Fe2As2)5 is a unique parent compound for superconductivity, which consists of both semiconducting Pt3As8 and metallic FeAs layers. We report the observation of superconductivity induced via chemical doping in either Ca site using rare-earth (RE) elements (RE = La, Gd) or Fe site using Pt. The interlayer distance and the normal-state physical properties of the doped system change correspondingly. The coupled changes include (1) superconducting transition temperature T_c increases with increasing both doping concentration and interlayer distance, (2) our Tc value is higher than previously reported maximum value for Pt doping in the Fe site, (3) both the normal-state in-plane resistivity and out-of-plane resistivity change from non-metallic to metallic behavior with increasing doping concentration and Tc, and (4) the transverse in-plane magnetoresistance (MRab) changes from linear-field dependence to quadratic behavior upon increasing Tc. For La-doped compound with the highest Tc (~35 K), upper critical fields (""H"" _""c2"" ^""ab"" , ""H"" _""c2"" ^""c"" ), coherence lengths (xiab, xic), and in-plane penetration depth (lambdaab) are estimated. We discuss the relationship between chemical doping, interlayer distance, and physical properties in this system.",3
Stable ultra-thin CdTe crystal: a robust direct gap semiconductor.,"Employing density functional theory based calculations, we investigate structural, vibrational and strain-dependent electronic properties of an ultra-thin CdTe crystal structure that can be derived from its bulk counterpart. It is found that this ultra-thin crystal has an 8-atom primitive unit cell with considerable surface reconstructions. Dynamic stability of the structure is predicted based on its calculated vibrational spectrum. Electronic band structure calculations reveal that both electrons and holes in single layer CdTe possess anisotropic in-plane masses and mobilities. Moreover, we show that the ultra-thin CdTe has some interesting electromechanical features, such as strain-dependent anisotropic variation of the band gap value, and its rapid increase under perpendicular compression. The direct band gap semiconducting nature of the ultra-thin CdTe crystal remains unchanged under all types of applied strain. With a robust and moderate direct band gap, single-layer CdTe is a promising material for nanoscale strain dependent device applications.",3
Two-dimensional thio- and seleno-cyanates of Mo and W.,"The stability of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal di-chalcogenides (TMDC) is controlled by the fact that sulfur or selenium atoms can cap the 2D layers without exposing highly reactive bonds. Here we use first-principles calculations to show that a similar structural motif can stabilize Mo- and W-based 2D materials with thio- or seleno-cyanate groups. In particular, we show that the formation of Mo(SeCN)2, W(SCN)2 and W(SeCN)2 sheets is energetically favorable and can lead to various configurations that resemble the well-known polymorphs of TMDCs. The lowest-energy structures are small-gap semiconductors, while certain polytypes bear Dirac-like cones close to the Fermi energy, demonstrating the potential of these new 2D materials for applications in modern electronic devices.",3
A systematic study of 4d and 5d transition metal mediated exchange coupling between Fe and Gd nanolaminates.,"We present a systematic study of the magnetic coupling between iron and gadolinium layers intermediated by 4d and 5d transition metals using density functional theory. We demonstrate that it is possible to find a magnetic coupling for most of them. In particular, for the early transition metals (d (1), d (2), d (3) and d (4)), a ferromagnetic coupling occurs even stronger than the 3d interlayers. Atomic size and the electronic configuration of the transition metals are crucial for the nature of the coupling. All the open shell transition metals present induced magnetic moments. By increasing the number of interlayers, an oscillating behavior in the magnetic coupling was found and the magnetic coupling goes to zero beyond four spacer layers. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that the interlayer strongly enhances the critical temperature in the Gd layers closest to the interface.",3
Ab initio simulations of water splitting on hematite.,"In recent years, hematite has attracted great interest as a photocatalyst for water splitting, but many questions remain unanswered about the mechanisms and the main limiting factors. For this reason, density functional theory has been used to understand the optical, electronic and chemical properties of this material at an atomistic level. Bulk doping can be used to reduce the band gap, and to increase photoabsorption and charge mobility. Charge transport takes place through adiabatic polaron hopping. The stable (0 0 0 1) surface has a stoichiometric termination when exposed to oxygen, it becomes hydroxylated in water, and it has an oxygen-rich termination under illumination in a photoelectrochemical setup. On the oxygen-rich termination, surface states are present that might act as recombination centres for electrons and holes. On the contrary, on the hydroxylated termination surface states appear only on reaction intermediates. The intrinsic surface states disappear in the presence of an overlayer of gallium oxide. The reaction of water oxidation is assumed to proceed by four proton-coupled electron transfers and it is shown to involve a nucleophilic attack with the formation of an OOH group. Calculated overpotentials are in the range of 0.5-0.6 V. Open questions and future research directions are briefly discussed.",3
Chemical states of surface oxygen during CO oxidation on Pt(1 1 0) surface revealed by ambient pressure XPS.,"The study of CO oxidation on Pt(1 1 0) surface is revisited using ambient pressure x-ray photoemission spectroscopy. When the surface temperature reaches the activation temperature for CO oxidation under elevated pressure conditions, both the alpha-phase of PtO2 oxide and chemisorbed oxygen are formed simultaneously on the surface. Due to the exothermic nature of CO oxidation, the temperature of the Pt surface increases as CO oxidation takes place. As the CO/O2 ratio increases, the production of CO2 increases continuously and the surface temperature also increases. Interestingly, within the diffusion limited regions, the amount of surface oxide changes little while the chemisorbed oxygen is reduced.",3
CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB structures with orthogonal easy axes: perpendicular anisotropy and damping.,"We report on the Gilbert damping parameter alpha, the effective magnetization [Formula: see text], and the asymmetry of the g-factor in bottom-CoFeB(0.93 nm)/MgO(0.90-1.25 nm)/CoFeB(1.31 nm)-top as-deposited systems. Magnetization of CoFeB layers exhibits a specific noncollinear configuration with orthogonal easy axes and with [Formula: see text] values of [Formula: see text] kG and [Formula: see text] kG for the bottom and top layers, respectively. We show that [Formula: see text] depends on the asymmetry [Formula: see text] of the g-factor measured in the perpendicular and the in-plane directions revealing a highly nonlinear relationship. In contrast, the Gilbert damping is practically the same for both layers. Annealing of the films results in collinear easy axes perpendicular to the plane for both layers. However, the linewidth is strongly increased due to enhanced inhomogeneous broadening.",3
Revisiting local structural changes in GeO2 glass at high pressure.,"Despite the great importance in fundamental and industrial fields, understanding structural changes for pressure-induced polyamorphism in network-forming glasses remains a formidable challenge. Here, we revisited the local structural transformations in GeO2 glass up to 54 GPa using x-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy via a combination diamond anvil cell and polycapillary half-lens. Three polyamorphic transitions can be clearly identified by XAFS structure refinement. First, a progressive increase of the nearest Ge-O distance and bond disorder to a maximum at ~5-16 GPa, in the same pressure region of previously observed tetrahedral-octahedral transformation. Second, a marked decrease of the nearest Ge-O distance at ~16-22.6 GPa but a slight increase at ~22.6-32.7 GPa, with a concomitant decrease of bond disorder. This stage can be related to a second-order-like transition from less dense to dense octahedral glass. Third, another decrease in the nearest Ge-O distance at ~32.7-41.4 GPa but a slight increase up to 54 GPa, synchronized with a gradual increase of bond disorder. This stage provides strong evidence for ultrahigh-pressure polyamorphism with coordination number >6. Furthermore, cooperative modification is observed in more distant shells. Those results provide a unified local structural picture for elucidating the polyamorphic transitions and densification process in GeO2 glass.",3
Photonic surface waves on metamaterial interfaces.,"A surface wave (SW) in optics is a light wave, which is supported at an interface of two dissimilar media and propagates along the interface with its field amplitude exponentially decaying away from the boundary. Research on surface waves has been flourishing in the last few decades due to their unique properties of surface sensitivity and field localization. These features have resulted in applications in nano-guiding, sensing, light-trapping and imaging based on near-field techniques, contributing to the establishment of nanophotonics as a field of research. Up to now, a wide variety of surface waves has been investigated in numerous material and structure settings. This article reviews the recent progress and development in the physics of SWs localized at metamaterial interfaces, as well as bulk media in order to provide broader perspectives on optical surface waves in general. For each type of surface wave, we discuss the material and structural platforms. We mainly focus on experimental realizations in the visible and near-infrared wavelength ranges. We also address existing and potential application of SWs in chemical and biological sensing, and experimental excitation and characterization methods.",3
Bilayers of Ni3C12S12 and Pt3C12S12: graphene-like 2D topological insulators tunable by electric fields.,"In the present work we predict, through first-principles calculations, that bilayers of the recently synthesized Ni3 [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] and Pt3 [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] layered materials are topological insulators upon electron doping, and that their topological insulator properties can be modulated by the application of electric fields with magnitudes achievable in devices. The electronic structures of both bilayers are characterized by spin-orbit split graphene-like bands, with gap magnitudes that are three orders of magnitude larger than graphene's. In ribbon geometries, chiral edge modes develop at each side with band dispersions similar to that of Kane-Mele graphene model. Surprisingly, the edge states' spin-propagation locking occurs even for very thin ribbons. We also find that the response of the electronic structure of both materials to applied electric fields are similar to both graphene and the Kane-Mele model with a Rashba term. All these findings indicate that these bilayer systems can be considered as large-spin-orbit graphene analogues with a strong sensitivity to applied electric fields.",3
Monovacancy paramagnetism in neutron-irradiated graphite probed by (13)C NMR.,"We report on the magnetic properties of monovacancy defects in neutron-irradiated graphite, probed by (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The bulk paramagnetism of the defect moments is revealed by the temperature dependence of the NMR frequency shift and spectral linewidth, both of which follow a Curie behavior, in agreement with measurements of the macroscopic magnetization. Compared to pristine graphite, the fluctuating hyperfine fields generated by the defect moments lead to an enhancement of the (13)C nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate [Formula: see text] by about two orders of magnitude. With an applied magnetic field of 7.1 T, the temperature dependence of [Formula: see text] below about 10 K can well be described by a thermally activated form, [Formula: see text], yielding a singular Zeeman energy of ([Formula: see text]) meV, in excellent agreement with the sole presence of polarized, non-interacting defect moments.",3
Relaxation dynamics and polydispersivity associated with defects and ferroelectric correlations in Ba-doped EuTiO3.,"We present the frequency- and temperature-dependent dielectric response of Eu1-x Ba x TiO3 (0 x 0.5) in detail. Excluding grain boundary effects, four relaxation mechanisms were observed. Relaxation dynamics were observed to arise due to hopping conduction associated with defects, namely oxygen vacancies as well as Eu(3+) and Ti(3+) ions. Dielectric relaxation analysis led to the identification of Ti ions in two different environments with different relaxation rates in the overall EuTiO3 perovskite structure. The emergence of another relaxation mechanism associated with ferroelectric order as a consequence of the formation of polar regions was also observed for higher Ba concentrations. The addition of Ba led to the identification of relaxation dynamics associated with hopping conduction between Eu ions, Ti ions (in the regions with and without oxygen vacancies) and with the formation of ferroelectric polar regions. Furthermore, the polydispersivity and relaxation times were extracted within the framework of the modified Debye model. Relaxation times have been observed to increase with a decrease in temperature while larger values of polydispersivity reveal a wide distribution of relaxation times due to the presence of lattice parameter and energy barrier distributions.",3
Polaron effect on the bandgap modulation in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides.,"We theoretically study the bandgap modulation in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) originating from the carrier-optical phonon coupling in the Frohlich polaron model, in which both of the surface optical phonons modes induced by the polar substrate and the intrinsic longitudinal optical phonons modes have been taken into account. We find that the modulated magnitude of the bandgap is in the range of 100-500 meV by altering different polar substrates and tuning the internal distance between TMDs and polar substrate. The large tunability of the bandgap not only provides a possible explanation for the experimental measurements regarding the dielectric environmental sensitivity of the bandgap, but also holds promise for potential applications in optoelectronics and photovoltaics.",3
Twofold stationary states in the classical spin-Hall effect.,"The stationary states occurring in spin-Hall devices are investigated within the framework of the phenomenological two spin-channel model. It is shown that two different stationary states can be defined, which depends on the redistribution of the electric charges between the two spin-channels during the transient time. A first stationary state can be reached if the charge accumulation occurs inside each spin channel independently, while a second stationary state is reached if the two spin channels are undifferentiated from the point of view of the electric charge accumulation. The screening equations that describe the accumulation of electric charges due to spin-orbit coupling are derived in both cases, and the two stationary states are discussed in terms of the Dyakonov-Perel transport equations. It is shown that the equations should be generalized to spin-dependent electric fields in order to take into account the first stationary state. In both cases, the phenomenology is compatible with experimental observations.",3
Polarization rotation and the electrocaloric effect in barium titanate.,"We study the electrocaloric effect in the classic ferroelectric BaTiO3 through a series of phase transitions driven by applied electric field and temperature. We find both negative and positive electrocaloric effects, with the negative electrocaloric effect, where temperature decreases with applied field, in monoclinic phases. Macroscopic polarization rotation is evident through the monoclinic and orthorhombic phases under applied field, and is responsible for the negative electrocaloric effect.",3
Optical properties of graphene nanocones under electric and magnetic fields.,Here we present a theoretical study of the optical properties of graphene nanocones tuned by external electric and magnetic fields. We investigate the effects of the size and topology of the carbon nanostructures on the density of states and on the electro- and magneto-absorption of linearly polarized electromagnetic radiation in different nanocone geometries. We find that the electric field induces changes in the electric charge distribution mainly at the cone edges. In the infrared range the absorption coefficient shows a peculiar dependence on the electric field (magnitude and direction) and on the photon polarization for all investigated structures. Our results suggest that the electric field may be used to control the electric charge at the apex and for a selective light absorption. The presence of an axial magnetic field induces new features in the nanocone density of states due to the induced localization effects. For high fields the density of states exhibits a sequence of peaks resembling the graphene Landau spectra. The magneto-absorption spectra present a series of resonances strongly sensitive to the photon polarization opening routes for manipulation of the optical responses.,3
Squeezed Dirac and topological magnons in a bosonic honeycomb optical lattice.,"Quantum information storage using charge-neutral quasiparticles is expected to play a crucial role in the future of quantum computers. In this regard, magnons or collective spin-wave excitations in solid-state materials are promising candidates in the future of quantum computing. Here, we study the quantum squeezing of Dirac and topological magnons in a bosonic honeycomb optical lattice with spin-orbit interaction by utilizing the mapping to quantum spin-[Formula: see text] XYZ Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice with discrete Z2 symmetry and a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We show that the squeezed magnons can be controlled by the Z2 anisotropy and demonstrate how the noise in the system is periodically modified in the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases of the model. Our results also apply to solid-state honeycomb (anti)ferromagnetic insulators.",3
Large-scale calculations of thermoelectric transport coefficients: a case study of gamma-graphyne with point defects.,"Defects such as vacancies and impurities could have profound effects on the transport properties of thermoelectric materials. However, it is usually quite difficult to directly calculate the thermoelectric properties of defect-containing systems via first-principles methods since a very large supercell is required. In this work, based on the linear response theory and the kernel polynomial method, we present an efficient approach that can help to calculate the thermoelectric transport coefficients of a large system containing millions of atoms at arbitrary chemical potential and temperature. As a prototype example, we consider dilute vacancies and hydrogen impurities in a large-scale gamma-graphyne sheet and discuss their effects on the thermoelectric transport properties.",3
Effect of hydrostatic pressure on the superconducting properties of quasi-1D superconductor K2Cr3As3.,"K2Cr3As3 is a newly discovered quasi-1D superconductor with a T c = 6.1 K and an upper critical field micro 0 H c2(0) approximately 40 T three times larger than the Pauli paramagnetic limit micro 0 H p that is suggestive of a spin-triplet Cooper pairing. In this paper, we have investigated the effects of hydrostatic pressure on its T c and micro 0 H c2 by measuring the ac magnetic susceptibility chi'(T) under magnetic fields at various hydrostatic pressures up to 7.5 GPa. The major findings include: (1) T c is suppressed gradually to below 2 K at 7.5 GPa; (2) the estimated micro 0 H c2(0) decreases dramatically to below micro 0 H p above ~2 GPa and becomes slight lower than the orbital limiting field [Formula: see text] estimated from the initial slope of upper critical field via [Formula: see text] = -0.73T cdH c2/[Formula: see text] in the clean limit; (3) the estimated Maki parameter alpha = radical2[Formula: see text]/H p drops from 4 at ambient pressure to well below 1 at P > 2 GPa, suggesting the crossover from Pauli paramagnetic limiting to orbital limiting in the pair breaking process upon increasing pressure. These observations suggested that the application of hydrostatic pressure could drive K2Cr3As3 away from the ferromagnetic instability and lead to a breakdown of the spin-triplet pairing channel. We have also made a side-by-side comparison and discussed the distinct effects of chemical and physical pressures on the superconducting properties of K2Cr3As3.",3
Evidence for the confinement of magnetic monopoles in quantum spin ice.,"Magnetic monopoles are hypothesised elementary particles connected by Dirac strings that behave like infinitely thin solenoids (Dirac 1931 Proc. R. Soc. A 133 60). Despite decades of searching, free magnetic monopoles and their Dirac strings have eluded experimental detection, although there is substantial evidence for deconfined magnetic monopole quasiparticles in spin ice materials (Castelnovo et al 2008 Nature 326 411). Here we report the detection of a hierarchy of unequally-spaced magnetic excitations via high resolution inelastic neutron spectroscopic measurements on the quantum spin ice candidate [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text]. These excitations are well-described by a simple model of monopole pairs bound by a linear potential (Coldea et al Science 327 177) with an effective tension of 0.642(8) K [Formula: see text] at 1.65 K. The success of the linear potential model suggests that these low energy magnetic excitations are direct spectroscopic evidence for the confinement of magnetic monopole quasiparticles in the quantum spin ice candidate [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text].",3
"Diffusion of interstitials in metallic systems, illustration of a complex study case: aluminum.","While diffusion mechanisms of interstitial elements in fcc systems are generally well-known, especially in the case of H atoms, we show in this work that even in the case of a simple metallic system (aluminum), the diffusion of interstitials exhibits a wide variety of paths and mechanisms that depend on the specie. We used an approach based on first-principles calculations associated with kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations and a multi-state diffusion formalism to compute the diffusion coefficients of five interstitial elements: hydrogen, boron, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. For instance, at the atomic scale, whilst we find that C atoms prefer to be located in octahedral sites (labeled o) rather than in tetrahedral positions (labeled t), we find one additional stable position in the lattice (M). The diffusion through these three stable positions are thus studied in detail. In the case of B atoms, for which the tetrahedral site is found unstable, the diffusion path is between o-o sites. Similarly, in the case of oxygen, t positions are found to be the only stable positions (o are unstable) and the path of migration, along t-t direction, is found through a twice degenerated asymmetric transition state. In the case of H and N atoms for which t and o sites are stable, we explain why the only path is along the t-o direction. Finally, we discuss explicit formulas to compute coefficients of diffusion of interstitials in fcc structures.",3
Electronic and magnetic properties of multiferroic ScFeO3 available from diffraction experiments.,"Electronic and magnetic properties of ferric ions (3d (5)) in multiferroic ScFeO3 are puzzling, in part because they are different from the only other multiferroic known to possess the same polar chemical structure, BiFeO3. Open questions about ScFeO3 can be addressed by confronting observations with results for G-type antiferromagnetism allowed by the lithium niobate (LiNbO3)-like parent R3c structure. Calculated structure factors for resonant x-ray diffraction include all charge-like quadrupoles allowed by symmetry, and if experimental results for ScFeO3 subsequently imply they are different from zero then ferric ions cannot be in the high-spin (6)S state. The same type of experiment can reveal the moment direction in the G-type antiferromagnetism, according to our calculations, and thereby contribute to understanding magnetic anisotropy. Furthermore, structure factors for magnetic neutron diffraction by ScFeO3 include Dirac multipoles that are time-odd and parity-odd, e.g. dipoles that are often called anapoles or toroidal moments. Apart from Dirac multipoles, the conventional approach to the interpretation of neutron Bragg diffraction data will be inadequate if ferric ions (Fe(3+)) are not in the high-spin (6)S state, because the scattering amplitude includes more than simple dipole moments in the general case.",3
Dipole-switch induced modification of the emissive response of carbon nanotubes.,"The interaction of carbon nanotubes with the molecular dipole switch spiropyran is expected to affect the optical response of the tubes. Until now, the need of anchor groups to immobilize the switches on the tubes has hindered the experimental observation of the effects of switching on the emission behavior of the tubes. Here we present spiropyran-carbon nanotube complexes obtained by micelle swelling. This method does not require any anchor nor sophisticated chemistry to warrant close tube-switch proximity. For the first time, we observe the shifts predicted theoretically and their effect on the tubes' excitation and emission energies.",3
Diverse carrier mobility of monolayer BNC x : a combined density functional theory and Boltzmann transport theory study.,"BNC x monolayer as a kind of two-dimensional material has numerous chemical atomic ratios and arrangements with different electronic structures. Via calculations on the basis of density functional theory and Boltzmann transport theory under deformation potential approximation, the band structures and carrier mobilities of BNC x (x = 1,2,3,4) nanosheets are systematically investigated. The calculated results show that BNC2-1 is a material with very small band gap (0.02 eV) among all the structures while other BNC x monolayers are semiconductors with band gap ranging from 0.51 eV to 1.32 eV. The carrier mobility of BNC x varies considerably from tens to millions of cm(2) V(-1) s(-1). For BNC2-1, the hole mobility and electron mobility along both x and y directions can reach 10(5) orders of magnitude, which is similar to the carrier mobility of graphene. Besides, all studied BNC x monolayers obviously have anisotropic hole mobility and electron mobility. In particular, for semiconductor BNC4, its hole mobility along the y direction and electron mobility along the x direction unexpectedly reach 10(6) orders of magnitude, even higher than that of graphene. Our findings suggest that BNC x layered materials with the proper ratio and arrangement of carbon atoms will possess desirable charge transport properties, exhibiting potential applications in nanoelectronic devices.",3
Phase transitions and thermal entanglement of the distorted Ising-Heisenberg spin chain: topology of multiple-spin exchange interactions in spin ladders.,"We consider a symmetric spin-1/2 Ising-XXZ double sawtooth spin ladder obtained from distorting a spin chain, with the XXZ interaction between the interstitial Heisenberg dimers (which are connected to the spins based on the legs via an Ising-type interaction), the Ising coupling between nearest-neighbor spins of the legs and rungs spins, respectively, and additional cyclic four-spin exchange (ring exchange) in the square plaquette of each block. The presented analysis supplemented by results of the exact solution of the model with infinite periodic boundary implies a rich ground state phase diagram. As well as the quantum phase transitions, the characteristics of some of the thermodynamic parameters such as heat capacity, magnetization and magnetic susceptibility are investigated. We prove here that among the considered thermodynamic and thermal parameters, solely heat capacity is sensitive versus the changes of the cyclic four-spin exchange interaction. By using the heat capacity function, we obtain a singularity relation between the cyclic four-spin exchange interaction and the exchange coupling between pair spins on each rung of the spin ladder. All thermal and thermodynamic quantities under consideration should be investigated by regarding those points which satisfy the singularity relation. The thermal entanglement within the Heisenberg spin dimers is investigated by using the concurrence, which is calculated from a relevant reduced density operator in the thermodynamic limit.",3
Quantum modeling of ultrafast photoinduced charge separation.,"Phenomena involving electron transfer are ubiquitous in nature, photosynthesis and enzymes or protein activity being prominent examples. Their deep understanding thus represents a mandatory scientific goal. Moreover, controlling the separation of photogenerated charges is a crucial prerequisite in many applicative contexts, including quantum electronics, photo-electrochemical water splitting, photocatalytic dye degradation, and energy conversion. In particular, photoinduced charge separation is the pivotal step driving the storage of sun light into electrical or chemical energy. If properly mastered, these processes may also allow us to achieve a better command of information storage at the nanoscale, as required for the development of molecular electronics, optical switching, or quantum technologies, amongst others. In this Topical Review we survey recent progress in the understanding of ultrafast charge separation from photoexcited states. We report the state-of-the-art of the observation and theoretical description of charge separation phenomena in the ultrafast regime mainly focusing on molecular- and nano-sized solar energy conversion systems. In particular, we examine different proposed mechanisms driving ultrafast charge dynamics, with particular regard to the role of quantum coherence and electron-nuclear coupling, and link experimental observations to theoretical approaches based either on model Hamiltonians or on first principles simulations.",3
Highly anisotropic electric conductivity in PAN-based carbon nanofibers.,"In addition to the chemical and physical properties of nanostructures their successful utilization for applications is strongly triggered by economic aspects. Electrospinning of nanowires from solution followed by subsequent annealing steps is a comparably cheap technique to fabricate conductive carbon nanofibers (CNF) made from polyacrylonitrile (PAN) molecules in large quantities. In this work, we investigated the microscopic properties of the CNFs with diameters of 100-300 nm by means of Raman and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and correlated these results with transport measurements done with a 4-tip STM. In particular, we investigated the effect of fiber alignment and knot densities, which can be controlled by applying constant creep due to stress during the stabilization process. The comparison of the conductivity obtained from single CNFs revealed further that the fiber crossings within the ensemble structure act as scattering centers and proofs that the transport is along the surfaces of the CNFs.",3
On atomic mechanisms governing the oxidation of Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>.,"Oxidation of Bi2Te3 (space group R-3m) has been investigated using experimental and theoretical means. Based on calorimetry, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and thermodynamic modelling, Bi2Te3 is at equilibrium with Bi2O3 and TeO2, whereby the most stable compound is Bi2Te3, followed by Bi2O3. Hence, the reactivity of Bi towards oxygen is expected to be higher than that of Te. This notion is supported by density functional theory. The strongest bond is formed between Bi and Te, followed by Bi - O. This gives rise to unanticipated atomic processes. Dissociatively adsorbed oxygen diffuses through Bi and Te basal planes of Bi2Te3(0001) and preferably interacts with Bi. The Te termination considerably retards this process. These findings may clarify conflicting literature data. Any basal plane off-cut or Bi terminations trigger oxidation, but a perfect basal cleavage, where only Te terminations are exposed to air, may be stable for a longer period of time. These results are of relevance for applications in which surfaces are of key importance, such as nanostructured Bi2Te3 thermoelectric devices.",3
"Structure, magnetism and electronic properties in 3<i>d</i>-5<i>d</i> based double perovskite (Sr<sub>1-x</sub>Y<sub>x</sub>)<sub>2</sub>FeIrO<sub>6</sub>.","The 3$d$-5$d$ based double perovskites are of current interest as they provide model system to study the interplay between electronic correlation ($U$) and spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Here we report detailed structural, magnetic and transport properties of doped double perovskite material (Sr$_{1-x}$Y$_x$)$_2$FeIrO$_6$ with $x$ $\leq$ 0.2. With substitution of Y, system retains its original crystal structure but structural parameters modify with $x$ in nonmonotonic fashion. The magnetization data for Sr$_2$FeIrO$_6$ show antiferromagnetic type magnetic transition around 45 K, however, a close inspection in data indicates a weak magnetic phase transition around 120 K. No change of structural symmetry has been observed down to low temperature, although the lattice parameters show sudden changes around the magnetic transitions. Sr$_2$FeIrO$_6$ shows an insulating behavior over the whole temperature range which yet does not change with Y substitution. Nature of charge conduction is found to follow thermally activated Mott's variable range hopping and power law behavior for parent and doped samples, respectively. Interestingly, evolution of structural, magnetic and transport behavior in (Sr$_{1-x}$Y$_x$)$_2$FeIrO$_6$ is observed to reverse with $x$ $&gt;$ 0.1 which is believed to arise due to change in transition metal ionic state.",3
Charge-transfer modified embedded atom method dynamic charge potential for Li-Co-O system.,"To overcome the limitation of conventional fixed charge potential methods for the study of Li-ion battery cathode materials, a dynamic charge potential method, charge-transfer modified embedded atom method (CT-MEAM), has been developed and applied to the Li-Co-O ternary system. The accuracy of the potential has been tested and validated by reproducing a variety of structural and electrochemical properties of LiCoO2. A detailed analysis on the local charge distribution confirmed the capability of this potential for dynamic charge modeling. The transferability of the potential is also demonstrated by its reliability in describing Li-rich Li2CoO2 and Li-deficient LiCo2O4 compounds, including their phase stability, equilibrium volume, charge states and cathode voltages. These results demonstrate that the CT-MEAM dynamic charge potential could help to overcome the challenge of modeling complex ternary transition metal oxides. This work can promote molecular dynamics studies of Li ion cathode materials and other important transition metal oxides systems that involve complex electrochemical and catalytic reactions.",3
Vacancies and holes in bulk and at 180 degrees domain walls in lead titanate.,"Domain walls (DWs) in ferroic materials exhibit a plethora of unexpected properties that are different from the adjacent ferroic domains. Still, the intrinsic/extrinsic origin of these properties remains an open question. Here, density functional theory calculations are used to investigate the interaction between vacancies and 180 degrees DWs in the prototypical ferroelectric PbTiO3, with a special emphasis on cationic vacancies and released holes. All vacancies are more easily formed within the DW than in the domains. This is interpreted, using a phenomenological model, as the partial compensation of an extra-tensile stress when the defect is created inside the DW. Oxygen vacancies are found to be always fully ionized, independently of the thermodynamic conditions, while cationic vacancies can be either neutral or partially ionized (oxygen-rich conditions), or fully ionized (oxygen-poor conditions). Therefore, in oxidizing conditions, holes are induced by neutral and partially ionized Pb vacancies. In the bulk PbTiO3, these holes are more stable as delocalized rather than small polarons, but at DWs, the two forms are found to be possible.",3
Onsager's missing steps retraced.,"Onsager's paper on phase transition and phase coexistence in anisotropic colloidal systems is a landmark in the theory of lyotropic liquid crystals. However, an uncompromising scrutiny of Onsager's original derivation reveals that it would be rigorously valid only for ludicrous values of the system's number density (of the order of the reciprocal of the number of particles). Based on Penrose's tree identity and an appropriate variant of the mean-field approach for purely repulsive, hard-core interactions, our theory shows that Onsager's theory is indeed valid for a reasonable range of densities.",3
Polynomial description of inhomogeneous topological superconducting wires.,"We present the universal features of the topological invariant for p-wave superconducting wires after the inclusion of spatial inhomogeneities. Three classes of distributed potentials are studied, a single-defect, a commensurate and an incommensurate model, using periodic site modulations. An analytic polynomial description is achieved by splitting the topological invariant into two parts; one part depends on the chemical potential and the other does not. For the homogeneous case, an elliptical region is found where the topological invariant oscillates. The zeros of these oscillations occur at points where the fermion parity switches for finite wires. The increase of these oscillations with the inhomogeneity strength leads to new isolated non-topological phases. We characterize these new phases according to each class of spatial distributions. Such phases could also be observed in the XY model, to which our model is dual.",3
Influence of the orbital effects on the Majorana quasi-particles in a nanowire.,"Majorana quasi-particles can be realised using magnetic field in the form of diamagnetic (orbital) or paramagnetic effects. In both cases, the magnetic field induces a topologically non-trivial phase of matter. In this paper, the influence of orbital effects on Majorana bound states induced by paramagnetic effects in 1D nanowire is elaborated. The role of orbital effects in density of states and eigenstates of the system is also discussed. Additionally, we show the phase diagram-the magnetic field versus the magnetic flux, which displays a relation between topologically trivial and non-trivial phases. The Majorana bound states existence in the presence of relatively small orbital effects is indicated.",3
"Structural, magnetic and electronic properties of pulsed-laser-deposition grown SrFeO<sub>3-delta</sub> thin films and SrFeO<sub>3-delta</sub> /La<sub>2/3</sub>Ca<sub>1/3</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> multilayers.","We studied the structural, magnetic and electronic properties of SrFeO&lt;sub&gt;3-delta&lt;/sub&gt; (SFO) thin films and SrFeO&lt;sub&gt;3-delta&lt;/sub&gt; /La&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;Ca&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub& gt; (LCMO) superlattices that have been grown with pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on La&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;0.65&lt;/sub &gt;Ta&lt;sub&gt;0.35&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (LSAT) substrates. X-ray reflectometry and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) confirm the high structural quality of the films and flat and atomically sharp interfaces of the superlattices. The STEM data also reveal a difference in the interfacial layer stacking with a SrO layer at the LCMO/SFO and a LaO layer at the SFO/LCMO interfaces along the PLD growth direction. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) data suggest that the as grown SFO films and SFO/LCMO superlattices have an oxygen-deficient SrFeO&lt;sub&gt;3-delta&lt;/sub&gt; structure with I4/ mmm space group symmetry delta </= 0.2). Subsequent ozone annealed SFO films are consistent with an almost oxygen stoichiometric structure (delta approximately 0). The electronic and magnetic properties of these SFO films are similar to the ones of corresponding single crystals. In particular, the as grown SrFeO&lt;sub&gt;3-delta&lt;/sub&gt; films are insulating whereas the ozone annealed films are metallic. The magneto-resistance effects of the as grown SFO films have a similar magnitude as in the single crystals, but extend over a much wider temperature range. Last but not least, for the SFO/LCMO superlattices we observe a rather large exchange bias effect that varies as a function of the cooling field.",3
Negative thermophoresis of nanoparticles interacting with fluids through a purely-repulsive potential.,"Thermophoretic forces acting on nanoparticles are investigated using molecular dynamics simulation. We assume the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential for the interaction between fluid molecules. On the other hand, the interaction between the nanoparticle and the surrounding fluid molecules are assumed to be either LJ or Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) potential, where the latter is purely-repulsive. The effect of the interaction potential on the thermophoretic force is investigated for various situations. It is found that the thermophoretic force basically acts in the direction from the hotter side to the colder side of the nanoparticle. However, when the surrounding fluid is in the liquid phase, the force acts in the reversed direction for the case of the WCA potential. It is clarified that the sign reversal is caused by the different structures observed in the distribution of repulsive forces acting on the nanoparticle.",3
Self-assembly of model proteins into virus capsids.,"We consider self-assembly of proteins into a virus capsid by the methods of molecular dynamics. The capsid corresponds either to SPMV or CCMV and is studied with and without the RNA molecule inside. The proteins are flexible and described by the structure-based coarse-grained model augmented by electrostatic interactions. Previous studies of the capsid self-assembly involved solid objects of a supramolecular scale, e.g. corresponding to capsomeres, with engineered couplings and stochastic movements. In our approach, a single capsid is dissociated by an application of a high temperature for a variable period and then the system is cooled down to allow for self-assembly. The restoration of the capsid proceeds to various extent, depending on the nature of the dissociated state, but is rarely complete because some proteins depart too far unless the process takes place in a confined space.",3
Delocalized versus localized excitations in the photoisomerization of azobenzene-functionalized alkanethiolate SAMs.,"Self-assembled monolayers of azobenzene-functionalized alkanethiolates form molecular ensembles with preferential orientation and significant excitonic coupling among the azobenzene chromophores. We have studied their optical switching with differential reflectance and two-photon-photoemission spectroscopy tuning the excitation wavelength through the excitonically broadened S2 absorption band. While the effective isomerization cross-section increases towards shorter wavelengths, the fraction of cis molecules in the photostationary state decreases. We attribute this observation to the absorption of the cis isomer in the SAM. The photoisomerization in the SAM thereby follows the behavior of non-interacting chromophores in solution, despite the formation of H-aggregates. Our study thus reveals that photoswitching occurs via localized excitations while strongly excitonically coupled, delocalized states do not contribute significantly.",3
"Computational methods for 2D materials: discovery, property characterization, and application design.","The discovery of two-dimensional (2D) materials comes at a time when computational methods are mature and can predict novel 2D materials, characterize their properties, and guide the design of 2D materials for applications. This article reviews the recent progress in computational approaches for 2D materials research. We discuss the computational techniques and provide an overview of the ongoing research in the field. We begin with an overview of known 2D materials, common computational methods, and available cyber infrastructures. We then move onto the discovery of novel 2D materials, discussing the stability criteria for 2D materials, computational methods for structure prediction, and interactions of monolayers with electrochemical and gaseous environments. Next, we describe the computational characterization of the 2D materials' electronic, optical, magnetic, and superconducting properties and the response of the properties under applied mechanical strain and electrical fields. From there, we move on to discuss the structure and properties of defects in 2D materials, and describe methods for 2D materials device simulations. We conclude by providing an outlook on the needs and challenges for future developments in the field of computational research for 2D materials.",3
Statistical analysis of the reduction process of graphene oxide probed by Raman spectroscopy mapping.,"We propose a method for monitoring the large-scale homogeneity of the reduction process of graphene oxide. For this purpose, a Raman mapping technique is employed to probe the evolution of the phonon properties of two different graphene oxide (GO) thin films upon controllable thermal reduction. The reduction of GO is reflected by the upshift of the statistical distribution of the relative intensity ratio of the G and D peaks (I D/I G) of the Raman spectra and is consistent with the ratio obtained for chemically reduced GO. In addition, the shifts of the position distributions of the main Raman modes ([Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]) and their cross-correlation with the I D/I G ratio provides evidence of a change of the doping level, demonstrating the influence of reduction processes on GO films.",3
The influence of the dimensionality of the system on the realization of unconventional Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov pairing in ultra-cold Fermi gases.,"The recent development of experimental techniques in ultracold atomic Fermi gases is extremely helpful in the progress of the realization of the unconventional Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superfluid phase in quasi-one dimensional systems (Liao et al 2010 Nature 467 567). Due to a Fermi surface nesting, which is enhanced in 1D, the low-dimensional systems are particularly good candidates to find the FFLO phase stable. We investigate the influence of a dimensional crossover (from one dimension (1D) to two dimensions (2D) or three dimensions (3D)) on the stability of the FFLO state in the spin-imbalanced attractive Hubbard model.",3
Quasielastic and low-energy inelastic neutron scattering study of HoCrO<sub>3</sub> by high resolution time-of-flight neutron spectroscopy.,n order to understand the origin of the huge quasielastic magnetic scattering&#13; observed previously with a back-scattering neutron spectrometer we&#13; have re-investigated the low energy excitations in HoCrO$_3$ by&#13; inelastic neutron scattering in a much wider energy range with&#13; time-of-flight neutron spectrometers. The inelastic signals are due to&#13; the excitations between the ground state doublet of the Ho ion. The quasielastic signal is due to the fluctuation of the disordered Ho moments. At low temperature the intensity of quasielastic scattering is small. It starts increasing as the temperature increases above 30 K. At the same temperature the elastic intensity due to Ho moment ordering decreases in a similar way. This observation strengthens the hypothesis that the quasielastic scattering is due the fluctuations of the disordered Ho moments. The time scale of fluctuations has been determine from the quasielastic scattering and was found to vary from about 22 ps at T = 70 K to about 2.5 ps at T = 160 K. The stretched exponential line shape indicates a distribution of decay rates at low temperatures.,3
Manipulating magnetism by ultrafast control of the exchange interaction.,"In recent years, the optical control of exchange interactions has emerged as an exciting new direction in the study of the ultrafast optical control of magnetic order. Here we review recent theoretical works on antiferromagnetic systems, devoted to (i) simulating the ultrafast control of exchange interactions, (ii) modeling the strongly nonequilibrium response of the magnetic order and (iii) the relation with relevant experimental works developed in parallel. In addition to the excitation of spin precession, we discuss examples of rapid cooling and the control of ultrafast coherent longitudinal spin dynamics in response to femtosecond optically induced perturbations of exchange interactions. These elucidate the potential for exploiting the control of exchange interactions to find new scenarios for both faster and more energy-efficient manipulation of magnetism.",3
Ground state properties of 3d metals from self-consistent GW approach.,"The self consistent GW approach (scGW) has been applied to calculate the ground state properties (equilibrium Wigner-Seitz radius S WZ and bulk modulus B) of 3d transition metals Sc, Ti, V, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu. The approach systematically underestimates S WZ with average relative deviation from the experimental data of about 1% and it overestimates the calculated bulk modulus with relative error of about 25%. It is shown that scGW is superior in accuracy as compared to the local density approximation but it is less accurate than the generalized gradient approach for the materials studied. If compared to the random phase approximation, scGW is slightly less accurate, but its error for 3d metals looks more systematic. The systematic nature of the deviation from the experimental data suggests that the next order of the perturbation theory should allow one to reduce the error.",3
Spin reorientation and disordered rare earth magnetism in Ho<sub>2</sub>FeCoO<sub>6</sub>.,"We report the experimental observation of spin reorientation in the double perovskite Ho&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;FeCoO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. The magnetic phase transitions in this compound are characterized and studied through magnetization and specific heat, and the magnetic structures are elucidated through neutron powder diffraction. Two magnetic phase transitions are observed in this compound - one at T&lt;sub&gt;N1&lt;/sub&gt; approximately 250 K, from paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic, and the other at T&lt;sub&gt;N2&lt;/sub&gt; approximately 45 K, from a phase with mixed magnetic structures to a single phase through a spin reorientation process. The magnetic structure in the temperature range 200 K -45 K is a mixed phase of the irreducible representations Gamma&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and Gamma&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, both of which are antiferromagnetic. The phase with mixed magnetic structures that exists in Ho&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;FeCoO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; gives rise to a large thermal hysteresis in magnetization that extends from 200 K down to the spin reorientation temperature. At T&lt;sub&gt;N2&lt;/sub&gt;, the magnetic structure transforms to Gamma&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Though long-range magnetic order is established in the transition metal lattice, it is seen that only short-range magnetic order prevails in Ho&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; - lattice. Our results should motivate further detailed studies on single crystals in order to explore spin reorientation process, spin switching and the possibility of anisotropic magnetic interactions giving rise to electric polarization in Ho&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;FeCoO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.",3
Role of charged impurities in thermoelectric transport in molybdenum disulfide monolayers.,"A theoretical study of the electronic properties, namely, electrical conductivity (EC), electronic thermal conductivity (ETC) and thermoelectric power (TEP) in 2D MoS2 monolayers (MLs), over a wide range of temperatures (10 < T < 300 K), is presented employing Boltzmann transport formalism. Considering the electrons to be scattered by screened charged impurities and the acoustic, optical and remote phonons, the transport equation is solved using Ritz iterative method. Numerical calculations of EC, ETC and TEP presented for supported and free-standing MLs with high electron concentrations, as a function of temperature, bring out the relative importance of the various scattering mechanisms operative. The role of CIs, with regard to both concentration and separation from the substrate-ML interface, in determining the properties of supported MLs is demonstrated for the first time. Validity of Wiedemann-Franz law and Mott formula are examined for supported and free standing MLs. Calculations are in consonance with recent experimental data on mobility and TEP of exfoliated SiO2-supported MoS2 ML samples. In the case of TEP it is found that though the diffusion contribution is dominant the inclusion of the drag component, incorporating contributions from all relevant phonon scattering mechanisms, is needed to obtain good agreement with the data.",3
Electric control of the bandgap in quantum wells with band-inverted junctions.,"In IV-VI semiconductor heterojunctions with band-inversion, such as those made of [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text]Te or [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text]Se, interface states are properly described by a two-band model, predicting the appearance of a Dirac cone in single junctions. However, in quantum wells the interface dispersion is quadratic in momentum and the energy spectrum presents a gap. We show that the interface gap shrinks under an electric field parallel to the growth direction. Therefore, the interface gap can be dynamically tuned in experiments on double-gated quantum wells based on band-inverted compounds.",3
Nonclassical nucleation pathways in protein crystallization.,"Classical nucleation theory (CNT), which was established about 90 years ago, has been very successful in many research fields, and continues to be the most commonly used theory in describing the nucleation process. For a fluid-to-solid phase transition, CNT states that the solute molecules in a supersaturated solution reversibly form small clusters. Once the cluster size reaches a critical value, it becomes thermodynamically stable and favored for further growth. One of the most important assumptions of CNT is that the nucleation process is described by one reaction coordinate and all order parameters proceed simultaneously. Recent studies in experiments, computer simulations and theory have revealed nonclassical features in the early stage of nucleation. In particular, the decoupling of order parameters involved during a fluid-to-solid transition leads to the so-called two-step nucleation mechanism, in which a metastable intermediate phase (MIP) exists between the initial supersaturated solution and the final crystals. Depending on the exact free energy landscapes, the MIPs can be a high density liquid phase, mesoscopic clusters, or a pre-ordered state. In this review, we focus on the studies of nonclassical pathways in protein crystallization and discuss the applications of the various scenarios of two-step nucleation theory. In particular, we focus on protein solutions in the presence of multivalent salts, which serve as a model protein system to study the nucleation pathways. We wish to point out the unique features of proteins as model systems for further studies.",3
Fulde-Ferrell state in superconducting core/shell nanowires: role of the orbital effect.,"The orbital effect on the Fulde-Ferrell (FF) phase is investigated in superconducting core/shell nanowires subjected to the axial magnetic field. Confinement in the radial direction results in quantization of the electron motion with energies determined by the radial j and orbital m quantum numbers. In the external magnetic field, the twofold degeneracy with respect to the orbital magnetic quantum number m is lifted which leads to the Fermi wave vector mismatch between the paired electrons, [Formula: see text]. This mismatch is transferred to the nonzero total momentum of the Cooper pairs, which results in a formation of the FF phase occurring sequentially with increasing magnetic field. By changing the nanowire radius R and the superconducting shell thickness d, we discuss the role of the orbital effect in the FF phase formation in both the nanowire-like ([Formula: see text]) and nanofilm-like ([Formula: see text]) regime. We have found that the irregular pattern of the FF phase which appears for the case of the nanowire-like regime, for the nanofilm-like geometry evolves towards the regular distribution in which the FF phase stability regions emerge periodically between the BCS states. The transition between these two different phase diagrams is explained as resulting from the orbital effect and the multigap character of superconductivity in the core/shell nanowires.",3
Electrochemical phase diagrams of Ni from ab initio simulations: role of exchange interactions on accuracy.,"The stabilities of Ni metal and its derived compounds, including oxides, hydroxides, and oxyhydroxides under electrochemical conditions, can be readily predicted from the Ni Pourbaix diagram, where the formation free energies of the involved species are utilized to construct the phase stability map with respect to electrode potential and pH. We calculate and analyze the crystal structures, electronic structures, and thermodynamic energies of Ni metal and its compounds using different exchange-correlation functionals to density-functional-theory (DFT), including the semilocal LDA and GGA density functionals, the nonlocal metaGGA, and the hybrid density functionals. Next, we simulate the corresponding Ni Pourbaix diagrams to compare systematically the performance of the functional to each other and to experimental observations. We show that the structures and energies obtained from experimental databases may not be sufficiently accurate to describe direct electrochemical observations, and we explain how the electronic exchange within the density functionals plays a key role in determining the accuracy of the DFT calculated electronic, thermodynamic, and electrochemical properties. We find that only the hybrid density functional produces reliable results owing to the fractional contribution of exact Fock exchange included therein. Last, based on our accurate Ni Pourbaix diagram, we construct band-gap and magnetic electrochemical maps which can facilitate more experimental measurements and property assessments under variable potential and pH in the future.",3
Compact modes in quasi one dimensional coupled magnetic oscillators.,"In this work we study analytically and numerically the spectrum and localization properties of three quasi-one-dimensional (ribbons) split-ring resonator arrays which possess magnetic flatbands, namely, the stub, Lieb and kagome lattices, and how their spectra are affected by the presence of perturbations that break the delicate geometrical interference needed for a magnetic flatband to exist. We find that the stub and Lieb ribbons are stable against the three types of perturbations considered here, while the kagome ribbon is, in general, unstable. When losses are incorporated, all flatbands remain dispersionless but become complex, with the kagome ribbon exhibiting the highest loss rate. The stability of flatband modes of certain split-ring resonator arrays suggests that they could be used as components of future stable magnetic storage devices.",3
Atomic-scale distortions and temperature-dependent large pseudogap in thin films of the parent iron-chalcogenide superconductor Fe<sub>1+y</sub>Te.,"We investigate by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy/Spectroscopy (STM/STS) and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations the surface structures and the electronic properties of Fe1+yTe thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition. Contrary to the regular arrangement of antiferromagnetic nanostripes previously reported on cleaved single-crystal samples, the surface of Fe1+yTe thin films displays a peculiar distribution of spatially inhomogeneous nanostripes. Both STM and DFT calculations show the bias-dependent nature of such features and support the interpretation of spin-polarized tunneling between the FeTe surface and an unintentionally magnetized tip. In addition, the spatial inhomogeneity is interpreted as a purely electronic effect, related to changes in hybridization and Fe-Fe bond length driven by local variations in the concentration of excess interstitial Fe cations. Unexpectedly, the surface density of states measured by STS strongly evolves with temperature in close proximity to the antiferromagnetic-paramagnetic first-order transition, and reveals a large pseudogap of 180-250 meV at about 50-65 K. We believe that in this temperature range a phase transition takes place and the system orders and locks into particular combinations of orbitals and spins, because of the interplay between excess interstitial magnetic Fe and strongly correlated d-electrons.",3
A study of electron and thermal transport in layered titanium disulphide single crystals.,"We present a detailed study of thermal and electrical transport behavior of single crystal titanium disulphide flakes, which belong to the two dimensional, transition metal dichalcogenide class of materials. In-plane Seebeck effect measurements revealed a typical metal-like linear temperature dependence in the range of 85-285 K. Electrical transport measurements with in-plane current geometry exhibited a nearly T (2) dependence of resistivity in the range of 42-300 K. However, transport measurements along the out-of-plane current geometry showed a transition in temperature dependence of resistivity from T (2) to T (5) beyond 200 K. Interestingly, Au ion-irradiated TiS2 samples showed a similar T (5) dependence of resistivity beyond 200 K, even in the current-in-plane geometry. Micro-Raman measurements were performed to study the phonon modes in both pristine and ion-irradiated TiS2 crystals.",3
Length of encapsidated cargo impacts stability and structure of in vitro assembled alphavirus core-like particles.,"In vitro assembly of alphavirus nucleocapsid cores, called core-like particles (CLPs), requires a polyanionic cargo. There are no sequence or structure requirements to encapsidate single-stranded nucleic acid cargo. In this work, we wanted to determine how the length of the cargo impacts the stability and structure of the assembled CLPs. We hypothesized that cargo neutralizes the basic region of the alphavirus capsid protein and if the cargo is long enough, it will also act to scaffold the CP monomers together. Experimentally we found that CLPs encapsidating short 27mer oligonucleotides were less stable than CLPs encapsidating 48mer or 90mer oligonucleotides under different chemical and thermal conditions. Furthermore, cryo-EM studies showed there were structural differences between CLPs assembled with 27mer and 48mer cargo. To mimic the role of the cargo in CLP assembly we made a mutant (4D) where we substituted a cluster of four Lys residues in the CP with four Asp residues. We found that these few amino acid substitutions were enough to initiate CLP assembly in the absence of cargo. The cargo-free 4D CLPs show higher resistance to ionic strength and increased temperature compared to wild-type cargo containing CLPs suggesting their CLP assembly mechanism might also be different.",3
Ir d-band derived superconductivity in the lanthanum-iridium system LaIr3.,"The electronic properties of the heavy metal superconductor [Formula: see text] are reported. The estimated superconducting parameters obtained from physical properties measurements indicate that [Formula: see text] is a BCS-type superconductor. Electronic band structure calculations show that Ir d-states dominate the Fermi level. A comparison of electronic band structures of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] shows that the Ir-compound has a strong spin-orbit-coupling effect, which creates a complex Fermi surface.",3
A new tracking algorithm for multiple colloidal particles close to contact.,"In this paper, we propose a new algorithm based on radial symmetry center method to track colloidal particles close to contact, where the optical images of the particles start to overlap in digital video microscopy. This overlapping effect is important to observe the pair interaction potential in colloidal studies and it appears as additional interaction in the measurement of the interaction with conventional tracking analysis. The proposed algorithm in this work is simple, fast and applicable for not only two particles but also three and more particles without any modification. The algorithm uses gradient vectors of the particle intensity distribution, which allows us to use a part of the symmetric intensity distribution in the calculation of the actual particle position. In this study, simulations are performed to see the performance of the proposed algorithm for two and three particles, where the simulation images are generated by using fitted curve to experimental particle image for different sized particles. As a result, the algorithm yields the maximum error smaller than 2 nm for [Formula: see text] mum silica particles in contact condition.",3
Smectic phases in ionic liquid crystals.,"Ionic liquid crystals (ILCs) are anisotropic mesogenic molecules which carry charges and therefore combine properties of liquid crystals, e.g. the formation of mesophases, and of ionic liquids, such as low melting temperatures and tiny triple-point pressures. Previous density functional calculations have revealed that the phase behavior of ILCs is strongly affected by their molecular properties, i.e. their aspect ratio, the loci of the charges, and their interaction strengths. Here, we report new findings concerning the phase behavior of ILCs as obtained by density functional theory and Monte Carlo simulations. The most important result is the occurrence of a novel, wide smectic-A phase [Formula: see text], at low temperature, the layer spacing of which is larger than that of the ordinary high-temperature smectic-A phase [Formula: see text]. Unlike the ordinary smectic S A phase, the structure of the [Formula: see text] phase consists of alternating layers of particles oriented parallel to the layer normal and oriented perpendicular to it.",3
Deep level defects in 4H-SiC introduced by ion implantation: the role of single ion regime.,"We characterized intrinsic deep level defects created in ion collision cascades which were produced by patterned implantation of single accelerated 2.0 MeV He and 600 keV H ions into n-type 4H-SiC epitaxial layers using a fast-scanning reduced-rate ion microbeam. The initial deep level transient spectroscopy measurement performed on as-grown material in the temperature range 150-700 K revealed the presence of only two electron traps, Z 1/2 (0.64 eV) and EH6/7 (1.84 eV) assigned to the two different charge state transitions of the isolated carbon vacancy, V C (=/0) and (0/+). C-V measurements of as-implanted samples revealed the increasing free carrier removal with larger ion fluence values, in particular at depth corresponding to a vicinity of the end of an ion range. The first DLTS measurement of as-implanted samples revealed formation of additional deep level defects labelled as ET1 (0.35 eV), ET2 (0.65 eV) and EH3 (1.06 eV) which were clearly distinguished from the presence of isolated carbon vacancies (Z 1/2 and EH6/7 defects) in increased concentrations after implantations either by He or H ions. Repeated C-V measurements showed that a partial net free-carrier recovery occurred in as-implanted samples upon the low-temperature annealing following the first DLTS measurement. The second DLTS measurement revealed the almost complete removal of ET2 defect and the partial removal of EH3 defect, while the concentrations of Z 1/2 and EH6/7 defects increased, due to the low temperature annealing up to 700 K accomplished during the first temperature scan. We concluded that the ET2 and EH3 defects: (i) act as majority carrier removal traps, (ii) exhibit a low thermal stability and (iii) can be related to the simple point-like defects introduced by light ion implantation, namely interstitials and/or complex of interstitials and vacancies in both carbon and silicon sub-lattices.",3
Origin of the magnetic transition at 100 K in epsilon-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles studied by X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy.,"We present a study of the correlation between the magnetic phase transition and the structural distortion observed at 100 K in epsilon-Fe2O3. For this purpose, we have designed a novel one-pot sol-gel method assisted by glycerol, which reproducibly provides samples with a nominal 100% concentration of epsilon-Fe2O3 nanoparticles embedded in a SiO2 matrix. The high crystallinity of the samples and the absence of other iron oxide polymorphs has allowed us to perform, for the first time, temperature-dependent X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy experiments, with the aim of investigating the origin of the magnetic quenching anomaly observed at 100 K. The deformation of the structure at a local scale, where the tetrahedral and octahedral Fe sites undergo distortions of different intensities, has been simulated to fulfill the long-range order. Our results point to a local structure distortion accompanied by the magnetism quenching through a magneto-elastic coupling.",3
Sensitivity of the mixing-current technique for the detection of mechanical motion in the coherent tunnelling regime.,"In a recent publication we have studied theoretically the sensitivity of the mixing-current technique to detect nanomechanical motion by coupling the oscillator to a single-electron transistor in the incoherent tunnelling regime: [Formula: see text], where Gamma is the tunnelling rate, T is the electronic temperature, [Formula: see text] and k B are the Planck and the Boltzmann constant, respectively. In this work we consider the same problem when the detection device is a quantum dot in the coherent tunnelling regime ([Formula: see text]). In order to reach the best sensitivity we find that one should enter the strong coupling regime, as described in the recent publication (Micchi et al 2015 Phys. Rev. Lett. 115 206802) where a mechanical bistability is described. In this regime the electronic detection device strongly modifies the effective potential of the oscillator and the non-linearities determine the form of the displacement fluctuation spectrum. We find theoretical upper bounds to the sensitivity for the detection of the oscillation amplitude of the oscillator. It turns out that it is convenient to work as close as possible to the bistability.",3
Thermal transport in topological-insulator-based superconducting hybrid structures with mixed singlet and triplet pairing states.,"In the framework of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation, we investigate the thermal transport properties in topological-insulator-based superconducting hybrid structures with mixed spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairing states, and emphasize the different manifestations of the spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairing states in the thermal transport signatures. It is revealed that the temperature-dependent differential thermal conductance strongly depends on the components of the pairing state, and the negative differential thermal conductance only occurs in the spin-singlet pairing state dominated regime. It is also found that the thermal conductance is profoundly sensitive to the components of the pairing state. In the spin-singlet pairing state controlled regime, the thermal conductance obviously oscillates with the phase difference and junction length. With increasing the proportion of the spin-triplet pairing state, the oscillating characteristic of the thermal conductance fades out distinctly. These results suggest an alternative route for distinguishing the components of pairing states in topological-insulator-based superconducting hybrid structures.",3
Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy studies of metallic surface and interface states of oxide insulators.,"Over the last decade, conducting states embedded in insulating transition metal oxides (TMOs) have served as gateways to discovering and probing surprising phenomena that can emerge in complex oxides, while also opening opportunities for engineering advanced devices. These states are commonly realized at thin film interfaces, such as the well-known case of LaAlO3 (LAO) grown on SrTiO3 (STO). In recent years, the use of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to investigate the k-space electronic structure of such materials led to the discovery that metallic states can also be formed on the bare surfaces of certain TMOs. In this topical review, we report on recent studies of low-dimensional metallic states confined at insulating oxide surfaces and interfaces as seen from the perspective of ARPES, which provides a direct view of the occupied band structure. While offering a fairly broad survey of progress in the field, we draw particular attention to STO, whose surface is so far the best-studied, and whose electronic structure is probably of the most immediate interest, given the ubiquitous use of STO substrates as the basis for conducting oxide interfaces. The ARPES studies provide crucial insights into the electronic band structure, orbital character, dimensionality/confinement, spin structure, and collective excitations in STO surfaces and related oxide surface/interface systems. The obtained knowledge increases our understanding of these complex materials and gives new perspectives on how to manipulate their properties.",3
Phase field crystal simulation of stress induced localized solid-state amorphization in nanocrystalline materials.,"In this work, the phase field crystal (PFC) method is used to study the localized solid-state amorphization (SSA) and its dynamic transformation process in polycrystalline materials under the uniaxial tensile deformation with different factors. The impacts of these factors, including strain rates, temperatures and grain sizes, are analyzed. Kinetically, the ultra-high strain rate causes the lattice to be seriously distorted and the grain to gradually collapse, so the dislocation density rises remarkably. Therefore, localized SSA occurs. Thermodynamically, as high temperature increases the activation energy, the atoms are active and prefer to leave the original position, which induce atom rearrangement. Furthermore, small grain size increases the percentage of grain boundary and the interface free energy of the system. As a result, Helmholtz free energy increases. The dislocations and Helmholtz free energy act as the seed and driving force for the process of the localized SSA. Also, the critical diffusion-time step and the percentage of amorphous region areas are calculated. Through this work, the PFC method is proved to be an effective means to study localized SSA under uniaxial tensile deformation.",3
A bird's eye view on the flat and conic band world of the honeycomb and Kagome lattices: towards an understanding of 2D metal-organic frameworks electronic structure.,"We present a thorough tight-binding analysis of the band structure of a wide variety of lattices belonging to the class of honeycomb and Kagome systems including several mixed forms combining both lattices. The band structure of these systems are made of a combination of dispersive and flat bands. The dispersive bands possess Dirac cones (linear dispersion) at the six corners (K points) of the Brillouin zone although in peculiar cases Dirac cones at the center of the zone [Formula: see text] point) appear. The flat bands can be of different nature. Most of them are tangent to the dispersive bands at the center of the zone but some, for symmetry reasons, do not hybridize with other states. The objective of our work is to provide an analysis of a wide class of so-called ligand-decorated honeycomb Kagome lattices that are observed in a 2D metal-organic framework where the ligand occupy honeycomb sites and the metallic atoms the Kagome sites. We show that the p x -p y graphene model is relevant in these systems and there exists four types of flat bands: Kagome flat (singly degenerate) bands, two kinds of ligand-centered flat bands (A2 like and E like, respectively doubly and singly degenerate) and metal-centered (three fold degenerate) flat bands.",3
Advanced capabilities for materials modelling with Quantum ESPRESSO.,"Quantum ESPRESSO is an integrated suite of open-source computer codes for quantum simulations of materials using state-of-the art electronic-structure techniques, based on density-functional theory, density-functional perturbation theory, and many-body perturbation theory, within the plane-wave pseudo-potential and projector-augmented-wave approaches. Quantum ESPRESSO owes its popularity to the wide variety of properties and processes it allows to simulate, to its performance on an increasingly broad array of hardware architectures, and to a community of researchers that rely on its capabilities as a core open-source development platform to implement theirs ideas. In this paper we describe recent extensions and improvements, covering new methodologies and property calculators, improved parallelization, code modularization, and extended interoperability both within the distribution and with external software.",3
Magnetization dynamics of weak stripe domains in Fe-N thin films: a multi-technique complementary approach.,"The resonant eigenmodes of a nitrogen-implanted iron alpha'-FeN characterized by weak stripe domains are investigated by Brillouin light scattering and broadband ferromagnetic resonance experiments, assisted by micromagnetic simulations. The spectrum of the dynamic eigenmodes in the presence of the weak stripes is very rich and two different families of modes can be selectively detected using different techniques or different experimental configurations. Attention is paid to the evolution of the mode frequencies and spatial profiles under the application of an external magnetic field, of variable intensity, in the direction parallel or transverse to the stripes. The different evolution of the modes with the external magnetic field is accompanied by a distinctive spatial localization in specific regions, such as the closure domains at the surface of the stripes and the bulk domains localized in the inner part of the stripes. The complementarity of BLS and FMR techniques, based on different selection rules, is found to be a fruitful tool for the study of the wealth of localized mag-netic excitations generally found in nanostructures.",3
A systematic study of <i>4d</i> and <i>5d</i> transition metal mediated exchange coupling between Fe and Gd nanolaminates.,"We present a systematic study of the magnetic coupling between iron and gadolinium layers&#13; intermediated by 4d and 5d transition metals using density functional theory. We demonstrate that&#13; it is possible to nd a magnetic coupling for most of them. In particular, for the early transition&#13; metals (d1, d2, d3 and d4) , a ferromagnetic coupling occurs even stronger than the 3d interlayers.&#13; Atomic size and the electronic conguration of the transition metals are crucial for the nature of the&#13; coupling. All the open shell transition metals present induced magnetic moments. By increasing the&#13; number of interlayers, an oscillating behavior in the magnetic coupling was found and the magnetic&#13; coupling goes to zero after four spacer layers. Using Monte carlo simulations, we demonstrate that&#13; the interlayer strongly enhances the critical temperature in the Gd layers closest to the interface.",3
Fermi surface map of large-scale single-orientation graphene on SiO2.,"Large scale tetraoctylammonium-assisted electrochemical transfer of graphene grown on single-crystalline Ir(1 1 1) films by chemical vapour deposition is reported. The transferred samples are characterized in air with optical microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and four point transport measurements, providing the sheet resistance and the Hall carrier concentration. In vacuum we apply low energy electron diffraction and photoelectron spectroscopy that indicate transferred large-scale single orientation graphene. Angular resolved photoemission reveals a Fermi surface and a Dirac point energy which are consistent with charge neutral graphene.",3
Hole dephasing caused by hole-hole interaction in a multilayered black phosphorus.,We study the magnetotransport of holes in a multilayered black phosphorus in a temperature range of 1.9 to 21.5 K. We observed a negative magnetoresistance at magnetic fields up to 1.5 T. This negative magetoresistance was analyzed by weak localization theory in diffusive regime. At the lowest temperature and the highest carrier density we found a phase coherence length of 48 nm. The linear temperature dependence of the dephasing rate shows that the hole-hole scattering processes with small energy transfer are the dominant contribution in breaking the carrier phase coherence.,3
Evidence for the Confinement of Magnetic Monopoles in Quantum Spin Ice.,"Magnetic monopoles are hypothesised elementary particles connected by Dirac strings that behave like infinitely thin solenoids [Dirac 1931 Proc. Roy. Soc. A 133 60]. Despite decades of searches, free magnetic monopoles and their Dirac strings have eluded experimental detection, although there is substantial evidence for deconfined magnetic monopole quasiparticles in spin ice materials [Castelnovo, Moessner & Sondhi 2008 Nature 326 411]. Here we report the detection of a hierarchy of unequally-spaced magnetic excitations via high resolution inelastic neutron spectroscopic measurements on the quantum spin ice candidate Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;. These excitations are well-described by a simple model of monopole pairs bound by a linear potential [Coldea et al. Science 327 177] with an effective tension of 0.7(1) K/Angstrom. The success of the linear potential model suggests that these low energy magnetic excitations are direct spectroscopic evidence for the confinement of magnetic monopole quasiparticles in the quantum spin ice candidate Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;.",3
Bilayers of Ni<sub>3</sub>C<sub>12</sub>S<sub>12</sub> and Pt<sub>3</sub>C<sub>12</sub>S<sub>12</sub>: graphene-like 2D topological insulators tunable by electric fields.,"In the present work we predict, through first-principles calculations, that bilayers of the recently synthesized Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; layered materials are topological insulators upon electron doping, and that that their topological insulator properties can be modulated by the application of electric fields with magnitudes achievable in devices. The electronic structures of both bilayers are characterized by spin-orbit split graphene-like bands, with gap magnitudes that are three orders of magnitude larger than graphene's. In ribbon geometries, chiral edge modes develop at each side with band dispersions similar to that of Kane-Mele graphene model. Surprisingly, the edge states' spin-propagation locking occurs even for very thin ribbons. We also find that the response of the electronic structure of both materials to applied electric fields are similar to both graphene and the Kane-Mele model with a Rashba term. All these findings indicate that these bilayer systems can be considered as large-spin-orbit graphene analogues with a strong sensitivity to applied electric fields.",3
Strain engineering on transmission carriers of monolayer phosphorene.,"The effects of uniaxial strain on the structure, band gap and transmission carriers of monolayer phosphorene were investigated by first-principles calculations. The strain induced semiconductor-metal as well as direct-indirect transitions were studied in monolayer phosphorene. The position of CBM which belonged to indirect gap shifts along the direction of the applied strain. We have concluded the change rules of the carrier effective mass when plane strains are applied. In band structure, the sudden decrease of band gap or the new formation of CBM (VBM) causes the unexpected change in carrier effective mass. The effects of zigzag and armchair strain on the effective electron mass in phosphorene are different. The strain along zigzag direction has effects on the electrons effective mass along both zigzag and armchair direction. By contrast, armchair-direction strain seems to affect only on the free electron mass along zigzag direction. For the holes, the effective masses along zigzag direction are largely affected by plane strains while the effective mass along armchair direction exhibits independence in strain processing. The carrier density of monolayer phosphorene at 300 K is calculated about [Formula: see text] cm(-2), which is greatly influenced by the temperature and strain. Strain engineering is an efficient method to improve the carrier density in phosphorene.",3
"Diffusion of interstitials in metallic systems, illustration of a complex study case: aluminum.","While diffusion mechanisms of interstitial elements in fcc systems are generally well-known, especially in the case of H atoms, we show in this work that even in the case of a simple metallic system (aluminum), the diffusion of interstitials exhibits a wide variety of paths and mechanisms that depend on the specie. We used an approach based on first-principles calculations associated with kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations and a multi-state diffusion formalism to compute the diffusion coefficients of five interstitial elements: hydrogen, boron, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. For instance, at the atomic scale, whilst we find that C atoms prefer to be located in octahedral sites (labeled $o$) rather than in tetrahedral positions (labeled $t$), we find one additional stable position in the lattice ($M$). The diffusion through these three stable positions are thus studied in detail. In the case of B atoms, for which the tetrahedral site is found unstable, the diffusion path is between $o$-$o$ sites. Similarly, in the case of oxygen, $t$ positions are found to be the only stable positions ($o$ are unstable) and the path of migration, along $t$-$t$ direction, is found through a twice degenerated asymmetric transition state. In the case of H and N atoms for which $t$ and $o$ sites are stable, we explain why the only path is along the $t$-$o$ direction. Finally, we discuss explicit formulas to compute coefficients of diffusion of interstitials in fcc structures.&#13.",3
Possible instability of the Fermi sea against surface plasma oscillations.,"We derive a generic formalism for studying the energy conversion processes in bounded metals. Using this formalism we show that in the collision-less limit the Fermi sea of metals should experience an instability against surface plasma oscillations, which opens for the latter an intrinsic self-amplification channel. The origin of the instability is clarified as arising from novel effects resulting from the translation symetry breaking due to the very presence of surface. The amplification rate of this channel is analytically evaluated on the basis of energy conservation and the effects of losses are discussed. In particular, the unique role played by the surface in energy conversion is unveiled. In contrast with common wisdom and in line with observations, Landau damping is shown as always overcompensated and therefore poses no serious issues in sub-wavelength plasmonics.",3
Squeezed Dirac and Topological Magnons in a Bosonic Honeycomb Optical Lattice.,"Quantum information storage using charge-neutral quasiparticles are expected to play a crucial role in the future of quantum computers. In this regard, magnons or collective spin-wave excitations in solid-state materials are promising candidates in the future of quantum computing. Here, we study the quantum squeezing of Dirac and topological magnons in a bosonic honeycomb optical lattice with spin-orbit interaction by utilizing the mapping to quantum spin-$1/2$ XYZ Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice with discrete Z$_2$ symmetry and a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We show that the squeezed magnons can be controlled by the Z$_2$ anisotropy and demonstrate how the noise in the system is periodically modified in the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases of the model. Our results also apply to solid-state honeycomb (anti)ferromagnetic insulators. &#13.",3
Optical properties of graphene nanocones under electric and magnetic fields.,Here we present a theoretical study of the optical properties of graphene nanocones tuned by external electric and magnetic fields. We investigate the effects of the size and topology of the carbon nanostructures on the density of states and on the electro- and magneto-absorption of linearly polarized electromagnetic radiation in different nanocone geometries. We find that the electric field induces changes in the electric charge distribution mainly at the cone edges. In the infrared range the absorption coefficient shows a peculiar dependence on the electric field (magnitude and direction) and on the photon polarization for all investigated structures. Our results suggest that the electric field may be used to control the electric charge at the apex and for a selective light absorption. The presence of an axial magnetic field induces new features in the nanocone density of states due to the induced localization effects. For high fields the density of states exhibits a sequence of peaks resembling the graphene Landau spectra. The magneto-absorption spectra present a series of resonances strongly sensitive to the photon polarization opening routes for manipulation of the optical responses.,3
Dipole-switch induced modification of the emissive response of carbon nanotubes.,"The interaction of carbon nanotubes with the molecular dipole switch spiropyran is expected to affect the optical response of the tubes. Until now, the need of anchor groups to immobilize the switches on the tubes has hindered experimental observation of effects of switching on the emission behavior of the tubes. Here we present spiropyran-carbon nanotubes complexes obtained by micelle swelling. This method does not require any anchor nor sophisticated chemistry to warrant close tube-switch proximity. For the first time we observe the shifts predicted theoretically and their effect on the tubes' excitation and emission energies.",3
Diverse carrier mobility of monolayer BNC<sub>x</sub>: A combined density functional theory and Boltzmann transport theory study.,"BNCX monolayer as a kind of two-dimensional material has numerous chemical atomic ratios and arrangements with different electronic structures. Via calculations on the basis of density functional theory and Boltzmann transport theory under deformation potential approximation, the band structures and carrier mobilities of BNCX (x=1,2,3,4) nanosheets are systematically investigated. The calculated results show that BNC2-1 is a material with very small band gap (0.02 eV) among all the structures while other BNCX monolayers are semiconductors with band gap ranging from 0.51 to 1.32 eV. The carrier mobility of BNCX varies considerably from tens to millions of cm2 V-1 s-1. For BNC2-1, the hole mobility and electron mobility along both x and y directions can reach 105 orders of magnitude, which is similar to the carrier mobility of graphene. Besides, all studied BNCX monolayers obviously have anisotropic hole mobility and electron mobility. In particular, for semiconductor BNC4, its hole mobility along y direction and electron mobility along x direction unexpectedly reach 106 orders of magnitude, even higher than that of graphene. Our findings suggest that BNCX layered materials with proper ratio and arrangement of carbon atoms will possess desirable charge transport properties, exhibiting potential applications in nanoelectronic devices.",3
Cavity QED with hybrid nanocircuits: from atomic-like physics to condensed matter phenomena.,"Circuit QED techniques have been instrumental in manipulating and probing with exquisite sensitivity the quantum state of superconducting quantum bits coupled to microwave cavities. Recently, it has become possible to fabricate new devices in which the superconducting quantum bits are replaced by hybrid mesoscopic circuits combining nanoconductors and metallic reservoirs. This mesoscopic QED provides a new experimental playground to study the light-matter interaction in electronic circuits. Here, we present the experimental state of the art of mesoscopic QED and its theoretical description. A first class of experiments focuses on the artificial atom limit, where some quasiparticles are trapped in nanocircuit bound states. In this limit, the circuit QED techniques can be used to manipulate and probe electronic degrees of freedom such as confined charges, spins, or Andreev pairs. A second class of experiments uses cavity photons to reveal the dynamics of electron tunneling between a nanoconductor and fermionic reservoirs. For instance, the Kondo effect, the charge relaxation caused by grounded metallic contacts, and the photo-emission caused by voltage-biased reservoirs have been studied. The tunnel coupling between nanoconductors and fermionic reservoirs also enable one to obtain split Cooper pairs, or Majorana bound states. Cavity photons represent a qualitatively new tool to study these exotic condensed matter states.",3
Numerical simulation of vortex dynamics in type-II superconductors in oscillating magnetic field using time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations.,"Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations were solved by the finite difference scheme for a superconducting sample in steady and oscillating magnetic fields for 3D geometry. The dynamic behaviour of penetrating and leaving magnetic vortices in superconductor with the oscillating magnetic field was simulated. Carrier concentration density and the average magnetization of the sample were studied as a function of the external oscillating magnetic field. Anomalies in carrier concentrations at certain magnetic field values were observed and discussed. It was also observed that the area swept by magnetization versus external magnetic field is magnetic oscillation frequency dependent, which increases with increasing frequencies. It was suggested that this effect may cause instability in the superconducting characteristics of the sample over a number of cycles. Calculated energy patterns showed consistency with vortex patterns in the steady magnetic field. Magnetic oscillations initiated oscillations in energy components, ripples in superconducting energy are subjected to the entrance and leaving of vortices, while instability observed in interaction energy is referred to vortex relaxation time.",3
Study on the regulation of focal adesions and cortical actin by matrix nanotopography in 3D environment.,"Matrix nanotopography plays an important role in regulating cell behaviors by providing spatial as well as mechanical cues for cells to sense. It has been proposed that nanoscale topography is possible to modulate the tensions which direct the formation of cytoskeleton and the organization of the membrane receptor within the cell, which in turn regulate intracellular mechanical and biochemical signaling. With current studies on this topic being performed mainly in 2D platforms, the question on how nanotopography can influence cell bahaviors in 3D environments has yet to be addressed. In this paper, we explored this question by placing cells in 3D hollow spherical polydimethylsiloxane scaffolds. After culturing rat embryonic fibroblast cells in two kinds of scaffold, one with smooth surface and the other with numerous nano-spikes, we observed that cells in the smooth scaffold have more anchoring sites and more focal adhesions than in the etched scaffold. Moreover, we found the presence of correlation between cortical actin, the important component for supporting cell attachment, and local cell geometry.",3
Monovacancy paramagnetism in neutron-irradiated graphite probed by <sup>13</sup>C NMR.,"We report on the magnetic properties of monovacancy defects in neutron-irradiated graphite, probed by $^{13}$C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The bulk paramagnetism of the defect moments is revealed by the temperature dependence of the NMR frequency shift and spectral linewidth, both of which follow a Curie behavior, in agreement with measurements of the macroscopic magnetization. Compared to pristine graphite, the fluctuating hyperfine fields generated by the defect moments lead to an enhancement of the $^{13}$C nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_{1}$ by about two orders of magnitude. With an applied magnetic field of 7.1 T, the temperature dependence of $1/T_{1}$ below about 10 K can well be described by a thermally activated form, $1/T_{1}\propto\exp(-\Delta/k_{B}T)$, yielding a singular Zeeman energy of ($0.41\pm0.01$) meV, in excellent agreement with the sole presence of polarized, non-interacting defect moments.",3
Revisiting local structural changes in GeO<sub>2</sub> glass at high pressure.,"Despite the great importance in fundamental and industrial fields, understanding structural changes for pressure-induced polyamorphism in network-forming glasses remains a formidable challenge. Here, we revisited the local structural transformations in GeO2 glass up to 54 GPa using x-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy via a combination diamond anvil cell and polycapillary half-lens. Three polyamorphic transitions can be clearly identified by XAFS structure refinement. First, a progressive increase of the nearest Ge-O distance and bond disorder to a maximum at ~5-16 GPa, in the same pressure region of previously observed tetrahedral-octahedral transformation. Second, a markedly decrease of the nearest Ge-O distance at ~16-22.6 GPa but a slight increase at ~22.6-32.7 GPa, with a concomitant decrease of bond disorder. This stage can be related to a second-order-like transition from less dense to dense octahedral glass. Third, another decrease in the nearest Ge-O distance at ~32.7-41.4 GPa but a slight increase up to 54 GPa, synchronized with a gradual increase of bond disorder. This stage provides strong evidence for ultrahigh-pressure polyamorphism with coordination number &gt;6. Furthermore, cooperative modification is observed in more distant shells. Those results provide a unified local structural picture for elucidating the polyamorphic transitions and densification process in GeO2 glass.",3
One-dimensional quantum matter: gold-induced nanowires on semiconductor surfaces.,"Interacting electrons confined to only one spatial dimension display a wide range of unusual many-body quantum phenomena, ranging from Peierls instabilities to the breakdown of the canonical Fermi liquid paradigm to even unusual spin phenomena. The underlying physics is not only of tremendous fundamental interest, but may also have bearing on device functionality in future micro- and nanoelectronics with lateral extensions reaching the atomic limit. Metallic adatoms deposited on semiconductor surfaces may form self-assembled atomic nanowires, thus representing highly interesting and well-controlled solid-state realizations of such 1D quantum systems. Here we review experimental and theoretical investigations on a few selected prototypical nanowire surface systems, specifically Ge(0 0 1)-Au and Si(hhk)-Au, and the search for 1D quantum states in them. We summarize the current state of research and identify open questions and issues.",3
Models and materials for generalized Kitaev magnetism.,"The exactly solvable Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice has recently received enormous attention linked to the hope of achieving novel spin-liquid states with fractionalized Majorana-like excitations. In this review, we analyze the mechanism proposed by Jackeli and Khaliullin to identify Kitaev materials based on spin-orbital dependent bond interactions and provide a comprehensive overview of its implications in real materials. We set the focus on experimental results and current theoretical understanding of planar honeycomb systems (Na2IrO3, alpha-Li2IrO3, and alpha-RuCl3), three-dimensional Kitaev materials (beta- and gamma-Li2IrO3), and other potential candidates, completing the review with the list of open questions awaiting new insights.",3
Effect of hydrostatic pressure on the superconducting properties of quasi-one-dimensional superconductor K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>3</sub>As<sub>3</sub>.,"K2Cr3As3 is a newly discovered quasi-one-dimensional superconductor with a Tc = 6.1 K and an upper critical field mu0Hc2(0) ~ 40 T three times larger than the Pauli paramagnetic limit mu0Hp that is suggestive of a spin-triplet Cooper pairing. In this paper, we have investigated the effects of hydrostatic pressure on its Tc and mu0Hc2 by measuring the ac magnetic susceptibility chi(T) under magnetic fields at various hydrostatic pressures up to 7.5 GPa. The major findings include: (1) Tc is suppressed gradually to below 2 K at 7.5 GPa; (2) the estimated mu0Hc2(0) decreases dramatically to below mu0Hp above ~2 GPa and becomes slight lower than the orbital limiting field mu0Hc2orb(0) estimated from the initial slope of upper critical field via mu0Hc2orb(0) = -0.73TcdHc2/dTc|Tc in the clean limit; (3) the estimated Maki parameter alpha = radical2Hc2orb(0)/Hp drops from 4 at ambient pressure to well below 1 at P &gt;2 GPa, suggesting the crossover from Pauli paramagnetic limiting to orbital limiting in the pair breaking process upon increasing pressure. These observations suggested that the application of hydrostatic pressure could drive K2Cr3As3 away from the ferromagnetic instability and lead to a breakdown of the spin-triplet pairing channel. We have also made a side-by-side comparison and discussed the distinct effects of chemical and physical pressures on the superconducting properties of K2Cr3As3.",3
First-principles study of Enhanced Magnetic Anisotropies in Transition-Metal Atoms Doped WS<sub>2</sub> Monolayer.,"Considerable progress in contemporary spintronics has been made in recent years for developing nanoscale data memory and quantum information processing. It is, however, still a great challenge to achieve the ultimate limit of storage bit. Two-dimensional materials, fortunately, provide an alternative solution to design materials with the expected miniaturizing scale, the chemical stability as well as the giant magnetic anisotropy energy. By performing first-principles calculations, we have examined two possible doping sites on WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; monolayer using three kind of transition metal (TM) atoms (Mn, Fe and Co). It is found that the TM atoms prefer to stay on the W atom site. Additionally, different from the case of Mn, doping Co and Fe atoms on the W vacancy can achieve perpendicular magnetic anisotropy with much larger magnitude, which provides a bright prospect for generating the atomic-scale magnets of storage devices.",3
Chiral quantum spin liquid on the repulsive Haldane-Hubbard model in square lattices.,"In this paper, we present a study on the repulsive Haldane-Hubbard model with spin-rotation symmetry in square lattices by deriving non-linear sigma model for magnetic states. It is found that a chiral spin liquid state as the ground state of the correlated system exists in the [Formula: see text] topological spin-density wave proposed by Wu et al (2016 J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 28 115602), of which the low energy physics can be determined by the Chern-Simons-Hopf gauge field theory.",3
Anomalous thermal conductance of graphyne under lower temperature.,"The thermal transport properties of graphyne are investigated via equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD) simulations and non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method. It is found that the room-temperature thermal conductivity of graphyne is 93% lower than that of graphene with a similar size and decreases steeply with increasing the number of acetylenic linkages, which agrees with the results obtained by NEGF method qualitatively. Lattice dynamics calculations reveal that these phenomena can be attributed to the reduction of both phonon group velocities and phonon lifetimes in graphyne at low-frequency region. However, when the temperature is less than 30 K, the thermal conductance of graphyne exceeds that of graphene. Moreover, the anomalous thermal conductance behavior is not sensitive to the system lateral size. The underlying mechanisms for such phenomena are elaborated by the normal mode analysis.",3
Structure of electric double layers in capacitive systems and to what extent (classical) density functional theory describes it.,"Ongoing scientific interest is aimed at the properties and structure of electric double layers (EDLs), which are crucial for capacitive energy storage, water treatment, and energy harvesting technologies like supercapacitors, desalination devices, blue engines, and thermocapacitive heat-to-current converters. A promising tool to describe their physics on a microscopic level is (classical) density functional theory (DFT), which can be applied in order to analyze pair correlations and charge ordering in the primitive model of charged hard spheres. This simple model captures the main properties of ionic liquids and solutions and it predicts many of the phenomena that occur in EDLs. The latter often lead to anomalous response in the differential capacitance of EDLs. This work constructively reviews the powerful theoretical framework of DFT and its recent developments regarding the description of EDLs. It explains to what extent current approaches in DFT describe structural ordering and in-plane transitions in EDLs, which occur when the corresponding electrodes are charged. Further, the review briefly summarizes the history of modeling EDLs, presents applications, and points out limitations and strengths in present theoretical approaches. It concludes that DFT as a sophisticated microscopic theory for ionic systems is expecting a challenging but promising future in both fundamental research and applications in supercapacitive technologies.",3
Strong second harmonic generation in two-dimensional ferroelectric IV-monochalcogenides.,"The two-dimensional ferroelectrics GeS, GeSe, SnS and SnSe are expected to have large spontaneous in-plane electric polarization and enhanced shift-current response. Using density functional methods, we show that these materials also exhibit the largest effective second harmonic generation reported so far. It can reach magnitudes up to [Formula: see text] which is about an order of magnitude larger than that of prototypical GaAs. To rationalize this result we model the optical response with a simple one-dimensional two-band model along the spontaneous polarization direction. Within this model the second-harmonic generation tensor is proportional to the shift-current response tensor. The large shift current and second harmonic responses of GeS, GeSe, SnS and SnSe make them promising non-linear materials for optoelectronic applications.",3
Charge transport by inverse micelles in non-polar media.,"Charged inverse micelles play an important role in the electrical charging and the electrodynamics of nonpolar colloidal dispersions relevant for applications such as electronic ink displays and liquid toner printing. This review examines the properties and the behavior of charged inverse micelles in microscale devices in the absence of colloidal particles. It is discussed how charge in nonpolar liquids is stabilized in inverse micelles and how conductivity depends on the inverse micelle size, water content and ionic impurities. Frequently used nonpolar surfactant systems are investigated with emphasis on aerosol-OT (AOT) and poly-isobutylene succinimide (PIBS) in dodecane. Charge generation in the bulk by disproportionation is studied from measurements of conductivity as a function of surfactant concentration and from generation currents in quasi steady-state. When a potential difference is applied, the steady-state situation can show electric field screening or complete charge separation. Different regimes of charge transport are identified when a voltage step is applied. It is shown how the transient and steady-state currents depend on the rate of bulk generation, on insulating layers and on the sticking or non-sticking behavior of charged inverse micelles at interfaces. For the cases of AOT and PIBS in dodecane, the magnitude of the generation rate and the type of interaction at the interface are very different.",3

Photonics surface waves on metamaterials interfaces.,"A surface wave (SW) in optics is a light wave, which is supported at an interface of two dissimilar media and propagates along the interface with its field amplitude exponentially decaying away from the boundary. The research on surface waves has been flourishing in last few decades thanks to their unique properties of surface sensitivity and field localization. These features have resulted in applications in nano-guiding, sensing, light-trapping and imaging based on the near-field techniques, contributing to the establishment of the nanophotonics as a field of research. Up to present, a wide variety of surface waves has been investigated in numerous material and structure settings. This paper reviews the recent progress and development in the physics of SWs localized at metamaterial interfaces, as well as bulk media in order to provide broader perspectives on optical surface waves in general. For each type of the surface waves, we discuss material and structural platforms. We mainly focus on experimental realizations in the visible and near-infrared wavelength ranges. We also address existing and potential application of SWs in chemical and biological sensing, and experimental excitation and characterization methods.",3
Anomalous cyclotron mass dependence on the magnetic field and Berry's phase in (Cd1-x-y Zn x Mn y )3As2 solid solutions.,"Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) effect and magnetoresistance measurements of single crystals of diluted II-V magnetic semiconductors (Cd1-x-y Zn x Mn y )3As2 (x + y = 0.4, y = 0.04 and 0.08) are investigated in the temperature range T = 4.2 / 300 K and in transverse magnetic field B = 0 / 25 T. The values of the cyclotron mass m c, the effective g-factor g*, and the Dingle temperature T D are defined. In one of the samples (y = 0.04) a strong dependence of the cyclotron mass on the magnetic field m c(B) = m c(0) + alphaB is observed. The value of a phase shift close to beta = 0.5 indicates the presence of Berry phase and 3D Dirac fermions in a single crystals of (Cd1-x-y Zn x Mn y )3As2 in one of the samples (y = 0.08).",3
Halogenation of SiC for band-gap engineering and excitonic functionalization.,"The optical excitation spectra and excitonic resonances are investigated in systematically functionalized SiC with Fluorine and/or Chlorine utilizing density functional theory in combination with many-body perturbation theory. The latter is required for a realistic description of the energy band-gaps as well as for the theoretical realization of excitons. Structural, electronic and optical properties are scrutinized and show the high stability of the predicted two-dimensional materials. Their realization in laboratory is thus possible. Large band-gaps of the order of 4 eV are found in the so-called GW approximation, with the occurrence of bright excitons, optically active in the four investigated materials. Their binding energies vary from 0.9 eV to 1.75 eV depending on the decoration choice and in one case, a dark exciton is foreseen to exist in the fully chlorinated SiC. The wide variety of opto-electronic properties suggest halogenated SiC as interesting materials with potential not only for solar cell applications, anti-reflection coatings or high-reflective systems but also for a possible realization of excitonic Bose-Einstein condensation.",3
Relaxation dynamics and polydispersivity associated with defects and ferroelectric correlations in Ba doped EuTiO3.,"We presented detailed frequency and temperature dependent dielectric response in Eu1-xBaxTiO3 (0 &lt; x &lt; 0.5). Excluding grain boundary effects, four relaxation mechanisms have been observed. Relaxation dynamics were observed to arise due to hopping conduction associated with defects namely, oxygen vacancies, Eu3+ and Ti3+ ions. Dielectric relaxation analysis led to identification of Ti ions in two different environments with different relaxation rates in the overall EuTiO3 perovskite structure. Emergence of another relaxation mechanism associated with ferroelectric order as a consequence of formation of polar regions have also been observed for higher Ba concentrations. Addition of Ba led to the identification of relaxation dynamics associated with hopping conduction between Eu ions, Ti ions (in the regions with and without oxygen vacancies) and with the formation of ferroelectric polar regions. Furthermore, polydispersivity and relaxation times have been extracted within the frame work of modified Debye model. Relaxation times have been observed to increase with decrease in temperature while larger values of polydispersivity revealed wide distribution of relaxation times due to the presence of lattice parameter and energy barrier distributions.",3
The offset droplet: a new methodology for studying the solid/water interface using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.,"The routine study of the solid-water interface by XPS is potentially revolutionary as this development opens up whole new areas of study for photoelectron spectroscopy. To date this has been realised by only a few groups worldwide and current techniques have significant restrictions on the type of samples which can be studied. Here we present a novel and uniquely flexible approach to the problem. By introducing a thin capillary into the NAP-XPS, a small droplet can be injected onto the sample surface, offset from the analysis area by several mm. By careful control of the droplet size a water layer of controllable thickness can be established in the analysis area-continuous with the bulk droplet. We present results from the solid-water interface on a vacuum prepared TiO2(110) single crystal and demonstrate that the solid/liquid interface is addressable.",3
"Electronic structure of ferromagnetic heavy fermion, YbPdSi, YbPdGe, and YbPtGe studied by photoelectron spectroscopy, x-ray emission spectroscopy, and DFT + DMFT calculations.","Electronic structures of ferromagnetic heavy fermion Yb compounds of YbPdSi, YbPdGe, and YbPtGe are studied by photoelectron spectroscopy around the Yb 4d-4f resonance, resonant x-ray emission spectroscopy at the Yb L 3 absorption edge, and density functional theory combined with dynamical mean field theory calculations. These compounds all have a temperature-independent intermediate Yb valence with large [Formula: see text] and small [Formula: see text] components. The magnitude of the Yb valence is evaluated to be YbPtGe [Formula: see text] YbPdGe [Formula: see text] YbPdSi, suggesting that YbPtGe is the closest to the quantum critical point among the three Yb compounds. Our results support the scenario of the coexistence of heavy fermion behavior and ferromagnetic ordering which is described by a magnetically-ordered Kondo lattice where the magnitude of the Kondo effect and the RKKY interaction are comparable.",3
Hybrid-DFT + V w method for band structure calculation of semiconducting transition metal compounds: the case of cerium dioxide.,"Hybrid functionals' non-local exchange-correlation potential contains a derivative discontinuity that improves on standard semi-local density functional theory (DFT) band gaps. Moreover, by careful parameterization, hybrid functionals can provide self-interaction reduced description of selected states. On the other hand, the uniform description of all the electronic states of a given system is a known drawback of these functionals that causes varying accuracy in the description of states with different degrees of localization. This limitation can be remedied by the orbital dependent exact exchange extension of hybrid functionals; the hybrid-DFT + V w method (Ivady et al 2014 Phys. Rev. B 90 035146). Based on the analogy of quasi-particle equations and hybrid-DFT single particle equations, here we demonstrate that parameters of hybrid-DFT + V w functional can be determined from approximate theoretical quasi-particle spectra without any fitting to experiment. The proposed method is illustrated on the charge self-consistent electronic structure calculation for cerium dioxide where itinerant valence states interact with well-localized 4f atomic like states, making this system challenging for conventional methods, either hybrid-DFT or LDA + U, and therefore allowing for a demonstration of the advantages of the proposed scheme.",3
Detection of suspended nanoparticles with near-ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.,"Two systems of suspended nanoparticles have been studied with near-ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy: silver nanoparticles in water and strontium fluoride-calcium fluoride core-shell nanoparticles in ethylene glycol. The corresponding dry samples were measured under ultra high vacuum for comparison. The results obtained under near-ambient pressure were overall comparable to those obtained under ultra high vacuum, although measuring silver nanoparticles in water requires a high pass energy and a long acquisition time. A shift towards higher binding energies was found for the silver nanoparticles in aqueous suspension compared to the corresponding dry sample, which can be assigned to a change of surface potential at the water-nanoparticle interface. The shell-thickness of the core-shell nanoparticles was estimated based on simulated spectra from the National Institute of Standards and Technology database for simulation of electron spectra for surface analysis. With the instrumental set-up presented in this paper, nanoparticle suspensions in a suitable container can be directly inserted into the analysis chamber and measured without prior sample preparation.",3
Evidence for thermal activation in the glassy dynamics of insulating granular aluminum conductance.,"Insulating granular aluminum is one of the proto-typical disordered insulators whose low temperature electrical conductance exhibits ubiquitous non-equilibrium phenomena. These include slow responses to temperature or gate voltage changes, characteristic field effect anomalies and ageing phenomena typical of a glass. In this system the influence of temperature on the glassy dynamics has remained elusive. A similar situation was met in insulating indium oxide and it was concluded that in high carrier density Anderson insulators, electronic slow relaxations essentially proceed via activationless processes. In this work we experimentally demonstrate that thermal effects do play a role and that the slow dynamics in granular aluminum is subject to thermal activation. We show how its signatures can be revealed and activation energy distributions can be extracted, providing a promising grasp on the nature of the microscopic mechanism at work in glassy Anderson insulators. We explain why some of the experimental protocols previously used in the literature fail to reveal thermal activation in these systems. Our results and analyses call for a reassessment of the emblematic case of indium oxide, and question the existence of purely activationless dynamics in any of the systems studied so far.",3
Confinement sensitivity in quantum dot singlet-triplet relaxation.,"Spin-orbit mediated phonon relaxation in a two-dimensional quantum dot is investigated using different confining potentials. Elliptical harmonic oscillator and cylindrical well results are compared to each other in the case of a two-electron GaAs quantum dot subjected to a tilted magnetic field. The lowest energy set of two-body singlet and triplet states are calculated including spin-orbit and magnetic effects. These are used to calculate the phonon induced transition rate from the excited triplet to the ground state singlet for magnetic fields up to where the states cross. The roll of the cubic Dresselhaus effect, which is found to be much more important than previously assumed, and the positioning of 'spin hot-spots' are discussed and relaxation rates for a few different systems are exhibited.",3
Spectroscopic evidence of a new energy scale for superconductivity in H3S.,"The discovery of a superconducting phase in sulfur hydride under high pressure with a critical temperature above 200 K has provided fresh impetus to the search for superconductors at ever higher temperatures. Although this systems displays all the hallmarks of superconductivity, the mechanism through which it arises remains to be determined. Here we provide a first optical spectroscopy study of this superconductor. Experimental results for the optical reflectivity of H3S, under hydrostatic pressure of 150 GPa, for several temperatures and over the range 60 to 600 meV of photon energies, are compared with theoretical calculations based on Eliashberg theory. Two significant features stand out: some remarkably strong infrared active phonons at around 160 meV, and a band with a depressed reflectance in the superconducting state in the region from 450 meV to 600 meV. In this energy range H3S becomes more reflecting with increasing temperature, a change that is traced to superconductivity originating from the electron-phonon interaction. The shape, magnitude, and energy dependence of this band at 150 K agrees with our calculations. This provides strong evidence of a conventional mechanism. However, the unusually strong optical phonon suggests a contribution of electronic degrees of freedom.",3
Nonlinear coherent structures in granular crystals.,"The study of granular crystals, which are nonlinear metamaterials that consist of closely packed arrays of particles that interact elastically, is a vibrant area of research that combines ideas from disciplines such as materials science, nonlinear dynamics, and condensed-matter physics. Granular crystals exploit geometrical nonlinearities in their constitutive microstructure to produce properties (such as tunability and energy localization) that are not conventional to engineering materials and linear devices. In this topical review, we focus on recent experimental, computational, and theoretical results on nonlinear coherent structures in granular crystals. Such structures-which include traveling solitary waves, dispersive shock waves, and discrete breathers-have fascinating dynamics, including a diversity of both transient features and robust, long-lived patterns that emerge from broad classes of initial data. In our review, we primarily discuss phenomena in one-dimensional crystals, as most research to date has focused on such scenarios, but we also present some extensions to two-dimensional settings. Throughout the review, we highlight open problems and discuss a variety of potential engineering applications that arise from the rich dynamic response of granular crystals.",3
Nonadiabatic exchange-correlation kernel for strongly correlated materials.,"We formulate a rigorous method for calculating a nonadiabatic (frequency-dependent) exchange-correlation (XC) kernel appropriate for accurate description of both equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of strongly correlated systems within the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) via the charge susceptibility, which is in turn obtained from dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) based on the effective multi-orbital Hubbard model. Application to the simple case of the one-orbital Hubbard model already shows the importance of the nonadiabatic kernel as it leads to significant modification of the excitation spectrum-shifting the (adiabatic) peak and disclosing another that is reminiscent of the solution from DMFT. The impact of dynamical effects, naturally included through the nonadiabaticity of the XC kernel, becomes even more transparent in our consideration of the nonequilibrium charge-density response of a multi-orbital perovskite, YTiO3, to a perturbation by a femtosecond (fs) laser pulse. These initial results indicate that electron-electron correlations and nonadiabatic features may significantly affect the spectrum and nonequilibrium properties of strongly correlated systems. We also propose an algorithm for extension of the approach to non-linear response. The transparency and computational efficiency of this non-adiabatic TDDFT+DMFT approach opens the door to examination of the spectra and response of multi-orbital systems with many nonequivalent atoms-bulk material, films and nanostructures.",3
Observation of pseudogap in MgB<sub>2</sub>.,"We investigate the electronic structure of a specially prepared highly dense conventional high temperature superconductor, MgB2 employing high resolution photoemission spectroscopy. The spectral evolution close to the Fermi energy is commensurate to BCS descriptions as expected. However, the spectra in the wider energy range reveal emergence of a pseudogap much above the superconducting transition temperature indicating apparent departure from the BCS scenario. The energy scale of the pseudogap is comparable to the energy of E2g phonon mode responsible for superconductivity in MgB2 and the pseudogap can be attributed to the effect of electron-phonon coupling on the electronic structure. These results reveal a scenario of the emergence of the superconducting gap within an electron-phonon coupling induced pseudogap and have significant implication in the study of high temperature superconductors.",3
Simulation study on exchange interaction and unique magnetization near ferromagnetic morphotropic phase boundary.,"Extensive efforts have been made in searching enhanced functionalities near the so-called morphotropic phase boundaries (MPBs) in both ferroelectric and ferromagnetic materials. Due to the exchange anti-symmetry of the wave function of fermions, it is widely recognized that the exchange interaction plays a critical role in ferromagnetism. As a quantum effect, the exchange interaction is magnitudes larger than electric interaction, leading to a fundamental difference between ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism. In this paper, we establish an energetic model capturing the interplay among the anisotropy energy, magnetostatic energy and the exchange energy to investigate systematically the effects of the exchange energy on the behavior of the ferromagnetic MPB. For the first time, it is found that the exchange energy can narrow the width of MPB region in the composition temperature phase diagram for ferromagnetic MPB systems. As temperature increases, MPB region becomes wider because of the weakening of the exchange interaction. Our simulation results suggest that the exchange energy play a critical role on the unique behavior of ferromagnetic MPB, which is in contrast different from that of ferroelectric MPB.",3
New understanding of nano-scale interstitial dislocation loops in BCC iron.,"Complex states of nanoscale interstitial dislocation loop can be described by its habit plane and Burgers vector. Using atomistic simulations, we provide direct evidences on the change of the habit plane of a 1/2<1 1 1> loop from {1 1 1} to {1 1 0} and {2 1 1}, in agreement with TEM observations. A new {1 0 0} habit plane of this loop is also predicted by simulations. The non-conservation of the Burgers vector is approved theoretically for: (1) dislocation reactions between loops with different Burgers vectors and (2) the transition between <1 0 0> loops and 1/2<1 1 1> loops. The rotation from a 1/2<1 1 1> to a <1 0 0> loop has also been explored, which occurs at 570 K for time on the order of 10 s. The dislocation-precipitate phase duality and change of habit plane are then proposed as new features for nano-scale dislocation loops.",3
The magnetic properties and structure of the quasi-two-dimensional antiferromagnet CoPS3.,"The magnetic properties and magnetic structure are presented for CoPS3, a quasi-two-dimensional antiferromagnet on a honeycomb lattice with a Neel temperature of [Formula: see text] K. The compound is shown to have XY-like anisotropy in its susceptibility, and the anisotropy is analysed to extract crystal field parameters. For temperatures between 2 K and 300 K, no phase transitions were observed in the field-dependent magnetization up to 10 Tesla. Single-crystal neutron diffraction shows that the magnetic propagation vector is k = [Formula: see text] with the moments mostly along the [Formula: see text] axis and with a small component along the [Formula: see text] axis, which largely verifies the previously-published magnetic structure for this compound. The magnetic Bragg peak intensity decreases with increasing temperature as a power law with exponent [Formula: see text] for [Formula: see text].",3
Ambient pressure phase transitions over Ir(1 1 1): at the onset of CO oxidation.,"In this study we report on the adsorbate structures on an Ir(1 1 1) surface during the phase transition from the inactive to the active state during CO oxidation. The CO oxidation over Pt(1 1 1) is used as a reference case. Where Pt(1 1 1) either is inactive and CO covered or active and O covered, Ir(1 1 1) exhibits a transition state with co-existing chemisorbed O and CO. The observed structural differences are explained in terms of DFT-calculated adsorption energies. For Pt(1 1 1) the repulsive CO-O interaction makes co-existing chemisorbed CO and O unfavourable, while for Ir(1 1 1) the stronger O and CO adsorption allows for overcoming the repulsive interaction. At the onset of CO oxidation over Ir(1 1 1), a CO structure containing defects forms, which enables O2 to dissociatively adsorb on the Ir(1 1 1) surface, thus enabling the CO oxidation reaction. At the mass transfer limit, the Ir(1 1 1) surface is covered by a chemisorbed O structure with defects; hence, the active surface is predominately chemisorbed O covered at a total pressure of 0.5 mbar and no oxide formation is observed.",3
Human-brain ferritin studied by muon spin rotation: a pilot study.,"Muon spin rotation is employed to investigate the spin dynamics of ferritin proteins isolated from the brain of an Alzheimer's disease (AD) patient and of a healthy control, using a sample of horse-spleen ferritin as a reference. A model based on the Neel theory of superparamagnetism is developed in order to interpret the spin relaxation rate of the muons stopped by the core of the protein. Using this model, our preliminary observations show that ferritins from the healthy control are filled with a mineral compatible with ferrihydrite, while ferritins from the AD patient contain a crystalline phase with a larger magnetocrystalline anisotropy, possibly compatible with magnetite or maghemite.",3
Quantum plasmon model for the terahertz photoconductivity in intrinsic semiconductor nanowires.,"A quantum plasmon model for the terahertz photoconductivity in intrinsic semiconductor nanowires is developed. The classical plasmon model assumes the excited electron in semiconductors feels a restoring force generated by a harmonic-oscillator potential. Although it is successfully applied to explain the terahertz photoconductivity in semiconductor nanowires, the classical treatment of the potential weakens accurate theoretical analysis. Here I treat the potential in a full quantum way and present an exact analytical formula for photoconductivity. The formula not only gives more reasonable photoconductivity, but also has the same conciseness when compared with that of the classical plasmon model. The validity of the quantum plasmon model is proved independently by numerical calculations in real space.",3
Spin-wave excitations in the spin-density wave state of doped iron pnictides.,"We investigate spin-wave excitations in the spin-density wave state of doped iron pnictides within a five-orbital model. We find that the excitations along ([Formula: see text]) --> ([Formula: see text]) are very sensitive to dopings whereas they do not exhibit a similar sensitivity along ([Formula: see text]) --> ([Formula: see text]). Secondly, the ellipticity of the elliptical ring-like excitations around ([Formula: see text]) is also very much dependent on doping. Thirdly, the spin-wave spectral weight shifts towards the low-energy region as it moves away from zero doping. We find several features to be in qualitative agreement with the inelastic neutron-scattering measurements for the doped pnictides.",3
Thermoelectric performance and the role of anti-site disorder in the 24-electron Heusler TiFe2Sn.,"Heusler compounds XY 2 Z with 24 valence electrons per formula unit are potential thermoelectric materials, given their thermal and chemical stability and their relatively earth-abundant constituent elements. We present results on the 24-electron compound TiFe2Sn here. First principles calculations on this compound suggest semiconducting behavior. A relatively flat conduction band that could be associated with a high Seebeck coefficient upon electron doping is found. A series of compounds have been prepared and characterized using a combination of synchrotron x-ray and neutron diffraction studies to understand the effects of site order/disorder phenomena and n-type doping. Samples fabricated by a three step processing approach were subjected to high temperature Seebeck and electrical resistivity measurements. Ti:Fe anti-site disorder is present in the stoichiometric compound and these defects are reduced when starting Ti-rich compositions are employed. Additionally, we investigate control of the Seebeck coefficient through the introduction of carriers through the substitution of Sb on the Sn site in these intrinsically p-type materials.",3
Novel boron channel-based structure of boron carbide at high pressures.,"Boron carbide (B4C) is one of the hardest materials known to date. The extreme hardness of B4C arises from architecturally efficient B12 or B11C icosahedrons and strong inter-icosahedral B-C bonding. As an excellent material for use in ballistic armor, the mechanic limit of B4C and possible phase transitions under extreme stress conditions are of great interest. Here we systematically explored the post-icosahedral solid structures of B4C under high pressure, using an unbiased structure search method. A new structure composed of extended framework of B and zigzag chains of C is predicted to be stable above 96 GPa. The new structure was predicted to have a high Vickers hardness of 55 GPa and simultaneously to retain a metallic ground state. The exceptional mechanical properties found in this structure are attributed to strong sp (3) covalent network formed under extreme pressure conditions. The predicted structure represents a new type of superhard boron carbides that form under high pressure without the presence of boron icosahedrons, which encourages experimental exploration in this direction.",3
Large scale calculations of thermoelectric transport coefficients: a case study of gamma-graphyne with point defects.,"Defects such as vacancies and impurities could have profound effects on the transport properties of thermoelectric materials. However, it is usually quite difficult to directly calculate the thermoelectric properties of defect-containing systems via first-principles method since very large supercell is required. In this work, based on the linear response theory and the kernel polynomial method, we present an efficient approach that can help to calculate the thermoelectric transport coefficients of a large system containing millions of atoms at arbitrary chemical potential and temperature. As a prototype example, we consider dilute vacancies and hydrogen impurities in a large scale gamma-graphyne sheet and discuss their effects on the thermoelectric transport properties.",3
Critical and compensation behavior of a mixed spin-5/2 and spin-3/2 Ising antiferromagnetic system in a core/shell nanowire.,"In this work, Monte Carlo simulations based on metropolis algorithm were performed to study the critical and compensation temperatures of a core-shell nanowire with spins [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], respectively, considering an Ising antiferromagnetic system. The influence of nearest neighbors exchange interactions and crystal field anisotropy on the critical and compensation behaviors of the system has been analyzed. The effects of the nanowire height in the critical and compensation temperatures were evaluated. The results show that, for a system with given values of exchange interaction constants and crystal field anisotropy, a compensation point only appears if two requirements are satisfied. First, the weight of the core magnetization in the total magnetization must be greater than the weight of the shell magnetization at zero temperature. And second, the exchange constant of shell ions must be greater than a certain value. This value is, at the same time, greater than the exchange constant of core ions. The critical and compensation temperatures are very sensitive to variations in the exchange constant of the shell ions and core ions, respectively, while the crystal field anisotropy affects both temperatures.",3
Two-probe STM experiments at the atomic level.,"Direct characterization of planar atomic or molecular scale devices and circuits on a supporting surface by multi-probe measurements requires unprecedented stability of single atom contacts and manipulation of scanning probes over large, nanometer scale area with atomic precision. In this work, we describe the full methodology behind atomically defined two-probe scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments performed on a model system: dangling bond dimer wire supported on a hydrogenated germanium (0 0 1) surface. We show that 70 nm long atomic wire can be simultaneously approached by two independent STM scanners with exact probe to probe distance reaching down to 30 nm. This allows direct wire characterization by two-probe I-V characteristics at distances below 50 nm. Our technical results presented in this work open a new area for multi-probe research, which can be now performed with precision so far accessible only by single-probe scanning probe microscopy (SPM) experiments.",3
Low-temperature thermal transport and thermopower of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors.,"We study the low temperature thermal conductivity of single-layer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). In the low temperature regime where heat is carried primarily through transport of electrons, thermal conductivity is linked to electrical conductivity through the Wiedemann-Franz law (WFL). Using a k.p Hamiltonian that describes the [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] valley edges, we compute the zero-frequency electric (Drude) conductivity using the Kubo formula to obtain a numerical estimate for the thermal conductivity. The impurity scattering determined transit time of electrons which enters the Drude expression is evaluated within the self-consistent Born approximation. The analytic expressions derived show that low temperature thermal conductivity (1) is determined by the band gap at the valley edges in monolayer TMDCs and (2) in presence of disorder which can give rise to the variable range hopping regime, there is a distinct reduction. Additionally, we compute the Mott thermopower and demonstrate that under a high frequency light beam, a valley-resolved thermopower can be obtained. A closing summary reviews the implications of results followed by a brief discussion on applicability of the WFL and its breakdown in context of the presented calculations.",3
Gutzwiller variational approach to the two-impurity Anderson model for a metallic host at particle-hole symmetry.,"We study Gutzwiller-correlated wave functions as variational ground states for the two-impurity Anderson model (TIAM) at particle-hole symmetry as a function of the impurity separation [Formula: see text]. Our variational state is obtained by applying the Gutzwiller many-particle correlator to a single-particle product state. We determine the optimal single-particle product state fully variationally from an effective non-interacting TIAM that contains a direct electron transfer between the impurities as variational degree of freedom. For a large Hubbard interaction U between the electrons on the impurities, the impurity spins experience a Heisenberg coupling proportional to [Formula: see text] where V parameterizes the strength of the on-site hybridization. For small Hubbard interactions we observe weakly coupled impurities. In general, for a three-dimensional simple cubic lattice we find discontinuous quantum phase transitions that separate weakly interacting impurities for small interactions from singlet pairs for large interactions.",3
Epitaxial strain driven crossover from Drude to Drude-Smith terahertz conductivity dynamics in LaNiO3 thin films.,"We investigate the hetero-epitaxial strain driven low-energy charge dynamics in compressive and tensile strained LaNiO3 thin films employing terahertz (THz) time-domain spectroscopy. The complex THz conductivity exhibits a crossover from Drude type metallic behavior for the compressive film to a Drude-Smith type disordered behavior for the tensile film. This demonstration of strain driven crossover in THz conductivity dynamics, while the two films have qualitatively similar dc conductivities, (i) brings out the potential of THz technology in distinguishing between similar dc electronic phases and (ii) suggests that LaNiO3 under compressive strain is a better candidate for applications as electrodes in oxides electronics.",3
Manipulation of native point defect behavior in rutile TiO2 via surfaces and extended defects.,"Semiconductor surfaces offer efficient pathways for exchanging native point defects with the underlying bulk. For rutile TiO2(1 1 0), isotopic self-diffusion studies of oxygen have suggested that the surface may act as a source for Oi while simultaneously acting as a sink for titanium interstitials Tii. Through self-diffusion measurements with labeled Ti as well as O, the present work develops a more complete picture of the diffusion-reaction network involving Oi and Tii, complete with the surface acting as a source for whichever elements are available from the gas phase and a sink for elements that are not. The picture points to the importance of extended defects such as platelets and crystallographic shear planes as reservoirs of Oi and Tii, acting as net sources or sinks of these species depending upon specific conditions. The results exemplify the combined roles of surfaces and extended defects in regulating point defect behavior even in macroscopic metal oxide crystals, and point to specific strategies for manipulating that behavior intentionally.",3
Relaxation dynamics of a driven two-level system coupled to a Bose-Einstein condensate: application to quantum dot-dipolar exciton gas hybrid systems.,"We develop a microscopic theory for the relaxation dynamics of an optically pumped two-level system (TLS) coupled to a bath of weakly interacting Bose gas. Using Keldysh formalism and diagrammatic perturbation theory, expressions for the relaxation times of the TLS Rabi oscillations are derived when the boson bath is in the normal state and the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) state. We apply our general theory to consider an irradiated quantum dot coupled with a boson bath consisting of a two-dimensional dipolar exciton gas. When the bath is in the BEC regime, relaxation of the Rabi oscillations is due to both condensate and non-condensate fractions of the bath bosons for weak TLS-light coupling and pre dominantly due to the non-condensate fraction for strong TLS-light coupling. Our theory also shows that a phase transition of the bath from the normal to the BEC state strongly influences the relaxation rate of the TLS Rabi oscillations. The TLS relaxation rate is approximately independent of the pump field frequency and monotonically dependent on the field strength when the bath is in the low-temperature regime of the normal phase. Phase transition of the dipolar exciton gas leads to a non-monotonic dependence of the TLS relaxation rate on both the pump field frequency and field strength, providing a characteristic signature for the detection of BEC phase transition of the coupled dipolar exciton gas.",3
Sonogashira cross-coupling over Au(1 1 1): from UHV to ambient pressure.,"We have studied the reaction of phenylacetylene (PA) with chloro-, bromo-, and iodobenzene on the Au(1 1 1) surface as a model system for the gold-catalysed Sonogashira cross-coupling. Both ultrahigh vacuum-based and ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy show that iodo- and chlorobenzene (IB and CB) undergo the cross-coupling reaction towards diphenylacetylene. Bromobenzene (BB), in contrast, does not react in the UHV experiments. Further, at ambient pressure signs are found for poisoning of the Au(1 1 1) surface by a carbon species formed in the reaction. The understanding obtained in the reaction experiments are based on a thorough investigation of the adsorption of PA, IB, CB, and BB on the Au(1 1 1) surface by soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy and temperature-dependent x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. In particular, the experiments provide the orientation of the intact adsorbates with respect to the surfaces at liquid nitrogen temperature. Dissociation in the temperature regime between -80 and -15 degrees C is observed for iodo- and chlorobenzene, but not for BB, in agreement with that only IB and CB, but not BB, react with PA to form diphenylacetylene. The difference is tentatively attributed to a difference in surface orientation of the different halobenzenes.",3
Electrical and thermoelectric transport properties of two-dimensional fermionic systems with <i>k</i>-cubic spin-orbit coupling.,"We investigate effect of &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-cubic spin-orbit interaction on electrical and thermoelectric transport properties of two-dimensional fermionic systems. We obtain exact analytical expressions of the inverse relaxation time (IRT) and the Drude conductivity for long-range Coulomb and short-range delta scattering potentials. The IRT reveals that the scattering is completely suppressed along the three directions theta = (2n+1)pi/3 with n=1,2,3. We also obtain analytical results of the thermopower and thermal conductivity at low temperature. The thermoelectric transport coefficients obey the Wiedemann-Franz law, even in the presence of &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-cubic Rashba spin-orbit interaction (RSOI) at low temperature. In the presence of quantizing magnetic field, the signature of the RSOI is revealed through the appearance of the beating pattern in the Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations of thermopower and thermal conductivity in low magnetic field regime. The empirical formulae for the SdH oscillation frequencies accurately describe the locations of the beating nodes. The beating pattern in magnetothermoelectric measurement can be used to extract the spin-orbit coupling constant.",3
Analytic approach to magneto-strain tuning of electronic transport through a graphene nanobubble: perspectives for a strain sensor.,"We consider the scattering of Dirac particles in graphene due to the superposition of an external magnetic field and mechanical strain. As a model for a graphene nanobubble, we find exact analytical solutions for single-particle states inside and outside a circular region submitted to the fields. Finally, we obtain analytical expressions for the scattering cross-section, as well as for the Landauer current through the circular region. Our results provide a fully-analytical treatment for electronic transport through a graphene nanobubble, showing that a combination of a physical magnetic field and strain leads to valley polarization and filtering of the electronic current. Moreover, our analytical model provides an explicit metrology principle to measure strain by performing conductance experiments under a controlled magnetic field imposed over the sample.",3
"Tuning the p-type Schottky barrier in 2D metal/semiconductor interface:boron-sheet on MoSe2, and WSe2.","Van der Waals (vdW) metal/semiconductor heterostructures have been investigated through first-principles calculations. We have considered the recently synthesized borophene (Mannix et al 2015 Science 350 1513), and the planar boron sheets (S1 and S2) (Feng et al 2016 Nat. Chem. 8 563) as the 2D metal layer, and the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) MoSe2, and WSe2 as the semiconductor monolayer. We find that the energetic stability of those 2D metal/semiconductor heterojunctions is mostly ruled by the vdW interactions; however, chemical interactions also take place in borophene/TMDC. The electronic charge transfer at the metal/semiconductor interface has been mapped, where we find a a net charge transfer from the TMDCs to the boron sheets. Further electronic structure calculations reveal that the metal/semiconductor interfaces, composed by planar boron sheets S1 and S2, present a p-type Schottky barrier which can be tuned to a p-type ohmic contact by an external electric field.",3
Spectral and magnetic properties of Na2RuO3.,"We present measurements of resistivity, x-ray absorption (XAS) and emission (XES) spectroscopy together with ab initio band structure calculations for quasi two dimensional ruthenate Na2RuO3. Density function calculations (DFT) and XAS and XES spectra both show that Na2RuO3 is a semiconductor with an activation energy of approximately 80 meV. Our DFT calculations reveal large magneto-elastic coupling in Na2RuO3 and predict that the ground state of Na2RuO3 should be antiferromagnetic zig-zag.",3
Anisotropic lattice thermal conductivity in three-fold degeneracy topological semimetal MoP: a first-principles study.,"Recently, three-component new fermions in topological semimetal MoP are experimentally observed (2017 Nature 546 627), which may have potential applications like topological qubits, low-power electronics and spintronics. These are closely related to thermal transport properties of MoP. In this work, the phonon transport of MoP is investigated by solving the linearized phonon Boltzmann equation within the single-mode relaxation time approximation (RTA). The calculated room-temperature lattice thermal conductivity is 18.41 [Formula: see text] and 34.71 [Formula: see text] along the in- and cross-plane directions, exhibiting very strong anisotropy. The isotope and size effects on the lattice thermal conductivity are also considered. It is found that isotope scattering produces little effect, and phonon has little contribution to the lattice thermal conductivity, when phonon mean free path (MFP) is larger than 0.15 [Formula: see text] at 300 K. It is noted that average room-temperature lattice thermal conductivity of MoP is lower than that of representative Weyl semimetal TaAs, which is due to smaller group velocities and larger Gruneisen parameters. Our works provide valuable informations for the thermal management of MoP-based nano-electronics devices, and motivate further experimental works to study thermal transport of MoP.",3
Effects of the Hubbard U on density functional-based predictions of BiFeO3 properties.,"First principles studies of multiferroic materials, such as bismuth ferrite (BFO), require methods that extend beyond standard density functional theory (DFT). The DFT + U method is one such extension that is widely used in the study of BFO. We present a systematic study of the effects of the U parameter on the structural, ferroelectric and electronic properties of BFO. We find that the structural and ferroelectric properties change negligibly in the range of U typically considered for BFO (3-5 eV). In contrast, the electronic structure varies significantly with U. In particular, we see large changes to the character and curvature of the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum, in addition to the expected increase in band gap, as U increases. Most significantly, we find that the [Formula: see text]/[Formula: see text] ordering at the conduction band minimum inverts for U values larger than 4 eV. We therefore recommend a U value of at most 4 eV to be applied to the Fe d orbitals in BFO. More generally, this study emphasises the need for systematic investigations of the effects of the U parameter not merely on band gaps but on the electronic structure as a whole, especially for strongly correlated materials.",3
RKKY interaction of magnetic impurities in multi-Weyl semimetals.,"We have systematically investigated the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction between two magnetic impurities in Weyl semimetals with arbitrary monopole charge Q. We find that the RKKY interaction becomes intrinsically anisotropic for [Formula: see text], and its dependence on Fermi energy and impurity separation is directly controlled by the monopole charge. With the increase of Q, the RKKY interaction becomes more long-ranged and more anisotropic, which makes interesting magnetic orders easier to form and thus may have important applications in spintronics.",3
Extracting the interfacial free energy and anisotropy from a smooth fluctuating dividing surface.,"Interfaces between different materials and phases play a crucial role in many physical and chemical phenomena. When performing simulations of matter at the atomic scale, however, it is often not trivial to characterize these interfaces, particularly when they are rough or diffuse. Here we discuss a generalization of a construction, due to Willard and Chandler, that allows one to obtain a smooth dividing surface that follows the irregular, ever changing shape of these fluctuating interfaces. We show how this construction can be used to study the surface that separates a solid material from its melt and how analyses of the Fourier modes for the capillary fluctuations of this instantaneous dividing surface can be performed. This particular analysis is useful as one can compute the specific free energy excess of the interface, and its dependence on orientation relative to the bulk phases, from the average amplitude of the Fourier modes. We therefore discuss the efficiency of this approach, both in terms of system size and statistical sampling.",3
Quantum many-body simulation using monolayer exciton-polaritons in coupled-cavities.,"Quantum simulation is a promising approach to understanding complex strongly correlated many-body systems using relatively simple and tractable systems. Photon-based quantum simulators have great advantages due to the possibility of direct measurements of multi-particle correlations and ease of simulating non-equilibrium physics. However, interparticle interaction in existing photonic systems is often too weak, limiting the potential for quantum simulation. Here we propose an approach to enhance the interparticle interaction using exciton-polaritons in MoS2 monolayer quantum dots embedded in 2D photonic crystal microcavities. Realistic calculation yields optimal repulsive interaction in the range of 1-10 meV-more than an order of magnitude greater than the state-of-the-art value. Such strong repulsive interaction is found to emerge neither in the photon-blockade regime for small quantum dot nor in the polariton-blockade regime for large quantum dot, but in the crossover between the two regimes with a moderate quantum-dot radius around 20 nm. The optimal repulsive interaction is found to be largest in MoS2 among commonly used optoelectronic materials. Quantum simulation of strongly correlated many-body systems in a finite chain of coupled cavities and its experimental signature are studied via the exact diagonalization of the many-body Hamiltonian. A method to simulate 1D superlattices for interacting exciton-polariton gases in serially coupled cavities is also proposed. Realistic considerations on experimental realizations reveal advantages of transition metal dichalcogenide monolayer quantum dots over conventional semiconductor quantum emitters.",3
Role of lattice inhomogeneities on the electronic properties of selenium deficient Bi2Se3.,"Inter-layer coupling is widely considered to play a crucial role in tuning electronic properties of 3D topological insulators. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of crystallographic defects on inter-layer coupling in the Se deficient Bi2Se3 (0 0 3) crystal using extended x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS) technique. EXAFS measurements at Se-K and Bi-L3 edges reveal distinct local geometry around these atomic sites. It has been observed that short inter-layer Bi-Se and Se-Se bonds emerge in the sample. This additional structural motif coexists with the conventional crystallographic arrangement. Within the quintuple layer Bi-Se bonds are preserved with slight compression in intra-planer Bi-Bi and Se-Se distance and overall reduction in c/a ratio. These findings suggest formation of deformed lattice region, localized and dispersed inhomogeneously within the sample. Such inhomogeneities have also resulted in interesting transport properties such as quantum Hall effect (QHE), large linear magnetoresistance and pi-Berry phase in Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations of bulk crystals. Detailed analyses of magnetotransport measurements suggest that tuning of inter-layer coupling by local lattice deformation is the key factor for unusual transport properties. Role of axial strain, and stacking faults generated due to defects and charged Se vacancies are discussed to understand the observed electronic properties.",3
Superconductivity at 7.4 K in few layer graphene by Li-intercalation.,"Superconductivity in graphene has been highly sought after for its promise in various device applications and for general scientific interest. Ironically, the simple electronic structure of graphene, which is responsible for novel quantum phenomena, hinders the emergence of superconductivity. Theory predicts that doping the surface of the graphene effectively alters the electronic structure, thus promoting propensity towards Cooper pair instability (Profeta et al (2012) Nat. Phys. 8 131-4; Nandkishore et al (2012) Nat. Phys. 8 158-63) [1, 2]. Here we report the emergence of superconductivity at 7.4 K in Li-intercalated few-layer-graphene (FLG). The absence of superconductivity in 3D Li-doped graphite underlines that superconductivity in Li-FLG arises from the novel electronic properties of the 2D graphene layer. These results are expected to guide future research on graphene-based superconductivity, both in theory and experiments. In addition, easy control of the Li-doping process holds promise for various device applications.",3
Photoactivity properties of ZnO doped with cerium ions: an EPR study.,"In the present study, we investigated the effect of cerium doping in zinc oxide matrix, used as photoactive material. Cerium ions into the matrix of ZnO can act like a 'trap' for the electrons, lowering the e (-)/h (+) recombination rate and so increasing the photocatalytic efficiency of the ZnO. We synthesised doped samples using a simple precipitation route. The amount of dopant used was, 1 and 10% molar. The samples have been studied via x-ray diffraction measurements for the structural characterisation; UV-visible diffuse reflectance was used for the optical analysis; Branauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) model for the measurement of the surface area. Finally, the samples have been analysed via electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy for the electronic characterisation and for testing their photoactivity. The spin trapping technique was also use to measure the amount of stable radical adducts formed via reaction of OH(*) radicals with molecules of the DMPO (5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide) spin probe.",3
Distinguishing advective and powered motion in self-propelled colloids.,"Self-powered motion in catalytic colloidal particles provides a compelling example of active matter, i.e. systems that engage in single-particle and collective behavior far from equilibrium. The long-time, long-distance behavior of such systems is of particular interest, since it connects their individual micro-scale behavior to macro-scale phenomena. In such analyses, it is important to distinguish motion due to subtle advective effects-which also has long time scales and length scales-from long-timescale phenomena that derive from intrinsically powered motion. Here, we develop a methodology to analyze the statistical properties of the translational and rotational motions of powered colloids to distinguish, for example, active chemotaxis from passive advection by bulk flow.",3
On the critical temperature discontinuity at the theoretical bcc-fcc phase transition in compressed selenium and tellurium superconductors.,"Recent hydrides-driven advent in the high-pressure phonon-mediated superconductivity motivates research on chemical elements which compound with hydrogen. It is desired that such elements should allow chemical pre-compression of hydrogen to assure the induction of the superconducting phase with the high transition temperature (T C). Herein, we present detailed theoretical insight into the properties of the superconducting state induced under pressure (p) in two of such component elements, namely selenium (Se) and tellurium (Te) at [Formula: see text] GPa and [Formula: see text] GPa, respectively. The assumed external pressure conditions allow us to conduct our analysis just above previously theoretically predicted bcc-fcc structural phase transition of Se and Te, and identify the possible associated discontinuity effect of the critical temperature. In particular, our numerical analysis is conducted within Migdal-Eliashberg formalism, due to the confirmed electron-phonon pairing mechanism and relatively high electron-phonon coupling constant in the materials of interest. We predict that T C values in Se and Te equal 8.13 K and 5.96 K, respectively, and mark the highest critical temperature values for these elements within the postulated fcc phase. Additionally, we supplement these results by the estimated maximum values of the superconducting energy band gap and the effective mass of electrons. We predict that all these parameters can be used as a guidelines for experimental observation of the critical temperature discontinuity and the corresponding bcc-fcc phase transition in Se and Te superconductors. Moreover, we show that the thermodynamics of superconducting phase in both elements may exhibit deviations from the conventional estimates of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory, and suggest existence of the strong-coupling and retardation effects. Finally, we note that our results can be also instructive for future screening of chemical elements for applications in superconducting hydrides.",3
Chemical states of surface oxygen during CO oxidation on Pt(110) surface revealed by ambient pressure XPS.,"The study of CO oxidation on Pt(110) surface is revisited using ambient pressure x-ray photoemission spectroscopy. When the surface temperature reaches the activation temperature for CO oxidation under elevated pressure condition, both the -phase of PtO2 oxide and chemisorbed oxygen are formed simultaneously on the surface. Due to exothermic nature of CO oxidation, the temperature of Pt surface increases as CO oxidation takes places. As the CO/O2 ratio increases, the production of CO2 increases continuously and the surface temperature also increases. Interestingly, during the mass transfer limiting regions, the amount of surface oxide changes little while the chemisorbed oxygen is being reduced. &#13.",3
Universal spectral signatures in pnictides and cuprates: the role of quasiparticle-pair coupling.,"Understanding the physical properties of a large variety of high-T c superconductors (SC), the cuprate family as well as the more recent iron-based superconductors, is still a major challenge. In particular, these materials exhibit the 'peak-dip-hump' structure in the quasiparticle density of states (DOS). The origin of this structure is explained within our pair-pair interaction (PPI) model: The non-superconducting state consists of incoherent pairs, a 'Cooper-pair glass' which, due to the PPI, undergoes a Bose-like condensation below T c to the coherent SC state. We derive the equations of motion for the quasiparticle operators showing that the DOS 'peak-dip-hump' is caused by the coupling between quasiparticles and excited pair states, or 'super-quasiparticles'. The renormalized SC gap function becomes energy-dependent and non retarded, reproducing accurately the experimental spectra of both pnictides and cuprates, despite the large difference in gap value.",3
Edge absorption and pure spin current in a 2D topological insulator in the Volkov-Pankratov model.,Light absorption due to transitions between the edge and two-dimensional (2D) states of a 2D topological insulator (TI) is considered in the Volkov-Pankratov model. It is shown that the transitions are allowed only for the in-plane electric field orthogonal to the TI edge. It is found that the absorption is accompanied by pure spin photocurrent along the TI edge. A possibility of spin current measurement using polarized luminescence from 2D TI quantum dots is discussed.,3
On the diffraction pattern of bundled rare-earth silicide nanowires on Si(0 0 1).,"Motivated by the complex diffraction pattern observed for bundled rare-earth silicide nanowires on the Si(0 0 1) surface, we investigate the influence of the width and the spacing distribution of the nanowires on the diffraction pattern. The diffraction pattern of the bundled rare-earth silicide nanowires is analyzed by the binary surface technique applying a kinematic approach to diffraction. Assuming a categorical distribution for the (individual) nanowire size and a Poisson distribution for the size of the spacing between adjacent nanowire-bundles, we are able to determine the parameters of these distributions and derive an expression for the distribution of the nanowire-bundle size. Additionally, the comparison of our simulations to the experimental diffraction pattern reveal that a (1 x 1)-periodicity on top of the nanowires has to be assumed for a good match.",3
Effect of Mo on the phase stability and elastic mechanical properties of Ti-Mo random alloys from ab initio calculations.,"Ti-Mo alloys are promising materials for shape memory alloys and biomedical materials. Whereas, the appearance of metastable omega phase can cause embrittlement and destroy the shape memory effect. In order to avoid the omega phase, the effect of Mo on the temperature dependent lattice parameters, phase stability and elastic mechanical properties of beta, alpha, and omega Ti1-x Mo x (x = 0-2.0) random alloys was systematically investigated by using the exact muffin-tin orbitals method in combination with the coherent potential approximation. The theoretical predictions for the lattice parameters are in good agreement with the available experiments. Results show that beta Ti0.96Mo0.04 can almost transform to omega phase without lattice deformation and volume change, which suggests that the athermal omega phase is easier to precipitate and grow near 4 at.% Mo content in the beta Ti1-x Mo x alloys. The critical content of Mo for the competed stabilization of beta phase at T = 300 K is ~11.2 at.%. Its valence electron concentration of 4.224 is viewed as a necessary criterion for the competed phase stability. The calculations of formation energy are used to explain successfully why the partitioning of Mo can be found in Ti0.91Mo0.09 alloy after annealing. Through the analysis of formation energy, both Mo addition and increasing temperature can stabilize the beta phase. The calculated Cauchy pressure, Pugh's ratio, Poisson ratio, and Young's modulus suggests that omega phase is intrinsically brittle and has large Young's modulus compared with beta and alpha phases.",3
Effect of molybdenum disulfide nanoribbon on quantum transport of graphene.,"Based on the density functional theory method in combination with the nonequilibrium green's function formalism, the quantum transport properties in graphene-[Formula: see text] vertical heterojunction were investigated in this work. The leads are boron doped graphene and seamlessly connect to the graphene nanoribbon in central scattering region. Although there is a weak graphene-[Formula: see text] interaction, molybdenum disulfide can smooth the electrostatic potential and enlarge the transport properties of the whole device. However, another competitive factor is that of the edge states of the [Formula: see text] nanoribbon. When the transport is along the zigzag direction of graphene, the armchair [Formula: see text] nanoribbon simply enlarges the transmission coefficient. Nevertheless, in the armchair transport system, there is an asymmetric electrostatic potential induced by the different atomic potentials of S and Mo atoms at both edges in the zigzag [Formula: see text] nanoribbon, whose potential can lead to obvious scattering from graphene to [Formula: see text] and suppress the transmission probability. Therefore, it also suppresses the influence of zigzag [Formula: see text] nanoribbon on the transmission coefficient. Our first principles simulations provide useful predictions for the application of graphene based emerging electronics, which may stimulate further experimental exploration.",3
Dielectric and diamagnetic susceptibilities near percolative superconductor-insulator transitions.,"Coarse-grained superconductor-insulator composites exhibit a superconductor-insulator transition governed by classical percolation, which should be describable by networks of inductors and capacitors. We study several classes of random inductor-capacitor networks on square lattices. We present a unifying framework for defining electric and magnetic response functions, and we extend the Frank-Lobb bond-propagation algorithm to compute these quantities by network reduction. We confirm that the superfluid stiffness scales approximately as [Formula: see text] as the superconducting bond fraction p approaches the percolation threshold p c . We find that the diamagnetic susceptibility scales as [Formula: see text] below percolation, and as [Formula: see text] above percolation. For models lacking self-capacitances, the electric susceptibility scales as [Formula: see text]. Including a self-capacitance on each node changes the critical behavior to approximately [Formula: see text].",3
Interface phenomena in magnetron sputtered Cu2O/ZnO heterostructures.,"The interface between ZnO and Cu2O has been predicted to be a good candidate for use in thin film solar cells. However, the high predicted conversion efficiency has yet to be fully realized experimentally. To explore the underlying causes of this we investigate the interface between ZnO and Cu2O in magnetron sputtered samples. Two different sample geometries were made: In the first set thin layers of ZnO were deposited on Cu2O (type A), while in the second set the order was reversed (type B). Using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), an intermediate CuO layer was identified regardless of the order in which the Cu2O and ZnO layers were deposited. The presence of a CuO layer was supported by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results. Changes in the electron hole screening conditions were observed in CuO near the interface with ZnO, manifested as changes in the relative peak-to-satellite ratio and the degree of asymmetric broadness in the Cu 2p peak. The suppression of the Cu 2p satellite characteristic of CuO may cause the CuO presence to be overlooked and cause errors in determinations of valence band offsets (VBOs). For the type A samples, we compare four different approaches to XPS-based determination of VBO and find that the most reliable results are obtained when the thin CuO layer and the altered screening conditions at the interface were taken into account. The VBOs were found to range between 2.5 eV and 2.8 eV. For the B type samples a reduction of the Cu 2p-LMM Auger parameter was found as compared to bulk Cu2O, indicative of quantum confinement in the Cu2O overlayer.",3
The uniform quantized electron gas revisited.,"In this article we continue and extend our recent work on the correlation energy of the quantized electron gas of uniform density at temperature [Formula: see text]. As before, we utilize the methods, properties, and results obtained by means of classical statistical mechanics. These were extended to quantized systems via the Feynman path integral formalism. The latter translates the quantum problem into a classical polymer problem in four dimensions. Again, the well known RPA (random phase approximation) is recovered as a basic result which we then modify and improve upon. Here we analyze the condition of thermodynamic self-consistency. Our numerical calculations exhibit a remarkable agreement with well known results of a standard parameterization of Monte Carlo correlation energies.",3

Statistics of twinning in strained ferroelastics.,"In this review, we show that the evolution of the microstructure and kinetics of ferroelastic crystals under external shear can be explored by computer simulations of 2D model materials. We find that the nucleation and propagation of twin boundaries in ferroelastics depend sensitively on temperature. In the plastic regime, the evolution of the ferroelastic microstructure under strain deformation maintains a stick-and-slip mechanism in all temperature regimes, whereas the dynamic behavior changes dramatically from power-law statistics at low temperature to a Kohlrausch law at intermediate temperature, and then to a Vogel-Fulcher law at high temperature. In the yield regime, the distribution of jerk energies follows power-law statistics in all temperature regimes for a large range of strain rates. The non-spanning avalanches in the yield regime follow a parabolic temporal profile. The changes of twin pattern and twin boundaries density represent an important step towards domain boundary engineering.",3
Prediction of huge magnetic anisotropies in 5d transition metallocenes.,"The stability, electronic structure and non-collinear magnetic properties of a series of 5d metallocenes, namely, two cyclopentadienyl (Cp) rings sandwiched with a single 5d transition metal atom, are investigated. Our first-principles calculations reveal that Cp rings not only provide a suitable ligand environment for metal atoms, but also result in tunable magnetism depending on the transition metal element. Among them, HfCp2 and WCp2 show a high preference for the magnetization axis perpendicular to the Cp plane, with large magnetic anisotropy energies (MAEs) around 10 meV. We further consider triple decker metallocenes (M2Cp3), and find a huge MAE of above 60 meV in Ta2Cp3. The orbital energy split and shifts induced by composition change in metallocenes is mainly responsible for the significant MAE enhancement. By choosing a suitable crystal field for transition metal atoms, we pave a feasible pathway for designing promising building blocks of future magnetic storage devices.",3
Magnetic correlations in the intermetallic antiferromagnet Nd3Co4Sn13.,"Specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, and neutron scattering have been used to investigate the nature of the spin system in the antiferromagnet Nd3Co4Sn13. At room temperature Nd3Co4Sn13 has a cubic, Pm-3n structure similar to Yb3Rh4Sn13. Antiferromagnetic interactions between, Nd(3+) ions dominate the magnetic character of this sample and at 2.4 K the Nd spins enter a long range order state with a magnetic propagation vector q = (0 0 0) with an ordered moment of 1.78(2) microB at 1.5 K. The magnetic Bragg intensity grows very slowly below 1 K, reaching ~2.4 microB at 350 mK. The average magnetic Nd(3+) configuration corresponds to the 3D irreducible representation Gamma7. This magnetic structure can be viewed as three sublattices of antiferromagnetic spin chains coupled with each other in the 120 degrees -configuration. A well-defined magnetic excitation was measured around the 1 1 1 zone centre and the resulting dispersion curve is appropriate for an antiferromagnet with a gap of 0.20(1) meV.",3
Spatial valley separation in strained graphene pn junction.,"Valleytronics in analogy to spintronics aims to use the electron valley degree of freedom to carry and manipulate information, and one of urgent tasks in this field is to generate valley-polarized electrons. In this work, we propose using the electron focusing effect in a strained graphene pn junction to separate valleys spatially through a beam of valley-unpolarized electrons, since the strain-induced pseudo-gauge potentials are opposite for K and [Formula: see text] valleys and severely affect the trajectories of K and [Formula: see text] electron propagation. We numerically simulate this valley-separated Veselago lens effect in a lattice model and demonstrate that pseudo-gauge potentials can efficiently control valley separation patterns.",3
Quantum mechanical force fields for condensed phase molecular simulations.,"Molecular simulations are powerful tools for providing atomic-level details into complex chemical and physical processes that occur in the condensed phase. For strongly interacting systems where quantum many-body effects are known to play an important role, density-functional methods are often used to provide the model with the potential energy used to drive dynamics. These methods, however, suffer from two major drawbacks. First, they are often too computationally intensive to practically apply to large systems over long time scales, limiting their scope of application. Second, there remain challenges for these models to obtain the necessary level of accuracy for weak non-bonded interactions to obtain quantitative accuracy for a wide range of condensed phase properties. Quantum mechanical force fields (QMFFs) provide a potential solution to both of these limitations. In this review, we address recent advances in the development of QMFFs for condensed phase simulations. In particular, we examine the development of QMFF models using both approximate and ab initio density-functional models, the treatment of short-ranged non-bonded and long-ranged electrostatic interactions, and stability issues in molecular dynamics calculations. Example calculations are provided for crystalline systems, liquid water, and ionic liquids. We conclude with a perspective for emerging challenges and future research directions.",3
Embedded-atom method potential for modeling hydrogen and hydrogen-defect interaction in tungsten.,"An embedded-atom method potential has been developed for modeling hydrogen in body-centered-cubic (bcc) tungsten by fitting to an extensive database of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Comprehensive evaluations of the new potential are conducted by comparing various hydrogen properties with DFT calculations and available experimental data, as well as all the other tungsten-hydrogen potentials. The new potential accurately reproduces the point defect properties of hydrogen, the interaction among hydrogen atoms, the interplay between hydrogen and a monovacancy, and the thermal diffusion of hydrogen in tungsten. The successful validation of the new potential confirms its good reliability and transferability, which enables large-scale atomistic simulations of tungsten-hydrogen system. The new potential is afterward employed to investigate the interplay between hydrogen and other defects, including [1 1 1] self-interstitial atoms (SIAs) and vacancy clusters in tungsten. It is found that both the [1 1 1] SIAs and the vacancy clusters exhibit considerable attraction for hydrogen. Hydrogen solution and diffusion in strained tungsten are also studied using the present potential, which demonstrates that tensile (compressive) stress facilitates (impedes) hydrogen solution, and isotropic tensile (compressive) stress impedes (facilitates) hydrogen diffusion while anisotropic tensile (compressive) stress facilitates (impedes) hydrogen diffusion.",3
Plasmon modes of bilayer molybdenum disulfide: a density functional study.,"We explore the collective electronic excitations of bilayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) using density functional theory together with random phase approximation. The many-body dielectric function and electron energy-loss spectra are calculated using an ab initio based model involving material-realistic physical properties. The electron energy-loss function of the bilayer MoS2 system is found to be sensitive to either electron or hole doping and this is due to the fact that the Kohn-Sham band dispersions are not symmetric for energies above and below the zero Fermi level. Three plasmon modes are predicted, a damped high-energy mode, one optical mode (in-phase mode) for which the plasmon dispersion exhibits [Formula: see text] in the long wavelength limit originating from low-energy electron scattering and finally a highly damped acoustic mode (out-of-phase mode).",3
Dynamics of microtubules: highlights of recent computational and experimental investigations.,"Microtubules are found in most eukaryotic cells, with homologs in eubacteria and archea, and they have functional roles in mitosis, cell motility, intracellular transport, and the maintenance of cell shape. Numerous efforts have been expended over the last two decades to characterize the interactions between microtubules and the wide variety of microtubule associated proteins that control their dynamic behavior in cells resulting in microtubules being assembled and disassembled where and when they are required by the cell. We present the main findings regarding microtubule polymerization and depolymerization and review recent work about the molecular motors that modulate microtubule dynamics by inducing either microtubule depolymerization or severing. We also discuss the main experimental and computational approaches used to quantify the thermodynamics and mechanics of microtubule filaments.",3
Assessing the performance of self-consistent hybrid functional for band gap calculation in oxide semiconductors.,"In this paper we assess the predictive power of the self-consistent hybrid functional scPBE0 in calculating the band gap of oxide semiconductors. The computational procedure is based on the self-consistent evaluation of the mixing parameter alpha by means of an iterative calculation of the static dielectric constant using the perturbation expansion after discretization method and making use of the relation [Formula: see text]. Our materials dataset is formed by 30 compounds covering a wide range of band gaps and dielectric properties, and includes materials with a wide spectrum of applications such as thermoelectrics, photocatalysis, photovoltaics, transparent conducting oxides, and refractory materials. Our results show that the scPBE0 functional provides better band gaps than the non self-consistent hybrids PBE0 and HSE06, but scPBE0 does not show significant improvement on the description of the static dielectric constants. Overall, the scPBE0 data exhibit a mean absolute percentage error of 14% (band gaps) and 10% ([Formula: see text]). For materials with weak dielectric screening and large excitonic biding energies scPBE0, unlike PBE0 and HSE06, overestimates the band gaps, but the value of the gap becomes very close to the experimental value when excitonic effects are included (e.g. for SiO2). However, special caution must be given to the compounds with small band gaps due to the tendency of scPBE0 to overestimate the dielectric constant in the proximity of the metallic limit.",3
Hidden symmetries in N-layer dielectric stacks.,"The optical properties of a multilayer system with arbitrary N layers of dielectric media are investigated. Each layer is one of two dielectric media, with a thickness one-quarter the wavelength of light in that medium, corresponding to a central frequency f 0. Using the transfer matrix method, the transmittance T is calculated for all possible 2 (N) sequences for small N. Unexpectedly, it is found that instead of 2 (N) different values of T at f 0 (T 0), there are only [Formula: see text] discrete values of T 0, for even N, and (N + 1) for odd N. We explain this high degeneracy in T 0 values by finding symmetry operations on the sequences that do not change T 0. Analytical formulae were derived for the T 0 values and their degeneracies as functions of N and an integer parameter for each sequence we call 'charge'. Additionally, the bandwidth at f 0 and filter response of the transmission spectra are investigated, revealing asymptotic behavior at large N.",3
Multiple timescales in the photoswitching kinetics of crystalline thin films of azobenzene-trimers.,"Functional materials that exhibit photoinduced structural phase transitions are highly interesting for applications in optomechanics and mechanochemistry. It is, however, still not fully understood how photochemical reactions, which are often accompanied by molecular motion, proceed in confined and crystalline environments. Here we show that thin films of azobenzene trimers exhibit high structural order and determine the crystallographic unit cell. We demonstrate that thin film can be switched partially reversibly between a crystalline and an amorphous phase. The time constant of the photoinduced amorphisation as measured with real-time x-ray diffraction ([Formula: see text]220 s) lies between the two time constants (120 s and 2870 s) of the ensemble photoisomerisation processes that are measured via optical spectroscopy. Our observation of a photoinduced shrinking of the crystalline domains indicates a cascading process, in which photoisomerisation starts at the surface of the thin film and propagates deeper into the crystalline layer by introducing disorder and generating free volume. This finding is important for the rapidly evolving research field of photoresponsive thin films and smart crystalline materials in general.",3
Improved electronic structure and magnetic exchange interactions in transition metal oxides.,"We discuss the application of the Agapito Curtarolo and Buongiorno Nardelli (ACBN0) pseudo-hybrid Hubbard density functional to several transition metal oxides. For simple binary metal oxides, ACBN0 is found to be a fast, reasonably accurate and parameter-free alternative to traditional DFT + U and hybrid exact exchange methods. In ACBN0, the Hubbard energy of DFT + U is calculated via the direct evaluation of the local Coulomb and exchange integrals in which the screening of the bare Coulomb potential is accounted for by a renormalization of the density matrix. We demonstrate the success of the ACBN0 approach for the electronic properties of a series technologically relevant mono-oxides (MnO, CoO, NiO, FeO, both at equilibrium and under pressure). We also present results on two mixed valence compounds, Co3O4 and Mn3O4. Our results for these binary oxides and all the materials we have investigated, obtained at the computational cost of a standard LDA/PBE calculation, are in excellent agreement with hybrid functionals, the GW approximation and experimental measurements.",3
Effect of functionalization of boron nitride flakes by main group metal clusters on their optoelectronic properties.,"The possibility of functionalizing boron nitride flakes (BNFs) with some selected main group metal clusters, viz. OLi4, NLi5, CLi6, BLI7 and Al12Be, has been analyzed with the aid of density functional theory (DFT) based computations. Thermochemical as well as energetic considerations suggest that all the metal clusters interact with the BNF moiety in a favorable fashion. As a result of functionalization, the static (first) hyperpolarizability ([Formula: see text]) values of the metal cluster supported BNF moieties increase quite significantly as compared to that in the case of pristine BNF. Time dependent DFT analysis reveals that the metal clusters can lower the transition energies associated with the dominant electronic transitions quite significantly thereby enabling the metal cluster supported BNF moieties to exhibit significant non-linear optical activity. Moreover, the studied systems demonstrate broad band absorption capability spanning the UV-visible as well as infra-red domains. Energy decomposition analysis reveals that the electrostatic interactions principally stabilize the metal cluster supported BNF moieties.",3
Electronic and magnetic properties of multiferroic ScFeO<sub>3</sub> available from diffraction experiments.,"Abstract&#13; Electronic and magnetic properties of ferric ions (3d5) in multiferroic ScFeO3 are puzzling, in part because they are different from the only other multiferroic known to possess the same polar chemical structure, BiFeO3. Open questions about ScFeO3 can be addressed by confronting observations with results for G-type antiferromagnetism allowed by the lithium niobate (LiNbO3)-like parent R3c structure. Calculated structure factors for resonant x-ray diffraction include all charge-like quadrupoles allowed by symmetry, and if experimental results for ScFeO3 subsequently imply they are different from zero then ferric ions cannot be in the high-spin 6S state. The same type of experiment can reveal the moment direction in the G-type antiferromagnetism, according to our calculations, and thereby contribute to understanding magnetic anisotropy. Furthermore, structure factors for magnetic neutron diffraction by ScFeO3 include Dirac multipoles that are time-odd and parity-odd, e.g., dipoles that are often called anapoles or toroidal moments. Apart from Dirac multipoles, the conventional approach to the interpretation of neutron Bragg diffraction data will be inadequate if ferric ions (Fe3) are not in the high-spin 6S state, because the scattering amplitude includes more than simple dipole moments in the general case. &#13; .&#13.",3
Magneto-optical properties of topological insulator thin films with broken inversion symmetry.,"We determine the optical response of ultrathin film topological insulators in the presence of a quantizing external magnetic field taking into account both hybridization between surface states, broken inversion symmetry and explicit time reversal symmetry breaking by the magnetic field. We find that breaking of inversion symmetry in the system, which can be due to interaction with a substrate or electrical gating, results in Landau level crossings and opening of additional optical transition channels that were previously forbidden. We show that by tuning the hybridization and symmetry breaking parameters, a transition from the normal to a topological insulator phase occurs with measureable signatures in both static (dc) and dynamic (optical) conductivity. Moreover, we find that these signatures in the optical Hall conductivity remain robust against a significant range of disorder strength.",3
Optics of exciton-plasmon nanomaterials.,"This review provides a brief introduction to the physics of coupled exciton-plasmon systems, the theoretical description and experimental manifestation of such phenomena, followed by an account of the state-of-the-art methodology for the numerical simulations of such phenomena and supplemented by a number of FORTRAN codes, by which the interested reader can introduce himself/herself to the practice of such simulations. Applications to CW light scattering as well as transient response and relaxation are described. Particular attention is given to so-called strong coupling limit, where the hybrid exciton-plasmon nature of the system response is strongly expressed. While traditional descriptions of such phenomena usually rely on analysis of the electromagnetic response of inhomogeneous dielectric environments that individually support plasmon and exciton excitations, here we explore also the consequences of a more detailed description of the molecular environment in terms of its quantum density matrix (applied in a mean field approximation level). Such a description makes it possible to account for characteristics that cannot be described by the dielectric response model: the effects of dephasing on the molecular response on one hand, and nonlinear response on the other. It also highlights the still missing important ingredients in the numerical approach, in particular its limitation to a classical description of the radiation field and its reliance on a mean field description of the many-body molecular system. We end our review with an outlook to the near future, where these limitations will be addressed and new novel applications of the numerical approach will be pursued.",3
Temperature dependent magnetic Compton profiles and first-principles strategies of quaternary half-Heusler alloy Co1-x Cu x MnSb(0 x 0.8).,"Temperature dependent experimental Compton profiles of quaternary alloys Co1-x Cu x MnSb (x = 0.0, 0.2, 0.6 and 0.8) when decomposed into constituent profiles show that the sp-electron spin polarization is antiferromagnetically coupled to Mn-3d moments. The orbital magnetic moments derived from combination of magnetic Compton profiles (MCPs) and magnetization measurements are found to be small. Moreover, the first-principles full potential-linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) calculations have been performed to validate the experimental investigations of spin moments and half-Heusler properties. Present experimental and theoretical work show major role of Mn atoms in building-up the absolute spin moments. Our MCP data and spin-projected density of states derived from FP-LAPW computations show an increase in sp-d interaction in conduction region on increasing the Cu concentration. Further, Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida-type hybridization and antiferromagnetic superexchange interactions are witnessed in the reported alloys.",3
Presenting a new kinetic model for methanol to light olefins reactions over a hierarchical SAPO-34 catalyst using the Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson mechanism.,"In this study, a new kinetic model for methanol to light olefins (MTO) reactions over a hierarchical SAPO-34 catalyst using the Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson (LHHW) mechanism was presented and the kinetic parameters was obtained using a genetic algorithm (GA) and genetic programming (GP). Several kinetic models for the MTO reactions have been presented. However, due to the complexity of the reactions, most reactions are considered lumped and elementary, which cannot be deemed a completely accurate kinetic model of the process. Therefore, in this study, the LHHW mechanism is presented as kinetic models of MTO reactions. Because of the non-linearity of the kinetic models and existence of many local optimal points, evolutionary algorithms (GA and GP) are used in this study to estimate the kinetic parameters in the rate equations. Via the simultaneous connection of the code related to modelling the reactor and the GA and GP codes in the MATLAB R2013a software, optimization of the kinetic models parameters was performed such that the least difference between the results from the kinetic models and experiential results was obtained and the best kinetic parameters of MTO process reactions were achieved. A comparison of the results from the model with experiential results showed that the present model possesses good accuracy.",3
Driving force of the orbital-relevant electronic nematicity in Fe-based superconductors.,"The electronic nematic responses in Fe-based superconductors have been observed ubiquitously in various experimental probes. One novel nematic character is the d-wave bond orbital-relevant nematic charge order which was firstly proposed by symmetry analysis and then conformed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. In this paper, we present a mechanism that the driving force of the orbital-relevant nematic charge order is the reduction of the large Hubbard energy in the particle-hole charge channel by virtual hopping processes. This is one scenario from strong-coupling consideration. The same virtual hopping processes can lead to a super-exchange interaction for the spin magnetic order in the particle-hole spin channel and a pairing interaction for the superconducting order in the particle-particle channel. Thus the electronic nematic order, the spin magnetic order and the pairing superconducting order are intrinsically entangled and they can all stem from the same microscopic virtual hopping processes in reduction of the Hubbard energy. The electronic nematicity, the spin magnetism and the pairing superconductivity in unconventional superconductors are proposed to be unified within this mechanism.",3
"Dielectric environment and/or random disorder effects on free, charged and localized excitonic states in monolayer WS2.","Excitonic effects play an important role on the optoelectronic behavior of atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) crystals of the WS2 transition metal dichalcogenide. In this paper, neutral and charged exciton behaviors in monolayer WS2 are handled within effective-mass approximation for which the critical parameters are ensured from our ab initio calculations. Firstly, we reveal an exciton series with a novel energy dependence on the orbital angular momentum. Considerable control of the dielectric environment on neutral and charged excitons binding energies is elucidated. We demonstrate that for accepted values of effective masses, the negative and positive trion binding energies should be identical. Secondly, localization of neutral exciton center of mass motion by random potential arising from monolayer defects is also studied. The results obtained are in agreement with available experimental work.",3
Low-temperature resonant Raman asymmetry in 2H-MoS2 under high pressure.,"We report on the combined effect of temperature (6 K-300 K) and high pressure (up to 6 GPa) on the resonant Raman scattering by A1g phonons in bulk 2H-MoS2, as the energy of the A exciton is tuned into resonance with an exciting laser at EL = 1.96 eV. As expected, the pressure to be applied for attaining resonant conditions decreases with decreasing temperature. A striking result concerns the combined effect of temperature and pressure on the strength of the incoming relative to the outgoing resonance of the A1g phonon. When its Raman intensity is normalized by that of the 'non-resonant' [Formula: see text] phonon (IA1g/I[Formula: see text]), we find that the contribution of the pressure-tuned outgoing resonance relative to that of the incoming channel changes with temperature. At room temperature both contributions are about equal, as expected. Interestingly, with decreasing temperature an asymmetry in the relative magnitude of the resonances develops, becoming the outgoing contribution about half of the incoming resonance below ~50 K. We discuss the different possibilities for the origin of this effect.",3
Photovoltaic efficiency of intermediate band solar cells based on CdTe/CdMnTe coupled quantum dots.,"In this work we show the calculation of optimized efficiencies of intermediate band solar cells (IBSCs) based on Mn-doped II-VI CdTe/CdMnTe coupled quantum dot (QD) structures. We focus our attention on the combined effects of geometrical and Mn-doping parameters on optical properties and solar cell efficiency. In the framework of [Formula: see text] theory, we accomplish detailed calculations of electronic structure, transition energies, optical selection rules and their corresponding intra- and interband oscillator strengths. With these results and by following the intermediate band model, we have developed a strategy which allows us to find optimal photovoltaic efficiency values. We also show that the effects of band admixture which can lead to degradation of optical transitions and reduction of efficiency can be partly minimized by a careful selection of the structural parameters and Mn-concentration. Thus, the improvement of band engineering is mandatory for any practical implementation of QD systems as IBSC hardware. Finally, our calculations show that it is possible to reach significant efficiency, up to approximately 26%, by selecting a restricted space of parameters such as quantum dot size and shape and Mn-concentration effects, to improve the modulation of optical absorption in the structures.",3
Close proximity electrostatic effect from small clusters of emitters.,"Using a numerical simulation based on the finite-element technique, this work investigates the field emission properties from clusters of a few emitters at close proximity, by analyzing the properties of the maximum local field enhancement factor ([Formula: see text]) and the corresponding emission current. At short distances between the emitters, we show the existence of a nonintuitive behavior, which consists of the increasing of [Formula: see text] as the distance c between the emitters decreases. Here we investigate this phenomenon for clusters with 2, 3, 4 and 7 identical emitters and study the influence of the proximity effect in the emission current, considering the role of the aspect ratio of the individual emitters. Importantly, our results show that peripheral emitters with high aspect-ratios in large clusters can, in principle, significantly increase the emitted current as a consequence only of the close proximity electrostatic effect (CPEE). This phenomenon can be seen as a physical mechanism to produce self-oscillations of individual emitters. We discuss new insights for understanding the nature of self-oscillations in emitters based on the CPEE, including applications to nanometric oscillators.",3
Anisotropic upper critical magnetic fields in Rb2Cr3As3 superconductor.,"Rb2Cr3As3 is a structurally one-dimensional superconductor containing Cr3As3 chains with a superconducting transition temperature of [Formula: see text] K. Here we report the electrical resistance measurements for Rb2Cr3As3 single crystals, under magnetic fields up to 29.5 T and at temperatures down to 0.36 K, from which the upper critical fields, [Formula: see text], can be obtained in a broad temperature range. For field parallel to the Cr3As3 chains, [Formula: see text] is paramagnetically limited with an initial slope of [Formula: see text]d[Formula: see text]/d[Formula: see text] T [Formula: see text] and a zero-temperature upper critical field of [Formula: see text] T. For field perpendicular to the Cr3As3 chains, however, [Formula: see text] is only limited by orbital pair-breaking effect with [Formula: see text]d[Formula: see text]/d[Formula: see text] T [Formula: see text]. As a consequence, the anisotropy [Formula: see text] decreases sharply near T c and reverses below 2 K. Remarkably, the low-temperature [Formula: see text] down to 0.075 [Formula: see text] remains to increase linearly up to over three times the Pauli paramagnetic limit, which strongly suggests dominant spin-triplet superconductivity in Rb2Cr3As3.",3
Evidence of magneto-structural coupling affecting magnetic anisotropy in a cobalt nano-composite.,"By investigating temperature dependent structural and magnetic properties of cobalt (Co) embedded within nanoporous anodized alumina template, we observe changes in the easy axis of Co magnetization and an unusual increase in its saturation magnetization below a temperature T cr. Analysis of our M(H) data reveals that the magnetized volume of the sample increases rapidly as T falls below T cr. To understand these features we perform micro-magnetic simulations for a single Co-nanopillar wherein by varying its magneto-crystalline anisotropy energy we are able to show that the changes observed near T cr are related to the changes in the magnetic anisotropy of the nanopillar. We propose crystallographic structural distortions trigger changes in the balance between shape and magneto-crystalline anisotropy in our nanopillar. Our results suggest interplay between magnetism, structure and magnetic anisotropy in low dimensional Co-nanopillars, which can be modified with temperature of the system.",3
First-principles investigation on Au n @(ZnO)42 (n = 6-16) core-shell nanoparticles: structure stability and catalytic activity.,"A family of Au n @(ZnO)[Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]-16) cluster-assembled nanoparticles are studied by density-functional theory calculations. Different sizes, up to 100 atoms, are considered for several compositions. For each n, we design and construct a converged model for Au n @(ZnO)[Formula: see text] to analyze the coupling effect of adding Au atoms into ZnO outer shell. Among the optimized geometrical structures, we find that [Formula: see text]@(ZnO)[Formula: see text] has the most stable structure. The electronic properties, optical properties and catalytic activity of the [Formula: see text]@(ZnO)[Formula: see text] core-shell have been systematically investigated, which also shows consistency with the experimental results. It is found that forming a core-shell structure enhances the visible-light photocatalytic ability and [Formula: see text]@(ZnO)[Formula: see text] core-shell structure has a high catalytic efficiency for the reaction CO oxidation.",3
Modeling shear-induced particle ordering and deformation in a dense soft particle suspension.,"We apply the lattice Boltzmann method and the bead-spring network model of deformable particles (DPs) to study shear-induced particle ordering and deformation and the corresponding rheological behavior for dense DP suspensions confined in a narrow gap under steady external shear. The particle configuration is characterized with small-angle scattering intensity, the real-space 2D local order parameter, and the particle shape factors including deformation, stretching and tilt angles. We investigate how particle ordering and deformation vary with the particle volume fraction varphi (=0.45-0.65) and the external shear rate characterized with the capillary number Ca (=0.003-0.191). The degree of particle deformation increases mildly with varphi but significantly with Ca. Under moderate shear rate (Ca = 0.105), the inter-particle structure evolves from string-like ordering to layered hexagonal close packing (HCP) as varphi increases. A long wavelength particle slithering motion emerges for sufficiently large varphi. For varphi = 0.61, the structure maintains layered HCP for Ca = 0.031-0.143 but gradually becomes disordered for larger and smaller Ca. The correlation in particle zigzag movements depends sensitively on varphi and particle ordering. Layer-by-layer analysis reveals how the non-slippery hard walls affect particle ordering and deformation. The shear-induced reconfiguration of DPs observed in the simulation agrees qualitatively with experimental results of sheared uniform emulsions. The apparent suspension viscosity increases with varphi but exhibits much weaker dependence compared to hard-sphere suspensions, indicating that particle deformation and unjamming under shear can significantly reduce the viscous stress. Furthermore, the suspension shear-thins, corresponding to increased inter-DP ordering and particle deformation with Ca. This work provides useful insights into the microstructure-rheology relationship of concentrated deformable particle suspensions.",3

Chiral discrimination in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.,"Chirality is a fundamental property of molecules whose spatial symmetry is characterized by the absence of improper rotations, making them not superimposable to their mirror image. Chiral molecules constitute the elementary building blocks of living species and one enantiomer is favoured in general (e.g. L-aminoacids and D-sugars pervade terrestrial homochiral biochemistry) because most chemical reactions producing natural substances are enantioselective. Since the effect of chiral chemicals and drugs on living beings can be markedly different between enantiomers, the quest for practical spectroscopical methods to scrutinize chirality is an issue of great importance and interest. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a topmost analytical technique, but spectrometers currently used are 'blind' to chirality, i.e. unable to discriminate the two mirror-image forms of a chiral molecule, because, in the absence of a chiral solvent, the spectral parameters, chemical shifts and spin-spin coupling constants are identical for enantiomers. Therefore, the development of new procedures for routine chiral recognition would offer basic support to scientists. However, in the presence of magnetic fields, a distinction between true and false chirality is mandatory. The former epitomizes natural optical activity, which is rationalized by a time-even pseudoscalar, i.e. the trace of a second-rank tensor, the mixed electric dipole/magnetic dipole polarizability. The Faraday effect, magnetic circular dichroism and magnetic optical activity are instead related to a time-odd axial vector. The present review summarizes recent theoretical and experimental efforts to discriminate enantiomers via NMR spectroscopy, with the focus on the deep connection between chirality and symmetry properties under the combined set of fundamental discrete operations, namely charge conjugation, parity (space inversion) and time (motion) reversal.",3
Wave vector dependent damping of THz collective modes in a liquid metal.,Well-defined damped collective modes have been observed in liquid metals over a wide range of wave vectors. Hydrodynamics predicts that viscosity and thermal conductivity are the cause for the damping of the collective modes. Here we present experimental data from neutron spectroscopy on the damping of collective modes of liquid rubidium over a wide range of wave vectors. We propose a phenomenological model derived from generalized hydrodynamics to describe the damping of the modes and the evolution with increasing wave vector based on the viscoelastic picture of liquid response. As necessary ingredients a wave vector dependent high frequency shear modulus and shear relaxation time appear. We obtain a remarkable good agreement on a quantitative basis between experiment and calculation over a wide range of wave vectors. The emergent picture is that the lifetime of the collective modes in the THz regime is mainly limited through the diffusion of momentum. The proposed methodology might be applicable to a wide range of liquids.,3
Mechanisms of photoinduced magnetization in Pr0.6Ca0.4MnO3 studied above and below charge-ordering transition temperature.,"We report the effect of photonic field on the electronic and magnetic structure of a low bandwidth manganite [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text]MnO3 (PCMO) thin film. In particular, the present study confirmed a mechanism that was recently proposed to explain how optical excitation can bias or directly activate the metamagnetic transition associated with the colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) effect of PCMO. The transition is characterized by a shift in the dynamic equilibrium between ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic clusters, explaining how it can be suddenly triggered by a sufficient external magnetic field. The film was always found to support some population of FM-clusters, the proportional size of which could be adjusted by the magnetic field and, especially in the vicinity of a thermomagnetic irreversibility, by optical excitation. The double exchange mechanism couples the magnetic degrees of freedom of manganites to their electronic structure, which is further coupled to the ion lattice via the Jahn-Teller mechanism. In accordance, it was found that producing optical phonons into the lattice could lower the free energy of the FM phase enough to significantly bias the CMR effect.",3
Mottness at finite doping and charge-instabilities in cuprates.,"The influence of the Mott physics on the doping-temperature phase diagram of copper oxides represents a major issue that is subject of intense theoretical and experimental effort. Here, we investigate the ultrafast electron dynamics in prototypical single-layer Bi-based cuprates at the energy scale of the O-2p-->Cu-3d charge-transfer (CT) process. We demonstrate a clear evolution of the CT excitations from incoherent and localized, as in a Mott insulator, to coherent and delocalized, as in a conventional metal. This reorganization of the high-energy degrees of freedom occurs at the critical doping pcr approximately 0.16 irrespective of the temperature, and it can be well described by dynamical mean field theory calculations. We argue that the onset of the low-temperature charge instabilities is the low-energy manifestation of the underlying Mottness that characterizes the p < pcr region of the phase diagram. This discovery sets a new framework for theories of charge order and low-temperature phases in underdoped copper oxides.",3
High-frequency microrheology reveals cytoskeleton dynamics in living cells.,"Living cells are viscoelastic materials, with the elastic response dominating at long timescales ( greater, similar1 ms)1. At shorter timescales, the dynamics of individual cytoskeleton filaments are expected to emerge, but active microrheology measurements on cells accessing this regime are scarce2. Here, we develop high-frequency microrheology (HF-MR) to probe the viscoelastic response of living cells from 1Hz to 100 kHz. We report the viscoelasticity of different cell types and upon cytoskeletal drug treatments. At previously inaccessible short timescales, cells exhibit rich viscoelastic responses that depend on the state of the cytoskeleton. Benign and malignant cancer cells revealed remarkably different scaling laws at high frequency, providing a univocal mechanical fingerprint. Microrheology over a wide dynamic range up to the frequency of action of the molecular components provides a mechanistic understanding of cell mechanics.",3
Hot spot-mediated non-dissipative and ultrafast plasmon passage.,"Plasmonic nanoparticles hold great promise as photon handling elements and as channels for coherent transfer of energy and information in future all-optical computing devices.1-5 Coherent energy oscillations between two spatially separated plasmonic entities via a virtual middle state exemplify electron-based population transfer, but their realization requires precise nanoscale positioning of heterogeneous particles.6-10 Here, we show the assembly and optical analysis of a triple particle system consisting of two gold nanoparticles with an inter-spaced silver island. We observe strong plasmonic coupling between the spatially separated gold particles mediated by the connecting silver particle with almost no dissipation of energy. As the excitation energy of the silver island exceeds that of the gold particles, only quasi-occupation of the silver transfer channel is possible. We describe this effect both with exact classical electrodynamic modeling and qualitative quantum-mechanical calculations. We identify the formation of strong hot spots between all particles as the main mechanism for the loss-less coupling and thus coherent ultra-fast energy transfer between the remote partners. Our findings could prove useful for quantum gate operations, but also for classical charge and information transfer processes.",3
Commensurability oscillations in a periodically modulated phosphorene.,"The recent experimental realization of high-quality phosphorene leads to novel electronic and optical properties with possible new device applications due to its huge direct band gap. We study the commensurability or Weiss oscillations in monolayer phosphorene in the presence of a weak perpendicular magnetic field B and a weak and periodic, electric or magnetic one-dimensional modulation. Either modulation broadens the Landau levels into bands, whose width oscillates with B, and the oscillations appear in the electrical conductivity perpendicular to the modulation taken along the direction (x) of the smaller effective mass. Compared with the oscillations of the diffusive conductivity in a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) for typical electron densities [Formula: see text], the ones in phosphorene, with typical [Formula: see text], have approximately similar height but a period significantly smaller when plotted versus [Formula: see text] while plotted versus B they occur at significantly higher fields. The Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations exhibit a similar behaviour. When the modulation is taken along the direction (y) of the larger effective mass, the oscillation period is close to that of a 2DEG. For equal modulation strengths the bandwidth due to a magnetic modulation is one order of magnitude larger than that due to an electric one and the amplitude of the oscillations in the diffusive conductivity about 50 times larger. Numerical results are presented for experimentally relevant parameters.",3
Is perpendicular magnetic anisotropy essential to all-optical ultrafast spin reversal in ferromagnets?,"All-optical spin reversal presents a new opportunity for spin manipulations, free of a magnetic field. Most of all-optical-spin-reversal ferromagnets are found to have a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), but it has been unknown whether PMA is necessary for spin reversal. Here we theoretically investigate magnetic thin films with either PMA or in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA). Our results show that spin reversal in IMA systems is possible, but only with a longer laser pulse and within a narrow laser parameter region. Spin reversal does not show a strong helicity dependence where the left- and right-circularly polarized light lead to the identical results. By contrast, the spin reversal in PMA systems is robust, provided both the spin angular momentum and laser field are strong enough while the magnetic anisotropy itself is not too strong. This explains why experimentally the majority of all-optical spin-reversal samples are found to have strong PMA and why spins in Fe nanoparticles only cant out of plane. It is the laser-induced spin-orbit torque that plays a key role in the spin reversal. Surprisingly, the same spin-orbit torque results in laser-induced spin rectification in spin-mixed configuration, a prediction that can be tested experimentally. Our results clearly point out that PMA is essential to spin reversal, though there is an opportunity for in-plane spin reversal.",3
Effects of Cu doping on the electronic structure and magnetic properties of MnCo2O4 nanostructures.,"Reported here are the results and their analysis from our detailed investigations of the effects of Cu doping ([Formula: see text]) on the electronic structure and magnetic properties of the spinel [Formula: see text]O4. A detailed comparison is given for the [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] cases for both the bulk-like samples and nanoparticles. The electronic structure determined from x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Rietveld analysis of x-ray diffraction patterns shows the structure to be: ([Formula: see text])A [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text]]B [Formula: see text] i.e. [Formula: see text] substitutes for [Formula: see text] on the octahedral B-sites. For the bulk samples, the ferrimagnetic [Formula: see text] K for [Formula: see text] is lowered to [Formula: see text] K for the [Formula: see text] sample, this decrease being due to the effect of Cu doping. For the nanosize [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]) sample, the lower [Formula: see text] K ([Formula: see text] K) is observed using [Formula: see text] analysis, this lowering being due to finite size effects. For [Formula: see text], fits of dc paramagnetic susceptibility data of [Formula: see text] versus T in nanosize samples to the Neel expression are used to determine the exchange interactions between the A and B sites with exchange constants: [Formula: see text] K (4.1 K), [Formula: see text] K (16.3 K) and [Formula: see text] K (13.8 K) for [Formula: see text]. The temperature dependence of ac susceptibilities [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] at different frequencies shows that in bulk samples of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], the transition at T C is the normal second order transition. But for the nanosize [Formula: see text] and 0.2 samples, analysis of the ac susceptibilities shows that the ferrimagnetic transition at T C is followed by a re-entrant spin-glass transition at lower temperatures [Formula: see text] K (138 K) for [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]). Analysis of the ac susceptibilities, [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], versus T data is done in terms of two scaling laws: (i) Vogel-Fulcher law [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text]; and (ii) power law of critical slowing-down [Formula: see text]. These fits confirm the existence of glassy behavior below T SG with the parameters [Formula: see text] (8.91), [Formula: see text] (9.6 x 10[Formula: see text]) and [Formula: see text] K ( approximately 138 K) for the samples [Formula: see text] (0.2), with similar results obtained for other samples. The linear behavior of the peak maximum in [Formula: see text] versus [Formula: see text] (AT-line) further supports the existence of glassy states in nanosize samples. For [Formula: see text], the temperature and composition dependence of the hysteresis loop parameters are investigated; all the samples with x 0.1 have the coercivity H C and remanence [Formula: see text]. Since the results reported here in these nanostructures are significantly different from those in bulk [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text], further investigations of their magnetic structures using neutron diffraction are warranted.",3
Better band gaps for wide-gap semiconductors from a locally corrected exchange-correlation potential that nearly eliminates self-interaction errors.,"This work constitutes a comprehensive and improved account of electronic-structure and mechanical properties of silicon-nitride ([Formula: see text] [Formula: see text]) polymorphs via van Leeuwen and Baerends (LB) exchange-corrected local density approximation (LDA) that enforces the exact exchange potential asymptotic behavior. The calculated lattice constant, bulk modulus, and electronic band structure of [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] polymorphs are in good agreement with experimental results. We also show that, for a single electron in a hydrogen atom, spherical well, or harmonic oscillator, the LB-corrected LDA reduces the (self-interaction) error to exact total energy to approximately 10%, a factor of three to four lower than standard LDA, due to a dramatically improved representation of the exchange-potential.",3
Charge transfer in time-dependent density functional theory.,"Charge transfer plays a crucial role in many processes of interest in physics, chemistry, and bio-chemistry. In many applications the size of the systems involved calls for time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) to be used in their computational modeling, due to its unprecedented balance between accuracy and efficiency. However, although exact in principle, in practise approximations must be made for the exchange-correlation functional in this theory, and the standard functional approximations perform poorly for excitations which have a long-range charge-transfer component. Intense progress has been made in developing more sophisticated functionals for this problem, which we review. We point out an essential difference between the properties of the exchange-correlation kernel needed for an accurate description of charge-transfer between open-shell fragments and between closed-shell fragments. We then turn to charge-transfer dynamics, which, in contrast to the excitation problem, is a highly non-equilibrium, non-perturbative, process involving a transfer of one full electron in space. This turns out to be a much more challenging problem for TDDFT functionals. We describe dynamical step and peak features in the exact functional evolving over time, that are missing in the functionals currently used. The latter underestimate the amount of charge transferred and manifest a spurious shift in the charge transfer resonance position. We discuss some explicit examples.",3
Perpendicularly magnetized Co20Fe60B20 layer sandwiched between Au with low Gilbert damping.,"Nowadays, the CoFeB thin layered film is intensively studied because of its potential applications in spintronic devices, especially devices based on spin-transfer torque phenomena. Hitherto, it has been shown that CoFeB may possess perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) when it is sandwiched between different layers (e.g. MgO, Pt, Pd, Ta, W). However, there is no experimental evidence that CoFeB, sandwiched between Au layers, has strong PMA. Moreover, in comparison with other noble metals, Au-based film systems exhibit the smallest spin pumping effect, which provides the main contribution to the damping in thin films in contact with heavy metals. Therefore, Au/CoFeB/Au may be a good candidate for future applications, where perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and low damping are required. Here, we show that PMA and low damping can be achieved in a Au/CoFeB/Au system without annealing.",3
MoS2-supported gold nanoparticle for CO hydrogenation.,"Employing dispersion-corrected density functional theory, we examine the geometry, electronic structure, and reactivity of 13-atom Au nanoparticle supported on defect-laden single-layer MoS2. The planar structure of Au13 favored in isolated phase, transforms into the three-dimensional structure when supported on MoS2. We find that charge is transferred from MoS2 to Au13, and that the electron density is also distributed away from the Au13/MoS2 interfacial region-making Au sites away from the interface catalytically active. Owing to effect of the support, the Au d states become narrower, and the frontier states appear close to the Fermi level. Consequently, in contrast to the reactivity of Au13/TiO2 toward methanol decomposition, Au13/MoS2 offers excellent activity toward methanol synthesis, as demonstrated here, via CO hydrogenation.",3
Skew scattering dominated anomalous Hall effect in Co x (MgO)100-x granular thin films.,"We investigated the mechanism(s) of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in magnetic granular materials by fabricating 100 nm-thick thin films of Co x (MgO)100-x with a Co volume fraction of 34 x 100 using co-sputtering at room temperature. We measured the temperature dependence of longitudinal resistivity ([Formula: see text]) and anomalous Hall resistivity ([Formula: see text]) from 5 K to 300 K in all samples. We found that when x decreases from 100 to 34, the values of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] respectively increased by about four and three orders in magnitude. By linearly fitting the data, obtained at 5 K, of anomalous Hall coefficient ([Formula: see text]) and of [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text], we found that our results perfectly fell on a straight line with a slope of [Formula: see text] 0.97 +/- 0.02. This fitting value of [Formula: see text] in [Formula: see text] clearly suggests that skew scattering dominated the AHE in this granular system. To explore the effect of the scattering on the AHE, we performed the same measurements on annealed samples. We found that although both [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] significantly reduced after annealing, the correlation between them was almost the same, which was confirmed by the fitted value, [Formula: see text] = 0.99 +/- 0.03. These data strongly suggest that the AHE originates from the skew scattering in Co-MgO granular thin films no matter how strong the scattering of electrons by the interfaces and defects is. This observation may be of importance to the development of spintronic devices based on MgO.",3
"Manifestation of hopping conductivity and granularity within phase diagrams of LaO1-x F x BiS2, Sr1-x La x FBiS2 and related BiS2-based compounds.","Layered BiS [Formula: see text] -based series, such as LaO [Formula: see text] F [Formula: see text] BiS [Formula: see text] and Sr [Formula: see text] La [Formula: see text] FBiS [Formula: see text] , offer ideal examples for studying normal and superconducting phase diagram of a solid solution that evolves from a nonmagnetic band-insulator parent. We constructed typical [Formula: see text] phase diagrams of these systems based on events occurring in thermal evolution of their electrical resistivity, [Formula: see text]. Overall evolution of these diagrams can be rationalized in terms of (i) Mott-Efros-Shklovskii scenario which, within the semiconducting [Formula: see text] regime ([Formula: see text] metal-insulator transition), describes the doping influence on the thermally activated hopping conductivity. (ii) A granular metal (superconductor) scenario which, within [Formula: see text], describes the evolution of normal and superconducting properties in terms of conductance g, Coulomb charging energy E c and Josephson coupling J; their joint influence is usually captured within a [Formula: see text] phase diagram. Based on analysis of the granular character of [Formula: see text], we converted the [Formula: see text] diagrams into projected g - T diagrams which, being fundamental, allow a better understanding of evolution of various granular-related properties (in particular the hallmarks of normal-state [Formula: see text] feature and superconductor-insulator transition) and how such properties are influenced by x, pressure or heat treatment.",3
Two-terminal transport measurements with cold atoms.,"In recent years, the ability of cold atom experiments to explore condensed-matter-related questions has dramatically progressed. Transport experiments, in particular, have expanded to the point in which conductance and other transport coefficients can now be measured in a way that is directly analogous to solid-state physics, extending cold-atom-based quantum simulations into the domain of quantum electronic devices. In this topical review, we describe the transport experiments performed with cold gases in the two-terminal configuration, with an emphasis on the specific features of cold atomic gases compared to solid-state physics. We present the experimental techniques and the main experimental findings, focusing on-but not restricted to-the recent experiments performed by our group. We finally discuss the perspectives opened up by this approach, the main technical and conceptual challenges for future developments, and potential applications in quantum simulation for transport phenomena and mesoscopic physics problems.",3
High resolution SPM imaging of organic molecules with functionalized tips.,"One of the most remarkable and exciting achievements in the field of scanning probe microscopy (SPM) in the last years is the unprecedented sub-molecular resolution of both atomic and electronic structures of single molecules deposited on solid state surfaces. Despite its youth, the technique has already brought many new possibilities to perform different kinds of measurements, which cannot be accomplished by other techniques. This opens new perspectives in advanced characterization of physical and chemical processes and properties of molecular structures on surfaces. Here, we discuss the history and recent progress of the high resolution imaging with a functionalized probe by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS). We describe the mechanisms responsible for the high-resolution AFM, STM and IETS-STM contrast. The complexity of this technique requires new theoretical approaches, where a relaxation of the functionalized probe is considered. We emphasise the similarities of the mechanism driving high-resolution SPM with other imaging methods. We also summarise briefly significant achievements and progress in different branches. Finally we provide brief perspectives and remaining challenges of the further refinement of these high-resolution methods.",3
Optical response in Weyl semimetal in model with gapped Dirac phase.,"We study the optical properties of Weyl semimetal (WSM) in a model which features, in addition to the usual term describing isolated Dirac cones proportional to the Fermi velocity v F, a gap term m and a Zeeman spin-splitting term b with broken time reversal symmetry. Transport is treated within Kubo formalism and particular attention is payed to the modifications that result from a finite m and b. We consider how these modifications change when a finite residual scattering rate [Formula: see text] is included. For [Formula: see text] the A.C. conductivity as a function of photon energy [Formula: see text] continues to display the two quasilinear energy regions of the clean limit for [Formula: see text] below the onset of the second electronic band which is gapped at ([Formula: see text]). For [Formula: see text] of the order m little trace of two distinct linear energy scales remain and the optical response has evolved towards that for [Formula: see text]. Although some quantitative differences remain there are no qualitative differences. The magnitude of the D.C. conductivity [Formula: see text] at zero temperature ([Formula: see text]) and chemical potential ([Formula: see text]) is altered. While it remains proportional to [Formula: see text] it becomes inversely dependent on an effective Fermi velocity out of the Weyl nodes equal to [Formula: see text] which decreases strongly as the phase boundary between Weyl semimetal and gapped Dirac phase (GDSM) is approached at [Formula: see text]. The leading term in the approach to [Formula: see text] for finite [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] is found to be quadratic. The coefficient of these corrections tracks closely the [Formula: see text] dependence of the [Formula: see text] limit with differences largest near to the WSM-GDSM boundary.",3
Probing dimensionality using a simplified 4-probe method.,"4-probe electrical measurements have been in existence for many decades. One of the most useful aspects of the 4-probe method is that it is not only possible to find the resistivity of a sample (independently of the contact resistances), but that it is also possible to probe the dimensionality of the sample. In theory, this is straightforward to achieve by measuring the 4-probe resistance as a function of probe separation. In practice, it is challenging to move all four probes with sufficient precision over the necessary range. Here, we present an alternative approach. We demonstrate that the dimensionality of the conductive path within a sample can be directly probed using a modified 4-probe method in which an unconventional geometry is exploited; three of the probes are rigidly fixed, and the position of only one probe is changed. This allows 2D and 3D (and other) contributions the to resistivity to be readily disentangled. The required experimental instrumentation can be vastly simplified relative to traditional variable spacing 4-probe instruments.",3
Investigation of the superconducting gap structure in kappa-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu(NCS)2 and kappa-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu[N(CN)2]Br by means of thermal-conductivity measurements.,"We report temperature-dependent thermal-conductivity, kappa, measurements on the layered quasi-two-dimensional organic superconductors kappa-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu(NCS)2 and kappa-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu[N(CN)2]Br down to 160 mK. The results for kappa-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu(NCS)2 may be consistent with a nodal superconducting (SC) gap structure as indicated by a non-negligible remnant linear contribution when [Formula: see text] is extrapolated to [Formula: see text]. For kappa-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu[N(CN)2]Br, contrary to expectations, higher kappa values are observed in the superconducting regime as compared to the normal, high-field state evidencing a dominant phonon contribution to kappa in the superconducting state. The strong increase of kappa in the normal state below T c for both samples indicates strong electron-phonon scattering. Our results highlight the need for thermal-conductivity measurements performed down to significantly lower temperatures to determine the symmetry of the SC gap.",3
Non-classical behaviour of higher valence dopants in chromium (III) oxide by a Cr vacancy compensation mechanism.,"Modification of metal oxides with dopants that have a stable oxidation in their parent oxides which is higher than the host system is expected to introduce extra electrons into the material to improve carrier mobility. This is essential for applications in catalysis, SOFCs and solar energy materials. Density functional theory calculations are used to investigate the change in electronic and geometric structure of chromium (III) oxide by higher valence dopants, namely; Ce, Ti, V and Zr. For single metal doping, we find that the dopants with variable oxidation states, Ce, Ti and V, adopt a valence state of +3, while Zr dopant has a +4 oxidation state and reduces a neighbouring Cr cation. Chromium vacancy formation is greatly enhanced for all dopants, and favoured over oxygen vacancy formation. The Cr vacancies generate holes which oxidise Ce, Ti and V from +3 to +4, while also oxidising lattice oxygen sites. For Zr doping, the generated holes oxidise the reduced Cr(2+) cation back to Cr(3+) and also two lattice oxygen atoms. Three metal atoms in the bulk lattice facilitate spontaneous Cr vacancy from charge compensation. A non-classical compensation mechanism is observed for Ce, Ti and V; all three metals are oxidised from +3 to +4, which explains experimental observations that these metals have a +4 oxidation state in Cr2O3. Charge compensation of the three Zr metals proceeds by a classical higher valence doping mechanism; the three dopants reduce three Cr cations, which are subsequently charge compensated by a Cr vacancy oxidising three Cr(2+) to Cr(3+). The compensated structures are the correct ground state electronic structure for these doped systems, and used as a platform to investigate cation/anion vacancy formation. Unlike the single metal doped bulks, preference is now given for oxygen vacancy formation over Cr vacancy formation, indicating that the dopants increase the reducibility of Cr2O3 with Ce doping showing the strongest enhancement. The importance of the correct ground state in determining the formation of defects is emphasised.",3
Engineering magnetism at functional oxides interfaces: manganites and beyond.,"The family of transition metal oxides (TMOs) is a large class of magnetic materials that has been intensively studied due to the rich physics involved as well as the promising potential applications in next generation electronic devices. In TMOs, the spin, charge, orbital and lattice are strongly coupled, and significant advances have been achieved to engineer the magnetism by different routes that manipulate these degrees of freedom. The family of manganites is a model system of strongly correlated magnetic TMOs. In this review, using manganites thin films and the heterostructures in conjunction with other TMOs as model systems, we review the recent progress of engineering magnetism in TMOs. We first discuss the role of the lattice that includes the epitaxial strain and the interface structural coupling. Then we look into the role of charge, focusing on the interface charge modulation. Having demonstrated the static effects, we continue to review the research on dynamical control of magnetism by electric field. Next, we review recent advances in heterostructures comprised of high T c cuprate superconductors and manganites. Following that, we discuss the emergent magnetic phenomena at interfaces between 3d TMOs and 5d TMOs with strong spin-orbit coupling. Finally, we provide our outlook for prospective future directions.",3
Advanced carbon nanotubes functionalization.,"Similar to graphene, carbon nanotubes are materials made of pure carbon in its sp(2) form. Their extended conjugated pi-network provides them with remarkable quantum optoelectronic properties. Frustratingly, it also brings drawbacks. The pi-pi stacking interaction makes as-produced tubes bundle together, blurring all their quantum properties. Functionalization aims at modifying and protecting the tubes while hindering pi-pi stacking. Several functionalization strategies have been developed to circumvent this limitation in order for nanotubes applications to thrive. In this review, we summarize the different approaches established so far, emphasizing the balance between functionalization efficacy and the preservation of the tubes' properties. Much attention will be given to a functionalization strategy overcoming the covalent-noncovalent dichotomy and to the implementation of two advanced functionalization schemes: (a) conjugation with molecular switches, to yield hybrid nanosystems with chemo-physical properties that can be tuned in a controlled and reversible way, and; (b) plasmonic nanosystems, whose ability to concentrate and enhance the electromagnetic fields can be taken advantage of to enhance the optical response of the tubes.",3
Demagnetization harmonic effects on the magnetization of granular systems on a macroscopic scale: the superconducting case.,"A model has been developed to determine the effective ac magnetic response of magnetic systems, taking into account the demagnetization effects arising from the sample geometry which determine the out-of-phase components of the applied fundamental frequency and higher harmonic components. Indeed, demagnetization fields and their intermodulation can significantly affect the ac magnetic response. This approach provides a system of self-consistent linear equations relating the magnetic response to the external magnetic field by means of nonlinear magnetic susceptibility. The model is extended to the magnetic response of granular systems in terms of the contributions of the individual grains and of the whole sample in the presence of demagnetization effects of the whole sample and of the grains on a macroscopic scale. In particular, our model is applied to a granular superconducting system. The comparison between the performed numerical simulations and the experimental data shows that the demagnetization fields of the single grains and of the whole sample, and their intermodulation, are relevant if magnetic measurements are used to extract detailed information about the analyzed material.",3
Suppressed Kondo effect and Kosterlitz-Thouless-type phase transition induced by level difference in a triple dot device.,"Quantum dot system provides an ideal platform for quantum information processing, within which to demonstrate the quantum states is one of the most important issue for quantum simulation and quantum computation. In this paper, we report a peculiar electron state in a parallel triple dot device where the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction is invalid when the level differences of the dots sweep into appropriate regime. This extraordinary tendency then results in an antiferromagnetic spin coupling between two of the dots and may lead to zero or full conductance, relying deeply on the relation of the two level spacings. e.g. when the level differences are kept equal, the Kondo effect is totally suppressed although the dots are triply occupied, since in this case a local inter-dot transport loop is found to play an important role in the transmission coefficient. By contrast, when the differences are retained symmetric, the Kondo peak reaches nearly to its unitary limit, owing to that the inter-dot transport process is significantly suppressed. To approach these problems, voltage controllable quantum phase transitions of Kosterlitz-Thouless type and first order are shown, and possible pictures related to the many-body effect and the effective Kondo model are given.",3
"Spanning the scales of mechanical metamaterials using time domain simulations in transformed crystals, graphene flakes and structured soils.","We begin with a brief historical survey of discoveries of quasi-crystals and graphene, and then introduce the concept of transformation crystallography, which consists of the application of geometric transforms to periodic structures. We consider motifs with three-fold, four-fold and six-fold symmetries according to the crystallographic restriction theorem. Furthermore, we define motifs with five-fold symmetry such as quasi-crystals generated by a cut-and-projection method from periodic structures in higher-dimensional space. We analyze elastic wave propagation in the transformed crystals and (Penrose-type) quasi-crystals with the finite difference time domain freeware SimSonic. We consider geometric transforms underpinning the design of seismic cloaks with square, circular, elliptical and peanut shapes in the context of honeycomb crystals that can be viewed as scaled-up versions of graphene. Interestingly, the use of morphing techniques leads to the design of cloaks with interpolated geometries reminiscent of Victor Vasarely's artwork. Employing the case of transformed graphene-like (honeycomb) structures allows one to draw useful analogies between large-scale seismic metamaterials such as soils structured with columns of concrete or grout with soil and nanoscale biochemical metamaterials. We further identify similarities in designs of cloaks for elastodynamic and hydrodynamic waves and cloaks for diffusion (heat or mass) processes, as these are underpinned by geometric transforms. Experimental data extracted from field test analysis of soil structured with boreholes demonstrates the application of crystallography to large scale phononic crystals, coined as seismic metamaterials, as they might exhibit low frequency stop bands. This brings us to the outlook of mechanical metamaterials, with control of phonon emission in graphene through extreme anisotropy, attenuation of vibrations of suspension bridges via low frequency stop bands and the concept of transformed meta-cities. We conclude that these novel materials hold strong applications spanning different disciplines or across different scales from biophysics to geophysics.",3
Dynamics and heat diffusion of Abrikosov's vortex-antivortex pairs during an annihilation process.,"The manipulation and control of vortex states in superconducting systems are of great interest in view of possible applications, for which mesoscopic materials are good candidates. In this work, we studied the annihilation dynamics and the dissipative aspects of an Abrikosov's vortex-antivortex pair in a mesoscopic superconducting system with a concentric hole. The generalized time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations were numerically solved. The main result is the appearance of a phase slip-like line due to the elongation of the vortex and antivortex cores. Under specific circumstances, thermal dissipation might be associated with a sizeable relaxation of the order parameter, so that the energy released in the annihilation of a vortex-antivortex pair might become detectable in measurements of the magnetization as a function of time.",3
Polar phase transitions in heteroepitaxial stabilized La0.5Y0.5AlO3 thin films.,"We report on the fabrication of epitaxial La0.5Y0.5AlO3 ultrathin films on (001) LaAlO3 substrates. Structural characterizations by scanning transmission electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction confirm the high quality of the film with a (-) b (+) c (-) AlO6 octahedral tilt pattern. Unlike either of the nonpolar parent compound, LaAlO3 and YAlO3, second harmonic generation measurements on the thin films suggest a nonpolar-polar phase transition at T c near 500 K, and a polar-polar phase transition at T a near 160 K. By fitting the angular dependence of the second harmonic intensities, we further propose that the two polar structures can be assigned to the Pmc2 1 and Pmn2 1 space group, while the high temperature nonpolar structure belongs to the Pbnm space group.",3
Cluster assembly route to a novel octagonal two-dimensional ZnO monolayer.,"To explore the possibility of cluster assembly resulting in a two-dimensional (2D) stable monolayer of ZnO, a systematic study is performed on the structural evolution of bare and passivated stoichiometric clusters of [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], using density-functional-theory-based first principles electronic structure calculations. The changes in hybridization are investigated with the aid of the site-projected partial density of states and partial charge density, while the effect of passivation and size on the ionicity of the cluster is studied using Bader charge analysis. The structural and chemical properties are found to be influenced by the coordination number of atoms in the clusters irrespective of the coordinating species. The physical parameters and hybridization of the states for the clusters on passivation resemble those of the bulk. Passivation thus provides an environment that leads to the stability of the clusters. Cluster assembly using the stable cluster geometries of passivated clusters (without the passivating atoms) has been shown to lead to stable 2D structures. This stability has been studied on the basis of binding energy, vibrational frequency, phonon dispersion and thermal properties. A new octagonal 2D monolayer planar geometry of ZnO is predicted.",3
Intrinsic plasmarons in warm graphene.,"Based on a self-consistent method, we predict theoretically that there exist intrinsic plasmarons in graphene at nonzero temperature, with a well defined mode, as shown by the result of Landau damping. We find that there are sharp differences between the discussed system and the QCD/QED system. Firstly, the thermal mass is proportional to [Formula: see text] but not [Formula: see text]. Secondly, at [Formula: see text], the fermion channel and plasmaron channel are nearly degenerate, and furthermore the energy difference between fermion and plasmaron becomes larger and larger with increasing q in the region [Formula: see text]. Thirdly, the fermion behaves as a 'relativistic particle' with nonzero mass, and the plasmaron exhibits an abnormal dispersion at moderate momentum.",3
Quantum transport across van der Waals domain walls in bilayer graphene.,"Bilayer graphene can exhibit deformations such that the two graphene sheets are locally detached from each other resulting in a structure consisting of domains with different van der Waals inter-layer coupling. Here we investigate how the presence of these domains affects the transport properties of bilayer graphene. We derive analytical expressions for the transmission probability, and the corresponding conductance, across walls separating different inter-layer coupling domains. We find that the transmission can exhibit a valley-dependent layer asymmetry and that the domain walls have a considerable effect on the chiral tunnelling properties of the charge carriers. We show that transport measurements allow one to obtain the strength with which the two layers are coupled. We perform numerical calculations for systems with two domain walls and find that the availability of multiple transport channels in bilayer graphene significantly modifies the conductance dependence on inter-layer potential asymmetry.",3
Tunable indirect-direct transition of few-layer SnSe via interface engineering.,"Tin selenide (SnSe) is one of the best thermoelectric materials reported to date. The possibility of growing few-layer SnSe helped boost the interest in this long-known, earth abundant material. Pristine SnSe in bulk, mono- and few-layer forms are reported to have indirect electronic bandgaps. Possible indirect-direct transition in SnSe is attractive for its optoelectronic-related applications. Based on the results from first principles density functional theory calculations, we carefully analyzed electronic band structures of bulk, and bilayer SnSe with various interlayer stackings. We report the possible stacking-dependent indirect-direct transition of bilayer SnSe. By further analysis, our results reveal that it is the directionality of interlayer interactions that determine the critical features of their electronic band structures. In fact, by engineering the interface stacking between layers, it is possible to achieve few-layer SnSe with direct electronic band gap. This study provides fundamental insights to design few-layer SnSe and SnSe heterostructures for electronic/optoelectronic applications, where the interface geometry plays a fundamental role in device performance.",3
Polymer models with optimal good-solvent behavior.,"We consider three different continuum polymer models, which all depend on a tunable parameter r that determines the strength of the excluded-volume interactions. In the first model, chains are obtained by concatenating hard spherocylinders of height b and diameter rb (we call them thick self-avoiding chains). The other two models are generalizations of the tangent hard-sphere and of the Kremer-Grest models. We show that for a specific value [Formula: see text], all models show optimal behavior: asymptotic long-chain behavior is observed for relatively short chains. For [Formula: see text], instead, the behavior can be parametrized by using the two-parameter model, which also describes the thermal crossover close to the theta point. The bonds of the thick self-avoiding chains cannot cross each other, and therefore the model is suited for the investigation of topological properties and for dynamical studies. Such a model also provides a coarse-grained description of double-stranded DNA, so that we can use our results to discuss under which conditions DNA can be considered as a model good-solvent polymer.",3
"Direct AFM observation of individual micelles, tile decorations and tiling rules of a dodecagonal liquid quasicrystal.","We performed an atomic force microscopy study of the dendron-based dodecagonal quasicrystal, the material that had been reported in 2004 as the first soft quasicrystal. We succeeded in orienting the 12-fold axis perpendicular to the substrate, which allowed the imaging of the quasiperiodic xy plane. Thus for the first time we have been able to obtain direct real-space information not only on the arrangement of the tiles, but also on their 'decorations' by the individual spherical micelles or 'nanoatoms'. The high-resolution patterns recorded confirm the square-triangle tiling, but the abundance of different nodes corresponds closely to random tiling rather than to any inflation rule. The previously proposed model of three types of decorated tiles, two triangular and one square, has been confirmed; the basic Frank-Kasper mode of alternating dense-sparse-dense-sparse layer stacking along z is confirmed too, each of the four sublayers being 2 nm thick. The consecutive dense layers are seen to be rotated by 90 degrees , as expected. The 2 nm steps on the surface correspond to one layer of spheres, nonetheless with a dense layer always remaining on top, which implies a layer slip underneath and possibly the existence of screw dislocations.",3
Local integrals of motion in the two-site Anderson-Hubbard model.,"It has been proposed that the states of fully many-body localized systems can be described in terms of conserved local pseudospins. Due to the multitude of ways to define these, the explicit identification of the optimally local pseudospins in specific systems is non-trivial. Given continuing intense interest in the role of disorder in strongly correlated systems, we consider the disordered Hubbard model. By studying a small system we provide concrete examples of the form of local integrals of motion in the Anderson-Hubbard model. Moreover, we are able not only to identify the most local choice but also to explore the nature of the distribution of possible choices. We track the evolution of the optimally localized pseudospins as hopping and interactions are varied to move the system away from the trivially localized atomic limit.",3
LiNbO3 surfaces from a microscopic perspective.,"A large number of oxides has been investigated in the last twenty years as possible new materials for various applications ranging from opto-electronics to heterogeneous catalysis. In this context, ferroelectric oxides are particularly promising. The electric polarization plays a crucial role at many oxide surfaces, and it largely determines their physical and chemical properties. Ferroelectrics offer in addition the possibility to control/switch the electric polarization and hence the surface chemistry, allowing for the realization of domain-engineered nanoscale devices such as molecular detectors or highly efficient catalysts. Lithium niobate (LiNbO3) is a ferroelectric with a high spontaneous polarization, whose surfaces have a huge and largely unexplored potential. Owing to recent advances in experimental techniques and sample preparation, peculiar and exclusive properties of LiNbO3 surfaces could be demonstrated. For example, water films freeze at different temperatures on differently polarized surfaces, and the chemical etching properties of surfaces with opposite polarization are strongly different. More important, the ferroelectric domain orientation affects temperature dependent surface stabilization mechanisms and molecular adsorption phenomena. Various ab initio theoretical investigations have been performed in order to understand the outcome of these experiments and the origin of the exotic behavior of the lithium niobate surfaces. Thanks to these studies, many aspects of their surface physics and chemistry could be clarified. Yet other puzzling features are still not understood. This review gives a resume on the present knowledge of lithium niobate surfaces, with a particular view on their microscopic properties, explored in recent years by means of ab initio calculations. Relevant aspects and properties of the surfaces that need further investigation are briefly discussed. The review is concluded with an outlook of challenges and potential payoff for LiNbO3 based applications.",3
High-performance electronic transport in the plane of 3D type-II Dirac semimetals.,"Recently, the type-II Dirac fermion, a new topological state, has been proposed in the Al3V family. It breaks Lorentz symmetry and has unique physical properties. We use first-principles calculations to investigate electronic transport limited by phonon scattering. The electronic resistivity in the xy plane is estimated to be 24.1 [Formula: see text] cm for Al3V and is much lower than that along the z direction. The heavy electronic effective mass along the z direction and the main electron-phonon coupling, originating from the phonon modes vibrating along the z direction, lead to anisotropic electronic transport, which is also found in other members of the Al3V family.",3
Separation of atomic-scale spin contrast on NiO(0 0 1) by magnetic resonance force microscopy.,"In magnetic exchange force microscopy, images contain the topographic contrast mixed with the spin contrast on the sample surface. In this study, we propose a new method of magnetic resonance force microscopy using ferromagnetic resonance to extract only the spin contrast. In this method, the magnetization of a magnetic cantilever is modulated by ferromagnetic resonance to separate the spin contrast and topographic contrast. We succeeded in obtaining a spin image of Ni atoms on a NiO (0 0 1) surface. Furthermore, we successfully detected the superexchange interaction between the tip apex atom and the second layer of Ni atoms.",3
"Magnetic properties of monoclinic lanthanide metaborates, Ln(BO2)3, Ln = Pr, Nd, Gd, Tb.","The bulk magnetic properties of the lanthanide metaborates, Ln(BO2)3, Ln = Pr, Nd, Gd, Tb are studied using magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity and isothermal magnetisation measurements. They are found to crystallise in a monoclinic structure containing chains of magnetic Ln (3+) and could therefore exhibit features of low-dimensional magnetism and frustration. Pr(BO2)3 is found to have a non-magnetic singlet ground state. No magnetic ordering is observed down to 0.4 K for Nd(BO2)3. Gd(BO2)3 exhibits a sharp magnetic transition at 1.1 K, corresponding to 3D magnetic ordering. Tb(BO2)3 shows two magnetic ordering features at 1.05 K and 1.95 K. A magnetisation plateau at a third of the saturation magnetisation is seen at 2 K for both Nd(BO2)3 and Tb(BO2)3, which persists in an applied field of 14 T. This is proposed to be a signature of quasi 1D behaviour in Nd(BO2)3 and Tb(BO2)3.",3
Correspondence between the electronic structure and phase separation in a K-doped FeSe system.,"Phase separated potassium intercalated FeSe thin films have been synthesized by pulsed laser deposition. The coexistence of FeSe phase and 245 phase was investigated both by x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and x-ray diffraction. The volume ratio of these two phases is sensitive to temperatures and amount of extra potassium dosing. The XPS and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy results indicated that these two phases shows the different hybridization strength between adjacent Fe layer and Se layer. We infer that the layered electronic structure is the necessary condition of superconductivity in potassium-doped FeSe system, and the phase separation is driven by competition between quasi-2D and 3D bonding mode within FeSe layer. Similar competition may also be able to interpret the phase seperation in K x Fe2-y Se2 bulk single crystal.",3
Canonical-ensemble extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics for the linear scaling density functional theory.,"We discuss the development and implementation of a constant temperature (NVT) molecular dynamics scheme that combines the Nose-Hoover chain thermostat with the extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) scheme, using a linear scaling density functional theory (DFT) approach. An integration scheme for this canonical-ensemble extended Lagrangian BOMD is developed and discussed in the context of the Liouville operator formulation. Linear scaling DFT canonical-ensemble extended Lagrangian BOMD simulations are tested on bulk silicon and silicon carbide systems to evaluate our integration scheme. The results show that the conserved quantity remains stable with no systematic drift even in the presence of the thermostat.",3
"Sensitivity of magnetic properties to chemical pressure in lanthanide garnets Ln 3 A 2 X 3O12, Ln = Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, A = Ga, Sc, In, Te, X = Ga, Al, Li.","A systematic study of the structural and magnetic properties of three-dimensionally frustrated lanthanide garnets Ln 3 A 2 X 3O12, Ln = Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, A = Ga, Sc, In, Te, X = Ga, Al, Li is presented. Garnets with Ln = Gd show magnetic behaviour consistent with isotropic Gd(3+) spins; no magnetic ordering is observed for T 0.4 K. Magnetic ordering features are seen for garnets with Ln = Tb, Dy, Ho in the temperature range 0.4 < T < 2.5 K, however the nature of the magnetic ordering varies for the different Ln as well as for different combinations of A and X. The magnetic behaviour can be explained by tuning of the magnetic interactions and changes in the single-ion anisotropy. The change in magnetic entropy is evaluated from isothermal magnetisation measurements to characterise the magnetocaloric effect in these materials. Among the Gd garnets, the maximum change in magnetic entropy per mole (15.45 J K(-1) [Formula: see text]) is observed for Gd3Sc2Ga3O12 at 2 K, in a field of 9 T. The performance of Dy3Ga5O12 as a magnetocaloric material surpasses the other garnets with Ln = Tb, Dy, Ho.",3
The influence of surface potential on the optical switching of spiropyran self assembled monolayers.,"Surfaces whose macroscopic properties can be switched by light are potentially useful in a wide variety of applications. One such promising application is electrochemical sensors that can be gated by optically switching the electrode on or off. One way to make such a switchable electrode is by depositing a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of bistable, optically switchable molecules onto an electrode surface. Quantitative application of any such sensor requires understanding how changes in interfacial field affect the composition of photostationary states, i.e. how does electrode potential affect the extent to which the electrode is on or off when irradiated, and the structure of the SAM. Here we address these questions for a SAM of a 6-nitro-substituted spiro[2H-1-benzopyran-2,2'-indoline] covalently attached through a dithiolane linker to an Au electrode immersed in a 0.1 M solution of Tetramethylammonium hexafluorophosphate in Acetonitrile using interface-specific vibrational spectroscopy. We find that in the absence of irradiation, when the SAM is dominated by the closed spiropyran form, variations in potential of 1 V have little effect on spiropyran relative stability. In contrast, under UV irradiation small changes in potential can have dramatic effects: changes in potential of 0.2 V can completely destabilize the open merocyanine form of the SAM relative to the spiropyran and dramatically change the chromophore orientation. Quantitatively accounting for these effects is necessary to employ this, or any other optically switchable bistable chromophore, in electrochemical applications.",3
Terahertz magnetoplasmon-polaritons with nonlocal corrections for lossy two dimensional electron gas in GaN-based heterostructures.,"The high electron concentration in GaN-based heterostructures necessitate the consideration of nonlocal corrections in the magnetoconductivity for the study of magnetoplasmon-polaritons (MPPs) in the lossy two dimensional electron gas system with grating couplers. With the complete set of Maxwell equations, the complex dispersion frequency and absorption spectrum are calculated numerically at different magnetic field (B max = 10 T) and plasmon wavevectors (k max = 5 x 10(7) m(-1)). Taking the AlGaN/GaN structure as a representative case, we observe the cyclotron resonance and its high order harmonics, as well as the MPP modes. The effective aspect ratio of the grating is determined according to the absorption spectrum. Effects of the nonlocal corrections on the dispersion frequency and absorption spectrum are analyzed in detail. The contributions of LO phonons, electron collisions, THz wave polarizations and retardations are also discussed.",3
Compressed H3S: inter-sublattice Coulomb coupling in a high-T C superconductor.,"Upon thermal annealing at or above room temperature (RT) and at high hydrostatic pressure P ~ 155 GPa, sulfur trihydride H3S exhibits a measured maximum superconducting transition temperature T C ~ 200 K. Various theoretical frameworks incorporating strong electron-phonon coupling and Coulomb repulsion have reproduced this record-level T C. Of particular relevance is that experimentally observed H-D isotopic correlations among T C, P, and annealed order indicate an H-D isotope effect exponent alpha limited to values 0.183, leaving open for consideration unconventional high-T C superconductivity with electronic-based enhancements. The work presented herein examines Coulombic pairing arising from interactions between neighboring S and H species on separate interlaced sublattices constituting H3S in the Im[Formula: see text]m structure. The optimal value of the transition temperature is calculated from T C0 = [Formula: see text]Lambdae (2)/[Formula: see text] zeta, with Lambda = 0.007465 A, inter-sublattice S-H separation spacing zeta = a 0/[Formula: see text], interaction charge linear spacing [Formula: see text] = a 0 (3/sigma)(1/2), average participating charge fraction sigma = 3.43 +/- 0.10 estimated from calculated H-projected electron states, and lattice parameter a 0 = 3.0823 A at P = 155 GPa. The resulting value of T C0 = 198.5 +/- 3.0 K is in excellent agreement with transition temperatures determined from resistivity (196-200 K onsets, 190-197 K midpoints), susceptibility (200 K onset), and critical magnetic fields (203.5 K by extrapolation). Analysis of mid-infrared reflectivity data confirms the expected correlation between boson energy and zeta (-1). Suppression of T C below T C0, correlating with increasing residual resistance for < RT annealing, is treated in terms of scattering-induced pair breaking. Correspondences between H3S and layered high-T C superconductor structures are also discussed, and a model considering Compton scattering of virtual photons of energies e (2)/zeta by inter-sublattice electrons is introduced, illustrating that Lambda proportional, variant C, where C is the reduced electron Compton wavelength.",3
Spin-dependent Seebeck effects in a graphene superlattice p-n junction with different shapes.,"We theoretically calculate the spin-dependent transmission probability and spin Seebeck coefficient for a zigzag-edge graphene nanoribbon p-n junction with periodically attached stubs under a perpendicular magnetic field and a ferromagnetic insulator. By using the nonequilibrium Green's function method combining with the tight-binding Hamiltonian, it is demonstrated that the spin-dependent transmission probability and spin Seebeck coefficient for two types of superlattices can be modulated by the potential drop, the magnetization strength, the number of periods of the superlattice, the strength of the perpendicular magnetic field, and the Anderson disorder strength. Interestingly, a metal to semiconductor transition occurs as the number of the superlattice for a crossed superlattice p-n junction increases, and its spin Seebeck coefficient is much larger than that for the T-shaped one around the zero Fermi energy. Furthermore, the spin Seebeck coefficient for crossed systems can be much pronounced and their maximum absolute value can reach 528 muV [Formula: see text] by choosing optimized parameters. Besides, the spin Seebeck coefficient for crossed p-n junction is strongly enhanced around the zero Fermi energy for a weak magnetic field. Our results provide theoretical references for modulating the thermoelectric properties of a graphene superlattice p-n junction by tuning its geometric structure and physical parameters.",3
"A comprehensive study of piezomagnetic response in CrPS4 monolayer: mechanical, electronic properties and magnetic ordering under strains.","We performed first-principles calculations to investigate the magnetic, mechanical and electronic properties of the tetrachalcogenide CrPS4. Although bulk CrPS4 has been shown to exhibit a low-dimensional antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state where ferromagnetic (FM) Cr-chains are coupled antiferromagnetically, our calculations indicated that the monolayer can be transformed to an FM material by applying a uniaxial tensile strain of 4% along the FM Cr-chain direction. The AFM-to-FM transition is explained to be driven by an increase of the exchange interaction induced by a decrease in the distance between the FM Cr-chains. A huge nonlinear piezomagnetism was predicted at the strain-induced magnetic phase boundary. Our study provides insight about rational design of single-layer magnetic materials for a wide range of spintronic devices and energy applications.",3
On the performance of natural orbital functional approximations in the Hubbard model.,"Strongly correlated materials are now under intense development, and natural orbital functional (NOF) methods seem to be able to capture the physics of these systems. We present a benchmark based on the Hubbard model for a class of commonly used NOF approximations (also known as reduced density matrix functional approximations). Our findings highlight the importance of imposing ensemble N-representability conditions in order to obtain consistent results in systems with either weak or strong electronic correlation, such as the Hubbard system with a varying two-particle interaction parameter. Based on the accuracy of the results obtained using PNOF7, which retrieves a large amount of the total strong nondynamic correlation, the Hubbard model points out that N-representability gives solid foundations for NOF development.",3
Valley precession and valley polarization in graphene with inter-valley coupling.,"We theoretically investigate the valley precession and valley polarization in graphene under inter-valley coupling. Our results show that the inter-valley coupling can induce valley polarization in graphene and also precess valleys in real space in a manner similar to the Rashba spin-orbit interaction rotating spins. Moreover, using strain modulation, we can achieve high valley polarization with large valley-polarized currents. These findings provide a new way to create and manipulate valley polarization in graphene.",3
"Stability, electronic and phononic properties of beta and 1T structures of SiTe x (x = 1, 2) and their vertical heterostructures.","By performing first-principles calculations, we predict a novel, stable single layer phase of silicon ditelluride, 1T-[Formula: see text], and its possible vertical heterostructures with single layer beta-SiTe. Structural optimization and phonon calculations reveal that 1T-[Formula: see text] structure has a dynamically stable ground state. Further analysis of the vibrational spectrum at the [Formula: see text] point shows that single layer 1T-[Formula: see text] has characteristic phonon modes at 80, 149, 191 and 294 [Formula: see text]. Electronic-band structure demonstrates that 1T-[Formula: see text] phase exhibits a nonmagnetic metallic ground state with a negligible intrinsic spin-orbit splitting. Moreover, it is shown that similar structural parameters of 1T-[Formula: see text] and existing beta-SiTe phases allows construction of 1T-beta heterostructures with a negligible lattice mismatch. In this regard, it is found that two energetically favorable stacking orders, namely AA and [Formula: see text]B, have distinctive shear and layer breathing phonon modes. It is important to note that the combination of semiconducting beta-SiTe and metallic 1T-[Formula: see text] building blocks forms ultra-thin Schottky barriers that can be used in nanoscale optoelectronic device technologies.",3
Tailoring of magnetic orderings in Fe substituted GdMnO3 bulk samples towards room temperature.,"The evolution of various magnetic ordering has been studied for the orthorhombic perovskite GdMn1-x Fe x O3 (0 x 0.7) system to obtain its comprehensive magnetic phase diagram. We observed that the substitution of Fe in GdMnO3 increases the antiferromagnetic Neel temperature (T N) from 40 K to above 400 K and importantly induces a spin-reorientation transition (T SR) for x 0.4. These transitions are close to room temperature at x = 0.5 and then gradually separated at a higher x value. The static orbital ordering induced by the Jahn-Teller distortion seems to play an important role in changing the T N. The variations of spin-reorientation ordering along with the competition between the magnetic orderings as a function of the composition were discussed with respect to antisymmetric exchange interactions and Mn(3+) single-ion anisotropy in detail. In addition, the correlation between structural and magnetic properties suggests that the subtle structural change at composition x = 0.4 may affect the magnetic ordering. The observed tunable T SR and T N in GdMn1-x Fe x O3 could add a practical value for these compositions in fields like spintronics and sensors.",3
Substitutional carbon doping of free-standing and Ru-supported BN sheets: a first-principles study.,"The development of spatially homogeneous mixed structures with boron (B), nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice is highly desirable, as they open the possibility of creating stable two-dimensional materials with tunable band gaps. However, at least in the free-standing form, the mixed BCN system is energetically driven towards phase segregation to graphene and hexagonal BN. It is possible to overcome the segregation when BCN material is grown on a particular metal substrate, for example Ru(0 0 0 1), but the stabilization mechanism is still unknown. With the use of density-functional theory we study the energetics of BN/Ru slabs, with different types of configurations of C substitutional defects introduced to the h-BN overlayer. The results are compared to the energetics of free-standing BCN materials. We found that the substrate facilitates the C substitution process in the h-BN overlayer. Thus, more homogeneous BCN material can be grown, overcoming the segregation into graphene and h-BN. In addition, we investigate the electronic and transport gaps in free-standing BCN structures, and assess their mechanical properties and stability. The band gap in mixed BCN free-standing material depends on the concentration of the constituent elements and ranges from zero in pristine graphene to nearly 5 eV in free-standing h-BN. This makes BCN attractive for application in modern electronics.",3
Hybridization effects on wave packet dynamics in topological insulator thin films.,"Theoretical study of electron wave packet dynamics in topological insulator (TI) thin films is presented. We have investigated real space trajectories and spin dynamics of electron wave packets in TI thin films. Our focus is on the role of hybridization between the electronic states of the two surfaces. This allows us to access the crossover regime of a thick film with no hybridization to a thin film with finite hybridization. We show that the electron wave packet undergoes side-jump motion in addition to zitterbewegung. The oscillation frequency of zitterbewegung can be tuned by the strength of hybridization, which in turn can be tuned by the thickness of the film. We find that the spin expectations also exhibit zitterbewegung tunable by hybridization. We also show that it is possible to obtain persistent zitterbewegung, oscillations which do not decay, in both the real space trajectories as well as spin dynamics. The zitterbewegung oscillation frequency in TI thin films falls in a parameter regime where it might be possible to observe these effects using present day experimental techniques.",3
Comparative analysis on resistance profiling along tapered semiconductor nanowires: multi-tip technique versus transmission line method.,"The detection of doping dependent values like contact- and path resistances along nanowires (NWs) still proves to be rather challenging compared to planar structures. Unfortunately, the usually used and well established TLM (transmission line measurement) setup exhibits some drawbacks. Complex preliminary preparation steps and the necessity of ohmic contacts limit the investigation to certain semiconductor materials. The simultaneous determination of contact- and path resistances with an unknown distribution makes an analysis on complex structures like tapered nanowires very challenging. Our approach is the utilization of a multi-tip scanning tunneling microscope (MT-STM) as a four point prober, which allows the investigation of freestanding nanowires with an increased spatial resolution. Here, the used measurement setup allows a local separation of current injection and potential measurement and thus a highly precise determination of path resistances. Tapered p-doped GaAs-NWs were used to compare both techniques. Whereas the evaluation of the axial doping profile by MT-STM was rather simple, correction factors had to be introduced for the TLM measurement to calculate the specific resistances and transfer length. By comparing the results of both methods for the very same NW-sample, the precision and accuracy of MT-STM measurements was demonstrated. We found an agreement, which allows the conclusion that both methods exhibit advantages; however the MT-STM was determined as the more precise setup, which enables additional characterization capabilities, such as surface, temperature or light dependent measurements.",3
"Magnetic behavior of metallic kagome lattices, Tb3Ru4Al12 and Er3Ru4Al12.","We report the magnetic behavior of two intermetallic-based kagome lattices, Tb3Ru4Al12 and Er3Ru4Al12, crystallizing in the Gd3Ru4Al2-type hexagonal crystal structure, by measurements in the range 1.8-300 K with bulk experimental techniques (ac and dc magnetization, heat capacity, and magnetoresistance). The main finding is that the Tb compound, known to order antiferromagnetically below (T N =) 22 K, shows glassy characteristics at lower temperatures ([Formula: see text]15 K), thus characterizing this compound as a re-entrant spin-glass. The data reveal that the glassy phase is quite complex and is of a cluster type. Since glassy behavior was not seen for the Gd analog in the past literature, this finding on the Tb compound emphasizes that this kagome family could provide an opportunity to explore the role of higher-order interactions (such as quadrupole) in bringing out magnetic frustration. Additional findings reported here for this compound are: (i) The plots of temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistivity data in the range 12-20 K, just below T N , are found to be hysteretic leading to a magnetic phase in this intermediate temperature range, mimicking disorder-broadened first-order magnetic phase transitions; (ii) features attributable to an interesting magnetic phase co-existence phenomenon in the isothermal magnetoresistance in zero field, after travelling across metamagnetic transition fields, are observed. With respect to the Er compound, we do not find any evidence for long-range magnetic ordering down to 2 K, but this compound appears to be on the verge of magnetic order at 2 K.",3
Non-contact lateral force microscopy.,"The goal of atomic force microscopy (AFM) is to measure the short-range forces that act between the tip and the surface. The signal recorded, however, includes long-range forces that are often an unwanted background. Lateral force microscopy (LFM) is a branch of AFM in which a component of force perpendicular to the surface normal is measured. If we consider the interaction between tip and sample in terms of forces, which have both direction and magnitude, then we can make a very simple yet profound observation: over a flat surface, long-range forces that do not yield topographic contrast have no lateral component. Short-range interactions, on the other hand, do. Although contact-mode is the most common LFM technique, true non-contact AFM techniques can be applied to perform LFM without the tip depressing upon the sample. Non-contact lateral force microscopy (nc-LFM) is therefore ideal to study short-range forces of interest. One of the first applications of nc-LFM was the study of non-contact friction. A similar setup is used in magnetic resonance force microscopy to detect spin flipping. More recently, nc-LFM has been used as a true microscopy technique to systems unsuitable for normal force microscopy.",3
Oscillatory deviations from Matthiessen's rule due to interacting dislocations.,"We theoretically examine the validity of Matthiessen's rule caused by strong dislocation-dislocation interaction using a fully quantized dislocation field, where its degree of deviation is quantified at arbitrary electron energy, dislocation-electron and dislocation-dislocation distances and interaction strengths. Contrary to intuition, we show that the electron relaxation rate deviates from the Matthiessen's rule in an oscillatory way as a function of inter-dislocation distance, instead of monotonically. In addition, we show quantitatively that the deviation is larger in a material with lower mass density, higher Poisson ratio and higher elastic moduli. This study could serve as a computational tool to investigate the electronic behavior of a highly-dislocated system at a full quantum field theoretical level.",3
Homogeneous crystal nucleation in polymers.,"The pathway of crystal nucleation significantly influences the structure and properties of semi-crystalline polymers. Crystal nucleation is normally heterogeneous at low supercooling, and homogeneous at high supercooling, of the polymer melt. Homogeneous nucleation in bulk polymers has been, so far, hardly accessible experimentally, and was even doubted to occur at all. This topical review summarizes experimental findings on homogeneous crystal nucleation in polymers. Recently developed fast scanning calorimetry, with cooling and heating rates up to 10(6) K s(-1), allows for detailed investigations of nucleation near and even below the glass transition temperature, including analysis of nuclei stability. As for other materials, the maximum homogeneous nucleation rate for polymers is located close to the glass transition temperature. In the experiments discussed here, it is shown that polymer nucleation is homogeneous at such temperatures. Homogeneous nucleation in polymers is discussed in the framework of the classical nucleation theory. The majority of our observations are consistent with the theory. The discrepancies may guide further research, particularly experiments to progress theoretical development. Progress in the understanding of homogeneous nucleation is much needed, since most of the modelling approaches dealing with polymer crystallization exclusively consider homogeneous nucleation. This is also the basis for advancing theoretical approaches to the much more complex phenomena governing heterogeneous nucleation.",3
Experimental realization and characterization of an electronic Lieb lattice.,"Geometry, whether on the atomic or nanoscale, is a key factor for the electronic band structure of materials. Some specific geometries give rise to novel and potentially useful electronic bands. For example, a honeycomb lattice leads to Dirac-type bands where the charge carriers behave as massless particles [1]. Theoretical predictions are triggering the exploration of novel 2D geometries [2-10], such as graphynes, Kagome and the Lieb lattice. The latter is the 2D analogue of the 3D lattice exhibited by perovskites [2]; it is a square-depleted lattice, which is characterised by a band structure featuring Dirac cones intersected by a flat band. Whereas photonic and cold-atom Lieb lattices have been demonstrated [11-17], an electronic equivalent in 2D is difficult to realize in an existing material. Here, we report an electronic Lieb lattice formed by the surface state electrons of Cu(111) confined by an array of CO molecules positioned with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). Using scanning tunneling microscopy, spectroscopy and wave-function mapping, we confirm the predicted characteristic electronic structure of the Lieb lattice. The experimental findings are corroborated by muffin-tin and tight-binding calculations. At higher energies, second-order electronic patterns are observed, which are equivalent to a super-Lieb lattice.",3
Effective spin Hamiltonian of a gated triple quantum dot in the presence of spin-orbit interaction.,"We derive and study the effective spin Hamiltonian of a gated triple quantum dot that includes the effects of spin-orbit interaction and an external magnetic field. In the analysis of the resulting spin interaction in linear and in general triangular geometry of the dots, we show that the pairwise spin interaction does depend on the position of the third dot. The spin-orbit induced anisotropy, in addition to changing its strength, also changes its symmetry with the motion of the third quantum dot outside the linear arrangement. Our results present a simplified model that may be used in the design of quantum computers based on three-spin qubits.",3
Properties of the antiferromagnetic selenite MnSeO3 and its non-magnetic analogue ZnSnO3 from first principles calculations.,"We report the properties of the antiferromagnetic selenite MnSeO3 and the non-magnetic analogue ZnSeO3, based on first principles calculations. These compounds are rare examples of ABO3 perovskites with a tetravalent A-site and a divalent B-site. The electronic structure is discussed in the context of the bonding and crystal structure. There is cross-gap hybridization between the O p states that form the valence bands of these compounds and the unoccupied p states of Se, reflecting the lone pair physics that leads to the strong off-centering of Se from the perovskite A-site. The G-type antiferromagnetism of MnSeO3 is a local moment in nature arising from high spin [Formula: see text] with short range interactions. Additionally, there is an interesting spin-dependent hybridization of Mn d and O p states analogous to that in colossal magnetoresistance manganites.",3
Pump-probe STM light emission spectroscopy for detection of photo-induced semiconductor-metal phase transition of VO2.,"We attempted to observe pump-probe scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)-light emission (LE) from a VO2 thin film grown on a rutile TiO2(0 0 1) substrate, with an Ag tip fixed over a semiconducting domain. Laser pulses from a Ti:sapphire laser (wavelength 920 nm; pulse width less than 1.5 ps) irradiated the tip-sample gap as pump and probe light sources. With a photon energy of 2.7 eV, suggesting phase transition from semiconducting monoclinic (M) to metallic rutile (R) phases in relation to the electronic band structure, faint LE was observed roughly 30 ps after the irradiation of the pump pulse, followed by retention for roughly 20 ps. The incident energy fluence of the pump pulse at the gap was five orders of magnitude lower than the threshold value for reported photo-induced M-R phase transition. The mechanism that makes it possible to reduce the threshold fluence is discussed.",3
Interfacial properties of hydrides in alpha-Zr: a theoretical study.,"In order to better understand hydride formation in zirconium alloys, heterophase interfaces between alpha-Zr and gamma-ZrH are investigated by means of ab initio atomic-scale simulations of multilayers coupled with continuous elasticity. Our approach allows us to separate out the elastic contribution, leading to basal and prismatic [Formula: see text] interface energies around 200 [Formula: see text] and 750 [Formula: see text] respectively, i.e. values noticeably higher than previously found for coherent particles such as zeta-Zr2H. By considering interfacial changes of H contents, the possibility of competing elasticity and chemistry effects for interface stability is analyzed. The effects of the strong anisotropy evident in [Formula: see text] interface energies on the important practical issue of preferential habit planes are discussed, allowing us to propose a plausible explanation for the experimental results.",3
Spin-orbit interaction and Kondo scattering at the PrAlO3/SrTiO3 interface: effects of oxygen content.,"We report the effects of oxygen pressure during growth ([Formula: see text]) on the electronic and magnetic properties of PrAlO3 films grown on [Formula: see text]-terminated SrTiO3 substrates. Resistivity measurements show an increase in the sheet resistance as [Formula: see text] is increased. The saturation of the sheet resistance down to 0.3 K is consistent with Kondo theory for [Formula: see text] torr. Resistivity data fits indicate Kondo temperatures of 16-18 K. For the [Formula: see text] sample, we measured a moderate positive magnetoresistance (MR) due to a strong spin-orbit (SO) interaction at low magnetic fields that evolves into a larger negative MR at high fields due to the Kondo effect. Analysis of the MR data permitted the extraction of the SO interaction critical field for the [Formula: see text] torr interface ([Formula: see text] T). We observed high positive MR for the least oxygenated sample, where a fraction of the n-type carriers are derived from oxygen vacancies and possible cation interdiffusion; for this [Formula: see text] torr sample, Hall effect data indicate a thick conducting layer. Its extremely high MR ( approximately [Formula: see text]) is attributed to classical behavior due to a distribution of mobilities.",3
Temperature behaviour of the average size of nanoparticle lattices co-deposited with an amorphous matrix. Analysis of Ge + Al2O3 and Ni + Al2O3 thin films.,"We theoretically interpret the thermal behaviour of the average radius versus substrate temperature of regular quantum dot/nanocluster arrays formed by sputtering semiconductor/metal atoms with oxide molecules. The analysis relies on a continuum theory for amorphous films with given surface quantities, perturbed by a nanoparticle lattice. An account of the basic thermodynamic contributions is given in terms of force-flux phenomenological coefficients of each phase (Ge, Ni, Al2O3). Average radii turn out to be expressible by a characteristic length scale and a dimensionless parameter, which mainly depend upon temperature through diffusion lengths, film pressures and finite-size corrections to interfacial tensions. The numerical agreement is good in both Ge ([Formula: see text]) and Ni ([Formula: see text]) lattices grown at temperatures [Formula: see text]800 K, despite the lower temperature behaviour of quantum dots seeming to suggest further driving forces taking part in such processes.",3
Direct observation of temperature-driven magnetic symmetry transitions by vectorial resolved MOKE magnetometry.,"Angle- and temperature-dependent vectorial magnetometry measurements are necessary to disentangle the effective magnetic symmetry in magnetic nanostructures. Here we present a detailed study on an Fe(1 0 0) thin film system with competing collinear biaxial (four-fold symmetry) and uniaxial (two-fold) magnetic anisotropies, carried out with our recently developed full angular/broad temperature range/vectorial-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect magnetometer, named TRISTAN. The data give direct views on the angular and temperature dependence of the magnetization reversal pathways, from which characteristic axes, remanences, critical fields, domain wall types, and effective magnetic symmetry are obtained. In particular, although the remanence shows four-fold angular symmetry for all investigated temperatures (15 K-400 K), the critical fields show strong temperature and angular dependencies and the reversal mechanism changes for specific angles at a given (angle-dependent) critical temperature, showing signatures of an additional collinear two-fold symmetry. This symmetry-breaking is more relevant as temperature increases to room temperature. It originates from the competition between two anisotropy contributions with different symmetry and temperature evolution. The results highlight the importance of combining temperature and angular studies, and the need to look at different magnetic parameters to unravel the underlying magnetic symmetries and temperature evolutions of the symmetry-breaking effects in magnetic nanostructures.",3
Effect of Tb(3+) doping in mixed-valence manganites and cobaltites.,"The magnetic ordering of four Tb(3+)-doped manganites and cobaltites, La0.7Tb0.1Sr0.2MnO3, La0.7Tb0.1Ca0.2MnO3, La0.7Tb0.1Sr0.2CoO3 and La0.7Tb0.1Ca0.2CoO3, have been studied by means of neutron diffraction and SQUID magnetometry. All the samples were prepared by sintering of sol-gel precursors and their orthorhombic or rhombohedral perovskite structures at room and low temperatures were refined. A long-range ferromagnetic (FM) order was detected at the Mn and Co sites. In addition, a small but significant ordered moment was observed at A sites of studied cobaltites, which was attributed to local Tb(3+) moments, aligned by exchange interactions due to FM ordered Co sublattice. No or minor Tb(3+) contribution was detected in studied manganites.",3
Magnetic impurity doping induced spin-glass state and short-range zigzag order in the honeycomb iridate Na2IrO3.,"Based on the modified Heisenberg-Kitaev model, the effects of magnetic substitution on the magnetic properties of the honeycomb-lattice iridate [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] are studied using Monte Carlo simulations. It is observed that the long-range zigzag state of the original system is rather fragile and can be replaced by a spin-glass state even for small substitution, well consistent with the experimental observation in Ru-substituted samples (Mehlawat et al 2015 Phys. Rev. B 92 134412). Both the disordered Heisenberg and Kitaev interactions caused by the magnetic ion-doping are suggested to be responsible for the magnetic phase transitions in the system. More interestingly, a short-range zigzag order is suggested to survive above the freezing temperature even at high magnetic impurity doping levels.",3
Revealing correlation effect of Co 3d electrons in La3Co4Sn13 and Ce3Co4Sn13 by infrared spectroscopy study.,"We report resistivity, specific heat and optical spectroscopy measurements on single crystal samples of [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text]. We observed clear temperature-induced spectral weight suppression below 4000 [Formula: see text] for both compounds in the conductivity spectra [Formula: see text], indicating the progressive formation of gap-like features with decreasing temperature. The suppressed spectral weight transfers mostly to the higher energy region. This observation reflects the presence of the correlation effect in the compounds. We attribute the correlation effect to the Co 3d electrons.",3
On the density of states of circular graphene quantum dots.,We suggest a simple approach to calculate the local density of states that effectively applies to any structure created by an axially symmetric potential on a continuous graphene sheet such as circular graphene quantum dots or rings. Calculations performed for the graphene quantum dot studied in a recent scanning tunneling microscopy measurement (Gutierrez et al 2016 Nat. Phys. 12 1069-75) show an excellent experimental-theoretical agreement.,3
Electronic and magnetic properties of low-dimensional system Co2TeO3Cl2.,"The electronic and magnetic properties of transition metal oxyhalide compound Co2TeO3Cl2 are investigated using first principle calculations within the framework of density functional theory. To find the underlying spin-lattice of this compound, various hopping integrals and exchange interactions are calculated. The calculations reveal that the dominant inter-chain and intra-chain interactions are in the ab plane. The exchange path is visualized by Wannier function plotting. The nearest neighbor and next nearest neighbor exchange interactions are antiferromagnetic, making the system frustrated in low dimension. Calculations are also done with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) to find out the effect of SOC on this compound. Calculation of magnetocrystalline anisotropy suggests that the easy axis is along the crystallographic b direction.",3
Isotropic shrinkage of the oxygen octahedron in SrTiO3 under uniaxial pressure.,"X-ray absorption spectra at the Ti K-edge of a SrTiO3 single crystal under uniaxial pressure were measured to obtain evidence of uniaxial pressure-induced polarization predicted in SrTiO3 from the electronic viewpoint. The pre-edge 3d-e g peak decreases in intensity with increasing uniaxial pressure, together with an energy shift to higher energy side. Contrary to uniaxial deformation, these changes were independent of incident x-ray polarization. This implies the presence of a mechanism that maintains the isotropic coordination environment around a Ti atom, i.e. a tilt and rotation of the TiO6 octahedron accompanied by its isotropic shrinkage, hence the local polarization essential to the ferroelectric order cannot be observed.",3
