Magnetotransport properties of compensated semimetal HfB<sub>2</sub> with high-density light carriers.,"We present a detailed magnetotransport study on HfB&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;, a possible topological nodal-line semimetal. HfB&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; exhibits field-induced resistivity upturn and plateau behaviors at low temperature and high field, accompanying with rather large&amp;#13; magnetoresistance. The analysis of field dependence of Hall and longitudinal resistivity shows that there are two kinds of carriers (electrons and holes) with almost same carrier concentrations and rather high mobilities in HfB&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;. Above field-induced phenomena can be well explained by using the two-band model with compensation condition. Even the carrier concentrations is significantly high ( approximately 1.8x10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;21&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; cm&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt; -3&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;) in HfB&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;, much larger than other known topological semimetals with discrete Dirac nodal points, the electron-type carriers still have relatively small effective masses. In contrast to ZrB&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;, the slightly increased effective mass in HfB&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; manifests the effect of enhanced spin-orbit coupling due to the large atomic number of Hf.&amp;#13; &amp;#13; &amp;#13.",3
Two dimensional ferromagnetic semiconductor: monolayer CrGeS<sub>3</sub>.,"Recently, two-dimensional ferromagnetic semiconductors have been an important class of materials for many potential applications in spintronic devices. Based on density functional theory, we systematically explore the magnetic and electronic properties of CrGeS&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; with the monolayer structures. It is found that the bandgap of spin-up state is 1.01 eV when it is 1.07 eV in spin-down state. The exchange splitting is calculated as 0.67 eV (2.21 eV by HSE06 functional), which originates from bonding dpsigma hybridized states of Cr e&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;g&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;-S p and unoccupied Cr t&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2g&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;-Ge p hybridization. After that, the comparison of total energy between different magnetic states ensures the ferromagnetic ground state of monolayer CrGeS&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;. The reason of the magnetic states originates mainly from the competition between antiferromagnetic direct neighboring Cr-Cr exchange and ferromagnetic superexchange mediated by S atom. And the results also show the magnetic moment of 6 mu&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;B&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; per unit cell, including two Cr atoms. Besides, we estimate that the monolayer CrGeS&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; possesses the Curie temperature of 161 K by mean-eld theory. The results suggest that monolayer CrGeS&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; crystals will possess potential applications in nanoscale spintronics.",3
Nodeless s-wave superconductivity in the <i>alpha-Mn</i> structure type noncentrosymmetric superconductor TaOs: A muSR study.,"Noncentrosymmetric superconductors can lead to a variety of exotic properties in the superconducting&amp;#13; state such as line nodes, multigap behavior, and time-reversal symmetry breaking. In this&amp;#13; paper, we report the properties of the new noncentrosymmetric superconductor TaOs, using muon&amp;#13; spin relaxation and rotation measurements. It is shown using the zero-field muon experiment that&amp;#13; TaOs preserve the time-reversal symmetry in the superconducting state. From the transverse field&amp;#13; muon measurements, we extract the temperature dependence of lambda(T) which is proportional to the&amp;#13; superfluid density. This data can be fit with a fully gapped s-wave model for alpha = Delta(0)=k&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;B&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;Tc = 2.01&amp;#13; +/- 0.02. Furthermore, the value of magnetic penetration depth is found to be 5919 +/- 45 A, which is&amp;#13; consistent with the value obtained from the bulk measurements.",3
Ir 5<i>d</i>-band Derived Superconductivity in LaIr<sub>3</sub>.,"The superconducting properties of rhombohedral LaIr$_3$ were examined using susceptibility, resistivity, heat capacity, and zero-field (ZF) and transverse-field (TF) muon spin relaxation and rotation ($\mu$SR) measurements. The susceptibility and resistivity measurements confirm a superconducting transition below $T_{\mathrm{C}}=2.5(1)$~K. Two successive transitions are observed in the heat capacity data, one at $T_{\mathrm{C}}=2.5$~K and a second at 1.2~K below $T_{\mathrm{C}}$. The heat capacity jump is $\Delta C/\gamma T_{\mathrm{C}} \sim 1.0$ which is lower than 1.43 expected for Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) weak-coupling limit. Transverse-field-$\mu$SR measurements reveal a fully gapped $s-$wave superconductivity with $2\Delta(0)/k_{\mathrm{B}}T_{\mathrm{C}}=3.31(8)$, which is small compared to BCS value of 3.56, suggesting weak-coupling superconductivity. The magnetic penetration depth, $\lambda_{\mathrm{L}}(0)$, estimated from TF-$\mu$SR gives $\lambda_{\mathrm{L}}(0)=386(3)$~nm, a superconducting carrier density $n_{\mathrm{s}}=2.9(1)\times10^{27}$ carriers $m^{-3}$ and a carrier effective-mass enhancement factor $m^{*}=1.53(1)m_{\mathrm{e}}$. ZF-$\mu$SR data show no evidence for any spontaneous magnetic fields below $T_{\mathrm{C}}$, which demonstrates that time-reversal symmetry is preserved in the superconducting state of LaIr$_3$.",3
Carrier free long-range magnetism in Mo doped one quintuple layer Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> and Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>.,"One of the keys to the realization of Quantum Anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is long range ferromagnetism, which is only experimentally realized in Cr or V doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 system. Both elements are 3d transition metals and 4d transition metals are found to be ineffective to produce long range ferromagnetism in Bi2Se3. Still, whether long range ferromagnetism can be realized by magnetic doping of 4d elements is an open question. Based on density functional theory calculations, we predict that long range ferromagnetism can be realized in Mo doped Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3, which are semiconducting. The coupling strength is comparable with that of Cr doped Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3. Therefore, Mo doped Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3 or their alloys can be new systems to realize diluted magnetic semiconductors and QAHE.",3
Transport signatures of symmetry protection in 1D Floquet topological insulators.,"Time-periodic external drives have emerged as a powerful tool to artificially create topological phases of matter. Prime examples are Floquet topological insulators (FTIs), where a gapped bulk supports in-gap edge states, protected against symmetry-preserving local perturbations. Similar to an ordinary static topological insulator, the robustness of an edge state in a one-dimensional (1D) FTI shows up as a pinning of its quasienergy level, but now inside one of two distinct bulk gaps. Here we propose a scheme for probing this unique feature by observing transport characteristics of a 1D finite-sized FTI attached to external leads. We present predictions for transmission spectra using a nonequilibrium Green's function approach. Our analysis covers FTIs with time-independent and periodically driven boundary perturbations which either preserve or break the protecting chiral symmetry.",3
Ultrafast spin dynamics in ferrimagnets with compensation point.,"We derive an effective Lagrangian that facilitates the modeling of magnetization dynamics in a ferrimagnet with magnetization compensation point. The model is able to explain the earlier reported magnetization dynamics in the noncollinear magnetic phase triggered by a femtosecond laser pulse in GdFeCo amorphous alloy in the vicinity of spin-flop transition. Moreover, the described approach can be easily extended and applied to other cases of ultrafast magnetism in uniaxial f-d (rare-earth - transition metal) ferrimagnet near the magnetization compensation point in high magnetic fields. &amp;#13; We assume that the primary effect of the femtosecond laser pulse is the ultrafast demagnetization of the ferrimagnet. We show that in the noncollinear magnetic phase, which can be prepared by applying external magnetic field above the spin-flop transition, such a demagnetization results in a torque acting on the magnetizations of both sublattices. It is shown that, similarly to the experiment, the amplitude and timescales of the dynamics strongly depend on temperature and applied magnetic field. In particular, in the vicinity of the spin-flop phase transition the amplitude dramatically increases while the dynamics exhibits a critical slowdown. &amp;#13; We expect that the developed theoretical framework will boost further research of ultrafast magnetism of noncollinear spin systems.",3
Theoretical prediction of stable cluster-assembled CdSe bilayer and its functionalization with Co and Cr adatoms.,"In this article, we present our results on bilayers assembled upon strategic&amp;#13; placement of Cd&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;6&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;Se&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;6&amp;lt;/sub&amp; gt; clusters. These bilayers are studied for their&amp;#13; stability and electronic structure with the help of density functional theory&amp;#13; and are further analyzed using Bardeen, Tersoff and Hamann formalism for their&amp;#13; tunneling properties. Our calculations show that the hexagonal arrangement of&amp;#13; these clusters prevails as the most stable geometry showing all real phonon&amp;#13; modes. First-principles molecular dynamics studies on this 2D structure show&amp;#13; that it remains intact even at room temperature. This bilayer shows an indirect&amp;#13; semiconducting band gap of 1.28eV with the current-voltage (I-V)&amp;#13; characteristics similar to a tunnel diode. Further, we functionalized this&amp;#13; bilayer using transition metal atoms, Co and Cr. The aim was to seek whether&amp;#13; the bilayer sustains magnetism and how the concentration affects its electronic&amp;#13; and magnetic properties. Co functionalization brings ferromagnetic ordering in&amp;#13; the bilayer which turns near half-metallic upon increasing the concentration.&amp;#13; On the other hand, Cr functionalization shows a transition from antiferro- to&amp;#13; ferromagnetic ordering upon increasing the concentration. The I-V&amp;#13; characteristics of all these functionalized bilayers show negative differential&amp;#13; conductance similar to a tunnel diode.",3
Computational prediction of a +4 oxidation state in Au via compressed AuO<sub>2</sub> compounds.,"Much effort has been devoted to the investigation of the physical and chemical properties of the Au-O system over a range of pressures, owing to the considerable importance of these materials in fundamental and practical applications. To date, however, only Au1+, Au2+, Au3+, and Au5+ oxidation states have been identified in the Au-O system but tetravalent Au4+ has not been found. Here, we report the results of structure prediction for the Au-O system at high pressure via the effective structure prediction methodology within a first-principles electronic structure framework. We have discovered an intriguing structure with AuO2 composition and tetravalent Au, stable at high pressures. This phase shows an electronic transition from a metal to a semiconducting phase as a function of pressure. The present results provide fundamental understanding of the structural and physicochemical properties of compressed Au-O compounds.",3
Self-assembly of core-corona particles confined in a circular box.,"Using Monte Carlo simulations, we study the assembly of colloidal particles interacting via isotropic core-corona potentials in two dimensions and confined in a circular box. We explore the structural variety at low temperatures as function of the number of particles (N) and the size of the confining box and find a rich variety of patterns that are not observed in unconfined flat space. For a small number of particles \left(N\leq6\right), we identify the zero-temperature minimal energy configurations at a given box size. When the number of particles is large (N\geq100), we distinguish different regimes that appear in route towards close packing configurations as the box size decreases. These regimes are characterized by the increase in the number of branching points and their coordination number. Interestingly, we obtain anisotropic open structures with unexpected variety of rotational symmetries that can be controlled by changing the model parameters, and some of the structures have chirality, in spite of the isotropy of the interactions and of the confining box. For arbitrary temperatures, we employ Monte Carlo integration to obtain the average energy and the configurational entropy of the system, which are then used to construct a phase diagram as function of temperature and box radius. Our findings show that confined core-corona particles can be a suitable system to engineer particles with highly complex internal structure that may serve as building blocks in hierarchical assembly.",3
"Magneto-electronic properties, carrier mobility and strain effects of InSe nanoribbon.","The monolayer InSe has been successfully fabricated recently and studied intensely. Here, we investigate the geometrical stability and various physical properties such as electronic and magnetic feature, carrier mobility and strain effects for InSe nanoribbons. Our calculations show that armchair nanoribbons, regardless of the bare-edged or H-saturated ones, are semiconductors with an indirect bandgaps, but the bandgap size is increased greatly by H-saturation. Their electron mobility is predicted to be moderately large (from ~ 10^2 to ~10^3 cm^2 V^-1 s^-1) with the holes being less mobile for wider ribbons, and the carrier polarity phenomenon becomes more prominently for H-saturation. The zigzag InSe nanoribbons are found to be magnetic metals with a bigger magnetic moment and the ferromagnetic ground state at the single edge. The magnetism stems from unpaired electrons at the In-rich edge. More interestingly, it is found that the externally applied mechanical strain can effectively tune the spin polarization efficiency at the Fermi level to two stepwise stages, suggesting that the strain can act as a tool for developing a mechanical switch to control spin-polarized transport under lower bias. The detailed analysis suggests that this strain-tuning mechanism can be attributed to the ionic and covalent bond-configuration competition due to the strain-induced bond-length alterations, which leads to the unpaired electron redistribution in magnetic atoms or vanishing.",3
Unravelling oxygen-vacancy-induced electron transfer at SrTiO<sub>3</sub>-based heterointerfaces by transport measurement during growth.,"Numerous studies have showed that oxygen vacancies play an important role on the formation of two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at SrTiO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;-based heterointerfaces. Previously, it is widely believed that the main mechanism is that the oxygen vacancies in SrTiO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; directly contribute electrons to the 2DEG. Here we performed transport measurements during the creation of 2DEG for depositing amorphous LaAlO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; on SrTiO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; substrates and related heterostructures. Our result suggests that, unlike the previous viewpoint, in this kind of 2DEG the determinant mechanism is the electron transfer from the oxygen vacancies in the film grown on SrTiO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;, rather than the oxygen vacancies in SrTiO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; themselvies. This effect is so striking that an amorphous film of less than 10% monolayer coverage on SrTiO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;, or equivalently 0.04 nm , can already generate a highly conducting 2DEG. The present result may has a general implication and provide a possible way to understand the long-standing debate on the origin of 2DEG at SrTiO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;-based heterointerfaces.",3
Thermophoresis of biological and biocompatible compounds in aqueous solution.,"With rising popularity of Microscale Thermophoresis for the characterisation of protein-ligand binding reactions and possible applications in microfluidic devices, there is a growing interest in considering thermodiffusion in the context of life sciences. But although the understanding of thermodiffusion in non-polar mixtures has grown rapidly in recent years, predictions for associated mixtures like aqueous solutions remain challenging. This review aims to give an overview of the literature on thermodiffusion in aqueous systems, show the difficulties in theoretical description that arise from the non-ideal behaviour of water-mixtures, and highlight the relevance of thermodiffusion in a biological context. We find that the thermodiffusion in aqueous systems is dominated by contributions from heat of transfer, hydrogen bond interactions and charge effects. However, the separation of these effects is often difficult, especially in case of biological systems where a systematic exclusion of contributions may not be feasible.",3
Theoretical study of the microscopic origin of magnetocrystalline anisotropy in Fe<sub>16</sub>N<sub>2</sub> and its alloys: comparison with the other L1<sub>0</sub> alloys.,"We study the magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA) energy of Fe&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;16-&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;n&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;X &amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;n&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;N&amp; lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; (&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;n&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; = 1, 2), where X = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu. To understand the microscopic origin and basic mechanism controlling the MCA energy of Fe&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;16-&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;n&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;X &amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;n&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;N&amp; lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;, we first examined the behavior of the MCA energy of Fe&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;16&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;N&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp; gt;, focusing on the spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and compared the behavior with other alloy systems (FeCo, FePt and CoPt) with L1&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;0&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; structure. We find that whereas the MCA energy of FeCo is determined by the spin-conserved terms of the SOC energy, the MCA energy of Fe&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;16&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;N&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp; gt; is determined by mutual competition between spin-conserved and spin-flip terms. We then studied the effect of the transition element X on the phase stability and MCA of Fe&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;16-&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;n&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;X &amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;n&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;N&amp; lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;. The MCA energy and cohesive energy are calculated to determine the most stable configuration for each choice of X and &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;n&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;, and compared with those of Fe&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;16&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;N&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp; gt;. For X = V and Cu, both the MCA and phase stability improved noticeably. For X = Co, the MCA energy improves, but Fe&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;16-&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;n&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;C o&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;n&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;N&amp ;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; is less stable than Fe&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;16&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;N&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp; gt;. The microscopic mechanism underlying the MCA energy enhancement due to X = V, Cu and Co in Fe&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;16-&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;n&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;X &amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;n&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;N&amp; lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; was studied by examining the data for spin- and site-resolved projected density of states (PDOS), as well as each spin-conserved and spin-flip terms contributing to the SOC energy.",3
Hydrostatic pressure induced structural phase transition and mechanical properties of fluoroperovskite.,"We perform the first-principles calculations combining with the particle swarm optimization algorithm to investigate the high-pressure phase diagrams of NaXF3 (X=Mn, Ni, Zn). Two reconstructive phase transitions are predicted from Pv-Pnma to pPv-Cmcm at about 9 GPa and pPv-Cmcm to ppPv-Pnma at around 26 GPa for NaZnF3. That is not the case for NaMnF3 - a direct transition (reconstructive transition in nature but with the same Pnma space group) from Pv-Pnma to ppPv-Pnma phase around 12 GPa. Strikingly, our simulated results manifest that a disproportionation phase of NaZnF3 post-perovskite is uncovered along the way, which provides a successful explanation for the observed results in experiment. Additionally, the mechanical and thermal properties, especially the dynamical property, of the four NaZnF3 phases have also been studied. Here, we reveal the obvious softening of P-wave velocity and bulk sound speed in pPv-Cmcm-to-ppPv-Pnma transition, which may result in the discontinuity of seismic waves propagation through the earth's interior.",3
Experimental signatures of a nonequilibrium phase transition near the crossover point of a Langmuir monolayer.,"We investigate the response of the two-dimensional (2D) continuous non-particulate film of surfactant sorbitan tristearate confined at the air-water interface under oscillatory shear deformation. The time dependence of various rheological parameters show critical-like behavior at a value of strain amplitude close to the crossover point of elastic (G') and viscous (G'') shear moduli. Imposing oscillatory shear of different strain amplitudes (gamma0) above and below the crossover strain amplitude (gammaf) over a large number of cycles, we quantify the temporal dependence of interfacial viscous modulus, phase angle (G''/G') as well as higher harmonic components of stress. The number of shear cycles (tauR) required for these quantities to reach the steady state value diverges near gammaf. The steady state values of the third harmonic (I3/I1) show order parameter like behavior indicating the importance of higher order harmonics near the nonequilibrium transition. We further show that the energy dissipation per cycle per unit volume has a marked change near gammaf, consistent with continuum level nonequilibrium shear-transformation-zone (STZ) model of amorphous viscoplasticity.",3
Spin-rotation mode in a quantum Hall ferromagnet.,"A spin-rotation mode emerging in a quantum Hall ferromagnet due to excitation by a laser pulse&amp;#13; is studied. This state, macroscopically representing a rotation of the entire electron spin-system to&amp;#13; a certain angle, microscopically is not equivalent to a coherent turn of all spins as a single-whole&amp;#13; and is presented in the form of a combination of eigen quantum states corresponding to all possible&amp;#13; S_z spin numbers. Motion of the macroscopic quantum state is studied microscopically by solving a&amp;#13; non-stationary Schr odinger equation and by means of a kinetic approach where damping of the spin-&amp;#13; rotation mode is related to an elementary process - transformation of a 'Goldstone spin exciton'&amp;#13; to a 'spin-wave exciton'. The system exhibits a spin stochastization mechanism (determined by&amp;#13; spatial fl uctuations of the Land e factor) providing the damping - the transverse spin relaxation,&amp;#13; but irrelevant to a decay of spin-wave excitons and thus not providing the longitudinal relaxation -&amp;#13; recovery of the S_z number to its equilibrium value.",3
Defect induced ferromagnetic ordering in epitaxial Zn0.95Mn0.05O films on sapphire (0 0 0 1).,"We report the influence of Mn dopant on magnetic properties of Zn0.95Mn0.05O (ZMO)/Al2O3(0 0 0 1) hetero-epitaxial systems grown by using pulsed-laser deposition. The room temperature (RT) intrinsic ferromagnetic (FM) ordering verified by superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism spectrum of Mn L 2,3 edges is ascribed to the substitutional Mn atoms in the Zn site of ZnO. Mn in ZMO has a tetrahedral local symmetry instead of the octahedral symmetry of MnO, after verifying the absence of the Mn-related impurities or clusters in ZMO epitaxial film by Mn K-edge and Zn K-edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy spectrum, as well as the analysis of long-range structural ordering on Renninger scan of forbidden (0 0 0 5) reflection in x-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectrum. Comparison of x-ray absorption spectra of ZMO with those of ZnO epilayers at O K-, Zn K-, and L 3-edges indicates that the substitution of the Zn site with Mn enhances the charge-transfer (CT) transition and the presence of Zn vacancies (VZn) also dominate the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum, implying that the formation of numerous VZn defects plays an important role in activating FM interactions. The strong CT effect and the existence of high-density VZn suggest that the intrinsic RT FM ordering of insulating ZMO is a result of the formation of the bound magnetic polarons (BMPs) that interact with each other via intermediate magnetic impurities.",3
Enhancement of thermoelectric performance of a nanoribbon made of [Formula: see text] lattice.,"We present electronic and transport properties of a zigzag nanoribbon made of [Formula: see text] lattice. Our particular focus is on the effects of the continuous evolution of the edge modes (from flat to dispersive) on the thermoelectric transport properties. Unlike the case of graphene nanoribbon, the zigzag nanoribbon of [Formula: see text] lattice can host a pair of dispersive edge modes at the two valleys for specific width of the ribbon. Moreover, gap opening can also occur at the two valleys depending on the width. The slope of the dispersive edge modes and the energy gap strongly depend on the relative strength of two kinds of hoping parameters present in the system. We compute corresponding transport coefficients such as conductance, thermopower, thermal conductance and the thermoelectric figure of merits by using the tight-binding Green function formalism, in order to explore the roles of the dispersive edge modes. It is found that the thermopower and thermoelectric figure of merits can be enhanced significantly by suitably controlling the edge modes. The figure of merits can be enhanced by thirty times under suitable parameter regime in comparison to the case of graphene. Finally, we reveal that the presence of line defect, close to the edge, can cause a significant impact on the edge modes as well as on electrical conductance and thermopower.",3
Charge ordering in high-temperature superconductors visualized by scanning tunneling microscopy.,"Since the discovery of stripe order in La1.6-xNd0.4SrxCuO4 superconductors in 1995, charge ordering in cuprate superconductors has been intensively studied by various experimental techniques. Among these studies, scanning tunneling microscope (STM) plays an irreplaceable role in determining the real space structures of charge ordering. STM imaging of different families of cuprates over a wide range of doping levels reveal similar checkerboard-like patterns, indicating that such a charge ordered state is likely a ubiquitous and intrinsic characteristic of cuprate superconductors, which may shed light on understanding the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity. In another class of high-temperature superconductors, iron-based superconductors, STM studies reveal several charge ordered states as well, but their real-space patterns and the interplay with superconductivity are markedly different among different materials. In this paper, we present a brief review on STM studies of charge ordering in these two classes of high-temperature superconductors. Possible origins of charge ordering and its interplay with superconductivity will be discussed.&amp;#13.",3
Predicting the performance of the inter-coulombic electron capture from single-electron quantities.,"The probability of the inter-Coulombic electron capture (ICEC) is studied for nanowire-embedded quantum-dot pairs where electron capture in one dot leads to electron emission from the other. Previous studies pointed to an interdependence of several ICEC pathways which can enhance the ICEC reaction probability. To identify favorable criteria for such synergies in a qualitative and quantitative manner, we conducted a considerable amount of simulations scanning multiple geometrical parameters. The focus of the paper is not only to find the geometries which are most favorable to ICEC but most importantly to explain the basic principles of the ICEC probability. We have thus derived a number of energy relations among solely single-electron level energies that explain the mechanisms of the multiple reaction pathways. Among them are direct ICEC, both slowing or accelerating the outgoing electron, as well as resonance-enhanced ICEC which captures into a two-electron resonance state that decays thereafter. These pathways may apply simultaneously for just one single geometric configuration and contribute constructively leading to an enhancement of the reaction probability. Likewise some conditions are found that clearly turn down the ICEC probability to zero. The results based on single-electron relations are so general that they can as well be used to predict ICEC probability from the electronic structure in arbitrary physical systems such as atoms or molecules.",3
Local entanglement and string order parameter in dimerized models.,"In this letter, we propose an application of String Order Parameter (SOP), commonly used in&amp;#13; quantum spin systems, to identify symmetry-protected topological phase (SPT) in fermionic systems&amp;#13; in the example of the dimerized fermionic chain. As a generalized form of dimerized model, we&amp;#13; consider a one-dimensional spin-1/2 XX model with alternating spin couplings. We employ Jordan-&amp;#13; Wigner fermionization to map this model to the spinless Su-Schrieffer-Heeger fermionic model (SSH)&amp;#13; with generalized hopping signs. We demonstrate a phase transition between a trivial insulating&amp;#13; phase and the Haldane phase by the exact analytical evaluation of reconstructed SOPs which are&amp;#13; represented as determinants of Toeplitz matrices with the given generating functions. To get more&amp;#13; insight into the topological quantum phase transition (tQPT) and microscopic correlations, we&amp;#13; study the pairwise concurrence as a local entanglement measure of the model. We show that the&amp;#13; first derivative of the concurrence has a non-analytic behaviour in the vicinity of the tQPT, like in&amp;#13; the second order trivial QPTs.",3
Phonon transport in periodically and quasi-periodically modulated cylindrical nanowires.,"Phonon transport in periodically modulated cylindrical nanowire (PMCA) and quasi-periodically modulated cylindrical nanowire (QPMCA) is comparatively studied. It is shown that the transmission coefficient and thermal conductance for PMCA is greater than the corresponding values for QPMCA. At low frequencies, a wide stop-frequency gap due to the destructive interference between the incoming and back waves can be clearly observed here. For PMCA, such stop-frequency gap seems to be insensitive to the change of N (the periodic number). For QPMCA, however, its breadth increases with the increase of N (the Fibonacci number). When N is increased, the thermal conductance for PMCA presents a distinct change from the decrease to the constant, while it for QPMCA has a tendency of monotonous decrease. A brief discussion on these results is made.",3
Size-dependent magnetic properties of gamma-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanocrystallites.,"A route for synthesizing monodisperse magnetic nanocrystallites of maghemite, $\gamma$-Fe$_{2}$O$_3$, with various sizes has been revisited. A systematic investigation of three $\gamma$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ nanocrystalline samples by different techniques has been performed to characterize their size-dependent magnetic properties. Zero-field-cooled and field-cooled magnetization measurements reveal that the superparamagnetic blocking temperatures are around 230~K, 170~K, and 50~K for the 15.0~nm, 11.8~nm, and 6.1~nm nanocrystallites, respectively. Low-temperature M{\""o}ssbauer spectra show that all three nanocrystallites have the maghemite structure with all the vacancies in the B-sites. Furthermore, detailed analysis shows that there are more vacancies on the B-sites for the 6.1~nm nanocrystallites compared to 0.33 for the bulk maghemite.",3
Visualizing pairing symmetry in nematic superconductors using spin-polarized spectroscopy of magnetic impurities.,"We study the spin-polarized spectral properties of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov resonance states induced by magnetic impurities in 2- and 3-dimensional nematic superconductors: few layer Bi&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;Te&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sub&amp; gt; grown on FeTe&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;0.55&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;Se&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;0.45&amp;lt;/ sub&amp;gt; (2-dimensional) and Cu&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;x&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;Bi&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp; gt;Se&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; (3-dimensional). We focus on the relationship between pairing symmetry and the distribution of spin-polarized spectroscopy. We calculate the spin-polarized local density of states (SP LDOS) and the corresponding Fourier transformation using the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;T&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;-matrix method for both the 2- and 3-dimensional materials. Various situations with different impurity orientations and different SP LDOSs have been investigated. We find that, like the quasiparticle interference spectrum, the spin-polarized spectroscopy can be applied to distinguish threefold rotation symmetric pairings, e.g., the plain &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;s&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;-wave pairing, chiral &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;p&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;-wave pairing, etc, and nematic pairings in these materials.",3
Strain tunable spin reorientation of an individual Fe atom on 2D blue phosphorous.,"Herein, using first-principles calculations, we predict spin reorientation from in-plane to out-of-plane magnetization of an individual Fe magnet at the monophosphor vacancy in two-dimensional blue phosphorous (2D blue-P) by a few percent of tensile strain. We further reveal that this magnetization reversal is associated with the spin-state transition of Fe 3d (5) state from low-spin (1 [Formula: see text]) to high-spin state (5 [Formula: see text]), which occurs at the same tensile strain imposed into 2D blue-P, from the Ligand field theory analyses in the unpaired electron counts. The underlying mechanism for both the spin-state transition and spin-reorientation phenomena is the strain induced changes in the spin-orbit coupled adatomic [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] states through the strong hybridization with the P-3p orbitals. These findings open interesting prospects for exploiting stain engineering of 2D materials to manipulate magnetism and magnetization orientation of single-molecule magnets adsorbed on it.",3
Tip-induced superconductivity coexisting with preserved topological properties in line-nodal semimetal ZrSiS.,"ZrSiS was recently shown to be a new material with topologically non-trivial band structure that exhibits multiple Dirac nodes and a robust linear band dispersion up to an unusually high energy of 2 eV. Such a robust linear dispersion makes the topological properties of ZrSiS insensitive to perturbations like carrier doping or lattice distortion. Here, we show that a novel superconducting phase with a remarkably high [Formula: see text] of 7.5 K can be induced in single crystals of ZrSiS by a non-superconducting metallic tip of Ag. From first-principles calculations, we show that the observed superconducting phase might originate from a dramatic enhancement of density of states due to the presence of a metallic tip on ZrSiS. Our calculations also show that the emerging tip-induced superconducting phase co-exists with the well preserved topological properties of ZrSiS.",3
Experimental few-copy multi-particle entanglement detection.,"Many future quantum technologies rely on the generation of entangled states. Quantum devices will require verification of their operation below some error threshold, but the reliable detection of quantum entanglement remains a considerable challenge for large-scale quantum systems. Well-established techniques for this task rely on the measurement of expectation values of entanglement witnesses, which however require many measurements settings to be extracted. Here we develop a generic framework for efficient entanglement detection that translates any entanglement witness into a resource-efficient probabilistic scheme, whose confidence grows exponentially with the number of individual detection events, namely copies of the quantum state. To benchmark our findings, we experimentally verify the presence of entanglement in a photonic six-qubit cluster state generated using three single-photon sources operating at telecommunication wavelengths. We find that the presence of entanglement can be certified with at least 99:74% confidence by detecting 20 copies of the quantum state. Additionally, we show that genuine six-qubit entanglement is verified with at least 99% confidence by using 112 copies of the state. Our protocol can be carried out with a remarkably low number of copies and in the presence of experimental imperfections, making it a practical and applicable method to verify large-scale quantum devices.",3
Structural features enabling multiferroic behavior in the RX<sub>3</sub>(BO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub> system.,"The magnetoelectric effect in the RX3(BO3)4 system (R= Ho, Eu, Sm, Nd, Gd; X= Fe, Al) varies significantly with the cation R despite very similar structural arrangements. Our structural studies reveal a symmetry reducing tilting of the BO3 planes and of the FeO6 polyhedra in the systems exhibiting low magnetic field induced electric polarization. We develop an atomic-level description of the structure related mechanism behind the magnetoelectric effect, and propose a possible method for enhancement of the electric polarization. Neutron scattering measurements reveal a lack of magnetic ordering indicating the primary importance of the atomic structure in the multiferroic behavior of this system.",3
"Assessing model-dielectric-dependent hybrid functionals on the antiferromagnetic transition-metal monoxides MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO.","Recently, two nonempirical hybrid functionals, dielectric-dependent range-separated hybrid functional based on the Coulomb-attenuating method (DD-RSH-CAM) and doubly screened hybrid functional (DSH), have been suggested by [Chen &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;et al&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;, Phys. Rev. Mater. &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;, 073803 (2018)] and [Cui &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;et al&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;9&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;, 2338 (2018)], respectively. These two hybrid functionals are both based on a common model dielectric function approach, but differ in the way how to non-empirically obtain the range-separation parameter. By retaining the full short-range Fock exchange and a fraction of the long-range Fock exchange that equals the inverse of the dielectric constant, both DD-RSH-CAM and DSH turn out to perform very well in predicting the band gaps for a large variety of semiconductors and insulators. Here, we assess how these two hybrid functionals perform on challenging antiferromagnetic transition-metal monoxides MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO by comparing them to other conventional hybrid functionals and the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;GW&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; method. We find that single-shot DD0-RSH-CAM and DSH0 improve the band gaps towards experiments as compared to conventional hybrid functionals. The magnetic moments are slightly increased, but the predicted dielectric constants are decreased. The valence band density of states (DOS) predicted by DD0-RSH-CAM and DSH0 are as satisfactory as HSE03 in comparison to experimental spectra, however, the conduction band DOS are shifted to higher energies by about 2 eV compared to HSE03. Self-consistent DD-RSH-CAM and DSH deteriorate the results with a significant overestimation of band gaps.",3
Ab initio study of optoelectronic and magnetic properties of Mn-doped ZnS with and without vacancy defects.,"The effect of vacancy defects on optoelectronic and magnetic properties of Mn-doped ZnS have been systematically investigated using first principle approaches. A single Mn substitution at Zn site induces a spin-polarized ground state in pure ZnS with total magnetization 5 [Formula: see text]. Our results for magnetic coupling show that the coupling between Mn spins in pure Mn doped ZnS is antiferromagnetic under the super-exchange mechanism. The existence of native defects has a great influence on the magnetic ground state of Mn-doped ZnS. In particular, a p -type defect such as Zn vacancy play a crucial role in stabilizing ferromagnetic ground state while n-type defect, such as S vacancy, has no effect on the magnetic ground state i.e. the interaction between two Mn spins with S-vacancy remain antiferromagnetic. Furthermore, optical properties such as dielectric functions, absorption coeffiecients, reflectivity and transmissitivity for Mn doped systems with and without vacancy defect were also studied, and we found that an absorption peak was obtained in the infrared region which is attributed to the defect states introduced by Zn vacancy in the system. In a S-vacancy defect system, the peaks in the near infrared and visible region are due to donor states introduced by S vacancy defect and these peaks are produced by electrons flipping from a spin up state to a spin down state. Finally, we also correlated the magnetic interactions with the d-d optical transition in pure Mn-doped ZnS and found that the d-d transitions during optical absorptions are red shifted and blue shifted in FM and AFM coupled Mn ions pair, which is in good agreement with the experimental observations. This study may help to understand the behavior of optical and magnetic properties of DMS under vacancy defects.",3
13C NMR of DIPAC and DIPAB organic ferroelectrics.,"The diisopropylammonium chloride (C6H16ClN, DIPAC) and diisopropylammonium bromide (C6H16BrN, DIPAB) molecular crystals are recently discovered ferroelectrics with sufficiently high spontaneous polarization and Curie temperature. We performed first studies of these crystals by 13C NMR. CP MAS spectra were collected within large temperature ranges covering the Curie points. The reconstructive phase transition from the initial orthorhombic P212121 structure of DIPAB to the monoclinic ferroelectric P21 structure leads to an abrupt alteration in the 13C spectrum. The 13C spectra for DIPAC and DIPAB in the ferroelectric P21 phase are quite similar with four lines at lower frequencies, which correspond to the CH3 groups, and two lines with close chemical shifts, which correspond to two CH groups. The transition into the paraphase leads to gradual reduction of the interline distances in the low-frequency quadruplet and in the doublet. The step-like changes in the interline frequency shifts at this transition evidence its first order. The analysis of the spectrum evolution in the paraphase shows that only a CH group lays in the reflection plane above the P21P21/m transition while the second CH group only moves closer to the reflection plane upon further heating.",3
High pressure study of magnetic properties of Tb<sub>3</sub>Co.,"The magnetic properties of rare-earth rich intermetallic compound, Tb&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;Co, were studied under external pressures up to approximately 1.21 GPa. The application of external pressure results in a decrease of the transition temperatures, T&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;N&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; (paramagnetic to modulated antiferromagnetic) by about 6 K, and the order to order transition that coincides with a glass transition at 72 K by about 15 K, respectively. The low temperature drop in the zero-field cooled magnetisation signifying the strengthening of spin-orbit coupling remains more or less unaffected (shifts only by 3 K) by the external pressures but significant changes in the magnetic behaviour were observed above 40 K. The overall long range non-collinear magnetic order coexisting with glassy behaviour (below 72 K) is sustained even at approximately 1.07 GPa pressure. The rate of decay of T&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;N&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; (dT&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;N&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;/dP) is found to be linear with -7.2 K/GPa up to approximately 0.9 GPa and then it deviates from linearity. The magnetic relaxations and memory effects studied under different measurement protocols confirm the presence of glassiness right up to the highest pressure, although the glassy behaviour is weakened to some extent with increasing pressure as reflected by faster relaxations.",3
The CeFe<sub>11</sub>Ti Permanent Magnet: A closer look at the microstructure of the compound.,"High-performance permanent magnets (PM) are based on compounds with outstanding intrinsic magnetic properties. Nowadays, the most powerful PMs are obtained from the favorable combination of rare earth metals (RE=Nd, Pr, Ce) with transition metals (TM=Fe, Co). Among them, CeFe11Ti is attracting considerable attention due to its large Curie temperature, magnetization, and magneto-crystalline anisotropy energy, in particular for the development of electric motors for future automatic electrification.&amp;#13; In this work, we shed some light in the understanding of this important compound by performing periodic hybrid-exchange density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The electronic structure of the different steps in the formation of CeFe11Ti gives us a clear explanation on the effect of Ce and Ti on its magnetic properties. The latter plays a role in stabilizing the structure, while Ce significantly hybridizes with Fe orbitals and alters the electronic bands. The calculations are compatible with a valence of 3+ for Ce, which is crucial in order to obtain a large magneto-crystalline anisotropy. Several spin configurations have been analyzed, being the ferromagnetic one the most stable. The results presented here provide a powerful tool for the further development of optimized high-performance PMs.",3
Structural properties of protective diamond-like-carbon thin films grown on multilayer graphene.,"In spite of the versatility of electronic properties of graphene, its fragility and low resistance to damage and external deformations reduce the practical value of this material for many applications. Coating of graphene with a thin layer of hard amorphous carbon is considered as a viable solution to protect the 2D material against accidental scratches and other external damaging impacts. In this study, we investigate the relationship between the deposition condition and quality of diamond-like-carbon (DLC) on top of multilayer graphene by means of molecular dynamics simulations. Deposition of carbon atoms with 70 eV incident energy at 100 K resulted in the highest content of &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;sp&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-bon ded C atoms. An increase of the number of dangling bonds at the interface between the top graphene layer and the DLC film indicates that decrease of the incident energy reduces the adhesion quality of DLC thin film on graphene. Analysis of radial distribution function indicates that &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;sp&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; hybridized carbon atoms tend to grow near already existing &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;sp&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-ato ms. This explains why the quality of the DLC structures grown on graphene have generally a lower content of &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;sp&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; C atoms compared to those grown directly on diamond. Ring analysis further shows that a DLC structure grown on the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;sp&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-ric h structures like graphene contains a higher fraction of disordered ring structures.",3
First-principles study of thermoelectric properties of Li-based Nowotony-Juza phases.,"We investigated the cubic--hexagonal phase transition and its effect on thermoelectric performance in Li-based Nowotny-Juza phases LiZn\textit{X} (\textit{X} = N, P, As, Sb, and Bi). Interestingly, other than LiZnSb, the cubic LiZnBi is found to be energetically more favorable than the hitherto reported hexagonal phase. The hexagonal phases of reported cubic LiZnP and LiZnAs are likely to be stabilized by pressure -- hydrostatic pressure can be aided by internal pressure. We find that while power factor values are much improved in the proposed hexagonal phases, the values in cubic phases are also impressive. We also determine conservative estimates of the figure of merit. The \textit{ZT} values of cubic and hexagonal LiZnSb at 700 K are 1.27 and 1.95, respectively. Other promising values are 1.96 and 1.49 at 700 K of hexagonal \textit{n}-type LiZnP and LiZnAs, respectively. Overall, our findings suggest the good thermoelectric potential of Nowotny-Juza phases.&amp;#13.",3
<b>Strain engineering of ferroelectric KNbO<sub>3</sub> for bulk photovoltaic applications: An insight from density functional theory calculations</b>.,"A large ferroelectric polarization and low band gap are essential to improve the bulk photovoltaic response which is the generation of photocurrent in the polar non-centrosymmetric materials such as ferroelectric perovskite oxides. Among various perovskite oxides, Potassium Niobate (KNbO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;, KNO) is a promising ferroelectric material for bulk photovoltaic applications as its band gap and polarization can be tuned effectively by strain, doping, or by applying an electric field. In this work, using the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we present an insight into the strain engineering of polarization, band structure, and optical properties of the cubic (C), tetragonal (T), and orthorhombic (O) structures of KNO. The tensile and compressive strain under the triaxial, biaxial, and uniaxial conditions are applied along the direction &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;parallel&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;perpendicular&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; to the polar axis of KNO structures. We find that the band gap decreases along with a substantial increment of polarization on the application of tensile strain along the direction &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;parallel&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; to the polar axis. In T (O) phase at +2% strain, the polarization increases by 18 muC/cm&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; (14 muC/cm&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;) in triaxial, 26 muC/cm&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; (16 muC/cm&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;) in biaxial, and 29 muC/cm&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; (29 muC/cm&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;) in uniaxial conditions with considerable decreasing of band gap with respective to zero strain condition. Therefore, wisely applying the tensile strain along the direction &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;parallel&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; to the polar axis the photovoltaic efficiency of KNO can be improved.",3
Topological phase diagram of the disordered 2XY model in presence of generalized Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction.,"Topological index of a system determines its edge physics. However, in situations such as strong disorder where due to level repulsion the spectral gap closes, the topological indices are not well-defined. In this paper, we show that the localization length of zero modes determined by the transfer matrix method reveals much more information than the topological index. The localization length can provide not only information about the topological index of the Hamiltonian itself, but it can also provide information about the topological indices&amp;#13; of the ""relative"" Hamiltonians. As a case study, we study a generalized XY model (2XY model) further augmented by a generalized Dziyaloshinskii-Moriya-like (DM) interaction parameterized by $\phi$ that after fermionization breaks the time-reversal invariance. The {\em parent} Hamiltonian at $\phi=0$ which belongs to BDI class is indexed by integer winding number while the $\phi\ne 0$ {\em daughter} Hamiltonian which belongs to class D is specified by a $Z_2$ index $\nu=\pm 1$. We show that the localization length in addition to determining the $Z_2$ can count the number of Majorana zero modes left over at the boundary of the daughter Hamiltonian -- which are not protected by winding number anymore. Therefore the localization length outperforms the standard topological indices in two respects: (i) it is much faster and more accurate to calculate and (ii) it can count the winding number of the parent Hamiltonian by looking into the edges of the daughter Hamiltonian.",3
Optical and magnetic properties of Gd<sub>1-x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>CrO<sub>3</sub> (0 </= x </= 0.15).,"Optical and magnetic properties of Gd1-xSrxCrO3 (0 </= x </= 0.15) polycrystalline samples have been investigated to identify the role of Sr2+ ion in GdCrO3 compound. Quantitative structural analysis using Rietveld refinement suggests the formation of single orthorhombic phase up to x = 0.1 composition, and in addition, a secondary monazite-type structure of SrCrO4 arises for x = 0.15 composition. Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectra also confirm the presence of SrCrO4 component for higher concentration of Sr2+ ion. Mixed valence state of Cr such as Cr3+ and Cr4+ is obtained from x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The presence of Cr4+ ion induces a reduction of optical band gap with increase of Sr content. The unoccupied states originate from Cr4+ modify d-d transitions. Larger cell volume and breaking of magnetic exchange pathways through nonmagnetic element (Sr) weaken the strength of interaction and consequently lower Neel and spin reorientation temperatures.",3
Reflectance of graphene-coated dielectric plates in the framework of Dirac model: Joint action of energy gap and chemical potential.,"We investigate the reflectance of a dielectric plate coated with&amp;#13; a graphene sheet which possesses the nonzero energy gap and chemical&amp;#13; potential at any temperature. The general formalism for the&amp;#13; reflectance using the polarization tensor is presented in the framework&amp;#13; of Dirac model. It allows calculation of the reflectivity properties&amp;#13; for any material plate coated with real graphene sheet on the basis of&amp;#13; first principles of quantum electrodynamics. Numerical computations of&amp;#13; the reflectance are performed for the graphene-coated SiO$_2$ plate at&amp;#13; room, liquid-nitrogen, and liquid-helium temperatures. We demonstrate&amp;#13; that there is a nontrivial interplay between the chemical potential,&amp;#13; energy gap, frequency, and temperature in their joint action on the&amp;#13; reflectance of a graphene-coated plate. Specifically, it is shown that&amp;#13; at the fixed frequency of an incident light an increase of the chemical&amp;#13; potential and the energy gap affect the reflectance in opposite&amp;#13; directions by increasing and decreasing it, respectively. According to&amp;#13; our results, the reflectance approaches unity at sufficiently low&amp;#13; frequencies and drops to that of an uncoated plate at high frequencies&amp;#13; for any values of the chemical potential and energy gap. The impact of&amp;#13; temperature on the reflectance is found to be more pronounced for graphene&amp;#13; coatings with smaller chemical potentials. The obtained results could be applied for&amp;#13; optimization of optical detectors and other devices exploiting graphene coatings.",3
Self-trapped holes (small polarons) in ferroelectric KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> crystals.,"Density functional theory (DFT) is used to establish the ground-state structure of the self-trapped hole (STH) in KH&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;PO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;4&amp;lt;/sub&amp; gt; crystals. The STHs in this nonlinear optical material are free small polarons, a fundamental intrinsic point defect. They are produced with ionizing radiation in the low-temperature orthorhombic structure of KH&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;PO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;4&amp;lt;/sub&amp; gt; and are only stable (i.e., long-lived) below approximately 70 K. A large 129-atom cluster, K&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;19&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;H&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;40&amp;lt;/sub&amp; gt;P&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;14&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;O&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;56&amp;lt;/sub&a mp;gt;, is constructed to model the self-trapped hole. The omegaB97XD functional with the 6-31+G* basis set is used and geometry optimization is performed. Our results show that two of the oxygen ions in a PO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;4&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; unit relax toward each other and equally share the hole. These two oxygen ions do not initially have close hydrogen neighbors. This equal sharing of the hole is related to the presence of isolated, slightly distorted, PO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;4&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; units and is significantly different from the small-polaron behavior often observed in other oxide crystals where the hole is localized on only one oxygen ion. The computational results provide a detailed description of the lattice relaxation occurring during formation of the self-trapped hole. Characteristic spectral features of this defect are a larger hyperfine interaction with one &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;31&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;P nucleus and equal, but smaller, hyperfine interactions with two &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;1&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;H nuclei. The computed values for these isotropic and anisotropic hyperfine coupling constants are in excellent agreement with results obtained from electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments.",3
QuantumATK: An integrated platform of electronic and atomic-scale modelling tools.,"QuantumATK is an integrated set of atomic-scale modelling tools developed since 2003 by professional software engineers in collaboration with academic researchers. While different aspects and individual modules of the platform have been previously presented,&amp;#13; the purpose of this paper is to give a general overview of the platform. The QuantumATK simulation engines enable electronic-structure calculations using density functional theory or tight-binding model Hamiltonians, and also offers bonded or reactive empirical force fields in many different parametrizations. Density functional theory is implemented using either a plane-wave basis or expansion of electronic states in a linear combination of atomic orbitals. The platform includes a long list of advanced modules, including Green's-function methods for electron transport simulations and surface calculations, first-principles electron-phonon and electron-photon couplings,&amp;#13; simulation of atomic-scale heat transport, ion dynamics, spintronics, optical properties of materials, static polarization, and more.&amp;#13; Seamless integration of the different simulation engines into a common platform allows for easy combination of different simulation methods into complex workflows. Besides giving a general overview and presenting a number of implementation details&amp;#13; not previously published, we also present four different application examples. These are calculations of the phonon-limited mobility of Cu, Ag and Au, electron transport in a gated 2D device, multi-model simulation of lithium ion drift through a battery cathode in an external electric field, and electronic-structure calculations of the composition-dependent band gap of SiGe alloys.&amp;#13.",3
Magnetic properties of Fe<sub>16-x</sub>(Ta/W)<sub>x</sub>N<sub>2</sub> ternary alloy: First principles and atomistic simulations.,"Using the first principles method, we explored the magnetic properties of Fe16-x(Ta/W)xN2 alloy. We calculated the alloy formation energy, dynamical and thermal stabilities and proved the possibility of materialization of Fe16-x(Ta/W)xN2 alloy. The Fe14Ta2N2 had a Curie temperature of 1020 K while it was 950 K in Fe14W2N2. We found greatly enhanced uniaxial anisotropy in ternary alloy systems. Particularly, the Fe14W2N2 alloy has a uniaxial anisotropy constant of 2.68 MJ/m3 which is almost five times enhancement of the value of 0.57 MJ/m3 in the Fe16N2. The increase in the uniaxial anisotropy resulted in an enhancement of the coercive field (HC). The Fe14W2N2 had a coercive filed of 27 kOe at 300 K and this is comparable to that of 25.6 kOe in Dy-doped Nd based magnet. Besides, the (BH)max of 54.5 MGOe in Fe14W2N2 alloy was even larger than the value of 40 MGOe in Dy-doped Nd-based magnet. Overall, we propose that the Fe16-x(Ta/W)xN2 can be a potential rare-earth-free permanent magnet.",3
Thermal Expansion Coefficient and Phonon Dynamics in Coexisting Allotropes of Monolayer WS2 Probed by Raman Scattering.,"We report a comprehensive temperature dependent Raman measurements on three different phases of monolayer WS2 from 4K to 330K in a wide spectral range. Our studies reveal the anomalous nature of the first as well as the higher order combination modes reflected in the disappearance of the few modes and anomalous temperature evaluation of the phonon self-energy parameters attributed to the detuning of resonance condition and development of strain due to thermal expansion mismatch with the underlying substrate. Our detailed temperature dependence studies also decipher the ambiguity about assignment of the two modes in literature near ~ 297 cm-1 and 325 cm-1. Mode near 297 cm-1 is assigned as first order Raman mode, which is forbidden in the backscattering geometry and 325 cm-1 is assigned to the combination of and mode. We also estimated thermal expansion coefficient by systematically disentangling the substrate effect in the temperature range of 4K to 330K and probed its temperature dependence in 1H, 1T and 1T' phases.",3
Scalable synthesis of water-dispersible two-dimensional manganese dioxide monosheets.,"The two-dimensional nanomaterials with atomic thickness usually exhibit high specific surface areas and atom exposure rates, which are suitable for surface reaction related applications. In this study, we selected the oxalate ions as the structure-inducing agent to synthesize delta-MnO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; ultrathin nanosheets (~4.5 nm) via a facile hydrothermal method. Subsequently, an efficient exfoliation method to prepare single-layer MnO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; nanosheets (~0.9 nm) with the major exposed {001} facets was successfully developed. We found that the oxalate ions play a major role in the growth and formation of delta-MnO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; ultrathin nanosheets, and the formation process of the ultrathin structure was also investigated. The resulting single-layer MnO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; nanosheets (monosheets) with exposed {001} facets showed much higher catalytic performance for carcinogenic airborne formaldehyde, better than few-layer ultrathin nanosheets and nanoflowers with exposed {100} facets. The reasons for the high catalytic activity of MnO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; monosheets can be attributed to its higher surface areas and oxygen vacancy concentration. Moreover, the Density-Functional-Theory theoretical calculations showed that the oxygen vacancy in single-layer {001} facets exhibited the strongest adsorption/activation ability to O&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; and H&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;O, which was very favorable for catalytic oxidation of formaldehyde. The synthesis strategy of ultrathin nanosheets described in this article may serve as reference and guidance for the preparation of other two-dimensional ultrathin nanomaterials.",3
The energy band engineering for the high-performance infrared photodetectors constructed by CdTe/MoS<sub>2</sub> heterojunction.,"Recently, people have paid much attention to the ultra broadband photodetectors (PDs) from the deep ultraviolet to the near infrared. However, the traditional infrared PDs made by the narrow band-gap semiconductors limited his wide application for its high cost and complex manufacturing process. The energy band engineering for two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals heterojunction with free ofsurface chemical dangling bonds is effective method for High-performance Infrared Photodetectors. In this work, we employ density functional calculation to design a type-CdTe/MoS2 heterostructure and calculate the electronic properties. The results reveal that the heterostructure has the narrow band gap of 0.64eV and electrons transfer from the CdTe layer to MoS2 layer, which promote the separation of photogenerated carriers and enhance the photoelectron conversion efficiency. The narrow band gap makes it can respond to near infrared, visible and ultraviolet light, demonstrating it the promising application for PDs. Furthermore, the analysis of molecules adsorption indicates the CdTe/MoS2 is prone to capture H2O and release the H2 molecules, which is conductive to the photocatalytic water splitting. Our work suggests that the CdTe/MoS2 heterostructure is a promising candidate as solar cell and photocatalyst, and also provides a new sight for experimental and theoretical research to design highly efficiency device.",3
Nature of the randomness-induced quantum spin liquids in two dimensions.,"The nature of the randomness-induced quantum spin liquid state, the random-singlet state, is investigated in two dimensions (2D) by means of the exact-diagonalization and the Hams-de Raedt methods for several frustrated lattices, {\it e.g.\/}, the triangular, the kagome and the $J_1-J_2$ square lattices. Properties of the ground state, the low-energy excitations and the finite-temperature thermodynamic quantities are investigated. The ground state and the low-lying excited states consist of nearly isolated singlet-dimers, clusters of resonating singlet-dimers, and orphan spins. Low-energy excitations are either singlet-to-triplet excitations, diffusion of orphan spins accompanied by the recombination of nearby singlet-dimers, creation or destruction of resonating singlet-dimers clusters. The latter two excitations give enhanced dynamical `liquid-like' features to the 2D random-singlet state. Comparison is made with the random-singlet state in a 1D chain without frustration, the similarity and the difference between in 1D and in 2D being highlighted. Frustration in a wide sense, not only the geometrical one but also including the one arising from the competition between distinct types of interactions, play an essential role in stabilizing this {\it frustrated\/} random singlet state. Recent experimental situations on both organic and inorganic materials are reviewed and discussed.",3
Low-temperature atomistic spin relaxation and non-equilibrium intensive properties using steepest-entropy-ascent quantum-inspired thermodynamics modeling.,"The magnetization of body-centered cubic iron at low temperatures is calculated with the steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamics (SEAQT) framework. This framework assumes that a thermodynamic property in an isolated system traces the path through state space with the greatest entropy production. Magnetization is calculated from the expected value of a thermodynamic ensemble of quantized spin waves based on the Heisenberg spin model applied to an ensemble of coupled harmonic oscillators. A realistic energy landscape is obtained from a magnon dispersion relation calculated using spin-density-functional-theory. The equilibrium magnetization as well as the evolution of magnetization from a non-equilibrium state to equilibrium are calculated from the path of steepest entropy ascent determined from the SEAQT equation of motion in state space. The framework makes it possible to model the temperature- and time-dependence of magnetization without a detailed description of magnetic damping. The approach is also used to define intensive properties (temperature and magnetic field strength) that are fundamentally, i.e., canonically or grand canonically, valid for any non-equilibrium state. Given the assumed magnon dispersion relation, the SEAQT framework is used to calculate the equilibrium magnetization at different temperatures and external magnetic fields and the results are shown to closely agree with experiment for temperatures less than 500 K. The time-dependent evolution of magnetization from different initial states and interactions with a reservoir is also predicted.",3
"Iron(II) complexes with N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> coordinating Schiff base-like equatorial ligand and 1,2-bis(pyridin-2-ylethynyl)benzene as axial pincer ligand.","Three new unique mononuclear iron(II) pincer complexes were synthesized using 1,2-bis(pyridin-2-ylethynyl)benzene as axially coordinating pincer ligand and N2O2 coordinating Schiff base-like equatorial ligands. Magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal that all three complexes remain in the high spin state in the entire temperature range investigated. Reason for this are restraining sterical interactions revealed in the single crystal X-ray structure analysis and extended DFT-computational studies of one of the pincer complexes. Those interactions also lead to the formation of unexpected side products during the synthesis such as a complex with two ethanol molecules as axial ligand, whose X-ray structure was determined.",3
Transconductance as a probe of nonlocality of Majorana fermions.,Each end of a Kitaev chain in topological phase hosts a Majorana fermion. Zero bias conductance peak is an evidence of Majorana fermion when the two Majorana fermions are decoupled. These two Majorana fermions are separated in space and this nonlocal aspect can be probed when the two are coupled. Crossed Andreev reflection is the evidence of the nonlocality of Majorana fermions. Nonlocality of Majorana fermions has been proposed to be probed by noise measurements since simple conductance measurements cannot probe it due to the almost cancellation of currents from electron tunneling and crossed Andreev reflection. Kitaev ladders on the other hand host subgap Andreev states which can be used to control the relative currents due to crossed Andreev reflection and electron tunneling. We propose to employ Kitaev ladder in series with Kitaev chain and show that transconductance of this setup can be used as a probe of nonlocality of Majorana fermions by enhancing crossed Andreev reflection over electron tunneling.,3
Pressure-induced metallization of black arsenic.,"Black arsenic (bAs), a cousin of black phosphorus, has attracted increasing attention because of its excellent physical properties such as high carrier mobility and high on/off ratio, which provide new opportunities for future field-effect transistors and photodetectors. As a clear and powerful means, hydrostatic pressure is commonly used to tune the structure and electronic properties of materials. However, there have been few reports to date about bAs under pressure. In this work, a theoretical study is presented on the structure, stability, and electronic properties of bAs under high pressure. The calculation results show that bAs becomes unstable at pressures above 3 GPa. A transition from direct band gap to indirect band gap occurs at 1.2 GPa, and with further increase of pressure bAs undergoes a phase transition from semiconductor to metal at a critical pressure of 2.2 GPa. In addition, the carrier effective masses can be modulated slightly by hydrostatic pressure.",3
Aging effect on vanadium oxide hybrid nanotubes.,"Vanadium oxides present a rich magnetic phase diagram depending on the oxidation state of the V ions. In particular the vanadium oxide nanotubes (VO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;x&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; NTs) present several promising perspectives for different technological applications for which it is essential to know the oxidation state of V ions, as well as to evaluate the stability with the aging time of the tubes. In this work we present a systematic study of the time evolution of the magnetic properties of VO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;x&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;NTs. For this complete characterization, we used electron spin resonance (ESR) and dc-susceptibility techniques, which were supplemented with TEM microscopy and XANES. We observed that for aging in normal environmental conditions of pressure, temperature and humidity, the V&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;4+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;ions oxidize to V&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;5+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;. Although the multiwall tubular structure is maintained, this oxidation process produces a marked change in the magnetic properties. We conclude that the aging of the samples affects the V&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;4+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;/ V&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;5+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;relationship in the VO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;x&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; NTs, which may contribute to explain the significant dispersion of data reported in the bibliography.&amp;#13.",3
The bond charge current in the monolayer graphene superlattice with hopping beyond nearest neighbor.,"In this paper, we systematically investigate the transportation properties of the zigzag nano-ribbon graphene in a local potential barrier/well with electrons hopping between and beyond nearest neighbor. When the local potential is present, the conductance exhibits novel periodic oscillation plateaus around increasing quantized conductance. The oscillation plateau hops down with the quantized conductance until vanishes with increasing local potential barrier. Furthermore, when a small voltage is applied between the two terminals of the conductor, the local current presents periodic oscillation in the barrier region. In contrast, when a local potential well is applied, the conductance shows irregular oscillation, exhibiting incommensurate oscillations of local current inside and outside the well. Finally, similar phenomena persists when more local potentials are applied to the system. We expect our studies can facilitate the design of relevant electronic devices.",3
Active glasses.,"Active glassy matter has recently emerged as a novel class of non-equilibrium soft matter, combining energy-driven, active particle movement with dense and disordered glass-like behavior. Here we review the state-of-the-art in this field from an experimental, numerical, and theoretical perspective. We consider both non-living and living active glassy systems, and discuss how several hallmarks of glassy dynamics (dynamical slowdown, fragility, dynamical heterogeneity, violation of the Stokes-Einstein relation, and aging) are manifested in such materials. We start by reviewing the recent experimental evidence in this area of research, followed by an overview of the main numerical simulation studies and physical theories of active glassy matter. We conclude by outlining several open questions and possible directions for future work.",3
Influence of Fe and Cr doping on the structural and magnetic properties of ZnV<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.,"In this paper, we report the modulation of structural and magnetic properties with Fe and Cr doping at the Zn and V sites in ZnV2O4. Undoped ZnV2O4 exhibits two anomalies in the M-T measurements which are assigned to a structural transition (TS ~ 57K) followed by a magnetic transition (TN ~ 41K). With the help of X-ray diffraction and energy dispersive X-ray analysis it is found that the prepared samples are single phase as well as stoichiometric. However, doping at both the cationic sites of ZnV2O4 leads to the disappearance of the structural transition and suppression of the long range magnetic ordering to a cusp like feature below 20K and the cusps broaden with increasing magnetic field while the position of the cusps remain unaltered with increasing field strength. The obtained results indicate that Zn1-xFexV2O4 and Zn(V1-tCrt)2O4 (x = t = 0, 0.05, 0.1) systems are frustrated cubic normal spinel systems. Moreover, such field independent behavior of cusp positions hints towards the antiferromagnetic ground state at low temperature instead of a spin glass phase. To elucidate this fact, dc aging (magnetic relaxation) and memory effects have been investigated in zero field cooled (ZFC) and field cooled (FC) protocol for the 10% doped samples, which exhibit aging and memory effect. Our study provides an explicit evidence of spin glass like state instead of low temperature antiferromagnetic ground state in the doped compounds.",3
Quantum magnetism of topologically-designed graphene nanoribbons.,"Based on the Hubbard models, quantum magnetism of topologically-designed graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) is studied using exact numerical simulations. We first study a two-band Hubbard model describing the low-energy topological bands using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) methods. It is found the spin correlations decay quickly with the distance, and the local moment is extrapolated to zero in the presence of symmetry-breaking terms. The results show that the two-band Hubbard chain is nonmagnetic, which is in contrast to the mean-field calculation predicting a critical interaction for the magnetic transition. We then include the Hubbard interaction to the topological-designed GNRs. For large interactions, the spin correlations keep finite for all distances, and the magnetic order develops. The local moment is extrapolated to almost zero for weak interactions, and begins to increase rapidly from a critical interaction. The estimated critical value is much larger than the realistic value in graphene, and we conclude the experimentally relevant GNRs is nonmagnetic, which is consistent with the experimental results.&amp;#13.",3
Klein collimation by rippled graphene superlattice.,"The hybridization of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] orbitals of carbon atoms in graphene depends on the surface curvature. Considering a single junction between flat and rippled graphene subsystems, it is found an accumulation of charge in the rippled subsystem due to Klein penetration phenomenon that gives rise to n-p junction. Using this fact, we show that the momentum distribution of electrons in ballisitically propagating beam can be selective without a waveguide, or external electric, and/or magnetic fields in graphene strip under experimentally feasible one-dimensional periodic potential. Such a potential is created with the aid of superlattice that consists of periodically repeated graphene pieces with different hybridizations of carbon orbits, produced by variation of the graphene surface curvature. The charge redistribution and selected transmission of electrons, caused by the superlattice, allows to control the electron focusing in the considered system by simply changing the element properties in the superlattice.",3
Depth resolved defect characterization of low energy ion irradiated ZnO by positron annihilation techniques and photoluminescence.,"Depth resolved positron annihilation spectroscopy has been employed to characterize the 1.2 MeV Ar and 800 keV O ion beam induced defects in ZnO. The first extraordinary result was the observation of defects in ion beam irradiated ZnO beyond the maximum penetration depth of the respective ions. The positron annihilation results revealed the formation of vacancy clusters consisting of both VZn and VO in ZnO which are saturated at a threshold radiation dose (defined as nuclear energy loss, Sn x fluence). From the photoluminescence (PL) spectra it has been observed that the PL intensity at the band edge degraded with the increase of open volume defects in ZnO. The evolution of the 2.4 eV PL spectra, which is linked with the oxygen vacancies, is more significant due to Ar irradiation than the oxygen irradiation.",3
Evidence of 2D anti-ferromagnetic ordering in rare-earth Langmuir-Blodgett films.,"In recent years the ordering of spins in two-dimensions has received considerable attention due to both the fundamental physics interest and for the possible technological applications. Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films with magnetic ions are ideal systems to study two-dimensional (2D) magnetic ordering as the distances of the magnetic-ions along the out-of-plane and in-plane directions differ by almost an order of magnitude and the effect of the substrate can be neglected. In particular, vortex formation in ferro and antiferro 2D magnetic structures are of current interest and LB films are ideal to study this evolving physics. We show here that 2D magnetic ordering along the in-plane direction of multilayered LB films changes from ferromagnetic to anti-ferromagnetic as the rare-earth magnetic ion is changed from Gadolinium (Gd) to Holmium (Ho). The in-plane magnetization results have shown that Gd based LB films exhibit a temperature dependent saturation moment due to the existence of a vortex structure. The results of the magnetization study presented here show that the Ho based LB films exhibit an in-plane anti-ferromagnetic ordering and the saturation moment is found to be almost independent of temperature indicating the absence of spin vortex structures. From a 1/chi - T plot the asymtotic Curie point theta a and the Neel temperature theta N of the Ho-St LB film were found to be 66 K and 42 K respectively.",3
Transient IR spectroscopy as a tool for studying photocatalytic materials.,"Over the years, a considerable amount of attention was given to the thermodynamics of photocatalysts, i.e. to the location of their valence and conduction bands on the energy scale. The kinetics of the photoinduced charge carriers at short times (i.e. prior to their surface redox reactions) is no less important. While significant work on the transient electronic spectra of photocatalysts has been performed, the transient vibrational spectra of this class of materials was hardly studied. This manuscript aims to increase the scientific awareness to the potential of transient IR spectroscopy (TRIR) as a complementary tool for understanding the first, crucial, steps of photocatalytic processes in solid photocatalysts. &amp;#13; This was done herein first by describing the various techniques currently in use for measuring transient IR signals of photo-excited systems and discussing their pros and cons. Then, a variety of examples is given, representing different types of photocatalysts such as oxides (TiO2, NaTaO3, BiOCl, BiVO4), photosensitized oxides (dye-sensitized TiO2), organic polymers (graphitic carbon nitride) and organo-metalic photocatalysts (rhenium bipyridyl complexes). These examples span from materials with no IR fingerprint signals (TiO2) to materials having a distinct spectrum showing well-defined, localized, relatively narrow, vibrational bands (carbon nitride). In choosing the given-above examples, care was made to represent the several pump &amp; probe techniques that are applied when studying transient IR spectroscopy, namely dispersive, transient 2D-IR spectroscopy and step-scan IR spectroscopy. It is hoped that this short review will contribute to expanding the use of TRIR as a viable and important technique among the arsenal of tools struggling to solve the mysteries behind photocatalysis. &amp;#13.",3

Manipulation of non-linear heat currents in the dissipative Anderson-Holstein model.,"The precise control of phonon heat currents will be of primary importance in emerging phononic devices. In this paper, a detailed analysis of electronically controled phonon transport is carried out using an \textit{Anderson-Holstein} based dissipative quantum dot setup. We consider two relevant electronic bias situations: (a) a voltage bias in the absence of an electronic temperature gradient and (b) an electronic temperature gradient at zero voltage. It is shown that the direction of phonon transport in the non-linear regime is different in the two cases since the first case facilitates the accumulation of phonons in the dot and the second case leads to the absorption of phonons in the dot. In the linear regime, both the phonon and electronic transport get decoupled and Onsager's symmetry is verified. We explain the observed cumulative effects of voltage and electronic temperature gradients on the non-linear phonon currents by introducing a new transport coefficient that we term as the \textit{electron induced phonon thermal conductivity}. It is demonstrated that under suitable operating conditions in Case (a) the dot can pump in phonons into the hotter phonon reservoirs and in Case (b) the dot can extract phonons out of the colder phonon reservoirs. Finally, as a corrollary, we elaborate on how the non-linear electronic heat current can be stimulated and controlled by manipulating the temperature of the phonon reservoirs even under vanishing effective electronic charge flow. &amp;#13.",3

(57)Fe Mossbauer and magnetic studies of Th7Co2.5 (57)Fe0.5 and Th7Ni2.5 (57)Fe0.5 superconductors.,"The noncentrosymmetric Th7Co2.5 (57)Fe0.5 and Th7Ni2.5 (57)Fe0.5 superconductors were studied by means of (57)Fe transmission Mossbauer spectroscopy (TMS), ac-magnetic susceptibility and magnetization measurements. The low-temperature data showed that both compounds are type-II superconductors with transition temperature close to [Formula: see text] K. The collected Mossbauer spectra of the studied samples consist of one well-resolved doublet over the temperature range measured. Neither abnormal behaviour of the hyperfine parameters at or near [Formula: see text] nor phonon softening were found. A comparison of (57)Fe Mossbauer data of Ni- and Co-based superconductors with those of Th7Fe3 indicated that with decreasing 3d-electron numbers across the series Th7Ni2.5 (57)Fe0.5 [Formula: see text] Th7Co2.5 (57)Fe0.5 [Formula: see text] Th7Fe3, the s-electron density around the Fe nucleus and as well as the electric field gradient strength increases. The latter finding is associated with increasing asymmetricity of 3d-electron distribution and this fact presumably gives arise to an exotic superconductivity in the Co- and Fe-based compounds.",3
Robust generation of half-metallic transport and pure spin current with photogalvanic effect in zigzag silicene nanoribbons.,"Using first-principles density functional theory combined with non-equilibrium Green's function method, we investigate the spin-dependent current generated by photogalvanic effect (PGE) in photoelectric devices based on zigzag silicence nanoribbons with unsymmetrical sp (2)-sp (3) hydrogen passivated edges (H-2H ZSiNRs) and C s symmetry. Due to their unique atomic structures and spin-semiconductor properties, we find that the flow direction of different spin channels, spin polarization and magnitude of the photocurrent can be efficiently controlled by tuning the photon energy ([Formula: see text]) or polarization/helicity angle ([Formula: see text]) of the incident polarized light. Interestingly, at certain polarization/helicity angles or certain photon energy, 100% spin polarized current can be achieved by either linearly or elliptically polarized light. Further, robust pure spin current without an accompanying charge current can be achieved by the irradiation of linearly and elliptically polarized light when the two leads are in antiparallel magnetic configuration and [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]. Most importantly, without suffering from Schottky barriers or tunnel barriers at metal-semiconductor interfaces, the generated pure spin current or fully spin polarized current in such a purely two-dimensional device with PGE is several orders of magnitude larger than those achieved in metal/semiconductor/metal structures. These numerical results suggest that the asymmetrically sp (2)-sp (3) terminated ZSiNRs are promising materials for construction of novel photoinduced pure spin current and fully spin polarized current generators, which will be of great significance in future spintronic applications.",3
Half-metallicity in CrAl-terminated Co2CrAl thin film.,"Half-metals with high Curie temperature are ideal candidates for applications in spin-based electronics-an emerging technology utilizing a spin degree of freedom in electronic devices. Many half-metallic materials have been predicted theoretically, and some have been confirmed experimentally. At the same time, in thin-film geometry the electronic structure of these materials may change due to the potential presence of surface/interface states. This could limit practical applications of these materials in nano-size devices, since typically these states result in reduced spin-polarization. Here, from first principles we study a full Heusler compound, Co2CrAl in thin film geometry. This material has been studied extensively, and it has been reported that it exhibits half-metallic properties in the bulk. We show contrary to the earlier reports that this material retains 100% spin polarization in CrAl-terminated thin film geometry (Co-termination results in destroyed half-metallicity). Moreover, we confirm that under biaxial strain Co2CrAl retains half-metallicity for a practically feasible range of considered pressure, i.e. in principle it may stay half-metallic if used in thin-film heterostructures, where lattice mismatch is a common scenario. The magnetic alignment of Co2CrAl is confirmed to be ferromagnetic, with the non-integer total magnetic moment of Co-terminated cell, and the integer total magnetic moment of CrAl-terminated cell, consistent with their corresponding non-half-metallic and half-metallic electronic structures. If confirmed experimentally, these results may have an important impact in spin-based electronics.",3
Giant caloric effects enhanced by the helix polarization at the 180 degrees domain wall in tetragonal BaTiO3.,"The electrocaloric and elastocaloric properties at the 180 degrees domain wall in the tetragonal BaTiO3 are studied using the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire model as a function of the domain wall rotation angle alpha. The Ising-Bloch character is predicted at the 180 degrees domain wall in tetragonal BaTiO3 under the flexoelectric effect. The electric field-induced adiabatic temperature change (DeltaT E) which is induced by the Bloch-type polarization component depends on alpha, and a giant positive DeltaT E appears at alpha = (pi + 12n)/24 where n is an integer. The asymmetry of DeltaT E is found around the Bloch-type domain wall. The Bloch-type polarization component has a little contribution to the stress-induced adiabatic temperature change. This calculation indicates a contribution of helix polarization at the domain wall on the caloric effects (CEs) in the ferroelectric materials.",3
Topological phases and pumps in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model periodically modulated in time.,"By the Floquet theory, we transform the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with the periodically modulated nearest-neighbor (NN) and next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) interactions into an effective 2D model, which holds the total Chern number of +/-1 modulated by the parameter theta. Under a staggered electric potential, the topological phase diagrams of the effective 2D model are reshaped and similar to the well-known Haldane model. While under a staggered Zeeman field, the topological phase diagram has the same shape as the former case, but with different Chern numbers, such as the spin and valley Chern numbers. With the combination of the staggered Zeeman field and the electric field, the effective 2D model holds even richer topological phases. At last, we find some types of topological pump, which can generate the time-averaged current without any bias voltage. The current depends on their different Chern numbers. In other words, we can modulate the parameters to obtain various Chern numbers to control the topological pump.",3
THz photodetector using sideband-modulated transport through surface states of a 3D topological insulator.,"The transport properties of the surface charge carriers of a three dimensional topological insulator under a terahertz (THz) field along with a resonant double barrier structure is theoretically analyzed within the framework of Floquet theory to explore the possibility of using such a device for photodetection purposes. We show that due to the contribution of elastic and inelastic scattering processes in the resulting transmission, side-bands are formed in the conductance spectrum. This side band formation is similar to the side-bands formation in cavity transmission spectra in an optical cavity and this information can be used to detect the frequency of unknown THz radiation. The dependence of the conductance on the bias voltage, the effect of THz radiation on resonances and the influence of zero energy points on the transmission spectrum are also discussed.",3
Phase transitions and lattice dynamics in perovskite-type hydride <i>Li</i><sub>x</sub><i>Na</i><sub>1-x</sub><i>MgH</i><sub>3</sub>.,"First principles calculations have been used to investigate the&amp;#13; structural phase transitions and lattice dynamics in the alloy&amp;#13; Lix Na1-xMgH3. The density functional perturbation&amp;#13; theory (DFPT) and the virtual crystal approximation (VCA) are&amp;#13; employed, within the generalized gradient approximation. Our total&amp;#13; energy and formation energy results show that Lix Na1-xMgH3 undergoes a&amp;#13; phase transition from the orthorhombic Pnma phase to the polar R3c&amp;#13; one at a lithium concentration of x = 0.7.

The heat capacity is evaluated from the calculated&amp;#13; phonon spectra and density of states in function of temperature&amp;#13; and lithium concentration in both phases.",3
Dielectric properties of an organic ferroelectric of bromide diisopropylammonium embedded into the pores of nanosized Al2O3 films.,"The study presents experimental results for investigating linear and nonlinear dielectric properties of nanocomposites based on bromide diisopropylammonium (C6H16NBr, DIPAB) and aluminum oxide films (Al2O3) with pore diameter of 330, 100 and 60 nm. It was indicated that the phase transition was blurred and shifted toward lower temperatures. This anomaly became more significant with decreasing pore size. The reduction of phase transition temperature in the nanocomposites, containing DIPAB, was consistent with theoretical models for the influence of size effects on the structural phase transition.",3
Electrical conduction in gold nanoparticles embedded indium oxide films: A crossover from metallic to insulating behavior.,"Electrical conductivity of indium oxide and gold nanoparticles incorporated indium oxide films grown by dc sputtering have been studied in the temperature range 1.5 to 300 K. Films with 0, 6 and 12 % gold nanoparticle volume fraction exhibit metallic nature in the temperature interval 1.5 to 20 K, with conduction being governed by electron-electron interaction. Films with 20 % gold nanoparticle volume fraction showed insulating nature and the conduction was governed by variable range hopping mechanism in the temperature range 1.5 to 50 K. Further a crossover from Efros-Shklovskii to Mott type was observed around 15 K. The transition from metallic to insulating nature in spite of the larger gold nanoparticle volume fraction is attributed to the inhibition of oxygen vacancies by Au species during the film growth. At higher temperatures, all films exhibit activated conduction.",3
A new single-layer structure of MBene family: Ti<sub>2</sub>B.,"In this manuscript, we have carried out combined study of density functional theory (DFT) and&amp;#13; Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for a thorough examine of single-layer (SL) Ti&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;B structure. On the&amp;#13; basis of first-principles, spin-polarized density functional calculations, we showed that free standing&amp;#13; SL-Ti&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;B structure is dynamically and thermally stable. The atomic structure, phonon spectrum,&amp;#13; electronic and magnetic properties of SL-Ti&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;B structure are analyzed. In order to determine ground&amp;#13; state, the structure of Ti&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;B is optimized for four types of spin oriented configurations, namely&amp;#13; ferromagnetic (FM), antiferromagnetic Neel (AFM-Neel), antiferromagnetic Zigzag (AFM-Zigzag)&amp;#13; and antiferromagnetic Stripy (AFM-Stripy) and non-magnetic (NM) states. We found that the spin&amp;#13; configuration FM corresponds to the ground state for SL-Ti&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;B . We also found that the Raman-&amp;#13; active modes are softening in the the AFM cases. On the basis of these results, MC simulations&amp;#13; show that the magnetic susceptibility, thermal variations of magnetization, and specific heat curves&amp;#13; of Ti&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;B exhibit a phase transition between paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases at the Curie&amp;#13; temperature of 39.06 K. While SL-Ti&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;B possess a little out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy, it has not&amp;#13; any in plane magnetic anisotropy energy.",3
Symmetric and antisymmetric electric fields induced spin valves in a zigzag silicene nanoribbon ferromagnetic junction.,"We report a possible two dimensional spin switch based on an even-chain zigzag silicene nanoribbon (ZSR) ferromagnetic junction with two perpendicular staggered electric fields. By calculating the transverse conductance of the device, we find that the metal-insulator phase transition could always occur in the system regardless of two staggered electric fields are symmetric or antisymmetric along the y-axis of the ribbon, which can act as an electrical tunable spin valve to filter and detect one species of spin state. When two symmetric staggered electric fields are applied, both spin up and spin down electrons are prohibited to transport in the same energy region due to the energy gap opened by the homogeneous staggered potentials, which is independent of whether two electric fields are fully or partially distributed. When two staggered electric fields are anti-symmetrically put on the ZSR junction, it has the same energy band symmetry(pseudo-parity) as the pristine ZSR without applying the electric field, the energy band selection rule appears and can be used to generate, separate and detect 100% polarized spin currents combined with the staggered potential. Our findings may provide a possible way to design an electrical controllable spin switch in two dimensional graphene-like materials.",3
Computational study of positron annihilation parameters for cation mono-vacancies and vacancy complexes in nitride semiconductor alloys.,"We calculate positron annihilation parameters, namely the S and W parameters from the Doppler broadening spectroscopy and the positron lifetime [Formula: see text], for defect-free states as well as cation mono-vacancies and vacancy complexes in nitride semiconductor alloys Al0.5Ga0.5N, In0.5Ga0.5N and Al0.5In0.5N. The obtained distributions of these parameters differ from compound to compound. Especially, the S-W relation for In0.5Ga0.5N is very different from that for Al0.5Ga0.5N. For the cation mono-vacancies, introducing local structural parameters, their correlations with S, W and [Formula: see text] are investigated. The S and [Formula: see text] variations are well described with the size distributions of the vacancies while the W variation is related to the presence of localized d electrons. For the vacancy complexes as well as the cation mono-vacancies, multiple-linear-regression models to describe S, W and [Formula: see text] are successfully constructed using the local structural parameters as descriptors. The S-W and S-[Formula: see text] relations are also compared with those for AlN, GaN and InN.",3
Exciton condensation in quantum wells with defects of macroscopic sizes.,"Formation of the excitonic condensed phase in quantum wells with defects of macroscopic size is investigated in the case of a specific kind of defect arising in local areas of planar quantum wells where the wells are thicker or thinner by an atomic monolayer or two. The excitonic system in the wells is non-equilibrium as the excitons are constantly created by an irradiation and decay due to the finite lifetime. The condensation considered in the paper is not the Bose-Einstein condensation but rather the classical condensation due an interaction between excitons with additional peculiarities caused by non-equilibrium conditions. The main contribution to the exciton's energy in the defect's area comes from the energy of the exciton's confinement along the growth axis and the respective quantization of the exciton's levels. The condensation manifests itself by an enhancement the exciton accumulation in the defect's area with increasing pumping and by an appearance of different types of structures in the exciton density distribution when the defect's size is large. The condensed phase may appear in the form of islands or in the form of rings on the defect's boundary. It is shown, that the value of the exciton's lifetime plays an important role in the spatial distribution of the exciton density. The similarity and the difference of density structures for wells with the extra or lacking atomic monolayer in the defect's area are investigated. The specific features of the manifestation of the exciton luminescence at the condensation in the defect's region is analyzed.",3
Information geometric analysis of long range topological superconductors.,"The Uhlmann connection is a mixed state generalization of the Berry connection. The latter has a very important role in the study of topological phases at zero temperature. Closely related, the quantum fidelity is an information theoretical quantity which is a measure of distinguishability of quantum states. Moreover, it has been extensively used in the analysis of quantum phase transitions. In this work, we study topological phase transitions in 1D and 2D topological superconductors with long-range hopping and pairing amplitudes, using the fidelity and the quantity Delta closely related to the Uhlmann connection. The drop in the fidelity and the departure of Delta from zero signal the topological phase transitions in the models considered. The analysis of the fidelity susceptibility and its associated critical exponents are also applied to the study of the aforementioned topological phase transitions.",3
Magnetic and magneto-optical properties of assembly of nanodots obtained from solid-state dewetting of ultrathin cobalt layer.,"Assembly of randomly organized cobalt nanoparticles were obtained by solid-state dewetting of a 3 nm-thick cobalt layer. Vibrating sample magnetometry and Brillouin light scattering techniques were used to investigate both their static and dynamic behaviors with respect to the initial native cobalt layer. The measurements obtained from the assembly of the obtained nanodots were analyzed by means of shape anisotropy contribution. The Brillouin spectra revealed an unusual reversed Stokes/antiStokes line height asymmetry comparing to that observed on the native layer. The e ff ective optical properties of the nanodots, combined with the relation between mean fi eld and inside-dot fi eld allowed explaining the observed reversed height asymmetry. The assembly of nanodots behaves as an e ff ective magnetic and optical medium where these properties can be tuned by the elaboration process.&amp;#13.",3
Superconductivity and the upper critical field in the chiral noncentrosymmetric superconductor NbRh2B2.,"NbRh2B2 crystallises in a chiral noncentrosymmetric structure and exhibits bulk type-II superconductivity below [Formula: see text] K. Here we show that the temperature dependence of the upper critical field deviates from the behaviour expected for both Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg and the Ginzburg-Landau models and that [Formula: see text] T exceeds the Pauli paramagnetic limit, [Formula: see text] T. We explore the reasons for this enhancement. Transverse-field muon spectroscopy measurements suggest that the superconducting gap is either s-wave or [Formula: see text]-wave, and the pressure dependence of [Formula: see text] reveals the superconducting gap is primarily s-wave in character. The magnetic penetration depth [Formula: see text] nm. Heat capacity measurements reveal the presence of a multigap [Formula: see text]-wave superconducting order parameter and moderate electron-phonon coupling.",3
"Rotational design of BP/XY2 (X = Mo, W; Y = S, Se) composites for overall photocatalytic water-splitting.","Photocatalytic water-splitting for hydrogen generation is a promising way to solve the energy crisis, yet the design of efficient photocatalysts is still a challenge. By utilization of first principles calculations, we predict the photocatalytic properties of monolayer boron phosphide (BP) based BP/XY2 (X = Mo, W; Y = S, Se) composites of different rotated configurations. Our results suggest that the BP/XY2 composites can be stably formed, and the narrowed bandgaps ensure these composites are suitable for absorbing visible light. The bandgaps and band edge positions are slightly affected by the rotation angles. The BP/MoS2, BP/MoSe2, and BP/WSe2 are type II heterostructures. Furthermore, the transferred charge from BP to XY2 layers leads to the formation of electric fields, which efficiently separate the photoinduced carriers. The band alignments of BP/MoS2, BP/MoS2, BP/MoSe2, and BP/WSe2 satisfy the requirements of overall water-splitting within the pH scope of 3.6-7.9, 6.8-7.9, 4.0-8.0, and 8.7-8.8. This work will provide valuable insight for designing efficient water-splitting photocatalysts.",3
Revealing fermionic quantum criticality from new Monte Carlo techniques.,"This review summarizes recent developments in the study of fermionic quantum criticality, focusing on new progress in numerical methodologies, especially quantum Monte Carlo methods, and insights that emerged from recently large-scale numerical simulations. Quantum critical phenomena in fermionic systems have attracted decades of extensive research efforts, partially lured by their exotic properties and potential technology applications, and partially awakened by the profound and universal fundamental principles that govern these quantum critical systems. Due to the complex and non-perturbative nature, these systems face the most difficult and challenging problems in the study of modern condensed matter physics, and many important fundamental problems remain open. Recently, new developments in model design and algorithm improvements enabled unbiased large-scale numerical solutions to be achieved in the close vicinity of these quantum critical points, which paves a new pathway towards achieving controlled conclusions through combined efforts of theoretical and numerical studies, as well as possible theoretical guidance for experiments in heavy-fermion compounds, Cu-based and Fe-based superconductors, ultra-cold fermionic atomic gas, twisted graphene layers, etc, where signatures of fermionic quantum criticality exist.",3
Tailoring the growth and electronic structures of organic molecular thin films.,"In the rapidly developing electronics industry, it has become increasingly necessary to explore materials that are cheap, flexible and versatile which have led to significant research efforts towards organic molecular thin films. Organic molecules are unique compared to their inorganic atomic counterparts as their properties can be tuned drastically through chemical functionalization, offering versatility, though their extended shape and weak intermolecular interactions bring significant challenges to the control of both the growth and the electronic structures of molecular thin films. In this paper, we will review the self-assembly process and how to establish long-range ordered organic molecular thin films. We will also discuss how the electronic structures of thin films are impacted by the molecule's local electrostatic environment and its interaction with the substrate, within the context of controlling interfacial energy level alignment between organic semiconductors and electrodes in electronic devices.",3
Correlated Paramagnetism and Interplay of Magnetic and Phononic Degrees of Freedom in 3d-5d Coupled La2CuIrO6.,"Conventional Paramagnetism - a state with finite magnetic moment per ion sans long range magnetic ordering, but with lowering temperature the moment on each ion picks up a particular direction, breaking spin rotational symmetry, and results into long-range magnetic ordering. However, in systems with competing multiple degrees of freedom this conventional notion may easily break and results into short range correlation much above the global magnetic transition temperature. La2CuIrO6 with complex interplay of spins (s =1/2) on Cu site and pseudo-spin (j =1/2) on Ir site owing to strong spin-orbit coupling provides fertile ground to observe such correlated phenomena. By a comprehensive temperature dependent Raman study, we have shown the presence of such a correlated paramagnetic state in La2CuIrO6 much above the long-range magnetic ordering temperature (TN ). Our observation of strong interactions of phonons, associated with Cu/Ir octahedra, with underlying magnetic degrees of freedom mirrored in the observed Fano asymmetry, which remarkably persists as high as ~ 3.5TN clearly signals the existence of correlated paramagnetism hence broken spin rotational symmetry. Our detailed analysis also reveals anomalous changes in the self-energy parameters of the phonon modes, i.e. mode frequencies and linewidth, below TN, providing a useful gauge for monitoring the strong coupling between phonons and magnetic degrees of freedom.",3
Photoinduced polarization enhancement on biased bilayer graphene in the Landau level regime.,"We investigate the charge carrier dynamics in bilayer graphene subject to monochromatic laser irradiation within the Landau level quantization regime. Even though the radiation field does not lift the energy degeneracy of the lowest Landau levels (LLs), it nevertheless has a strong effect on the photoinduced pseudospin polarization response for higher LLs ([Formula: see text]). Our results show that the photoinduced bandgaps lead to a finite response of the averaged pseudospin polarization with nontrivial oscillating behavior. It is shown that the contribution from these higher LL transitions turns out to be crucial to achieve an enhanced photoinduced polarization in radiated bilayer graphene. The experimental feasibility of our findings is also discussed.",3
Nonlinear vibrations of axially moving simply supported viscoelastic nanobeams based on nonlocal strain gradient theory.,"The lateral nonlinear vibration of an axially moving simply supported viscoelastic nanobeam is analysed based on nonlocal strain gradient theory. The proposed model includes the nonlocal parameters and material characteristic length parameters, investigating the two kinds of size effects of micro-nano beam structures. Firstly, the steady-state amplitude-frequency response of the subharmonic parametric resonance is analysed by a direct multiscale method, and the stability of the (non-) zero equilibrium solution determined by the Routh-Hurwitz criterion. Subsequently, the nonlinear frequencies of the nanobeams are calculated. Finally, several numerical examples are used to illustrate the influence of the scale parameters on the nonlinear vibration characteristics of nanobeams. The results show that when subharmonic parametric resonance occurs in the system, the (non-) zero equilibrium solution and the boundary of the instability region are markedly affected by the scale parameters. In addition, the nonlocal parameters soften the system, the material characteristic length parameters harden the system, and these softening and hardening effects are strengthened (or weakened) to varying degrees in the presence of nonlinearity.",3
Enhancement of thermoelectric performance of a nanoribbon made of alpha-Tau<sub>3</sub> lattice.,"We present electronic and transport properties of a zigzag nanoribbon made of $\alpha-\mathcal{T}_3$&amp;#13; lattice. Our particular focus is on the effects of the continuous evolution of the edge modes (&amp;#13; from flat to dispersive) on the thermoelectric transport properties. Unlike the case of graphene&amp;#13; nanoribbon, the zigzag nanoribbon of $\alpha-\mathcal{T}_3$ lattice can host a pair of &amp;#13; dispersive (chiral) edge modes at the two valleys for specific width of the ribbon.&amp;#13; Moreover, gap opening can also occur at the two valleys depending on the width. The slope&amp;#13; of the chiral edge modes and the energy gap strongly depend on the relative strength of two&amp;#13; kinds of hoping parameters present in the system. We compute corresponding transport&amp;#13; coefficients such as conductance, thermopower, thermal conductance and the thermoelectric&amp;#13; figure of merits by using the tight-binding Green function formalism, in order to explore&amp;#13; the roles of the dispersive edge modes. It is found that the thermopower and thermoelectric&amp;#13; figure of merits can be enhanced significantly by suitably controlling the edge modes.&amp;#13; The figure of merits can be enhanced by thirty times under suitable parameter regime in&amp;#13; comparison to the case of graphene. Finally, we reveal that the presence of line defect, &amp;#13; close to the edge, can cause a significant impact on the edge modes as well as on electrical&amp;#13; conductance and thermopower.",3
Monoclinic-tetragonal-monoclinic phase transitions in Eu0.1Bi0.9VO4 under pressure.,"The promising technological material Eu0.1Bi0.9VO4, has been studied for the first time at room-temperature under high-pressure, up to 24.9 GPa, by means of in situ angle dispersive powder x-ray diffraction (XRD). The compound undergoes two phase transitions at 1.9 and 16.1 GPa. The first transition is from the monoclinic fergusonite-type structure (space group I2/a) to a tetragonal scheelite-type structure (space group I41/a), being a ferroelastic-paraelastic transformation similar to that previously reported for isomorphic pristine BiVO4. The second phase transition is first-order in nature. The scheelite-type and the second high-pressure phase coexist in a wide pressure range. A monoclinic structure (space group P21/n) is proposed for the second high-pressure phase. Both transitions are reversible upon decompression. Details of the different crystal structures are reported. All the three observed structures are composed of network of VO4 tetrahedra and BiO8 (or EuO8 due to the substitution of Bi by Eu) dodecahedra. The room-temperature P-V equation of state and axial anisotropic compressibilities of the fergusonite and scheelite polymorphs are also given. In particular, the isothermal compressibility tensor for the monoclinic fergusonite phase has been calculated.",3
Structural evolution and electronic properties of medium-sized boron clusters doped with scandium.,"Doping of boron-based materials with transition metal atoms allows one to tune or modify the properties and structure of the materials. In this work, an extensive search for the global minima on potential energy surfaces of ScB n and ScB[Formula: see text] clusters has been performed using the CALYPSO method. The structural evolution of scandium doped boron clusters of this range is found to proceed in three steps; namely, the formation of half-sandwich type structures is followed by the formation of drum-like structures with the Sc atom located at the center and terminates with the cage-like structures. It is also found that highly symmetrical geometric structures are more common for the smaller size range of [Formula: see text]. The neutral ScB13 cluster is identified as magic on the basis of an analysis of relative stabilities in the ScB n series. Our analysis of chemical bonding has shown that the stability of this cluster is mainly due to the formation of several delocalized [Formula: see text]-bonding molecular orbitals composed of Sc 3d and B 2s atomic orbitals. These bonds appear to be responsible for the enhanced stability of ScB13 with respect to other Sc-doped boron clusters.",3
Magnetism and superconductivity in Fe<sub>1+y</sub>Te<sub>1-x</sub>Se<sub>x</sub>.,"Neutron scattering has played a significant role in characterizing magnetic and structural correlations in Fe$_{1+y}$Te$_{1-x}$Se$_x$ and their connections with superconductivity. Here we review several key aspects of the physics of iron chalcogenide superconductors where neutron studies played a key role. These topics include the phase diagram of Fe$_{1+y}$Te$_{1-x}$Se$_{x}$, where the doping-dependence of structural transitions can be understood from a mapping to the anisotropic random field Ising model. We then discuss orbital-selective Mott physics in the Fe chalcogenide series, where temperature-dependent magnetism in the parent material provided one of the earliest cases for orbital-selective correlation effects in a Hund's metal. Finally, we elaborate on the character of local magnetic correlations revealed by neutron scattering, its dependence on temperature and composition, and the connections to nematicity and superconductivity.",3
Persistent antiferromagnetic order in heavily overdoped Ca1-x La x FeAs2.,"In the Ca1-x La x FeAs2 (1 1 2) family of pnictide superconductors, we have investigated a highly overdoped composition (x = 0.56), prepared by a high-pressure, high-temperature synthesis. Magnetic measurements show an antiferromagnetic transition at T N = 120 K, well above the one at lower doping (0.15 < x < 0.27). Below the onset of long-range magnetic order at T N, the electrical resistivity is strongly reduced and is dominated by electron-electron interactions, as evident from its temperature dependence. The Seebeck coefficient shows a clear metallic behavior as in narrow band conductors. The temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient and the violation of Kohler's rule agree with the multiband character of the material. No superconductivity was observed down to 1.8 K. The success of the high-pressure synthesis encourages further investigations of the so far only partially explored phase diagram in this family of Iron-based high temperature superconductors.",3
Geometrically frustrated anisotropic four-leg spin-1/2 nanotube.,"We develop a real space quantum renormalization group (QRG) to explore a frustrated anisotropic four-leg spin-1/2 nanotube in the thermodynamic limit.&amp;#13; We obtain the phase diagram, fixed points, critical points, the scaling of coupling constants and magnetization curves.&amp;#13; Our investigation points out that in the case of strong leg coupling the diagonal frustrating interaction is marginal under QRG transformations and does not affect the universality class of the model.&amp;#13; Remarkably, the renormalization equations express that the spin nanotube prepared in the strong leg coupling case goes to the strong plaquette coupling limit (weakly interacting plaquettes).&amp;#13; Subsequently, in the limit of weakly interacting plaquettes, the model is mapped onto a 1D spin-1/2 XXZ chain in a longitudinal magnetic field under QRG transformation.&amp;#13; Furthermore, the effective Hamiltonian of the spin nanotube inspires both first and second order phase transitions accompanied by the fractional magnetization plateaus.&amp;#13; Our results show that the anisotropy changes the magnetization curve and the phase transition points, significantly.&amp;#13; Finally, we report the numerical exact diagonalization results to compare the ground state phase diagram with our analytical visions.",3
Commensurability and quantum interference magnetotransport oscillations in a two-dimensional electron gas sandwiched by superconductors.,"Magnetic-field dependence of the transport properties of ballistic two-dimensional electrons in a planar superconductor-normal-conductor-superconductor structure is numerically investigated. In the circumstance where the Andreev reflection from the normal-conductor-superconductor interfaces is almost perfect, two oscillatory behaviors occur for magnetic fields higher and lower than that for the coincidence of the cyclotron diameter with the separation between the superconductors. The oscillation period for the former and latter cases is proportional to the magnetic field and inverse of the magnetic field, respectively. The low-field oscillation originates from commensurability-driven guiding of Andreev-reflected trajectories along the interfaces between the normal conductor and the superconductors. If the Andreev reflection probability is considerably less than unity, the commensurability oscillation is suppressed in amplitude and is dwarfed by additionally emerged oscillations originating from the quantum interference between the Andreev- and normal-reflected components.",3
Approximate expression for the ground-state energy of the two- and three-dimensional Hubbard model at arbitrary filling obtained from dimensional scaling.,"We generalize the linear discrete dimensional scaling approach for the repulsive Hubbard model to obtain a nonlinear scaling relation that yields accurate approximations to the ground-state energy in both two and three dimensions, as judged by comparison to auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) data. Predictions are made for the per-site ground-state energies in two and three dimensions for n (filling factor) and U (Coulomb interaction) values for which QMC data are currently unavailable.",3
Hierarchical complex self-assembly in binary nanoparticle mixtures.,"Hierarchical self-assembly of soft matter provides a powerful route to create complex materials with enhanced physical properties. The understanding of the fundamental processes leading to such organization can provide design rules to create new functional materials. In this work, we use a simple model of polymer-grafted nanoparticles to explore the self-assembly of binary mixtures. By using Monte Carlo simulations we study the interplay of composition, density and particle sizes on the self-organization of such nanoparticle systems. It is found that complex hierarchical organization can take place for conditions where one-component systems form simple lattices. In particular, a mixture where one component forms a structure with 18-fold symmetry in a sea of an apparent disordered phase of the second component is observed to emerge for certain parameter combinations.",3
Chiral Fe nanotubes with both negative Poisson's ratio and Poynting's effect. Atomistic simulation.,"Using atomistic calculations, we study the features of uniaxial deformation of nanotubes made of rolled-up thin [0 1 0] plates of Fe cubic crystals. We find that within a certain range of chiral angles these nanotubes have both negative Poisson's ratio and axial strain-induced torsion (reverse Poynting's effect) during tension and compression. The maximum torsion and the minimum value of Poisson's ratio are observed at chiral angles of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], respectively. We show that Young's modulus of the chiral Fe nanotubes increases with a chiral angle. We demonstrate that in the discussed range of nanotube sizes there is a satisfactory correspondence between the results obtained by molecular statics and anisotropic theory of elasticity.",3
Explanation of an unexpected occurrence of [Formula: see text] fractional quantum Hall effect states in monolayer graphene.,"Recent experiment reveals the appearance of incompressible fractional quantum Hall effect states in monolayer graphene at [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] substituting the compressible Hall metal states at these fillings in the lowest Landau level in a narrow magnetic field window depending on the sample parameters. Simultaneously, none such behavior has been observed either for [Formula: see text] or [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text]. We propose an explanation of these observations in terms of homotopy of monolayer graphene in consistence with a general theory of correlated states in planar Hall systems.",3
Unveiling the tunneling phenomena in graphene-graphene homo-junctions for emerging device applications.,"Motivated by the idea that high-quality graphene always produces innovative aspects of physics. In this outline, a novel class of two-dimensional (2D) assembly namely thickness controlled homo-junctions with a configuration similar to graphene-insulator-graphene is introduced in this work. We demonstrate 2D-2D quantum tunneling between two graphene stacks in which van der Waals gap serves the purpose of tunneling barrier. The nonlinear I-V characteristics with improved current switching ratio (I on / I off) of ~10(6) coupled with counterclockwise current hysteresis which are the signatures of a memristive devices has been validated in the tunneling regime. It is the first time to report on revealing thickness modulated 2D homo junctions in exfoliated graphenic material and to disclose the involved tunneling mechanism for switching applications. This work promises well for the possibilities of graphene sheets for the realization of two terminal configured devices as a substitute of three terminal graphene based field effect transistors in the area of resistive switching memories. As graphene being a versatile candidate possessing durable future in nano-electronics, therefore understanding deep insights of its charge carrier transport mechanism under range of bias voltages is prerequisite. Strikingly, an unconventional approach for improving on/off ratio of graphene based resistive switching devices has been put forward in the present report.",3
"Interaction of O-Y and O-Y-Ti clusters embedded in bcc Fe with He, vacancies and self-interstitial atoms.","Calculations based on density functional theory are performed to investigate the interaction of O-Y and O-Y-Ti clusters in bcc Fe with He atoms, vacancies (v) and self-interstitial atoms (SIA). The four different cluster structures studied in our previous work (J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 31 095701) are considered. He, v and SIA are inserted on different positions inside and in the environment of the clusters, the total energy of the corresponding supercell is minimized and the binding and incorporation energy of the three kinds of defects is determined. He in the center of a cage-like (CL) cluster is more stable than on interfacial vacant sites (IVS). In CL O-Y clusters He on an IVS is more stable than in the cluster structure with oxygen in the center, whereas there is no significant difference between the two kinds for clusters with Ti. Up to a distance of 1.5 times the iron lattice constant from the cluster center He is not stable on most of the octahedral and tetrahedral interstitial sites in the Fe matrix near the interface. Instead He is shifted towards positions closer to the cluster. Relaxation occurs to known IVS as well as to previously unknown interfacial interstitial sites. Moreover, two or three He atoms are placed on sites found to be stable after adding a single He. The corresponding binding and incorporation energies obtained after relaxation are nearly equal to the sum of the values for the interaction with a single He atom. However, placing He dimers or trimers in the environment of a vacancy may also lead to relatively low values of the incorporation energy. Also, barriers for jumps of He atoms between interfacial sites and the center of CL clusters are determined. In the CL O-Y cluster the barriers are lower than in the CL O-Y-Ti cluster, i.e. trapping and release of He is easier in the former than in the latter. v and SIA interaction with the clusters is also attractive. The binding energy of v strongly depends on the site where v is inserted while in all studied cases the SIA is annihilated at the cluster-iron interface. Present results clearly demonstrate that the oxide-based nanoclusters are strong traps for irradiation induced defects which is in agreement with experimental findings.",3
Spin structure and spin Hall magnetoresistance of epitaxial thin films of the insulating non-collinear antiferromagnet SmFeO3.,"We report a combined study of imaging the antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin structure and measuring the spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) in epitaxial thin films of the insulating non-collinear antiferromagnet SmFeO3. X-ray magnetic linear dichroism photoemission electron microscopy measurements reveal that the AFM spins of the SmFeO3(1 1 0) align in the plane of the film. Angularly dependent magnetoresistance measurements show that SmFeO3/Ta bilayers exhibit a positive SMR, in contrast to the negative SMR expected in previously studied collinear AFMs. The SMR amplitude increases linearly with increasing external magnetic field at higher magnetic fields, suggesting that field-induced canting of the AFM spins plays an important role. In contrast, around the coercive field, no detectable SMR signal is observed, indicating that the SMR of the AFM and canting magnetization components cancel out. Below 50 K, the SMR amplitude increases sizably by a factor of two as compared to room temperature, which likely correlates with the long-range ordering of the Sm ions. Our results show that the SMR is a sensitive technique for non-equilibrium spin systems of non-collinear AFMs.",3
"Structural, electronic and energetic properties of uranium-americium mixed oxides [Formula: see text] using DFT[Formula: see text] calculations.","In this paper, we determine for the first time the electronic, structural and energetic properties of [Formula: see text] mixed oxides in the entire range of Am content using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)[Formula: see text] in combination with the special quasirandom structure (SQS) approach to reproduce chemical disorder. This study reveals that in [Formula: see text] oxides, Am cations act as electron acceptors, whereas U cations act as electron donors showing a fundamental difference with [Formula: see text] or [Formula: see text] in which there is no cation valence change in stoichiometric conditions compared to the pure oxides. We show for the first time that the lattice parameter of stoichiometric [Formula: see text] follows a linear evolution which is the structural signature of an ideal solid solution behavior. Finally, using two approaches (SQS and parametric), we show by assessing the enthalpy of mixing that there is no phase separation in the whole range of Am concentration.",3
Magnetocaloric effect as a signature of quantum level-crossing for a spin-gapped system.,"Recent research dealing with magnetocaloric effect (MCE) study of antiferromagnetic (AFM) low dimensional spin systems have revealed a number of fascinating ground-state crossover characteristics upon application of external magnetic field. Herein, through MCE investigation we have explored field-induced quantum level-crossing characteristics of one such spin system: [Formula: see text] (NCP), an AFM spin 1/2 dimer. Experimental magnetization and specific heat data are presented and the data have been employed to evaluate entropy, magnetic energy and magnetocaloric properties. We witness a sign change in magnetic Gruneisen parameter across the level-crossing field B C . An adiabatic cooling is observed at low temperature by tracing the isentropic curves in temperature-magnetic field plane. Energy-level crossover characteristics in NCP interpreted through MCE analysis are well consistent with the observations made from magnetization and specific heat data.",3
"Strained epitaxial interfaces of metal (Pd, Pt, Au) overlayers on nonpolar CdS (10-10) surfaces from first-principles.","The depositions of (111) and (100) overlayers of Pd, Pt and Au on the CdS (10-10) surface are studied within epitaxial&amp;#13; mismatches of 6-7%, using spin-polarized density functional theory. For both compressively strained and tensilestrained&amp;#13; interfaces, the (100) overlayers were found to be thermodynamically more stable owing to better interfacial&amp;#13; matching, and higher surface under-coordination resulting in higher reactivity. Pt(111) exhibits slip dislocations even for&amp;#13; five-atomic-layer thick Pt slabs. Along with the leading metal-S interaction, the interfacial charge transfers indicate&amp;#13; a weak metal-Cd interaction which decreases in strength in the order Pd&amp;gt;Pt~Au. For the same substrate area, the&amp;#13; accumulation of electronic charge for Pt overlayers is 1.5-2 times larger than that of Pd and Au. The n-type Schottky&amp;#13; barriers of Au overlayers with the minimum mismatch are within 0.1 eV of the predictions of Schottky-Mott rule,&amp;#13; indicating a relatively ideal, scantily reactive interface structure. This is in clear contrast to the Pt epitaxial overlayers&amp;#13; which deviate by 0.6-0.8 eV.",3
Cs2TlBiI6: a new lead-free halide double perovskite with direct band gap.,"The recent development of halide double perovskites A2B'B""X6 with favorable band gaps have provided a new search direction for stable Pb-free perovskite solar cells. Here, we propose a new lead free double perovskite Cs2TlBiI6 as a potential candidate for perovskite solar cell absorber. We probe the structural, electronic and optical properties of this material through density functional theory calculations. Our calculations on this material show that Cs2TlBiI6 adopt cubic double perovskite structure with space group Fm-3m. Using PBE exchange-correlation functional we obtain direct band gap of about 1.37 eV at the centre of Brillouin zone. The direct band gap and strong optical absorption of this material in the visible energy range of solar spectrum implies that Cs2TlBiI6 can be a potential candidate for perovskite based solar cell. Our fundamental calculations on this material would open up further possibility of experimental studies on TlBi based perovskite.",3
Second order structure functions for higher powers of turbulent velocity.,"We experimentally study the temporal second-order structure functions for integer powers of turbulent fluid velocity fluctuations [Formula: see text], in three dimensional (3D) and two dimensional (2D) turbulence. Here [Formula: see text] is a composite time-series constructed by averaging the concurrent time-series ([Formula: see text]) sampled at N spatially distributed Eulerian points. The N = 1 case has been extensively studied for velocity fluctuations (m = 1) and to a lesser extent for m > 1. The averaging method in case of N > 1 diverges from the Kolmogorov framework and has not been studied because fluctuations in [Formula: see text] are expected to smooth with increasing N leaving behind uninteresting large-scale mean flow information, but we find this is not so. We report the evolution of scaling exponents [Formula: see text] for [Formula: see text] in going from a single (N = 1) to a spatial average over several Eulerian points ([Formula: see text]). Our 3D experiments in a tank with rotating jets at the floor show [Formula: see text] for all m-values in agreement with prior results and evolves to an asymptotic value of [Formula: see text]. The evolution of [Formula: see text] follows the functional form [Formula: see text], where [Formula: see text] points is the only fit parameter representing the convergence rate constant. Results for the 2D experiments conducted in a gravity assisted soap film in the enstrophy cascade regime are in sharp contrast with their 3D counterparts. Firstly [Formula: see text] varies polynomially with m and asymptotes to a constant value at m = 5. Secondly, the evolution of [Formula: see text] is logarithmic [Formula: see text], where A and B are fit parameters and eventually deviates at large N and asymptotes to [Formula: see text] for all m. The starkly different convergence forms (exponential in 3D versus logarithmic in 2D) may be interpreted as a signature of inter-scale couplings in the respective turbulent flows by decomposing the two-point correlator for [Formula: see text] into a self-correlation and cross-correlation term. In addition to aiding in the theoretical development, the results may also have implications for determination of resolution in 2D turbulence experiments and simulations, wind energy and atmospheric boundary layer turbulence.",3
From IR to x-rays: gaining molecular level insights on metal-organic frameworks through spectroscopy.,"This topical review focuses on the application of several types of spectroscopy methods to a class of solid state materials called metal organic frameworks (MOFs). MOFs are self-assembled, porous crystalline materials composed of metal cluster nodes linked through coordination bonds with organic or organometallic molecular constituents. Their unique host-guest properties make them attractive for many adsorption-based applications such as gas storage and separation, catalysis, sensing and others. While much research focuses on the development and application of these materials, fundamental studies of MOF properties and molecular level host-guest interactions behind their functionality have become a significant research direction on its own. Spectroscopy methods are now ubiquitous tools in this pursuit. This review focuses on the application of three classes of spectroscopy methods to MOF materials: vibrational, optical electronic and x-ray spectroscopies. Following brief introductions to each method that include pertinent theory and experimental considerations, we present a broad overview of the types of MOF systems that have been studied, with specific examples and important new molecular level insights highlighted along the way. The current status of spectroscopic studies of MOFs is presented at the end along with some perspectives on the future directions in this area of research.",3
Generalized Lorentz reciprocal theorem in complex fluids and in non-isothermal systems.,"The classical Lorentz reciprocal theorem (LRT) was originally derived for slow viscous flows of incompressible Newtonian fluids under the isothermal condition. In the present work, we extend the LRT from simple to complex fluids with open or moving boundaries that maintain non-equilibrium stationary states. In complex fluids, the hydrodynamic flow is coupled with the evolution of internal degrees of freedom such as the solute concentration in two-phase binary fluids and the spin in micropolar fluids. The dynamics of complex fluids can be described by local conservation laws supplemented with local constitutive equations satisfying Onsager's reciprocal relations (ORR). We consider systems in quasi-stationary states close to equilibrium, controlled by the boundary variables whose evolution is much slower than the relaxation in the system. For these quasi-stationary states, we derive the generalized LRT and global Onsager's reciprocal relations (GORR) for the slow variables at boundaries. This establishes the connection between ORR for local constitutive equations and GORR for constitutive equations at boundaries. Finally, we show that the LRT can be further extended to non-isothermal systems by considering as an example the thermal conduction in solids and still fluids.",3
Structural and topological phase transitions induced by strain in two-dimensional bismuth.,"We employ first-principles density-functional calculations to study structural and topological electronic transitions in two-dimensional bismuth layers. Our calculations reveal that a free-standing hexagonal bismuthene phase (the most stable one in the absence of strain) should become thermodinamically unstable against transformation to a putative 'pentaoctite' phase (composed entirely of pentagonal and octagonal rings), under biaxial tensile strain. Moreover, our results indicate that 2D bismuth layers in the pentaoctite phase should undergo a topological electronic phase transition under either a biaxial or uniaxial tensile strain. More specifically, at its equilibrium lattice parameters the pentaoctite lattice is a topologically trivial system with a direct band gap. Strain-induced parity inversion of valence and conduction bands is obtained, and the pentaoctite structure undergoes a transition to a topological-insulator phase at a biaxial tensile strain of 5%. In the case of uniaxial tensile strains, the topological transition happens at a tensile strain of 6% along the armchair direction of the pentaoctite lattice, and at a 5% tensile strain in the zigzag direction. Our study indicates that 2D bismuth layers may prove themselves a rich platform to realize topologically non-trivial 2D materials upon strain engineering.",3
Electrical tuning of helical edge states in topological multilayers.,"Mainstream among topological insulators, GaSb/InAs quantum wells present a broken gap alignment for the energy bands which supports the quantum spin Hall insulator phase and forms an important building block in the search of exotic states of matter. Such structures allow the band-gap inversion with electrons and holes confined in adjacent layers, providing a fertile ground to tune the corresponding topological properties. Using a full 3D eight-band [Formula: see text] method we investigate the inverted band structure of GaSb/InAs/GaSb and InAs/GaSb/InAs multilayers and the behavior of the helical edge states, under the influence of an electric field applied along the growth direction. By tuning the electric field modulus, we induce the change of the energy levels of both conduction and valence bands, resulting in a quantum spin Hall insulator phase where the helical edge states are predominantly confined in the GaSb layer. In particular, we found that InAs/GaSb/InAs has a large hybridization gap of about [Formula: see text] and, therefore, are promising to observe massless Dirac fermions with a large Fermi velocity. Our comprehensive characterization of GaSb/InAs multilayers creates a basis platform upon which further optimization of III-V heterostructures can be contrasted.",3
Role of hydration water in the onset of protein structural dynamics.,"Proteins are the molecular workhorses in a living organism. Their 3D structures are animated by a multitude of equilibrium fluctuations and specific out-of-equilibrium motions that are required for proteins to be biologically active. When studied as a function of temperature, functionally relevant dynamics are observed at and above the so-called protein dynamical transition (~240 K) in hydrated, but not in dry proteins. In this review we present and discuss the main experimental and computational results that provided evidence for the dynamical transition, with a focus on the role of hydration water dynamics in sustaining functional protein dynamics. The coupling and mutual influence of hydration water dynamics and protein dynamics are discussed and the hypotheses illustrated that have been put forward to explain the physical origin of their onsets.",3
"Structure-property correlation studies of alkaline-earth metal-azides M(N3)2 (M = Sr, Ba).","Inorganic metal azides M(N3)2 (M = Sr, Ba) and metal nitrates M(NO3)2 (M = Sr, Ba) are interesting materials due to their wide range of industrial usefulness as gas generators, pyrotechnics, photo graphic materials and explosives. In this work, we explore the mechanical, vibrational (infrared, phonon dispersion), Born effective charge (BEC) and thermodynamic properties of these materials to understand the sensitivity correlation studies using plane wave pseudopotential method. As these materials are layered with crucial non bonding interactions, the generalized gradient approximation with Tkatchenko-Scheffler (for Sr(N3)2) and Ortmann-Bechstedt-Schmidt (for Ba(N3)2) dispersion correction methods are adopted to compute accurate ground state properties with norm-conserving pseudopotentials. The calculated lattice parameters, unit cell volumes, bond lengths are well reproduced with 1% deviation when compared to the experimental and previously reported theoretical data. The mechanical (single crystal, poly-crystalline elastic constants) property correlations corroborate with the experimental impact sensitivity trend. The vibrational, phonon dispersion spectra's, BEC's, thermodynamic properties calculated with density functional perturbative theory approach provide better conclusions about the dynamical stability and polarization (optical sensitivity) trends. From the BEC results we propose that M(NO3)2 (M = Sr, Ba) materials may find various optical applications too. Overall, we tried to explain the crucial reasons for the differences in energetic properties of the studied materials.",3
"Complex magnetism of B20-MnGe: from spin-spirals, hedgehogs to monopoles.","B20 compounds are the playground for various non-trivial magnetic textures such as skyrmions, which are topologically protected states. Recent measurements on B20-MnGe indicate no clear consensus on its magnetic behavior, which is characterized by the presence of either spin-spirals or three-dimensional objects interpreted to be a cubic lattice of hedgehogs and anti-hedgehogs. Utilizing a massively parallel linear scaling all-electron density functional algorithm, we find from full first-principles simulations on cells containing thousands of atoms that upon increase of the compound volume, the state with lowest energy switches across different magnetic phases: ferromagnetic, spin-spiral, hedgehog and monopole.",3
Surface state transport in double-gated and magnetized topological insulators with hexagonal warping effects.,"We explore the scattering of Dirac electrons in a double-gated topological insulator in the presence of magnetic proximity effects and warped surface states. It is found that a magnetic field can shift the Dirac cone in momentum space and deform the constant-energy contour, or opens up a band gap at the Dirac point, depending on the magnetization orientation. The double gate voltage induces quantum wells and/or quantum barriers on the surface of topological insulators, generating surface resonant tunnelling states. It is found that the hexagonal warping effect can increase the electronic transport at high energies when the constant-energy contour exhibits a snowflake shape. The energy-dependent conductances in the parallel and antiparallel magnetic configurations exhibit out-of-phase oscillations due to the quantum interference of propagating waves in the region between the two magnetized segments. Although the conductance spectrum of the double-well structure is higher than that of the double-barrier structure, the magnetoresistance ratio versus the separation distance between the two magnetized barriers exhibits pronounced oscillations due to the resonant tunnelling states. We show that the surface state transport can be controlled by the exchange field and gate voltage without breaking time reversal symmetry, suggesting that the double gated and magnetized topological insulators can be utilized to achieve a large magnetoresistance ratio with a tunable sign.",3
The specific heat and magnetic properties of two species of spin-1/2 ladders with butterfly-shaped unit blocks.,"Studies of the structural effects on the thermodynamic properties of two types of Ising-Heisenberg ladders are comprehensively reported. Each structure comprises spin-1/2 particles partitioned into adjoined blocks or cages formed from butterfly-shaped plaquettes and interacting in an Ising manner. We use the transfer-matrix approach to determine the partition functions of these models and numerically investigate their magnetization and specific-heat properties. Both models illustrate all characteristic features of low-temperature magnetization processes and thermodynamics properties such as abrupt variations of the magnetization curves, Schottky-type peak and a double-peak structure of the specific heat. Comparisons between the two ladders reveal some differences in their magnetic and thermodynamic behaviors. For instance, difference in the number of intermediate magnetization plateaus, also difference in the height and temperature-position of the specific heat peaks. We also present that the fluctuations of the specific heat with respect to the magnetic field are in highly accordance with the magnetization plateaus and magnetization jumps. Moreover, we find quite interesting threshold reentrance points within the matrix-plot of the specific heat shown in the (T/J - B/J) plane, at which the temperature-position of the Schottky peak alternatively change. Finally, we prove that the reentrance points can be satisfactorily considered as magnetization plateau witnesses even in the high temperatures.",3
"Surface plasmon-polaritons in graphene, embedded into medium with gain and losses.","The paper deals with the theoretical consideration of surface plasmon-polaritons in the graphene monolayer, embedded into dielectric with spatially separated gain and losses. It is demonstrated, that presence of gain and losses in the system leads to the formation of additional mode of graphene surface plasmon-polaritons, which does not have its counterpart in the conservative system. When the gain and losses are mutually balanced, the position of exceptional point-transition point between unbroken and broken [Formula: see text]-symmetry-can be effectively tuned by graphene's doping. In the case of unbalanced gain and losses the spectrum of surface plasmon-polaritons contains spectral singularity, whose frequency is also adjustable through the electrostatic gating of graphene.",3
Distorted structures in half-filled p-band materials.,"Many half-filled p-band materials form complex, semiconducting or semi-metallic crystallographic structures, which are commonly conceived of as distortions of simpler, higher-symmetry structures. This distortion is conventionally attributed to the energy gained by the opening of a band gap in the vicinity of the Fermi level, which was assumed to lower the overall energy of the lattice. Applying DFT calculations of the total energy and its component terms to both elemental and binary half-filled p-band materials, we show that the energy gain from distortion arises from the Coulombic interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that although the distortion is followed by an opening of a band gap, there may be other changes of the same order of magnitude in lower energy levels of the electrons. These results are demonstrated to apply both in the distortion parameter space of a specific phase and between different phases with different symmetries. It is therefore our conclusion that, in contrast to the prevailing concept, the metal-semiconductor or metal-semimetal transitions of such materials are the consequence of the distortion rather than its cause. This may suggest a more general mechanism of high-to-low symmetry transitions, relevant also to other distorted structures which do not demonstrate the same electronic transitions.",3
Medium-range order in amorphous ices revealed by persistent homology.,"Despite the amorphous nature of glassy water, x-ray or neutron scattering experiments reveal sharp peaks in the structure factor, indicating the existence of medium-range order (MRO) in the system. However the real space origin of the peaks has yet to be disclosed. Herein, we use a combined approach of molecular dynamics simulations and persistent homology (PH) to investigate two types of glassy water, low-density amorphous (LDA) and high-density amorphous (HDA) ices. We present prominent MRO ring structures in each type of the ices, distinguished by their size and shape as well as the number of their components: MRO rings in HDA are observed smaller, less planar and more membered, compared to those in LDA. The PH-extracted MRO rings successfully reproduce the quantitative features, including the position and width, of the first sharp diffraction peaks in the structure factor, hence suitably serving as the origin of experimental MRO signatures in the amorphous ices. Our study supports that PH is an effective tool to identify hidden MRO in amorphous configurations.",3
Frustration phenomenon in the spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg planar model of inter-connected trigonal bipyramid structures.,"Ground-state and finite-temperature properties of the exactly solvable mixed spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg planar model composed of identical trigonal bipyramids that are arranged into a regular archimedean lattice are examined with the aim to clarify the frustration phenomenon at zero and finite temperatures. It is shown that the ground-state spin frustration persists even far above the second-order phase transition. If the interaction ratio between the Heisenberg and Ising exchange interactions is close enough to the ground-state boundaries between the neighboring phases, a remarkable re-entrance of the (non-)frustrated spin arrangement of the Heisenberg spins can be observed around the critical temperature of the model. It is also evidenced that entropy and specific heat show pronounced temperature variations not only around the critical temperature, but also in low-temperature regime if values of the interaction parameters are taken from neighborhood of the ground-state phase transitions, where energies of the neighboring phases are very close.",3
Stress- and electric-field-induced band gap tuning in hexagonal boron phosphide layers.,"Two-dimensional hexagonal boron phosphide presents great potential in applications of electronics and optoelectronics due to its high carrier mobility and moderate band gap. In this work, we investigate the effect of stress and electric field on the electronic properties of hexagonal boron phosphide layers based on first-principles calculations. We find that both the band gap and the carrier effective masses of hexagonal boron phosphide monolayer gradually increase with stress from compression to tension. As for hexagonal boron phosphide bilayer with two stacking orders (AB_B-P and AB_B-B) upon applied electric field, the band gap monotonously increases with the enhancement of electric field for AB_B-P bilayer, while it undergoes a band gap closing and reopening process for AB_B-B bilayer. We employ the tight-binding model to explain the mechanism of different band gap variations of two stacking orders with electric field. Moreover, we discuss the band gap variation of hexagonal boron phosphide bilayer with combined effect of stress and electric field. The investigation here presents an insight into the effective manipulation towards the electronic properties of hexagonal boron phosphide, which will further enable the broader applications of the hexagonal boron phosphide in modern electronic and optoelectronic fields.",3
Bandwidth renormalization due to the intersite Coulomb interaction.,"The theory of correlated electrons is currently moving beyond the paradigmatic Hubbard U, towards the investigation of intersite Coulomb interactions. Recent investigations have revealed that these interactions are relevant for the quantitative description of realistic materials. Physically, intersite interactions are responsible for two rather different effects: screening and bandwidth renormalization. We use a variational principle to disentangle the roles of these two processes and study how appropriate the recently proposed Fock treatment of intersite interactions is in correlated systems. The magnitude of this effect in graphene is calculated based on cRPA values of the intersite interaction. We also apply the variational principle to benzene and find effective parameters comparable to those obtained by ab initio density matrix downfolding.",3
"Insights on the Jahn-Teller distortion, hydrogen bonding and local-environment correlations in a promised multiferroic hybrid perovskite.","Perovskite-type formates have recently emerged as potential candidates for multiferroics. Previous ab initio calculations have concluded that copper guanidinium formate (CuGF) is a promising multiferroic. Although ab initio design and characterisation of inorganic multiferroics is at a mature stage, this situation is not true for multiferroic metal-organic frameworks. Regardless of these limitations, such predictions have also been extended to other materials. Here, we present with deeper insights into the structural aspects based on single crystal neutron diffraction studies, questioning such predictions in CuGF. The comparative investigation of the polar CuGF and its centrosymmetric cousin, MnGF, uncovers the differences in the N-Hcdots, three dots, centeredO bonds. Such differences are associated with the Jahn-Teller distortion, which balances its influence on the local-environment of the three sets of ND2 in the guanidinium cation. Hydrogen bonds which were not dealt with in the previous ab initio studies have been carefully treated in this experimental study. Hence, providing a crucial understanding based on which an encouraging platform may be rendered for improving the ab initio calculations for hybrid perovskites catering various applications.",3
Black phosphorene exhibiting negative thermal expansion and negative linear compressibility.,"Positive expansion on heating, and positive contraction on hydrostatic compression are our general understanding. Actually, the abnormal negative thermal expansion (NTE) or negative linear compressibility (NLC) behavior is permissible, but exists in very few materials. Interestingly, we find that the NTE and NLC behaviors can coexist in the low-dimensional black phosphorene using first-principles calculations. In the temperature-field, the volume-NTE of black phosphorene can be exhibited below about 200 K, while the axial-NTE exists in the whole studied temperature range. In the hydrostatic pressure-field, the NLC behavior can occur along a zigzag direction or armchair direction in different pressure ranges. The phonon abnormality in black phosphorene is detected. It is found that acoustic phonons, especially the lowest-frequency TA z mode, play a very important role. The re-entrant honeycomb network in black phosphorene, as the specific topology, will facilitate the occurrence of NTE and NLC behaviors. This work can provide some foundations and clues for exploring the abnormal properties in other 2D materials.",3
Destructive quantum interference in transport through molecules with electron-electron and electron-vibration interactions.,"We study the transport through a molecular junction exhibiting interference effects. We show that these effects can still be observed in the presence of molecular vibrations if Coulomb repulsion is taken into account. In the Kondo regime, the conductance of the junction can be changed by several orders of magnitude by tuning the levels of the molecule, or displacing a contact between two atoms, from nearly perfect destructive interference to values of the order of 2e (2)/h expected in Kondo systems. We also show that this large conductance change is robust for reasonable temperatures and voltages for symmetric and asymmetric tunnel couplings between the source-drain electrodes and the molecular orbitals. This is relevant for the development of quantum interference effect transistors based on molecular junctions.",3
Dependence of the magnetic interactions in MoS2 monolayer on Mn-doping configurations.,"Understanding the magnetic properties of the various Mn doping configurations that can be encountered in 2H-MoS2 monolayer could be beneficial for its use in spintronics. Using density functional theory plus Hubbard term (DFT + U) approach, we study how a single isolated, double- and triple-substitution configurations of Mn atoms within a MoS2 monolayer could contribute to its total magnetization. We find that the doping-configuration plays a critical role in stabilizing a ferromagnetic state in a Mn-doped MoS2 monolayer. Indeed, the Mn-Mn magnetic interaction is found to be ferromagnetic and strong for Mn in equidistant substitution positions where the separation average range of 6-11 [Formula: see text]. The strongest ferromagnetic interaction is found when substitutions are in second nearest neighbor Mo-sites of the armchair chain. Clustering is energetically favorable but it strongly reduces the ferromagnetic exchange energies. Furthermore, in term of electronic properties, we show that the Mn-doped MoS2 monolayer can change its electronic behavior from semiconductor to half-metallic depending on the doping configuration. Our results suggest that ordering the Mn dopants on MoS2 monolayer is needed to increase its potential ferromagnetism.",3
"Density functional study of structural, electronic and magnetic properties of new half-metallic ferromagnetic double perovskite Sr2MnVO6.","In this paper, a new half-metallic (HM) double perovskite compound is predicted with the simultaneous presence of ferromagnetism and polar distortion. The structural, electronic and magnetic properties of Sr2MnVO6 (SMVO) are calculated by density functional theory (DFT) with both generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and GGA + U approaches, where U is the on-site Coulomb interaction parameter. Different orderings of B (B') cationic sites in A2BB'O6 double perovskite structure are evaluated, including rocksalt, columnar and layered arrangements for cubic, monoclinic and tetragonal crystal structures. It is found that the most stable ordering is obtained when B and B' are placed in a layered type ordering for a tetragonal crystal structure with I4/m space group, which is confirmed by phonon calculations. The B-site ordering of the Mn(3+) and V(5+) ions in a layered configuration leads to ferromagnetically coupled magnetic moments of 4.17 micro B at Mn site and 0.23 micro B at V site. Finally, SMVO is found to be a half-metallic ferromagnetic (HM-FM) compound with a band gap of 0.65 eV in a spin down channel with off-centered displacement of V atoms in the octahedral cage (second order Jahn -Teller effect) which can cause ferroelectricity. Therefore, SMVO is predicted to be a polar HM material and a promising candidate for multiferroic property with potential application in spintronics.",3
Influence of He and N2 plasma on in situ surface passivated Fe nanopowders by plasma arc discharge.,"DC transferred arc plasma method was employed for the synthesis of core (Fe)-shell (Fe oxide) nanopowders under N2 and He atmospheres. The phase and elemental compositions were studied by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) techniques. The structural and magnetic properties were investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and Mossbauer spectroscopy. XRD and EDS results confirmed the presence of iron and iron oxide. From HRTEM, the average particle sizes of 32, 47 and 71 nm and 20, 26 and 37 nm were obtained against processing currents of 50, 100 and 150 A under N2 and He atmospheres respectively. The average particle size values were found to increase with increases in processing current. Spherical and hollow hexagonal nano-structures were obtained under N2 atmosphere whereas spherical and distorted cubes were formed under He atmosphere. The elemental mapping revealed the presence of oxygen on the surface and Fe in the core of the nanoparticles.",3
Continuous transformation between ferro and antiferro circular structures in [Formula: see text] frustrated Heisenberg model.,"Frustrated magnetic compounds, in particular low-dimensional, are topical research due to the persistent uncovering of novel nontrivial quantum states and potential applications. The problem of this field is that many important results are scattered over the localized parameter ranges, while areas in between still contain hidden interesting effects. We consider the [Formula: see text] Heisenberg model on the square lattice and use the spherically symmetric self-consistent approach for spin-spin Green's functions in 'quasielastic' approximation. We have found a new local order in spin liquids: antiferromagnetic isotropical helices. On the structure factor we see circular concentric dispersionless structures, while on any radial direction the excitation spectrum has 'roton' minima. That implies nontrivial magnetic excitations and consequences in magnetic susceptibility and thermodynamics. On the [Formula: see text] exchange parameters globe we discover a crossover between antiferromagnetic-like local order and ferromagnetic-like; we find stripe-like order in the middle. In fact, our 'quasielastic' approach allows investigation of the whole [Formula: see text] globe.",3
Electrocaloric effect in the two spin-1/2 XXZ Heisenberg edge-shared tetrahedra and spin-1/2 XXZ Heisenberg octahedron with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.,"In the present paper, we consider two species of small spin clusters known as; two spin-1/2 Heisenberg edge-shared tetrahedra and spin-1/2 Heisenberg octahedron with the corresponding Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya terms in a longitudinal magnetic field, then we examine magnetization process and electric polarization of the models as functions of magnetic and electric fields at Low temperature using exact numerical diagonalization. Our exact results are in a good agreement with recent analysis carried out by Strecka and Karlova (2018 AIP Adv. 8 101403); Karlova et al (2017 J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 29 125802). It is demonstrated that the polarization behavior coincides the magnetization curves (including sequential intermediate plateaus), also it reflects the respective stepwise changes of ground-state phase transitions. We find that the polarization has significant effects on the magnetic field dependencies of the magnetization. Furthermore, we investigate other isothermal strategies such as cooling rate, magnetocaloric effect (MCE), as well as, electrocaloric effect (ECE) for both models. Since, new electrocaloric materials with high performance is of great interest and importance in condensed matter physics, here, we report on the ECE of the both aforedescribed spin-1/2 Heisenberg small clusters. We conclude that two spin-1/2 Heisenberg edge-shared tetrahedra is a material with significant reversible temperature change capability under an external electric field compared with the spin-1/2 Heisenberg octahedron, and can be used for cooling/heating process. On the other hand, our exact results obtained by studying the MCE and ECE of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg octahedron prove that this model displays a rich ECE close to the relevant critical points, thus can be considered as a material with rich electrocaloric(magnetocaloric) performance even in the presence of an external electric(magnetic) field. Generally, by comparing both models with each other, we point out that the two spin-1/2 Heisenberg edge-shared tetrahedra is a high performance electrocaloric material rather than spin-1/2 Heisenberg octahedron, while the spin-1/2 Heisenberg octahedron demonstrates greater MCE.",3
Self- and interdiffusion in dilute liquid germanium-based alloys.,"Self- and inter-diffusion coefficients in liquid Ge and dilute Ge-based Ge-Si, Ge-Au, Ge-In, Ge-Ce and Ge-Gd alloys-containing 2 at% additions, respectively, are measured using a comprehensive approach of measuring techniques: quasi-elastic neutron scattering, in situ long-capillary experiments combined with x-ray radiography, and a long-capillary experiment under microgravity conditions. Resulting inter- and Ge self-diffusion coefficients are equal within error bars for each investigated alloy. The interdiffusion coefficients are smaller for the alloys containing Ce and Gd, However, no dependence of the atomic mass of the minor additions, that varies by about a factor of seven between Si and Au, on the diffusion coefficients could be observed. This demonstrates that in a loosely-packed metallic liquid with fast diffusive dynamics the diffusion mechanism is highly collective in nature.",3
Introducing catalysis in photocatalysis: What can be understood from surface science studies of alcohol photoreforming on TiO2.,"Mechanisms in heterogeneous photocatalysis have traditionally been interpreted by the band-structure model and analogously to electrochemistry. This has led to the establishment of 'band-engineering' as a leading principle for the discovery of more efficient photocatalysts. In such a picture, mainly thermodynamic aspects are taken into account, while kinetics are often ignored. This holds in particular for chemical kinetics, which are, other than those for charge carrier dynamics, often not at all considered for the interpretation of the catalysts' photocatalytic performance. However, while being usually neglected in photocatalyis, they are a traditional and powerful tool in thermal catalysis and are still applied with great success in this field. While surface science studies made substantial contributes to thermal catalysis, analogous studies in heterogeneous photocatalysis still play only a minor role. In this review, the authors show that the photo-physics of defined materials in well-defined environments can be correlated with photochemical events on a surface, highlighting the importance of well-characterized semiconductors for the interpretation of mechanisms in heterogeneous photochemistry. The work focuses on contributions from surface science, which were obtained for the model system of a titania single crystal and alcohol photo-reforming. It is demonstrated that only surface science studies have so far enabled the elucidation of molecularly precise reaction mechanisms, the determination of reaction intermediates and assignment of reactive sites. As the identification of these properties remain major prerequisites for a breakthrough in photocatalysis research, the work also discusses the implications of the findings for applied systems. In general, the results from surface science demonstrate that photocatalytic systems shall also be approached by a perspective originating from heterogeneous catalysis rather than solely from an electrochemical point of view.",3
Event-chain Monte Carlo simulations of the liquid to solid transition of two-dimensional decagonal colloidal quasicrystals.,"In event-chain Monte Carlo simulations, we model colloidal particles in two dimensions that interact according to an isotropic short-ranged pair potential which supports the two typical length scales present in decagonal quasicrystals. We investigate the assembled structures as we vary the density and temperature. Our special interest is related to the transition from quasicrystal to liquid. In contrast to the KTHNY melting theory for quasicrystals which predicts an intermediate pentahedratic phase, we find a one-step first-order melting transition. However, we discover that the slow relaxation of phasonic flips, i.e. rearrangements of the particles due to additional degrees of freedom in quasicrystals, changes the positional correlation functions, to the extent that structures with long-range orientational correlations, but exponentially decaying positional correlations, are observed.",3
Valley controlled Andreev reflection and valley-switch effect in graphene-based superconducting hybrid structures.,"The presence of the valley degree of freedom in two-dimensional materials leads to the valleytronics, in which information is encoded by the valley quantum number of the electron. For graphene-based superconducting hybrid structures, with the incoming electron and the Andreev reflected hole belonging to two opposite valleys, the Andreev reflection (AR) can be controlled by the valley degree of freedom. Here, we investigate theoretically the AR in graphene-based normal/supercondcutor junctions. Due to the interplay of the staggered potentials and the off-resonant circularly polarized light, the conductances demonstrate rich features. In particular, when the Fermi level of the normal lead is smaller than the superconducting gap, the retro AR and specular AR are well separated in energy, so we can easily distinguish them by studying the conductance spectra. More importantly, for normal/supercondcutor/normal junctions, the local AR is forbidden due to the vanishing density of states in one valley, and one may observe a valley-switch effect between perfect elastic cotunneling and perfect crossed AR, by reversing the handedness of the circularly polarized light.",3
Structural characteristics in deformation mechanism transformation in nanoscale metallic glasses.,"Deformation of metallic glasses is closely related to their microstructures which depend on the composition, processing method, and the size of the materials. This subtle structure-property relation is fairly complex and remains to be explored. Here, we scrutinize the microstructural evolution in relation to the mechanical properties in metallic glass nanowires with the same composition and size but subtle microstructural differences by controlling the preparing process using molecular dynamics simulations. The results suggest that a structural threshold exists for the transformation of deformation mechanisms in metallic glasses: when the structural feature exceeds the threshold, the deformation changes from homogeneous flow to shear localized deformation.",3
Renormalization of electron-phonon coupling in the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit due to point defects in the V1-x Ti x alloy superconductors.,"We report here the temperature dependence of electrical resistivity ([Formula: see text](T)), heat capacity (C(T)) and thermal conductivity ([Formula: see text](T)) of superconducting V1-x Ti x alloys in the absence and presence of external applied magnetic fields. The [Formula: see text](T) changes from positive temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR) to negative TCR at about x = 0.7 indicating that many of these alloys lie close to the Mott-Ioffe-Regel (MIR) limit. The jump in the C(T) across the superconducting transition temperature ([Formula: see text]) indicates that these alloys are in the intermediate coupling limit. The [Formula: see text](T) increases in certain V1-x Ti x alloys as the temperature decreases below the [Formula: see text] indicating that the phonons dominate the heat conduction in the superconducting state, whereas we found that the electrons are the major carriers of heat in the normal state. Our analysis suggests that the unusual features of thermal conductivity have origin in (i) the electron mean free path approaching the inter atomic distances (MIR limit) and (ii) the renormalization of the phonon mean free path due to the presence of point defects and the electron-phonon interaction.",3
Interchain interaction effect on the magnetic properties of azurite material.,"Considering the interchain exchange interaction through dimer and monomer in the azurite, a two-dimensional Ising-Heisenberg model with dimer and monomer interlacing arrangement is established, and the magnetic and thermodynamic properties are calculated by Monte Carlo method. In the ground state, as the magnetic field increases from zero, the system changes from quantum antiferromagnetic (QAF) state with monomer in antiferromagnetic state and dimer in spin singlet to the quantum ferrimagnetism (QFI) state with monomer in saturated state and dimer in spin singlet, and finally reaches the saturated spin state (SP). In the QFI state, system shows 1/3 magnetization plateau. Starting from the QAF phase closing to the boundary with QFI phase, the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility of the system with temperature show beaks in the low temperature region, corresponding phase change, and in the whole range of temperature they may present double peak structure. Starting from the two phases of QFI and SP near the boundary between them, the magnetic susceptibility and specific heat with temperature also show peak, and the corresponding phase transition temperature is symmetry with respect to the phase boundary. Comparing with the specific heat data in the experiment, we conjecture the strength of the interchain interaction of azurite material is about half of the dimer interaction.",3
Effect of substitutional impurities on vibrational properties of zircon: a first-principles study.,"Density-functional theory was used to investigate the effect of atomic impurities on the structural and vibrational properties of zircon (tetragonal ZrSiO4). Atomic impurities considered include radioactive elements U and Th, as well as Hf, Sn, and Ti, substituted on the Zr-site. Using the supercell approach to model a range of substitutional concentrations, impurities were found to cause changes in the volume of the host lattice. This effect was shown to be partially equivalent to the application of a lattice strain. This quantum-based finding is in excellent agreement with the heuristic lattice-strain model traditionally employed in the geosciences to account for the compatibility of impurities in host lattices. Vibrational properties of substituted zircon were also investigated in order to provide a quantum mechanical understanding of Raman spectroscopy measurements on natural zircon. The computational analysis reproduces existing experimental data reported for uranium-substituted zircon and provides general predictive trends for other impurities including Th, Hf, Sn, and Ti. The insights gained by this study regarding the Raman signature of the presence of substitutional impurities set the groundwork for future study of the more substantial lattice disruptions that characterize radiation damage due to alpha decay in zircon.",3
Structural engineering of bilayer PtSe2 thin films: a first-principles study.,"PtSe2 is an emerging layered two-dimensional material of applied interest. Its monolayer shows promising properties for applications in electronic devices, while the bandgap of a multilayer PtSe2 film can be tuned via changing its thickness. In this work the bilayer PtSe2 thin films are investigated as an example of structural engineering with first-principles calculations. Various van der Waals corrections schemes are firstly discussed, and the optB86b scheme shows a better description of the semiconductor-metal transition for PtSe2 films. Six bilayer PtSe2 thin films in different stacking modes are constructed in order to structurally tune the electronic and transport properties. The bandgap can be effectively broadened with the structural engineering for wider potential applications. The carrier mobility, dynamical stability and Raman spectra are also calculated and discussed.",3
Multiple gaps revealed by low temperature specific heat in the 1111-type CaFe0.88Co0.12AsF single crystals.,"Low-temperature specific heat (SH) is measured on the 1111-type CaFe0.88 Co0.12AsF single crystals under different magnetic fields. A clear SH jump with the height [Formula: see text] mJ mol(-1) K(-2) is observed at the superconducting transition temperature T c . The electronic SH coefficient [Formula: see text] increases linearly with the field below 5 T and a kink is observed around 5 T, indicating a multi-gap feature in the present system. Such a sign is also reflected in the T c - B data. A detailed analysis shows that this behavior can be interpreted in terms of a two-gap scenario with the ratio [Formula: see text]-4.5.",3
Thermoelectric properties of 1 T monolayer pristine and Janus Pd dichalcogenides.,"In this paper, we investigate the stability and thermoelectric properties of 1 T PdSSe, PdSTe and PdSeTe Janus structures using density functional theory (DFT). All three systems are narrow gap semiconductors with indirect bandgaps of 0.94 eV, 0.33 eV and 0.34 eV respectively. Compared to transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers, PdS2 and PdSe2 are semiconductors with wider indirect bandgaps of 1.29 eV and 0.69 eV respectively. Phonon dispersion calculations demonstrate that all pristine and Janus structures are mechanically stable despite the presence of negligible negative frequencies around the [Formula: see text] point in PdSTe and PdSeTe. Inspection of the lattice thermal conductivity ([Formula: see text]) shows that these structures are slightly anisotropic in the x and y directions except for PdSe2 which shows a higher degree of anisotropy. Influenced by the values of [Formula: see text], the thermal electronic conductivity ([Formula: see text]), the electronic conductivity ([Formula: see text]) and the Seebeck effect (S), the figure of merit along the x (ZT (xx) )and y (ZT (yy) ) directions register the largest values in the case of electron doping for the PdSe2 and PdSeTe 2D crystals. Interestingly, the figures of merit of the Janus structures are larger than their corresponding pristine PdX2 (X = S, Se) structures. Once synthesized, such information is crucial for the implementation of the PdXY (Y = Se, Te) structures in industrial applications.",3
Graphene thermal break-down induced by anharmonic bending mode.,"A novel approach is proposed allowing us to prove, self-consistently, that free-standing graphene reaching a certain temperature loses its mechanical stability resulting in abrupt breakdown, which can be interpreted as melting. Our study is based on the idea of the crucial role of the anomalously soft bending 'sound' mode in the jump transition of graphene from the state with relatively small bending fluctuations to a state with fluctuations close in amplitude to the graphene lattice constant. The acme of the developed theory is in establishing a quantitative relationship connecting the graphene elastic moduli of second, third (negative!), and fourth orders at the melting temperature T m that permits us to calculate T m. The results obtained lay a theoretical foundation for an analog of Lindemann criterion for graphene.",3
"Simple correction to bandgap problems in IV and III-V semiconductors: an improved, local first-principles density functional theory.","We report results from a fast, efficient, and first-principles full-potential Nth-order muffin-tin orbital (FP-NMTO) method combined with van Leeuwen-Baerends correction to local density exchange-correlation potential. We show that more complete and compact basis set is critical in improving the electronic and structural properties. We exemplify the self-consistent FP-NMTO calculations on group IV and III-V semiconductors. Notably, predicted bandgaps, lattice constants, and bulk moduli are in good agreement with experiments (e.g. we find for Ge 0.86 eV, 5.57 [Formula: see text], 75 GPa versus measured 0.74 eV, 5.66 [Formula: see text], 77.2 GPa). We also showcase its application to the electronic properties of 2-dimensional h-BN and h-SiC, again finding good agreement with experiments.",3
Guiding self-organized pattern formation in cell polarity establishment.,"Spontaneous pattern formation in Turing systems relies on feedback. Patterns in cells and tissues however often do not form spontaneously, but are under control of upstream pathways that provide molecular guiding cues. The relationship between guiding cues and feedback in controlled biological pattern formation remains unclear. We explored this relationship during cell polarity establishment in the one-cell-stage C. elegans embryo. We quantified the strength of two feedback systems that operate during polarity establishment, feedback between polarity proteins and the actomyosin cortex, and mutual antagonism amongst polarity proteins. We characterized how these feedback systems are modulated by guiding cues from the centrosome. By coupling a mass-conserved Turing-like reaction-diffusion system for polarity proteins to an active gel description of the actomyosin cortex, we reveal a transition point beyond which feedback ensures self-organized polarization even when cues are removed. Notably, the baton is passed from a guide-dominated to a feedback-dominated regime significantly beyond this transition point, which ensures robustness. Together, this reveals a general criterion for controlling biological pattern forming systems: feedback remains subcritical to avoid unstable behaviour, and molecular guiding cues drive the system beyond a transition point for pattern formation.",3
Crystalline electric field study in a putative topologically trivial rare-earth doped YPdBi compound.,"Topological states of matter have attracted a lot of attention recently due to their intriguing physical properties and potential applications. In particular, the family of half-Heusler compounds [Formula: see text] (R = rare earth, M = Pt, Pd or Au, and T = Bi, Sb, Pb or Sn) has been predicted to display tunable topological properties via their cubic unit cell volume and/or the charges of the M and T atoms. In this work, we report electron spin resonance (ESR), along with complementary macroscopic experiments, in the putative topologically trivial rare-earth doped (Gd, Nd and Er) YPdBi. From magnetic susceptibility data analysis constrained by ESR results, we were able to extract the fourth (A 4) and sixth (A 6) order crystal field parameters (CFP) for YPdBi and compared them with those already reported to YPtBi, which is known as a topologically non-trivial compound. We observed that the sign of the CFP changes systematically from YPdBi to YPtBi, possibly due to the inversion of the valence and conduction bands at the Fermi level. The enhanced spin-orbit coupling in YPtBi, when compared to YPdBi, induces the band inversion that drives the system to a non-trivial topological state. This band inversion likely has an effect on the effective charges surrounding the magnetic dopants that are probed by the CFP.",3
radical7 x radical3 surface with a double layer of In on Si(1 1 1) exhibiting both hexagonal and rectangular features.,"Using a scanning tunneling microscope (STM), we demonstrate that the In-induced hexagonal ( radical7 x radical3-hex) and rectangular ( radical7 x radical3-rect) radical7 x radical3 phases on Si(111) are from the same surface with a double layer of In. The double-layer In thickness was derived from observations that a radical7 x radical3-hex island was formed on the radical7 x radical3-'striped' phase, which is believed to have a single layer of In atoms. Bias-dependent STM images were obtained from the same radical7 x radical3 domain and exhibited both radical7 x radical3-hex and radical7 x radical3-rect features, which led to the conclusion that both radical7 x radical3 STM features originate from the same structure. These findings are in stark contrast to the prevailing idea that there are two radical7 x radical3 surfaces with different structures and In coverage. We also observed a long-range Moire-like superstructure in the radical7 x radical3 surface and attribute it to the mismatch of the lattices of the surface layer of In and the Si(1 1 1) substrate.",3
Readout of a dopant spin in the anisotropic quantum dot with a single magnetic ion.,"Owing to exchange interaction between the exciton and magnetic ion, a quantum dot embedding a single magnetic ion is a great platform for optical control of individual spin. In particular, a quantum dot provides strong and sharp optical transitions, which give experimental access to spin states of an individual magnetic ion. We show, however, that physics of quantum dot excitons also complicate spin readout and optical spin manipulation in such a system. This is due to electron-hole exchange interaction in anisotropic quantum dots, which affects the polarisation of the emission lines. One of the consequences is that the intensity of spectral lines in a single spectrum are not simply proportional to the population of various spin states of magnetic ion. In order to provide a solution of the above problem, we present a method of extracting both the spin polarisation degree of a neutral exciton and magnetic dopant inside a semiconductor quantum dot in an external magnetic field. Our approach is experimentally verified on a system of CdSe/ZnSe quantum dot containing a single Fe(2+) ion. Both the resonant and non-resonant excitation regimes are explored resulting in a record high optical orientation efficiency of dopant spin in the former case. The proposed solutions can be easily expanded to any other system of quantum dots containing magnetic dopants.",3
Graphdiyne doped with sp-hybridized nitrogen atoms at acetylenic sites as potential metal-free electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction.,"Exploring metal-free electrocatalysts with high efficiency and lower cost for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is necessary to realize the commercialization of fuel cells. In this paper, the ORR mechanisms on nitrogen-doped graphdiyne (GDY) are investigated using the first principles calculations. It is found that the GDY doped with sp-hybridized N at acetylenic sites can activate molecular oxygen (O2). The kinetically most favorable reaction pathway is O2 --> OOH --> O + H2O --> OH --> H2O, which is an efficient four-electron ORR process. The first reaction step O2 --> OOH is the rate determining step (RDS), and the energy barrier is 0.61 eV. The energy barrier of RDS is smaller than that of pure Pt (0.80 eV). Therefore, these results illustrate that sp-hybridized N-doped GDY is a promising carbon-based metal-free ORR catalyst.",3
Mass-like band-gap creation in superconducting topological insulator due to mixed singlet and triplet states.,"We investigate proximity-induced mixed spin-singlet and spin-triplet superconducting state on the surface states of a topological insulator. Such hybrid structure features fundamentally distinct electron-hole excitations and resulting effective superconducting subgap. Studying the particle-hole and time-reversal symmetry properties of the mixed state Dirac-Bogoliubov-de Gennes effective Hamiltonian gives rise to manifesting possible topological phase exchange of surface states, since the mixed-spin channels leads to appearance of a band gap on the surface states. This can be verified by evaluating topological invariant winding number for chiral eigenstates, via the introducing a chiral symmetry operator. We interestingly find the role of mixed-spin superconducting state as creating a mass-like gap in topological insulator by means of appearing new mixed-spin channels [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]. The interplay between superconducting spin-singlet and triplet correlations actually results in gaped surface states, where the size of gap can be controlled by tuning the relative s- and p -waves pairing potentials. We show that the system is in different topology classes by means of using chiral or no-chiral spin-triplet symmetry. In addition, the resulting effective superconductor subgap manipulated at the Fermi surface presents a complicated dependency on mixed-spin channels. Furthermore, we investigate the resulting subgap tunneling conductance in N/S, and also Josephson current in S/I/S junctions to unveil the influence of effective symmetry of mixed superconducting gap. The results can pave the way to realize the effective superconducting gap in noncentrosymmetric superconductors with mixed-spin state.",3
"Multi-polaron solutions, nonlocal effects and internal modes in a nonlinear chain.","Multipolaron solutions were studied in the framework of the Holstein one-dimensional molecular crystal model. The study was performed in the continuous limit where the crystal model maps into the nonlinear Schrodinger equation for which a new periodic dnoidal solution was found for the multipolaron system. In addition, the stability of the multi-polaron solutions was examined, and it was found that cnoidal and dnoidal solutions stabilize in different ranges of the parameter space. Moreover, the model was studied under the influence of nonlocal effects and the polaronic dynamics was described in terms of internal solitonic modes.",3
Excitation and phase transitions of spin density waves in graphene nanoribbons.,"Anti-ferromagnetic states widely exist on graphene zigzag edges. Our previous work (Xie et al 2018 New J. Phys. 20 013035) shows there are also various spin density wave (SDW) states in the graphene nanoribbons (GNR). In this paper, we propose some excitation mechanism of these SDW by the absorbed magnetic atoms with the mean-field Hubbard model and the first-principles calculations. With the Floquet theory, we also find that by regulating the temperature or the light intensity, there are a lot of phase transitions for these SDW. The temperature or light can dramatically modify the inter-edge coupling or the spin stiffness of GNR. The artificial magnetization technique is employed to explore the establishment process of these SDW states. Some interesting intermedia phase transitions and the corresponding spin orders are discovered. This research may be helpful in the understandings and technique controls of magnetic orders in future nano magnetic devices.",3
Reversible direct-indirect band transition in alloying TMDs heterostructures via band engineering.,"Alloying is a feasible and practical strategy to tune the electronic properties of 2D layered semiconductors. Here, based on first-principles calculations and analysis, we demonstrate band engineering through alloying W into a prototype MoS2/MoSe2 heterostructure. Especially, when the W compositions x > 0.57 in Mo1-x W x S2/MoSe2, it exhibits remarkable and reversible direct- to indirect-gap transition. This is because for Mo1-x W x S2/MoSe2, the valence band maximum located at the K point originates from dominant MoSe2, while the competing Gamma state stems from the hybridization of both Mo1-xW x S2 and MoSe2, which is extremely sensitive to the interlayer coupling. Consequently, alloying in MoS2 layer induces direct- to indirect-gap transition and gap increase due to the weakened p-d coupling. We also observe that whether initial alloying in MoS2 or MoSe2, the microMo-microW poor condition should always be used. Our findings are generally applicable and will significantly expand the band engineering to other alloying TMDs heterostructures.",3
"Dark-field spectroscopy: development, applications and perspectives in single nanoparticle catalysis.","Dark-field microscopy (DFM) is an effective method to detect the scattering signal from single nanoparticles. This technique could break through the 200 nm limit resolution of ordinary optical microscopes. It even can observe the submicron particles of 20-200 nm. Moreover, from 2000, DFM was coupled with a spectrometer to measure the scattering spectra of single silver nanoparticles. Then, dark-field spectroscopy becomes a very important plasmon spectroscopy technique for single nanoparticles. Usually, plasmonic nanoparticles are the major research target, because they have unique optical properties due to their localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), which can be influenced by many factors, such as composition, size, morphology, the refractive index of the surrounding medium etc. When surface chemical reactions occur on a single nanoparticle, it could induce the variation of these factors. Then, the structure-activity relationship for these nanoparticle catalysts can be studied at a single nanoparticle level and in real time. This review mainly summarized the development of dark-field spectroscopy, spectrometers, light sources, and other accessories, which greatly improved the imaging capabilities of dark-field spectroscopy. Meanwhile, the applications of dark-field spectroscopy in single-particle catalysis such as chemocatalysis, photocatalysis, electrocatalysis and biocatalysis are also reviewed.",3
Single-shot phase-sensitive wideband active microrheology of viscoelastic fluids using pulse-scanned optical tweezers.,"We present a fast phase sensitive active microrheology technique exploring the phase response of a microscopic probe particle trapped in a linear viscoelastic fluid using optical tweezers under an external perturbation. Thus, we experimentally&amp;#13; determine the cumulative response of the probe to an entire repertoire of sinusoidal excitations simultaneously by applying a spatial square pulse as an excitation to the trapped probe. The square pulse naturally contains the fundamental sinusoidal frequency component and higher odd harmonics, so that we measure the phase response of the probe over a wide frequency band in a single shot, with the band being tunable over the spectrum by choosing suitable experimental parameters. We then determine the responses to individual harmonics using a lock-in algorithm, and compare the phase shifts to those obtained theoretically by solving the equation of motion of the probe particle conned in a harmonic potential in the fluid in the presence of a sinusoidal perturbation. We go on to relate the phase response of the probe to the complex shear modulus G""(omega), and proceed to verify our technique in a mixture of polyacrylamide and water, which we compare with known values in literature and obtain very good agreement. Our method increases the robustness of active microrheology in general and ensures that any drifts in time are almost entirely ruled out from the data, with&amp;#13; the added advantage of high speed and ease of use.",3
Electron magnetic resonance in heterogeneous photocatalysis research.,"The contribution of electron magnetic resonance techniques, and in particular of CW-EPR, to the experimental research on photocatalytic phenomena is illustrated in this paper with selected examples. In the first part of the paper the role of EPR in unravelling the nature and the features of extrinsic point defects in semiconducting oxides is epitomized using the important example of the photoactive nitrogen center in various semiconducting oxides. In the second part we describe how EPR can monitor the processes that follow the initial photoinduced charge separation in photocatalysis, namely the stabilisation, migration and surface reactivity of electrons and holes. Finally, we will discuss how the role of EPR in photocatalysis is not limited to monitor phenomena occurring in the solid or at its surface but it can be extended to the investigation of the liquid phase by employing the spin trapping techniques to monitor the nature and the concentration of the reactive free radicals formed along the photocatalytic process.",3
Crystal structure and superconducting properties of Sc5Ir6Sn18.,"Sc5Ir6Sn18 crystallizes with a split variant of the Tb5Rh6Sn18 structure type (space group I41/acd, [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text]). DFT calculations confirmed the instability of the structural arrangement with the fully occupied and unsplit crystallographic sites. High quality single crystals were grown from a Sn melt. Sc5Ir6Sn18 is a diamagnetic metal showing a superconducting transition at a critical temperature [Formula: see text] K. The relatively low critical magnetic field [Formula: see text] 3.2 T as well as the obtained values of the specific heat ratio [Formula: see text] and energy-gap ratio [Formula: see text] suggest this system to be a weakly coupled BCS-like superconductor.",3
"Interplay between magnetic, metal/insulator and topological phases in Hg1-x Mn x Te alloys: prediction of a ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal at x = 0.25.","We report a theoretical investigation of magnetic, electronic, and topological properties of Hg1-x Mn x Te alloys. We consider periodic structures with Mn concentrations as x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1. Our hybrid DFT/Hartree-Fock calculations for the bandgaps of antiferromagnetic (ground-state) phases are in good agreement with experiments. The calculations also show that the modification of the magnetic ordering from anti- to ferromagnetic leads to a significant bandgap reduction, resulting in a metal/insulator transition at higher Mn concentrations. We show that a ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal phase is achieved for x = 0.25, where a single pair of Weyl nodes mirrored by the [Formula: see text] point in the momentum space is observed. The non-trivial topological property of the ferromagnetic Hg0.75Mn0.25Te is confirmed by the calculation of the chirality of each Weyl node, which are connected by a surface Fermi arc of a semi infinite Hg0.75Mn0.25Te.",3
Spin preservation during THz orbital pumping of shallow donors in silicon.,"We investigate the spin relaxation under conditions of optical excitation between the Rydberg orbital states of phosphorus donor impurities in silicon. Here we show that the spin relaxation is less than a few percent, even after multiple excitation/relaxation cycles. The observed high level of spin preservation may be useful for readout cycling or in quantum information schemes where coupling of neighbor qubits is via orbital excitation.",3
The complex non-collinear magnetic orderings in Ba2YOsO6: a new approach to tuning spin-lattice interactions and controlling magnetic orderings in frustrated complex oxides.,"Frustrated magnets are one class of fascinating materials that host many intriguing phases such as spin ice, spin liquid and complex long-range magnetic orderings at low temperatures. In this work we use first-principles calculations to find that in a wide range of magnetically frustrated oxides, at zero temperature a number of non-collinear magnetic orderings are more stable than the type-I collinear ordering that is observed at finite temperatures. The emergence of non-collinear orderings in those complex oxides is due to higher-order exchange interactions that originate from second-row and third-row transition metal elements. This implies a collinear-to-noncollinear spin transition at sufficiently low temperatures in those frustrated complex oxides. Furthermore, we find that in a particular oxide Ba2YOsO6, experimentally feasible uniaxial strain can tune the material between two different non-collinear magnetic orderings. Our work predicts new non-collinear magnetic orderings in frustrated complex oxides at very low temperatures and provides a mechanical route to tuning complex non-collinear magnetic orderings in those materials.",3
Data driven modeling of magnetism in dilute magnetic semiconductors: correlation between the magnetic features of diluted magnetic semiconductors and electronic properties of the constituent atoms.,"We propose an efficient machine learning based approach in modeling the magnetism of diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMSs) leading to the prediction of new compounds with enhanced magnetic properties. The approach combines accurate ab initio methods with statistical tools to uncover the correlation between the magnetic features of DMSs and electronic properties of the constituent atoms to determine the underlying factors responsible for the DMS-magnetism. Taking the electronic properties of different DMS systems as descriptors to train different regression models allows us to achieve a speed up of several orders of magnitude in the search for an optimum combination of the host semiconductor and the dopants with enhanced magnetic properties. We demonstrate this by analyzing a large set of descriptors for a wide range of systems and show that only 30% of these features are more likely to contribute to this property. We also show that training regression models with the reduced set of features to predict the total magnetic moment of new candidate DMSs has reduced the mean square error by about 20% compared to the models trained using the whole set of features. Furthermore, our results indicate that the predictive power of our method can be improved even more by extending our descriptor set.",3
Computing the self-consistent field in Kohn-Sham density functional theory.,"A new framework is presented for evaluating the performance of self-consistent field methods in Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT). The aims of this work are two-fold. First, we explore the properties of Kohn-Sham DFT as it pertains to the convergence of self-consistent field iterations. Sources of inefficiencies and instabilities are identified, and methods to mitigate these difficulties are discussed. Second, we introduce a framework to assess the relative utility of algorithms in the present context, comprising a representative benchmark suite of over fifty Kohn-Sham simulation inputs, the scf-x n suite. This provides a new tool to develop, evaluate and compare new algorithms in a fair, well-defined and transparent manner.",3
"Temperature-dependent optical properties of self-doped superconducting Fe-pnictide, Sr2VO3FeAs.","We performed an infrared spectroscopic study on a single crystal of Sr2VO3FeAs grown by a self-flux method. This layered material system consists of two alternative layers of [SrVO3](-1) and [SrFeAs](+1). Since the typical size of single crystalline Sr2VO3FeAs samples is 200 [Formula: see text] 200 [Formula: see text] 10 [Formula: see text]m(3) an optical study on this material is challenging. We observed an additional interband transition around 1000 cm(-1), which is absent in other doped Ba-122 Fe-pnictides. The origin of this additional transition is not clearly known yet. We also observed a hidden Fermi liquid behavior. Interestingly, we observed a Fano line-shaped phonon which appears near 555 cm(-1) below 200 K and shows a strong blue-shift when the temperature is lowered. The amplitude, width, and asymmetric Fano parameter of this phonon show anomalies at 150 K, which are probably related to an electronic phase observed below 155 K recently by an NMR study (Ok et al 2017 Nat. Commun. 8 2167). Our finding may help to understand the electronic phase observed previously in the same material.",3
"Hard ferromagnetic van-der-Waals metal (Fe,Co)<sub>3</sub>GeTe<sub>2</sub>: a new platform for the study of low-dimensional magnetic quantum criticality.","The widely-studied ferromagnetic van-der-Waals metal Fe3GeTe2 has great promise for studies of quantum criticality in the two-dimensional limit, but is limited by a relatively high Curie temperature in excess of 200 K. To help render the quantum critical point achievable in such a system within the reach of practically possible tuning methods, we have grown single crystals of a variant of (Fe,Co)3GeTe2 with useful physical properties for both this purpose and the wider study of low-dimensional magnetism and spin transport. (Fe,Co)3GeTe2 is found through x-ray diffraction and electron microscopy to have an equivalent crystal structure to Fe3GeTe2, with a random distribution of the cobalt dopant sites. It exhibits a sharp ferromagnetic transition at a value below 40 K, a stronger anisotropy and a coercive field 10 times larger than that of Fe3GeTe2. The transport properties and specific heat show the electronic properties and strong correlations of Fe3GeTe2 to be near-unchanged in this doped material. We demonstrate that (Fe,Co)3GeTe2 can be cleanly exfoliated down to monolayer thickness. This unprecedented hard metallic van-der-Waals ferromagnet is a valuable new addition to the limited range of materials available for the study of 2D magnetism.",3
"Structural, vibrational and electrical properties of type-II Dirac semimetal PtSe2 under high pressure.","We present a high-pressure study of type-II Dirac semimetal PtSe2 single crystals through synchrotron x-ray diffraction (XRD), electrical transport and Raman scattering measurements in diamond anvil cells with pressures up to 36.1-42.3 GPa, from which two critical pressure points associated with unusual electron-phonon coupling are unraveled. We show that both resistance and phonon linewidth of Raman modes display anomalies at the first critical pressure of P r ~ 10 GPa, in accordance with a scenario of pressure-induced disappearance/appearance of type-II/type-I Dirac points around P r predicted previously. The second critical pressure P c ~ 20 GPa may correspond to a structural crossover of PtSe2 from quasi-2D lattice to 3D network, which is revealed via detailed analysis of the structural parameters extracted from XRD refinement, Raman modes shifts as well as parameters from fitting of the low-temperature resistance. Our results demonstrate great tunability of PtSe2 via strain engineering, thanks to the single p-orbital manifold derived electronic states that are susceptible to out-of-plane and in-plane distances.",3
Phononic topological states in 1D quasicrystals.,"In this work, we address the study of phonons propagating on a one-dimensional quasiperiodic lattice, where the atoms are considered bounded by springs whose strength are modulated by equivalent Aubry-Andre hoppings. As an example, from the equations of motion, we obtained the equivalent phonon spectrum of the well known Hofstadter butterfly. We have also obtained extended, critical, and localized regimes in this spectrum. By introducing the equivalent Aubry-Andre model through the variation of the initial phase $\phi$, we have shown that border states for phonons are allowed to exist. These states can be classified as topologically protected states (topological states). By Calculating the Inverse Participation Rate, we describe the localization of phonons and verify a phase transition, characterized by the critical value of &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;lambda&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;=1.0, where the states of the system change from extended to localized, precisely like in a metal-insulator phase transition.",3
Magnetic glassy behaviour coupled with long range non-collinear magnetic order in Tb3Co.,"Detailed and systematic study of rare earth rich intermetallic compound Tb3Co, using dc magnetisation, neutron powder diffraction, and linear and non-linear ac-susceptibilities, shows the presence of an unexpected magnetic glassy state along with complex non-collinear or modulated antiferromagnetic (AFM) order. Our neutron diffraction study shows that the magnetic structure remains more or less the same except for a decrease in moment values in the temperature range of 2 K-70 K and rules out any phase transition around 30 K. However, it reveals sharp changes in structural parameters around 30 K, which indicates strong spin-lattice coupling and change in strength. It appears to be mainly responsible for the observed increase in ZFC magnetisation on warming around 30 K. Another important unexpected result of this study is the strong frequency dispersion in linear and non-linear (higher order harmonics) ac-susceptibilities below [Formula: see text] K. The analysis in terms of various spin glass theoretical formulisms and even stronger frequency dispersion in non-linear susceptibilities provides evidence for the presence of a spin glass like state in Tb3Co. The final picture that emerges out of this study is that a spin glass like state coexists with the long range modulated AFM order below 72 K.",3
"Thermal, electro-magnetic and thermoelectric investigation of CoNb<sub>1-x</sub>Ti<sub>x</sub>Sn (x = 0, 0.75, 0.5, 1) Half-Heusler alloy.","In this work, structural, thermal, electro-magnetic and thermoelectric attributes of CoNb1-xTixSn (x = 0, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25, 0) alloy have been investigated using density functional theory. The structural reforms brought to CoNbSn, portray the increase in its rigidity of the when increasing the Ti doping content at the Nb site of CoNbSn. The Ti doping in CoNbSn shifts the character of this alloy from semiconductor to a half metallic. This substitution alters the magnetic state of CoNbSn from anti-ferromagnetic to half metallic magnetic nature. By investigating elastic properties, studied alloys displayed stable structure. Thermoelectric properties which include Seebeck coefficient (S), electrical conductivity (sigma/tau) and power factor (S2 sigma/tau), are calculated based on the Boltzmann transport theory. Results revealed that CoNb1-xTixSn exhibits a switch from n-type to p-type at 0.75 doping content which is found to be temperature dependent. According to the predictive results, CoNb1-xTixSn alloys could have potential thermoelectric applications.",3
Low temperature hidden Fermi-liquid charge transport in under doped La x Sr1-x CuO2 infinite layer electron-doped thin films.,"We have studied the low temperature electrical transport properties of La x Sr1-x CuO2 thin films grown by oxide molecular beam epitaxy on (1 1 0) GdScO3 and TbScO3 substrates. The transmission electron microscopy measurements and the x-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the epitaxy of the obtained films and the study of their normal state transport properties, removing the ambiguity regarding the truly conducting layer, allowed to highlight the presence of a robust hidden Fermi liquid charge transport in the low temperature properties of infinite layer electron doped cuprate superconductors. These results are in agreement with recent observations performed in other p and n doped cuprate materials and point toward a general description of the superconducting and normal state properties in these compounds.",3
Molecular junction by tunneling in 1D and quasi-1D systems.,"We have investigated electron tunneling through two one-dimensional (1D) molecular junctions based on first-principles simulations using the density functional theory combined with the non-equilibrium Green's functions methodology. The first junction, composed of left and right carbyne wire electrodes with a sodium atom in between, is atomically thin. The second one is quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) and consists of two single-wall carbon nanotube electrodes, closed on the tips and again a sodium atom in the scattering region. Although the bridging atom bonds weakly to the electrodes in both systems, it strongly affects the electronic transport properties, such as electron transmission, current-voltage relation, differential conductance, density of states and eigenchannels. This is demonstrated by comparing with the results obtained from the corresponding systems for both the 1D and the quasi-1D junctions in the absence of the central sodium atom. The revealed transport properties are sensitive to the molecular geometry. This helps future molecular electronic device design.",3
"Energy band gaps and excited states in Si QD/SiO x /R y O z (R = Si, Al, Zr) suboxide superlattices.","X-ray and optical spectroscopies were applied in order to study the band structure and electronic excitations of the SiO x /R y O z (R = Si, Al, Zr) suboxide superlattices. The complementary x-ray emission and absorption measurements allow for the band gap values for the SiO x layers to be established, which are found to have almost no dependency on the cation type R. It is determined that, after annealing, the stoichiometric factor x remains near 1.8 in all the systems under study, implying that the silicon quantum dot synthesis reaction is not fully completed. It is shown that the SiO x /Al2O3 multilayer contains octahedral structural motifs (SiO6) usually found in stishovite, whereas SiO x /SiO2 and SiO x /ZrO2 demonstrate an electronic structure similar to conventional silica. The intrinsic electronic excited states are examined by means of synchrotron-excited photoluminescence spectroscopy. Low-energy UV-excited luminescence of SiO x layers is found to have the same spectrum in all of the studied structures, while VUV-excited spectra strongly depend on the cation R. In these measurements, manifestations of 'slow' exciton-mediated and 'fast' defect-related luminescence are distinguished using nanosecond time resolution. It is shown that both mobile and bounded excitons appear in the suboxide layer under 6.2 eV and 5.8 eV irradiation and then relax radiatively through the triplet-singlet transition of the neighbouring oxygen-deficient centers. The complete picture of the optical excitation and relaxation processes in these materials is illustrated in a general diagram depicting electronic states.",3
Formation of bonding interface in explosive welding-a molecular dynamics approach.,"The bonding between copper (Cu) and iron (Fe) to form a bi-layer composite using explosive welding is investigated through molecular dynamics simulation. Three stages in the joining process, including loading, unloading and cooling, are sequentially considered in modelling the formation of the bonding interface. The results demonstrate that three types of bonding interfaces can be obtained, based on whether melting happens. The morphologies and the atomic structures of the three types bonding interfaces in each stage are analyzed. The formation of nanograins near the bonding interface is mainly due to the melting and subsequent cooling process. Atomic simulations of tensile tests reveal that melting is not a necessary factor to form the bonding interface. What's more, depending on whether melting occurs, the joining mechanism can be regarded as pressure welding or fusion-diffusion welding.",3
Atomistic tight binding study of quantum confined Stark effect in GaBi x As1-x /GaAs quantum wells.,"Recently, there has been tremendous research interest in novel bismide semiconductor materials (such as GaBi x As1-x ) for wavelength-engineered, low-loss optoelectronic devices. We report a study of the quantum confined Stark effect (QCSE) computed for GaBi x As1-x /GaAs quantum well (QW) structures based on large-scale atomistic tight-binding calculations. A comprehensive investigation of the QCSE as a function of the applied electric field orientations and the QW Bi fractions reveals unconventional character of the Stark shift at low Bi compositions ([Formula: see text]). This atypical QCSE is attributed to a strong confinement of the ground-state hole wave functions due to the presence of Bi clusters. At technologically-relevant large Bi fractions ([Formula: see text]10%), the impact of Bi clustering on the electronic structure is found to be weak, leading to a quadratic Stark shift of the ground-state transition wavelength, similar to previously observed in other conventional III-V materials. Our results provide useful insights for the understanding of the electric field dependence of the electronic and optical properties of GaBi x As1-x /GaAs QWs, and will be important for the design of devices in the optoelectronics and spintronics areas of research.",3
Threshold energies of Auger recombination in HgTe/CdHgTe quantum well heterostructures with 30-70 meV bandgap.,"We calculate the threshold energies of Auger recombination in the HgTe/CdHgTe quantum well heterostructures with the bandgap in the 30-70 meV range. It is shown that there is a maximum in the temperature dependence of the threshold energy for Auger process involving two electrons and a hole. For Auger process involving two holes and an electron, in which the hole is in the second valence subband in the final state, the threshold energy decreases down to zero and then increases steeply as temperature grows. The results of calculation can be considered as guidelines for designing the long-wavelength laser structures.",3
Electron elastic backscattering probability and inelastic mean free path.,"We study the angular distribution of electron elastic backscattering probability, using the Oswald-Kasper-Gaukler (OKG) model and Monte Carlo simulation. The present results are consistent with experimental data and other theoretical calculations. We also propose an approach that makes the OKG model applicable to determine electron inelastic mean free paths for compounds. We apply the OKG model with the proposed approach to zinc oxide (ZnO) and cerium dioxide (CeO2).",3
Evidence of precursor orthorhombic domains well above the electronic nematic transition temperature in Sr(Fe<sub>1-x</sub>Co<sub>x</sub>)<sub>2</sub>As<sub>2</sub>.,"Raman scattering, synchrotron x-ray diffraction, specific heat, resistivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed in Sr(Fe&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;1-x&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;Co&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;x&amp;lt;/sub &amp;gt;)&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;As&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/s ub&amp;gt; [x = 0.24(3)] single crystals with superconducting critical temperature T&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;c&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; = 22 K and two additional transitions at 132 and 152 K observed in both specific heat and resistivity data. A quasielastic Raman signal with B&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2g&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; symmetry (tetragonal cell) associated with electronic nematic fluctuations is observed. Crucially, this signal shows maximum intensity at T&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;nem&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; approximately 132 K, marking the nematic transition temperature. X-ray diffraction shows evidence of coexisting orthorhombic and tetragonal domains between T&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;nem&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; and T&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;o&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; approximately 152 K, implying that precursor orthorhombic domains emerge over an extended temperature range above T&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;nem&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; . While the height of the quasielastic Raman peak is insensitive to T&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;o&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; , the temperature-dependence of the average nematic fluctuation rate indicates a slowing down of the nematic fluctuations inside the precursor orthorhombic domains. These results are analogous to those previously reported for the LaFeAsO parent oxypnictide [U.F. Kaneko et al., Phys. Rev. B 96, 014506 (2017)]. We propose a scenario where the precursor orthorhombic phase may be generated within the electronically disordered regime (T &amp;gt; T&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;nem&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; ) as long as the nematic fluctuation rate is sufficiently small in comparison to the optical phonon frequency range. In this regime, the local atomic structure responds adiabatically to the electronic nematic fluctuations, creating a net of orthorhombic clusters that, albeit dynamical for T &amp;gt; T&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;nem&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; , may be sufficiently dense to sustain long-range phase coherence in a diffraction process up to T&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;o&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;.",3
Weak ferromagnetic insulator with huge coercivity in monoclinic double perovskite La2CuIrO6.,"Insulating ferromagnets with high T C are required for many new magnetic devices. More complexity arises when strongly correlated 3d ions coexist with strongly spin-orbit coupled 5d ones in a double perovskite. Here, we perform the structural, magnetic, and density functional theory (DFT) study of such double perovskite La2CuIrO6. A new P21/n polymorph is found according to the comprehensive analysis of x-ray, Raman scattering and phonon spectrum. The magnetization reveals a weak ferromagnetic (FM) transition at T C = 62 K and short range FM order in higher temperature range. A huge coercivity is found as high as H C ~ 11.96 kOe at 10 K, which, in combination with the negative trapped field, results in the magnetization reversal in the zero field cooling measurement. The first principle calculations confirm the observed FM state and suggest La2CuIrO6 of this polymorph is a Mott insulating ferromagnet assisted by the spin-orbit coupling.",3
Impact of single atomic defects and vacancies on the magnetic anisotropy energy of CoPt thin films.,"The impact of surface vacancies and single adatoms on the magnetic properties of tetragonal L1 0 CoPt thin films is investigated from first principles. We consider Co and Fe single adatoms deposited on a Pt-terminated thin film while a Pt adatom is assumed to be supported by a Co-terminated film. The vacancy is injected in the top-surface layer of the films with both types of termination. After finding the most stable location of the defects, we discuss their magnetic properties tied to those of the substrate and investigate the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE). Previous simulations (Brahimi et al 2016 J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 28 496002) predicted a large out-of-plane surface MAE for the Pt-terminated CoPt films (4 meV per f.u.) in contrast to in-plane surface MAE for Co-terminated films (-1 meV per f.u.). Here, we find that the surface MAE is significantly modified upon the presence of the atomic defects. All investigated defects induce an in-plane MAE, which is large enough for Fe adatom and Pt vacancy to switch the surface MAE from out-of-plane to in-plane for the Pt-terminated films. Interestingly, among the investigated defects Pt vacancy has the largest effect on the MAE in contrast to Co vacancy, which induced the smallest but still significant effect. This behavior is explained in terms of the orbital moment anisotropy of the thin films.",3
Theoretical treatment of semiconductor heterojunctions for photocatalysis: the WO3/BiVO4 interface.,"The valence and conduction band (CB) alignments and the nature of the WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction have been analysed in detail based on hybrid functionals density functional theory calculations. The WO3/BiVO4 junction is widely studied in photocatalysis for its capability to reduce electron-hole recombination and to improve efficiency. This is assumed to be due to a favourable band alignment of the junction's components, which generates a flow of negative charge carriers towards WO3, and positive ones towards BiVO4. This conclusion is often based on the properties of the two isolated, non-interacting units. Here, we propose an explicit interface model where the (0 0 1) surface of WO3 is put in contact with the (0 1 0) surface of BiVO4 rotated by about 45 degrees , which leads to a small strain and a favourable cation-anion matching. The interface displays a moderate charge transfer and a small interface dipole. This leads to only moderate effects on the band alignment, which remains qualitatively similar to that obtained from the two independent oxides. We also considered in detail the role of the amount of exact exchange used in the description of the heterojunction, and in particular of the BiVO4 component, for which rather different hybrid functional approaches have been proposed in the literature.",3
Chip-integrated visible-telecom photon pair sources for quantum communication.,"Photon pair sources are fundamental building blocks for quantum entanglement and quantum communication. Recent studies in silicon photonics have documented promising characteristics for photon pair sources within the telecommunications band, including sub-milliwatt optical pump power, high spectral brightness, and high photon purity. However, most quantum systems suitable for local operations, such as storage and computation, support optical transitions in the visible or short near-infrared bands. In comparison to telecommunications wavelengths, the significantly higher optical attenuation in silica at such wavelengths limits the length scale over which optical-fiber-based quantum communication between such local nodes can take place. One approach to connect such systems over fiber is through a photon pair source that can bridge the visible and telecom bands, but an appropriate source, which should produce narrow-band photon pairs with a high signal-to-noise ratio, has not yet been developed. Here, we demonstrate an on-chip visible-telecom photon pair source for the first time, using high quality factor silicon nitride microresonators to generate bright photon pairs with an unprecedented coincidence-to-accidental ratio (CAR) up to (3.8 +/- 0.2) x 10(3). We further demonstrate dispersion engineering of the microresonators to enable the connection of different species of trapped atoms/ions, defect centers, and quantum dots to the telecommunications bands for future quantum communication systems.",3
Tuning the magnetotransport behavior of topological insulator with a transition-metal oxide layer.,"The interaction between topological insulator (TI) and its adjacent magnetic layer serves as a basis for exploring the device application of TI. Here we investigate the modulation of the magnetotransport behavior of Bi2Te3 TI with a transition-metal oxide layer NiO. It is found that the weak-antilocalization effect is absent at low magnetic fields and the magnetoresistance ratio decreases monotonically with increasing the NiO growth temperature from 300 to 473 K, indicating the suppression of the topological surface states of Bi2Te3. Such behaviors are attributed to the decomposition of NiO and the concomitant formation of magnetic impurities at the Bi2Te3/NiO interface. Differently, the weak-antilocalization shows no significant weakening with the growth of Cr2O3 top layer, due to its better chemical stability. Our observation would be significant for the material selection for the device integration of TI.",3
Experimental observation of a negative grey trion in an electron-rich WSe2 monolayer.,"We measure the evolution of low temperature photoluminescence in a WSe2 monolayer with increasing electron concentration level. By comparing non-resonant and resonant laser excitation, we find that the formation of negative trions is facilitated by very efficient phonon emission. The most prominent line in photolumienscence spectra in the intermediate range of carrier concentrations (below [Formula: see text] cm(-2)) is found to be 66 meV below the bright negative trion. Its measured properties, including low oscillator strength and the temperature dependence point to an interacting bright intervalley and dark intervalley trion state as the origin of the line.",3
Two dimensional electron gas in the [Formula: see text]-doped iridates with strong spin-orbit coupling: La[Formula: see text]Sr2IrO4.,"Iridates are of considerable current interest because of the strong spin-orbit coupling that leads to a variety of new phenomena. Using density-functional studies, we predict the formation of a spin-orbital entangled two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in the [Formula: see text]-doped iridate La[Formula: see text]Sr2IrO4, where a single SrO layer is replaced by a LaO layer. The extra La electron resides close to the [Formula: see text]-doped layer, partially occupying the [Formula: see text] upper Hubbard band and thereby making the interface metallic. The magnetic structure of the bulk is destroyed near the interface, with the Ir0 layer closest to the interface becoming non-magnetic, while the next layer (Ir1) continues to maintain the AFM structure of the bulk, but with a reduced magnetic moment. The Fermi surface consists of a hole pocket and an electron pocket, located in two different Ir layers (Ir0 and Ir1), with both carriers derived from the [Formula: see text] upper Hubbard band. The presence of both electrons and holes at the [Formula: see text]-doped interface suggests unusual transport properties, leading to possible device applications.",3
Spin switching temperature modulated by the magnetic field and spontaneous exchange bias effect in single crystal SmFeO3.,"The spin switching and exchange bias effect were investigated in the rare earth orthoferrite SmFeO3 composed of two antiferromagnetically coupled sublattices Sm(3+) and Fe(3+) with canted ferromagnetic moments and a temperature induced spin switching in single crystal SmFeO3 was observed. The spin switching temperature was found to be modulated by exerting different magnetic fields below the compensation temperature ([Formula: see text]). This effect could be explained as the changes of energy barrier related to the magnetization direction under different magnetic fields. In the meantime, the coercivity displayed strong dependence on the maximum applied magnetic fields in the hysteresis measurement. In addition, spontaneous exchange bias effect (EB) was observed with the largest EB field value of 1.2 T, and the EB field changed its sign across the compensation point. Our results indicate that the magnetic properties of SmFeO3 can be strongly affected and controlled by the temperature or the applied magnetic field during the measurement process, and it might lead to novel applications in magneto-optics, ultrafast switching, and magnetic sensing devices.",3
Computational methods in the study of self-entangled proteins: a critical appraisal.,"The existence of self-entangled proteins, the native structure of which features a complex topology, unveils puzzling, and thus fascinating, aspects of protein biology and evolution. The discovery that a polypeptide chain can encode the capability to self-entangle in an efficient and reproducible way during folding, has raised many questions, regarding the possible function of these knots, their conservation along evolution, and their role in the folding paradigm. Understanding the function and origin of these entanglements would lead to deep implications in protein science, and this has stimulated the scientific community to investigate self-entangled proteins for decades by now. In this endeavour, advanced experimental techniques are more and more supported by computational approaches, that can provide theoretical guidelines for the interpretation of experimental results, and for the effective design of new experiments. In this review we provide an introduction to the computational study of self-entangled proteins, focusing in particular on the methodological developments related to this research field. A comprehensive collection of techniques is gathered, ranging from knot theory algorithms, that allow detection and classification of protein topology, to Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics strategies, that constitute crucial instruments for investigating thermodynamics and kinetics of this class of proteins.",3
Unraveling the electromagnetic structure of the epitaxial graphene buffer layer.,"We have employed density functional theory to study the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of the first all-carbon layer grown epitaxially on 6H-SiC(0 0 0 1). Using VDW-DF, M06-L, LSDA, LSDA+U, PBE and PBE-D2 methods we have performed a comparative study of the preferable magnetic configuration of the system. In this work, for the first time, we report a stable antiferromagnetic (AF) ordering in the buffer layer caused by the presence of silicon dangling bonds in the SiC top layer. This state is nearly degenerated with the ferromagnetic state with a magnetic moment equal to the number of silicon dangling bonds. A net magnetic moment of 0.55 microb per Si dangling bond was found for both states. However, only for the ferromagnetic state the carbon atoms of the buffer layer exhibited a magnetic moment. The magnetic configuration is much more stable than the non-polarized one and might explain SQUID results and spin transport experiments with epitaxial graphene. Furthermore, we found that, as previously observed experimentally, the buffer layer is a true semiconductor.",3
Radiation damage in tungsten from cascade overlap with voids and vacancy clusters.,"We have performed a systematic molecular dynamics investigation of the effects of overlap of collision cascades in tungsten with pre-existing vacancy-type defects. In particular, we focus on the implications for fusion neutron irradiated tungsten in relation to comparisons with damage production under ion irradiation conditions. We find that overlap of a cascade with a vacancy-type defect decreases the number of new defects with roughly the same functional dependence as previously shown for interstitial clusters. We further find that different mechanisms govern the formation of dislocation loops, resulting in different Burgers vectors, depending on the degree of overlap between the cascade and the defect. Furthermore, we show that overlapping cascades consistently decrease the size of the pre-existing defect. We also observe void-induced cascade splitting at energies far below the subcascade splitting threshold in tungsten. The impact of these mechanisms on radiation damage accumulation and dose rate effects are discussed.",3
Phonon and electron transport in Janus monolayers based on InSe.,"We systematically investigated the phonon and electron transport properties of monolayer InSe and its Janus derivatives including monolayer In2SSe and In2SeTe by first-principles calculations. The breaking of mirror symmetry produces a distinguishable A 1 peak in the Raman spectra of monolayer In2SSe and In2SeTe. The long-range harmonic and anharmonic interactions play an important role in the heat transport of the group-III chalcogenides. The room-temperature thermal conductivity ([Formula: see text]) of monolayer InSe, In2SSe and In2SeTe are 44.6, 46.9, and 29.9 W (mK)(-1), respectively. There is a competition effect between atomic mass, phonon group velocity and phonon lifetime. The [Formula: see text] can be further effectively modulated by sample size for the purpose of thermoelectric applications. Meanwhile, monolayer In2SeTe exhibits a direct band gap of 1.8 eV and a higher electron mobility than that of monolayer InSe, due to the smaller electron effective mass caused by tensile strain on the Se side and smaller deformation potential. These results indicate that 2D Janus group-III chalcogenides can provide a platform to design the new electronic, optoelectronic and thermoelectric devices.",3
Ferromagnetic resonance studies of strain tuned Bi:YIG films.,"Bismuth-doped Yttrium iron garnet (Bi:YIG) thin films known for large magneto-optical activity with low losses still need to get probed for its magnetization dynamics. We demonstrate a controlled tuning of magnetocrystalline anisotropy in Bi-doped Y3Fe5O12 (Bi:YIG) films of high crystalline quality using growth induced epitaxial strain on [1 1 1]-oriented Gd3Ga5O12 (GGG) substrate. We optimize a growth protocol to get thick highly-strained epitaxial films showing large magneto-crystalline anisotropy, compare to thin films prepared using a different protocol. Ferromagnetic resonance measurements establish a linear dependence of the out-of-plane uniaxial anisotropy on the strain induced rhombohedral distortion of Bi:YIG lattice. Interestingly, the enhancement in the magnetoelastic constant due to an optimum substitution of Bi(3+) ions with strong spin orbit coupling does not strongly affect the precessional damping ( approximately [Formula: see text]). Large magneto-optical activity, reasonably low damping, large magnetocrystalline anisotropy and large magnetoelastic coupling in Bi:YIG are the properties that may help Bi:YIG emerge as a possible material for photo-magnonics and other spintronics applications.",3
Photon energy dependence of Kerr rotation in GeTe/Sb2Te3 chalcogenide superlattices.,"We report on pump-probe based helicity dependent time-resolved Kerr measurements under infrared excitation of chalcogenide superlattices, consisting of alternately stacked GeTe and Sb2Te3 layers. The Kerr rotation signal consists of the specular inverse Faraday effect (SIFE) and the specular optical Kerr effect (SOKE), both of which are found to monotonically increase with decreasing photon energy over a sub-eV energy range. Although the dependence of the SIFE can be attributed to the response function of direct third-order nonlinear susceptibility, the magnitude of the SOKE reflects cascading second-order nonlinear susceptibility resulting from electronic transitions between bulk valence/conduction bands and interface-originating Dirac states of the superlattice.",3
Stripe structures in phase separated magnetic oxides.,"We investigate the phase separated inhomogeneous charge and spin states in magnetic oxides. In particular, we study one dimensional harmonic waves and stripe structures. We show that harmonic spin charge waves are unstable and inevitably transform into two or three dimensional structures, while the stripe structures can be stable for certain parameters. Such stripe structures may allow the control of magnetic state with electric field in a magnetic oxide thin film.",3
Towards a simplified description of thermoelectric materials: accuracy of approximate density functional theory for phonon dispersions.,"We calculate the phonon-dispersion relations of several two-dimensional materials and diamond using the density-functional based tight-binding approach (DFTB). Our goal is to verify if this numerically efficient method provides sufficiently accurate phonon frequencies and group velocities to compute reliable thermoelectric properties. To this end, the results are compared to available DFT results and experimental data. To quantify the accuracy for a given band, a descriptor is introduced that summarizes contributions to the lattice conductivity that are available already in the harmonic approximation. We find that the DFTB predictions depend strongly on the employed repulsive pair-potentials, which are an important prerequisite of this method. For carbon-based materials, accurate pair-potentials are identified and lead to errors of the descriptor that are of the same order as differences between different local and semi-local DFT approaches.",3
"The hunt for the third acceptor in CuInSe2 and Cu(In,Ga)Se2 absorber layers.","The model for intrinsic defects in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 semiconductor layers is still under debate for the full range between CuInSe2 and CuGaSe2. It is commonly agreed by theory and experiment, that there are at least one shallow donor and two shallow acceptors. Spatially resolved photoluminescence on CuGaSe2 previously revealed a third acceptor. In this study we show with the same method that the photoluminescence peak at 0.94 eV in CuInSe2, previously attributed to a third acceptor, is a phonon replica. However another pronounced peak at 0.9 eV is detected on polycrystalline CuInSe2 samples grown with high copper and selenium excess. Intensity and temperature dependent photoluminescence measurements reveal that this peak originates from a DA-transition from a shallow donor (<8 meV) into a shallow acceptor A3 (135 [Formula: see text] 10) meV. The DA3 transition has three distinct phonon replicas with 28 meV spectral spacing and a Huang Rhys factor of 0.75. Complementary admittance measurements are dominated by one main step with an activation energy of 125 meV which corresponds well with the found A3 defect. The same defect is also observed in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 samples with low gallium content. For [Ga]/([Ga] + [In])-ratios of up to 0.15 both methods show a concordant increase of the activation energy with increasing gallium content shifting the defect deeper into the bandgap. The indium vacancy [Formula: see text] is discussed as a possible origin of the third acceptor level in CuInSe2 and [Formula: see text] in Cu(In,Ga)Se2.",3
"Two functionals approach in DFT for the prediction of thermoelectric properties of Fe2ScX (X = P, As, Sb) full-Heusler compounds.","In the quest for new thermoelectric materials with high power factors, full-Heusler compounds having flat band are found to be promising candidates. In this direction, Fe2ScX (X = P,As,Sb) compounds are investigated using mBJ for the band gap and SCAN to describe the electronic bands and phonon properties for thermoelectric applications. The band gaps obtained from mBJ are 0.81 eV, 0.69 eV and 0.60 eV for Fe2ScX compounds. The phonon dispersion, phonon density of states (DOS) and partial DOS are calculated. The phonon contributions to specific heat are obtained as a function of temperature under harmonic approximation. The electronic band structutre calculated from mBJ and SCAN functionals are qualitatively compared. The effective mass values are calculated at the band extrema from SCAN functional. The thermoelectric parameters are calculated for both hole and electron dopings under semiclassical theory. We use a simple, but reasonable method to estimate the phonon relaxation time ([Formula: see text]). Using the specific heat, estimated [Formula: see text] and slopes (phase velocity) of acoustic branches in the linear region, lattice thermal conductivity ([Formula: see text]) at 300 K is calculated for three compounds. The obtained values of [Formula: see text] with constant [Formula: see text] are 18.2, 13.6 and 10.3 Wm(-1) K(-1), respectively. Finally, the temperature dependent figure of merit ZT values are calculated for optimal carrier concentrations in the doping range considered, to evaluate the materials for thermoelectric application. The ZT values for n-type Fe2ScX, in 900-1200 K, are 0.34-0.43, 0.40-0.48 and 0.45-0.52, respectively. While, the p-type Fe2ScX have ZT values of 0.25-0.34, 0.20-0.28 and 0.18-0.26, respectively in the same temperature range. The ZT values suggest that, Fe2ScX compounds can be promising materials in high temperature power generation application on successful synthesis and further [Formula: see text] reduction by methods like nanostructuring.",3
A lower bound to the thermal diffusivity of insulators.,"It has been known for decades that thermal conductivity of insulating crystals becomes proportional to the inverse of temperature when the latter is comparable to, or higher than, the Debye temperature. This behavior has been understood as resulting from Umklapp scattering among phonons. We put under scrutiny the magnitude of the thermal diffusion constant in this regime and find that it does not fall below a threshold set by the square of sound velocity times the Planckian time ([Formula: see text]). The conclusion, based on scrutinizing the ratio in cubic crystals with high thermal resistivity, appears to hold even in glasses where Umklapp events are not conceivable. Explaining this boundary, reminiscent of a recently-noticed limit for charge transport in metals, is a challenge to theory.",3
Strain-engineered indirect-direct band-gap transitions of PbPdO2 slab with preferred (0 0 2) orientation.,"Layered transition metal oxide PbPdO2 has great potential application in electronic devices because of its unique electronic structure and large thermoelectric power at room temperature. In this work, strain effect on the electronic structure of PbPdO2 slab with preferred (0 0 2) orientation was systematically investigated using first-principles calculation. The calculated results indicate that PbPdO2 ultrathin slab possesses a small indirect gap while an indirect-direct band gap transition occurs when a moderate 2% compression or tensile strain is applied on the slab. Moreover, this strain induced indirect-direct band gap transition was analyzed in detail using the charge density difference at different point of valence band. The charge transfer and energy barrier with charge polarization resulting from the changes of bond length and angle for Pd-O bonding under the strain, have been accounted for this transition. Remarkablely, for the (0 0 2) preferred orientation PbPdO2 slab, the predicted carrier mobilities of electrons and holes are 11 645.31 and 694.60 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) along the x-axis direction, 935.05 and 16.05 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) along the y -axis direction, respectively. These calculated mobilities of electrons along the x-axis direction are larger than those for 2D MoS2 (~400 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1)), and being comparable to those for InSe (10(3) cm(2) V(-1) s(-1)) and black phosphorene (10(3)-10(4) cm(2) V(-1) s(-1)). It is strong suggested that the (0 0 2) orientated PbPdO2 slab with high mobility should be an ideal candidate material for the application of electronics devices.",3
"Transport and topological properties of ThOCh(Ch: S, Se and Te) in bulk and monolayer: a first principles study.","The present study unveils the topological insulating nature of Th-based oxy-chalcogenides and their transport properties which are less explored. A systematic analysis of electronic, topological, mechanical, dynamical and thermoelectric properties of ThOCh (Ch: S, Se and Te) in bulk and monolayer is presented. The effect of spin-orbit coupling is found to be appreciable in ThOTe compared to ThOS and ThOSe, causing a strong topological nature in bulk ThOTe. The detailed analysis of electronic structure, Z2 topological invariant and conducting surface states support the strong topological nature in bulk ThOTe. From thermoelectric studies, ThOS and ThOSe are found to be good thermoelectric candidates with heavy carrier doping (around 10(20) cm(-3)). To explore further, we have applied hydrostatic strain on bulk ThOCh and found that all the compounds are dynamically stable and show topological metallic behavior. The appearance of highly linearized Dirac points in the same energy range at different high symmetry points in the BZ indicate the presence of nodal line in ThOS and ThOSe without spin-orbit coupling and with the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling, the nodal line is found to be disappear. This variation in bands with and without spin-orbit coupling might indicate the topological nature in monolayer ThOCh. The thermoelectric calculations for monolayer shows an enhancement in electrical conductivity scaled by relaxation time by an order of ten compared to bulk and the carrier independent thermoelectric properties in monolayer might fetch good thermoelectric device applications. Overall, the present study explores yet another series of potential candidates for topological and thermoelectric properties in both bulk and layer forms.",3
Confinement effect on the low temperature specific heat for ultrathin silicon nanowires: a first principles study.,"This work studied the phonon confinement effects at the low temperature specific heat of Si nanowires from first principles using density functional perturbation theory. The nanowires were modeled in the [0 0 1] direction for three different diameters, with the largest cross section being approximately 10 A. The results indicate the specific heat can be described at low temperatures using a third-grade polynomial of the form c v = lambdaT + betaT (2) + gammaT(3), where the coefficients of quadratic and cubic terms are almost nonexistent for small diameters. These terms begin to have relevance at larger diameters. Further analysis shows lambda > beta > gamma, which shows the phonon confinement (lambda) and surface atoms (beta) become more important than the volumetric contribution (gamma) for ultrathin nanowires at low temperatures.",3
Structure and physical properties of SeCo1-x Mn x O3.,"We describe the high-pressure (4 GPa) high-temperature ( approximately 1100 K) synthesis of the solid solution series SeCo1-x Mn x O3 (0 < x < 1) using H2SeO4 and transition metal oxide mixtures sealed in Pt capsules. Neutron powder diffraction has been performed to determine progression of the structure across the solution. All samples crystallise with orthorhombic Pnma symmetry, and octahedral tilting is determined to increase with Mn content. SQUID magnetometry measurements were performed, and reveal that the Neel temperature shifts only by approximately 1 K over the series.",3
Temperature-induced phase transitions in the rock-salt type SiC: a first-principles study.,"The phase transitions in the rock-salt type SiC (B1-SiC) under decompression are studied in the framework of first-principles molecular dynamics simulations up to room temperature. The transformation pathways were determined based on an analysis of the symmetry and phonon spectra of high-symmetry transient structures identified in the simulations. The plausible pathways of the transformation of B1-SiC into the 3C-, 2H-, 4H-, 12R-SiC polytypes were suggested. The transformation paths were found to depend on both the availability of soft phonon modes in an unreconstructed phase and the initial conditions of the simulation. It is shown that an increase in cell volume at decompression leads to the condensation of a certain phonon mode. As a result, an intermediate state forms due to the atomic displacements and to subsequent strains related to this mode. All the decompressed structures were compressed back under pressure of 120-250 GPa depending on the type of the decompressed phase and simulation temperature that was in the range of 300-1200 K. The suggested scheme of structural identification can be used to determine the transition paths for the structural transformations of other similar structures under pressure.",3
Carrier and spin dynamics of high-density exciton magnetic polarons in Cd0.8Mn0.2Te.,"We investigated the carrier and spin dynamics of high-density exciton magnetic polarons (HD-EMPs) in Cd0.8Mn0.2Te based on the measurement of their time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectra and polarization states, and the utilization of photo-induced Faraday rotation techniques. The PL from the HD-EMPs were collected in a forward scattering configuration, and was observed as a pulsed emission of a few picoseconds duration, exhibiting a blue-shift with time evolution. The blue shift originated from the refractive-index dispersion of the sample. By excluding the influence of the refractive-index dispersion on the time profile, it was revealed that the ultra-short pulsed emission with a time width smaller than 1 ps was initially radiated with a time delay of ~2.4 ps after photoexcitation. From the results of time evolution of the polarization states, it is concluded that the exciton-Mn spin interactions occurs immediately after the excitation, which causes the Mn ion spins to align to follow the spin states of photoexcited excitons. The alignment of the Mn ion spins through the formation of the HD-EMPs was significantly faster than that of the localized EMP. On the other hand, the time evolution of the photo-induced Faraday rotation showed two decay components attributed to spin relaxations of the excitons and Mn ions within the HD-EMP. The observation of the Faraday rotation signal due to the Mn ion spins further confirms that these spins were aligned by the photo-excited spin-aligned excitons. Our findings suggest a novel mechanism for the effective optical control of spins in a semimagnetic semiconductor, which is associated with a multi-exciton system and its localized state.",3
Optoelectronic and magnetic properties of Mn-doped and Mn-C co-doped Wurtzite ZnS: a first-principles study.,"In order to meet the requirement of spintronic and optoelectronic, we have systematically investigated the effect of Mn doping and co-doping of Mn with C on the electronic, magnetic and optical properties of wurtzite zinc sulfide (ZnS) using first principle calculations. Our results find that single Mn doping alters the non-magnetic ZnS to a magnetic one and keeps its semiconducting and a semiconductor to half-metal transition is observed for Mn-C co-doping. Furthermore, an antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) ground states are favorable for Mn-doped and Mn-C co-doped system, respectively. Additionally, the optical properties of our studied configuration have been calculated in terms of real and imaginary parts of the complex dielectric function, absorption coefficient, and reflectivity. The absorption edge shifts slightly toward lower energy and intensity of the main peak become weak for single Mn doping, and a sharp peak at low energy is observed for the Mn-C co-doping. The analysis of optical absorption of Mn ions doped system shows the blue- and red-shifts of the d-d transition in the AFM and FM coupled of Mn ions doped configuration, respectively which is in good agreement with the experimental observations. The improved magnetic and optical properties of Mn-C co-doped ZnS shed light on the future application of such kind of materials in spintronic and optoelectronic devices such as remote sensing and photovoltaics.",3
Silicon and germanium terminated (0 0 1)-(2 [Formula: see text] 1) diamond surface.,"Control over the chemical termination of diamond surfaces has shown great promise in the realization of field-emission applications, the selection of charge states of near-surface colour-centres such as NV, and the realisation of surface-conductive channels for electronic device applications. Experimental investigations of ultra-thin Si and Ge layers yield surface states both within the band-gap and resonant with the underlying diamond valence band. In this report, we report the results of density-functional simulations of a range of coverages of Si and Ge on diamond (0 0 1) surfaces. We have found that surface coverage with crystallogen:carbon ratios of 67% and 75% are more stable than both higher and lower coverages on the (0 0 1)-diamond surface, and that they can explain the observation of an occupied band around 1.7 eV below the valence band top. We also report geometries, adsorption energies and electron affinities of these surface structures, and show that the resonant state is made up from conventional spd-covalent [Formula: see text]-bonding orbitals between the surface adsorbates.",3
Use of thermal gradients for control of vortex matter in mesoscopic superconductors.,"Usually, the measurements of electronic and magnetic properties of superconducting samples are carried out under a constant temperature bath. On the other hand, thermal gradients induce local variation of the superconducting order parameter, and the vortex dynamics can present interesting behaviors. In this work, we solved the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations simulating samples under two different thermal gradients, and considering two values of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter, [Formula: see text]. We find that both parameters, i.e. [Formula: see text] and thermal gradients, play an important role on the vortex dynamics and on the magnetization behavior of the samples.",3
Ultrafast dynamics of strongly correlated fermions -- Nonequilibrium green functions and selfenergy approximations.,"This article presents an overview on recent progress in the theory of nonequilibrium Green functions (NEGF). We discuss applications of NEGF simulations to describe the femtosecond dynamics of various finite fermionic systems following an excitation out of equilibrium. &amp;#13; NEGF simulations have mostly been performed with rather simple selfenergy approximations such as the second-order Born approximation (SOA). While they correctly capture the qualitative trends of the relaxation towards equilibrium, the reliability and accuracy of these NEGF simulations has remained open, for a long time. &amp;#13; Here we report on recent tests of NEGF simulations against benchmark data. The results confirm the high accuracy of NEGF simulations---provided selfenergies adequately include strong correlation and dynamical-screening effects. With an extended arsenal of selfenergies that can be used effectively, the NEGF approach has the potential of becoming a powerful simulation tool with broad areas of new applications including strongly correlated solids and ultracold atoms. &amp;#13; The present review aims at making such applications possible. To this end we present a selfcontained introduction to the theory of NEGF and give an overview on recent numerical applications to compute the ultrafast relaxation dynamics of correlated fermions. In the second part we give a detailed introduction to selfenergies beyond the SOA. Important examples are the third-order approximation, the GW approximation, the T-matrix approximation and the fluctuating-exchange approximation. We give a comprehensive summary of the explicit selfenergy expressions for a variety of systems of practical relevance, starting from the most general expressions and the Feynman diagrams, and including also the important cases of diagonal basis sets, the Hubbard model and the differences occuring for bosons and fermions. With these details, and information on the computational effort and scaling with the basis size and propagation duration, an easy use of these approximations in numerical applications is made possible.&amp;#13.",3
Thermoelectric properties of gapped bilayer graphene.,"Unlike in conventional semiconductors, both the chemical potential and the band gap in bilayer graphene (BLG) can be tuned via application of external electric field. Among numerous device implications, this property also designates BLG as a candidate for high-performance thermoelectric material. In this theoretical study we have calculated the Seebeck coefficients for abrupt interface separating weakly- and heavily-doped areas in BLG, and for a more realistic rectangular sample of mesoscopic size, contacted by two electrodes. For a given band gap ([Formula: see text]) and temperature (T) the maximal Seebeck coefficient is close to the Goldsmid-Sharp value [Formula: see text], the deviations can be approximated by the asymptotic expression [Formula: see text], with the electron charge -e, the Boltzmann constant [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text]. Surprisingly, the effects of trigonal warping term in the BLG low-energy Hamiltonian are clearly visible at few-Kelvin temperatures, for all accessible values of [Formula: see text] meV. We also show that thermoelectric figure of merit is noticeably enhanced (ZT > 3) when a rigid substrate suppresses out-of-plane vibrations, reducing the contribution from ZA phonons to the thermal conductivity.",3
Barut-Girardello coherent states for anisotropic 2D-Dirac materials.,"We construct the Barut-Girardello coherent states for charge carriers in anisotropic 2D-Dirac materials immersed in a constant homogeneous magnetic field which is orthogonal to the sample surface. For that purpose, we solve the anisotropic Dirac equation and identify the appropriate arising and lowering operators. Working in a Landau-like gauge, we explicitly construct nonlinear coherent states as eigenstates of a generalized annihilation operator with complex eigenvalues which depends on an arbitrary function f of the number operator. In order to describe the anisotropy effects on these states, we obtain the Heisenberg uncertainty relation, the probability density, mean energy value and occupation number distribution for three different functions f . For the case in which the anisotropy is caused by uniaxial strain, we obtain that when the stress is applied along the x-axis of the material surface, the probability density for the nonlinear coherent states is smaller compared to when the material is stressed along the orthogonal axis.",3
The theory of scanning quantum dot microscopy.,"Electrostatic forces are among the most common interactions in nature and omnipresent at the nanoscale. Scanning probe methods represent a formidable approach to study these interactions locally. The lateral resolution of such images is, however, often limited as they are based on measuring the force (gradient) due to the entire tip interacting with the entire surface. Recently, we developed scanning quantum dot microscopy (SQDM), a new technique for the imaging and quantification of surface potentials which is based on the gating of a nanometer-size tip-attached quantum dot by the local surface potential and the detection of charge state changes via non-contact atomic force microscopy. Here, we present a rigorous formalism in the framework of which SQDM can be understood and interpreted quantitatively. In particular, we present a general theory of SQDM based on the classical boundary value problem of electrostatics, which is applicable to the full range of sample properties (conductive versus insulating, nanostructured versus homogeneously covered). We elaborate the general theory into a formalism suited for the quantitative analysis of images of nanostructured but predominantly flat and conductive samples.",3
Destruction of multiferroicity in Tb2BaNiO5 by Sr-doping and its implication to magnetodielectric coupling.,"The Haldane spin-chain compound, Tb2BaNiO5, with two antiferromagnetic transitions, one at T 1 = 63 K and the other at T 2 = 25 K, has been recently shown to be an exotic multiferroic below T 2. Here, we report the results of our investigation of Sr doping at the Ba site by magnetization, heat-capacity, magnetodielectric (MDE) and pyrocurrent measurements. An intriguing finding, which we stress, is that the ferroelectricity is lost even for a doping level of ten atomic percent, though magnetic ordering prevails. The doped specimens however retain significant MDE behaviour, but with reduced magnitudes and qualitative changes with respect to the behaviour of the parent compound. This implies that ferroelectric order is also crucial for the anomalously large MDE in the parent compound, in addition to the role of 4f single-ion anisotropy.",3
Comparative study on the pressure-induced phase transformation of anatase TiO2 hollow and solid microspheres.,"Nanostructured anatase TiO2 undergoes pressure-induced phase transformation, and the transformation sequence is significantly different from the bulk counterpart. The size and the morphology are found both playing a critical role in the phase transformation behavior. In this work, we prepare anatase TiO2 microspheres using a hydrothermal method. By controlling the reaction time, hollow and solid spheres of similar diameters are prepared. TEM and XRD analysis reveals that these microspheres are aggregates of anatase nanocrystalline of size between 15-16 nm. The phase transformation behaviour under high temperature is examined in situ using both Raman spectroscopy and synchrotron x-ray diffraction. We find that although both solid and hollow spheres are micron-sized, they undergo phase transformation sequence similar to nanomaterials with size of several tens of nanometers. Hollow spheres exhibit a higher compressibility than the solid spheres. A detailed analysis based on the formation mechanism of the spheres is performed to explain the unique phase transformation behavior of these materials.",3
Revealing 'plasmaron' feature in DySb by optical spectroscopy study.,"We report magnetic susceptibility, resistivity and optical spectroscopy study on single crystal sample DySb. It exhibits extremely large magnetoresistance (XMR), and a magnetic phase transition from paramagnetic (PM) to antiferromagnetic (AFM) state at about 10 K. A 'screened' plasma edge at about 4000 cm(-1) is revealed by optical measurement, which suggests that the material has a low carrier density. With decreasing temperature, the 'screened' plasma edge shows a blue shift, possibly due to a decrease of the effective mass of carriers. Notably, an anomalous temperature dependent midinfrared absorption feature is observed in the vicinity of the 'screened' plasma edge. In addition, it can be connected to the inflection point in the real part of the dielectric function [Formula: see text], the frequency of which exactly tracks the temperature dependent 'screened' plasma frequency. This phenomena can be explained by the appearance of a coupled electron-plasmon 'plasmaron' feature.",3
Temperature dependent transport spin-polarization in the low Curie temperature complex itinerant ferromagnet EuTi1-x Nb x O3.,"The physical systems with ferromagnetism and 'bad' metallicity hosting unusual transport properties are playgrounds of novel quantum phenomena. Recently EuTi1-x Nb x O3 emerged as a ferromagnetic system where non-trivial temperature dependent transport properties are observed due to coexistence and competition of various magnetic and non-magnetic scattering processes. In the ferromagnetic state, the resistivity shows a T (2) temperature dependence possibly due to electron-magnon scattering and above the Curie temperature [Formula: see text], the dependence changes to T (3/2) behaviour indicating a correlation between transport and magnetic properties. In this paper, we show that the transport spin-polarization ([Formula: see text]) in EuTi1-x Nb x O3, a low Curie temperature ferromagnet, is as high ( approximately 40%) as that in some of the metallic ferromagnets with high Curie temperatures. In addition, owing to the low Curie temperature of EuTi1-x Nb x O3, the temperature (T) dependence of [Formula: see text] could be measured systematically up to [Formula: see text] which revealed a proportionate relationship with magnetization [Formula: see text] versus T. This indicates that such proportionality is far more universally valid than the ferromagnets with ideal parabolic bands. Furthermore, our band structure calculations not only helped to understand the origin of such high spin polarization in EuTi1-x Nb x O3 but also provided a route to estimate the Hubbard U parameter in complex metallic ferromagnets in general using experimental inputs.",3
Nanoscale size effect and phonon properties of silicon material through simple spectral energy density analysis based on molecular dynamics.,"Due to the importance of spectral analysis for the development of highly efficient semiconductor silicon devices and the complexity of current research techniques, the realization of an effective and simple method for phonon spectral analysis is imperative. Based on the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the phonon spectral energy density (SED) analysis (Thomas et al 2010 Phys. Rev. B 81 081411), a straightforward method is adopted to obtain the phonon dispersion for silicon films. The MD method is used to investigate the heat conduction of the three-dimensional (3D) thin silicon film with Stillinger-Weber (SW) potential. The thermal conductivity of the silicon is obtained from the non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulation by using Muller-Plathe (M-P) method (Muller-Plathe 1997 J. Chem. Phys. 106 6082). For further analysis of thermal transport properties based on the phonon concept, the SED analysis technique is utilized by adopting the previously obtained atomic velocities as input. Moreover, the nanoscale size effect on the spectral analysis is considered. Domains with different sizes are studied to achieve a sufficient resolution of the dispersion relation from the phonon SED. The comparison with the results of existing approach demonstrates that the utilized method can accurately and directly obtain the phonon SED profiles along the frequency axis.",3
Modulation of magnetocrystalline anisotropy in FePt/PbTiO3 heterostructures by ferroelectric polarization.,"Reducing the power consumption required for magnetization reversal is an urgent problem for spin storage device. Electric-field control of the magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) using multiferroics materials is a promising method to solve this problem. Based on density functional theory, we investigated the effects of the ferroelectric polarization on MAE of FePt/PbTiO3 multiferroic heterostructures. The MAEs of FePt monolayer with different polarization intensity are calculated. Our results indicated that the interfaces coupling between ferroelectric terminals and ferromagnetic terminals have a very large impact on the MAE of FePt monolayer. Moreover, with the reversal of the polarization orientation of ferroelectric PbTiO3 films, the MAE of ferromagnetic FePt monolayer has a monotonous but non-linear change. We demonstrated that the reversal of the polarization orientation results in a redistribution of charge density at the interface, thus resulting in a monotonic change in MAE with polarization intensity. It is provided an effective way to modulate the MAE by controlling the polarization intensity of ferroelectric layers.",3
Calculating adsorption isotherms using Lennard Jones particle density distributions.,"The computation of particle density distributions in pore channels is a fundamental post process practice in molecular adsorption simulations. The distributions, although not appropriate for direct experimental interrogation, when expressed in variable temperature, may be used to evaluate thermodynamic properties. As with molecular simulations, we can spotlight any frame or region of interest inside the computational cell, the distributions and subsequently the thermodynamic evaluations can be pore or site specific. This allows us to establish correlations for the adsorption capacity, on different pore partitions and surface textures and compare strengths of explicit interactions. We confirm this assumption using adsorption simulations of Lennard Jones particles such as argon in the dual cylindrical cavity of ZIF-69. We initiate the computations from the density distribution functions and reproduce full curves of adsorption isotherms which correlate well with the direct simulations. The computations are fast and implemented using linear van' t Hoff plots for the surface coverage at a sequence of pressures.",3
"Probing magnetic order and disorder in the one-dimensional molecular spin chains CuF2(pyz) and [Ln(hfac)3(boaDTDA)] n (Ln = Sm, La) using implanted muons.","We present the results of muon-spin relaxation ([Formula: see text]SR) measurements on antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic spin chains. In antiferromagnetic CuF2(pyz) we identify a transition to long range magnetic order taking place at [Formula: see text] K, allowing us to estimate a ratio with the intrachain exchange of [Formula: see text] and the ratio of interchain to intrachain exchange coupling as [Formula: see text]. The ferromagnetic chain [Sm(hfac)3(boaDTDA)] n undergoes an ordering transition at [Formula: see text] K, seen via a broad freezing of dynamic fluctuations on the muon (microsecond) timescale and implying [Formula: see text]. The ordered radical moment continues to fluctuate on this timescale down to 0.3 K, while the Sm moments remain disordered. In contrast, the radical spins in [La(hfac)3(boaDTDA)] n remain magnetically disordered down to T = 0.1 K suggesting [Formula: see text].",3
Anomalous spin Nernst effect in Weyl semimetals.,"The spin Nernst effect describes a transverse spin current induced by the longitudinal thermal gradient in a system with the spin-orbit coupling. Here we study the spin Nernst effect in a mesoscopic four-terminal cross-bar Weyl semimetal device under a perpendicular magnetic field. Because the spin current is a tensor, it has three elements with the spin direction pointing to the x, y and z directions when the spin current flows along the transverse lead. By using the tight-binding Hamiltonian combined with the nonequilibrium Green's function method, the three elements of the spin current in the transverse leads and the spin Nernst coefficients are obtained. The results show that the spin Nernst effect in the Weyl semimetal has an essential difference to the traditional Nernst effect: we found that the z direction spin current is zero without the magnetic field while it appears under the magnetic field, and the x and y direction spin currents in the two transverse leads flow out or in together, in contrast to the traditional spin Nernst effect, in which the spin current is induced by the spin-orbit coupling and flows out from one lead and flows in on the other. We call it the anomalous spin Nernst effect. In addition, we show that the Weyl semimetals have inversion-type symmetry, mirror-reversal-type symmetry and electron-hole-type symmetry, which lead to the spin Nernst coefficients being either odd or even functions of the Fermi energy, the magnetic field and the transverse terminals. Moreover, the spin Nernst effect in the Weyl semimetals are strongly anisotropic and its coefficients are strongly dependent on both the direction of thermal gradient and the direction of the transverse lead connection. Three non-equivalent connection modes (x-z, z-x and x-y modes) are studied in detail, and the spin Nernst coefficients for three different modes exhibit very different behaviors. These strongly anisotropic behaviors of the spin Nernst effect can be used as the characterization of magnetic Weyl semimetals.",3
Electric field effect on the contact angle for non-wetting drops.,"A microscopic model is formulated concerning the electrowetting of an electrically conducting drop on a dielectric substrate. The interaction energy between the drop and substrate includes both van der Waals attractive forces and Born repulsive forces resulting in an equilibrium gap. An augmented Young-Laplace equation is derived and used as the basis for calculations of wetting phenomena both with and without an applied voltage. In the absence of an electric field, a well-defined Young's angle is established at a distance from the meniscus incipience that is less than 100 times the equilibrium gap. An expression for Young's angle is determined showing its dependence on material properties of the system. With an electric field applied, the meniscus angle changes continuously from the three-phase line (TPL), where it is near zero, until after a distance of at least ten times the thickness of the dielectric where the Lippmann angle is established. Therefore, the initial angle is not the Lippmann angle and care must be taken in the interpretation of measurements of an apparent contact angle.",3
Influence of the preparation conditions on the morphology and photocatalytic performance Pt-modified hexaniobate composites.,"The preparation of lamellar nanostructures through exfoliation of stacked niobates is an interesting approach to the development of photocatalysts for energy conversion and environmental remediation. These materials exhibit a rich surface chemistry and several nanocomposites can be produced through intercalation or impregnation of suitable precursors. In this work, the influence of the physico-chemical preparation conditions on the photocatalytic activity of Pt-hexaniobate nanocomposites was investigated aiming at the establishment of the main factors that control their photoreactivities. Modification of hexaniobate layers were carried out by adsorption and impregnation methods, using [Pt(NH3)4]Cl2 (Pt1) and H2PtCl6 (Pt2), respectively. The addition of platinum precursors (1% wt.) were performed in the presence of the exfoliating agent tert-butylammonium hydroxide, sNb, or after acidic precipitation followed by resuspension in plain water, eNb. All samples were submitted to photoirradiation to reduce the platinum precursors and the effect of a previous thermal treatment was also evaluated. It was observed that H2 evolution from aqueous methanol solutions is more favored on hexaniobate nanosheets (eNb-Pt1 and eNb-Pt2) instead of scrolled layers (sNb-Pt1 and sNb-Pt2), independent on the platinum precursor. Moreover, residual tert-butylammonium can act as hole scavenger and decrease the degradation rates for methanol oxidation in sNb samples. The curled layers observed for sNb samples seem to favor the photodegradation of cationic species, such as methylene blue. Thermal treatment at 500 degrees C leads to morphological changes with a decrease of the specific surface area due to restacking of the individual layers along with some curling. As a result, the H2 evolution rates strongly decreases in relation to the non-sintered samples, suggesting that the 'soft' photoreduction of platinum precursors is the best method for preparation of these photocatalysts. The correlations between the preparation conditions and the photocatalytic activity for different photoreactions can allow the development of optimized materials for specific applications.",3
Broken translational and rotational symmetries in LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 spinel.,"In condensed matter physics broken symmetries and emergence of quasi-particles are intimately linked to each other. Whenever a symmetry is broken, it leaves its fingerprints, and that may be observed indirectly via its influence on the other quasi-particles. Here, we report the strong signature of broken spin rotational symmetry induced due to long range-ordering of spins in Mn - sublattice of LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 below T c ~ 113 K reflected with the marked changes in the lattice vibrations using Raman scattering. In particular, the majority of the observed first-order phonon modes show a sharp shift in frequency in the vicinity of long range magnetic-ordering temperature. Phonons exist in a crystalline system because of broken translational symmetry, therefore any renormalization in the phonon-spectrum could be a good gauge for broken translational symmetry. Anomalous evolution of the few modes associated with stretching of Mn/NiO6 octahedra in the intermediate temperature range (~60-260 K) marked the broken translational symmetry attributed to the charge ordering. Interestingly same modes also show strong coupling with magnetic degrees of freedom, suggesting that charge-ordering and magnetic transition may be linked to each other.",3
Stability predictions of magnetic M2AX compounds.,"Based on high throughput density functional theory calculations, we evaluated systematically the stability of 580 M2AX compounds. The thermodynamic, mechanical, and dynamical stability and the magnetic structure are calculated. We found 20 compounds fulfilling all three stability criteria, confirming Cr2AlC, Cr2GeC, Cr2GaC, Cr2GaN, and Mn2 GaC, which have been synthesized. The stability trends with respect to the M- and A-elements are discussed by analyzing the formation energies, indicating that Cr and Mn containing M2AX compounds are more stable than Fe, Co, or Ni containing compounds. Further insights on the stability are obtained by detailed analysis of the crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP).",3
Advanced diffuse reflectance spectroscopy for studies of photochromic/photoactive solids.,"The present article reports novel opportunities of diffuse reflectance (DR) spectroscopy extended through the use of a cryostat accessory for UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometers to investigate temperature dependences of DR spectra at the fundamental absorption edge of semiconductors at T = 90-600 K. Examined are rutile TiO2, a photochromic rutile TiO2 with strong absorption in the visible region, and the halide double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 that exhibited two optical band-to-band transitions in low-temperature DR spectra. Also reported are DR spectral and kinetics measurements of the separation of photogenerated charge carriers in various trap sites, their thermostimulated detrapping and their recombination in two different photochromic materials. The similarity between absorption and temperature-programmed annealing (TPA) spectra induced in the UV and Vis regions yielded physical evidence of the photo-formation of charge carriers upon Vis-light excitation of intrinsic defects (F-type centers) in yellow rutile TiO2. High-temperature oxidative/reductive treatments of samples, together with spectral and kinetics measurements were performed in situ with the accessory. Results led to assigning color centers in yellow TiO2 to Ti(3+) centers as deep electron traps, and to the establishment of several types of Ti(3+)-based color centers that include extra-negatively charged Ti (delta+) centers (3 > delta > 2). Photochromic occurrences are also elucidated in the Bi-doped perovskite CsPbBr3 under illumination in the region of intrinsic absorption and annealing of photoinduced absorption at T = 200-400 K. These phenomena are described in terms of the photogeneration of charge carriers followed by their trapping, which yielded Bi-related electron color centers responsible for the photoinduced absorption and for the thermostimulated detrapping of photoholes that ultimately recombine with the trapped electrons. The establishment of photochromism in the perovskites may lead to a further understanding of photoinduced and dark reversible phenomena in halide perovskites and halide perovskite-based solar cells.",3
Attaching titania clusters of various size to reduced graphene oxide and its impact on the conceivable photocatalytic behavior of the junctions-a DFT/D + U and TD DFTB modeling.,"DFT/D + U and density functional based tight binding (DFTB) molecular modeling was used to investigate the role of the structural, electronic and optical properties of reduced graphene oxide surface (r-GO), hybridized with hydrated TiO2 moieties of various size, ranging from small molecular Ti2O4 clusters into extended Ti43O86 rutile type nanocrystals of ~5 nm diameter. The calculated adhesion energies, varying from -5.048 eV (r-GO|Ti2O4), -12.159 eV (r-GO|Ti5O10), -18.499 eV (r-GO|Ti15O30) to -42.484 eV (r-GO|Ti43O86), indicate high stability of these composites. It was shown that electronic interactions at the r-GO|(1 1 0)TiO2 interface give rise to net charge flow from the r-GO substrate towards the TiO2 moieties, analyzed in terms of the partial charge density 3D plots and an interfacial dipole moment formation. The DOS structure of the composites was calculated by means of the time dependent DFTB approach, and the position and composition of the VB and CB edges, along with the presence of weak mid-gap 2p C states originating from the intact graphene-like patches in the r-GO substrate were discussed in detail in the context of conceivable photocatalytic activity of the composites. The constructed band alignment diagram implies formation of the staggered type II scheme, with the electric field offset that is sensitive to the titania cluster size. In the case of the nano-reticular TiO2, where only a fraction of the Ti atoms is engaged in the Ti-O-C linkers formation, recombination of the photogenerated charges is inhibited owing to favorable spatial separation effect. For small molecular TiO2 clusters with all Ti cations anchored to the r-GO layer fast cross-relaxation quenches the beneficial interfacial charge separation effect, since the strong hybridization of the oxygen and carbon states provides a convenient pathway for the efficient electronic coupling between the CB edge states of r-GO and the VB edge states of the TiO2 moieties. A phenomenological model of the molecular r-GO|Ti2O4 and the reticular r-GO|Ti43O86 composites was constructed in account for different photocatalytic behavior of both junctions.",3
Quantum Liquids.,"This article is dedicated to Roger A. Cowley and his seminal contributions to our understanding of&amp;#13; quantum liquids, both liquid 4He and 3He. Roger Cowley's neutron scattering measurements of the&amp;#13; collective and independent particle response of liquid 4He were made at Chalk River Laboratories&amp;#13; in 1965-74 chiefl&amp;#13; y with A. D. B. (Dave) Woods. They measured the phonon-roton (P-R) mode&amp;#13; energy, intensity and width with new precision. Particularly, they extended the measurements&amp;#13; to higher wave vector and identied both collective and single particle response regimes. They&amp;#13; showed that the P-R mode terminated at a nite energy as predicted by Pitaeskii rather than&amp;#13; continuing as predicted by Feynman and Feynman and Cohen. They determined both the single&amp;#13; P-R mode and multimode contributions to the dynamics. They made direct comparison with&amp;#13; theory which Roger understood well. They observed the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) fraction&amp;#13; in liquid 4He for the rst time. This appears to be the rst ever observation of BEC in any Bose&amp;#13; gas or liquid. Roger Cowley's pioneering measurements of the density excitations of liquid 3He&amp;#13; were made at the Institut Laue Langevin (ILL) in the period 1973-80. Roger, Reinhard Scherm,&amp;#13; W. G. (Bill) Stirling and collaborators showed for the rst time that the density response of&amp;#13; this highly neutron absorbing liquid could indeed be observed with neutrons. They documented&amp;#13; with others the dynamic response as a function of temperature and pressure stimulating extensive&amp;#13; theoretical and experimental interest that continues today.",3
Temperature dependent local atomic displacements in NaSn2As2 system.,"NaSn2As2 is mechanically exfoliable layered van der Waals (vdW) Zintl phase that is getting interesting due to its low thermal conductivity and recently observed superconductivity. Here, we have investigated the temperature dependent local structure of NaSn2As2 by a combined analysis of As K-edge and Sn K-edge extended x-ray absorption fine structure measurements. The system is intrinsically disordered with the interatomic distances largely consistent to those estimated by average structure measurements. The stretching force constants of different bond distances have been determined using temperature dependent mean square relative displacements. The Sn-As distance is the strongest bond in this system, having covalent nature, unlike the weaker interlayer distances which are characterized by vdW type bonding. Among them, As-Na distance is slightly weaker than Sn-Sn(i) below approximately 200 K and tends to get stronger above this temperature. The anomalous behavior of As-Na bond suggests that the mechanical exfoliation in this system is likely to be temperature dependent. The anomaly in the interlayer atomic correlations may be due to a charge density wave-like instability around this temperature, indicated by earlier experiments. The local structure and disorder are discussed in relation to the physical properties of NaSn2As2.",3
Electronic behaviors during martensitic transformations in all-d-metal Heusler alloys.,"For solid-state phase transitions, the alterations of electronic structure driven by the band Jahn-Teller effect would play an essential role in the structural phase transitions and in switching the resistivity or magnetization states for potential applications. However, this evolution of the electronic structure and electronic transport during the martensitic transformations (MT) still lacks comprehensive investigations, especially in magnetic martensitic materials studied in recent years. In this work, we report a study on the electronic behaviors during the MT in a kind of all-d-metal Ni50-x Fe x Mn35Ti15 Heusler magnetic shape memory alloys, by combining x-ray diffraction, calorimetric, magnetic, transport measurements and calculations. Based on the magnetic MTs, the system shows large magnetocaloric effect and magnetoresistance. In the whole temperature range, the system is dominated by hole carriers in both parent and martensite phases. A sharp increase in carrier concentration is observed across the transformations. Meanwhile, the mobility of holes is depressed due to the lattice distortion. A picture of the characteristics of MTs has been proposed for general understanding and clues of the potential spintronic applications based on the magnetostructural phase transitions.",3
Computational modelling of intrinsic defects in the orthosilicates Y2SiO5 and Lu2SiO5.,"Atomistic computer modelling techniques were applied to study the intrinsic defects in the Y2SiO5 (YSO) and Lu2SiO5 (LSO) structures at 0 and 300 K temperatures. The approach used is based on the interatomic potentials model and lattice energy minimization. A set of potential parameters were obtained by empirical adjustment and reproduced the lattice parameters with values better than 0.98% and 2.24% for YSO and LSO, respectively. Intrinsic defects were performed using the well-known Mott-Littleton method. Two conditions were adopted to calculate defects: for unbonded condition, point defects (vacancies and interstitials) were calculated without possible interactions with each other; for bounded condition, point defects interact with each other through coulomb and short-range potentials. All possible configurations were tested for Frenkel and Schottky defects in unbounded condition and only the most favourable defect configuration was considered in bounded condition. Oxygen Frenkel type is the most favourable energetic defect in both structures at both temperatures. Bounded defects calculations showed that oxygen vacancy and interstitial located in first coordinate sphere have the lowest solution energy values for LSO. However, the most favourable defect positions are further apart in the YSO structure. The bounded condition was most favourable decreasing the energetic costs of the defect for all cases demonstrating that the interaction of O Frenkel pair should be consider in future works.",3
Magnetic force theory combined with quasi-particle self-consistent GW method.,"We report a successful combination of magnetic force linear response theory with quasiparticle self-consistent GW method. The self-consistently determined wavefunctions and eigenvalues can just be used for the conventional magnetic force calculations. While its formulation is straightforward, this combination provides a way to investigate the effect of GW self-energy on the magnetic interactions which can hardly be quantified due to the limitation of current GW methodology in calculating the total energy difference in between different magnetic phases. In ferromagnetic 3d elements, GW self-energy slightly reduces the d bandwidth and enhances the interactions while the same long-range feature is maintained. In antiferromagnetic transition-metal monoxides, QSGW significantly reduces the interaction strengths by enlarging the gap. Orbital-dependent magnetic force calculations show that the coupling between e g and the nominally-empty 4s orbital is noticeably large in MnO which is reminiscent of the discussion for cuprates regarding the role of Cu-4s state. This combination of magnetic force theory with quasiparticle self-consistent GW can be a useful tool to study various magnetic materials.",3
Temperature and excitation wavelength dependence of circular and linear photogalvanic effect in a three dimensional topological insulator Bi2Se3.,"The circular (CPGE) and linear photogalvanic effect (LPGE) of a three-dimensional topological insulator Bi2Se3 thin film of seven quintuple layers excited by near-infrared (1064 nm) and mid-infrared (10.6 [Formula: see text]m) radiations have been investigated. The comparison of the CPGE current measured parallel and perpendicular to the incident plane, together with the comparison of the CPGE current under front and back illuminations, indicates that the CPGE under front illumination of 1064 nm light is dominated by the top surface states of the Bi2Se3 thin film. The CPGE current excited by 10.6 [Formula: see text]m light is about one order larger than that excited by 1064 nm light, which may be attributed to the smaller cancelation effect of the CPGE generated in the two-dimensional electron gas when excited by 10.6 [Formula: see text]m light. Under the excitation of 1064 nm light, the LPGE current is dominated by the component which shows an even parity of incident angles, while the LPGE current excited by 10.6 [Formula: see text]m light is mainly contributed by the component which is an odd parity of incident angles. Both of the CPGE and LPGE currents excited by 1064 nm decrease with increasing temperature, which may be owing to the decrease of the momentum relaxation time and the stronger electron-electron scattering with increasing temperature, respectively.",3
Visualization and investigation of the non-thermalized electrons in an InAs nanowire by scanning gate microscopy.,"We performed scanning gate microscopy measurements on an InAs nanowire at T = 4.2 K in an external magnetic field. We visualizeded non-thermalized electrons passed under narrow metallic contact. It was found that, for such kind of electrons, suppression of the weak antilocalization quantum correction occurs with a magnetic field at least three times smaller than the corresponding one measured for the whole electronic system of the wire.",3
"Interaction of CO, O, and CO2 with Cu cluster supported on Cu(1 1 1): a density functional theory study.","We performed density functional theory (DFT) based calculations to investigate the interaction of CO2 and its dissociated species (CO and O) on Cu3 cluster supported on Cu(1 1 1) (Cu3/Cu(1 1 1)) surfaces. Similar investigations were conducted on Cu(1 1 1) for purpose of comparison. In general, adsorption of CO and O are stronger on the cluster region than on the terrace region of Cu3/Cu and on the flat Cu surface. CO2, on the other hand, is weakly adsorbed on the surfaces. With reference to CO2 dissociation on Cu(1 1 1), we found that the cluster lowers the activation barrier and provides a more stable adsorption of the dissociated species. The presence of co-adsorbed CO in the cluster, however, will increase the activation energy. The variation in the activation barrier with the amount of CO is influenced by the stability of the O atom from the dissociated CO2. We further found that the adsorption energy of O atom is a possible descriptor for CO2 dissociation on the cluster region. The Cu cluster supported on Cu surface could be a promising catalyst for CO2 related reactions based on the lower activation energy for CO2 dissociation on the system than on Cu(1 1 1).",3
Structural and magnetic properties of the Yb2Pd2(In1-x Sn x ) system: a synchrotron x-ray and neutron powder diffraction investigation.,"The structural properties of the Yb2Pd2(In1-x Sn x ) system were investigated at room temperature by synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction. All the inspected compositions (x = 0.0, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9) crystallize in the tetragonal space group P4/mbm; the cell parameters exhibit a non-linear dependence on composition, whereas cell volume changes more regularly, with a minimum at x = 0.8. Samples with Sn content x = 0.5, 0.6, 0.9 were also analysed by neutron diffraction down to 0.5 K. No evidence for a structural transition can be detected at low temperature, whereas an antiferromagnetic ordering is observed, characterized by a propagation vectors k = (0,0,(1/2)). Magnetic moments order in the tetragonal ab-plane and the magnetic structure belongs to the Shubnikov magnetic space group P4/mbm.",3
Tunable electronic properties of monolayer MnPSe3/MoTe2 heterostructure: a first principles study.,"The construction of van der Waals heterostructures is deemed to be a novel scheme to circumvent the shortcomings of their components and bear potentials for applications in electronic devices. Here we systematically investigate the structural and electronic properties of a monolayer MnPSe3/MoTe2 heterostructure with the first principles calculations. The heterostructure stablizes in the antiferromagnetic state and possesses a typical type-II band alignment, with which the photoexcited electrons and holes can be effectively separated and their fast recombination can hence be suppressed. Meanwhile, an inherent electric field is observed at the interface between MnPSe3 and MoTe2. Interestingly, the band gap of the heterostructure shows a quasi-linear dependence on the external electric field applied, and is tunable within the semiconductor to semimetal range. The tunability with applied strain is also investigated and discussed.",3
Observation of quantum topological Hall effect in the Weyl semimetal candidate HgSe.,"The magnetoresistance (MR) and Hall effect of a single HgSe crystal with an extremely low electron concentration of 8.8 x 10(15) cm(-3) were studied in a quantising magnetic field applied both along and across the direction of the electric current. As the result, a broad plateau was discovered in the ordinary (transverse) Hall resistance in the quantum limit. Within a framework of quantum spin Hall effect for an inversion breaking Weyl semimetal, we associate this plateau with a contribution to Hall conductivity from Chern insulator edge states when only a zero Landau level is occupied. In addition to the plateau in the quantum limit, we also detected a well-developed plateau-like behaviour in a phenomenologically-introduced 'longitudinal' Hall resistivity. In the 'longitudinal' Hall conductivity, a step-like behaviour was revealed, which we identify with the discovery of half-integer quantum spin Hall effect in HgSe. This effect, being purely topological in origin, supplements the non-trivial Weyl semimetal physics and may serve as a promising magnetotransport method for the detection of Weyl nodes in a studied material.",3
Route to achieving enhanced quantum capacitance in functionalized graphene based supercapacitor electrodes.,"We have investigated the quantum capacitance ([Formula: see text]) in functionalized graphene modified with ad-atoms from different groups in the periodic table. Changes in the electronic band structure of graphene upon functionalization and subsequently the [Formula: see text] of the modified graphene were systematically analyzed using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We observed that the [Formula: see text] can be enhanced significantly by means of controlled doping of N, Cl and P ad-atoms in the pristine graphene surface. These ad-atoms are behaving as magnetic impurities in the system, generating a localized density of states near the Fermi energy which, in turn, increases charge (electron/hole) carrier density in the system. As a result, a very high quantum capacitance was observed. Finally, the temperature dependent study of [Formula: see text] for Cl and N functionalized graphene shows that the [Formula: see text] remains very high in a wide range of temperatures near room temperature.",3
"The interplay of interfaces, supramolecular assembly, and electronics in organic semiconductors.","Organic semiconductors, which include a diverse range of carbon-based small molecules and polymers with interesting optoelectronic properties, offer many advantages over conventional inorganic semiconductors such as silicon and are growing in importance in electronic applications. Although these materials are now the basis of a lucrative industry in electronic displays, many promising applications such as photovoltaics remain largely untapped. One major impediment to more rapid development and widespread adoption of organic semiconductor technologies is that device performance is not easily predicted from the chemical structure of the constituent molecules. Fundamentally, this is because organic semiconductor molecules, unlike inorganic materials, interact by weak non-covalent forces, resulting in significant structural disorder that can strongly impact electronic properties. Nevertheless, directional forces between generally anisotropic organic-semiconductor molecules, combined with translational symmetry breaking at interfaces, can be exploited to control supramolecular order and consequent electronic properties in these materials. This review surveys recent advances in understanding of supramolecular assembly at organic-semiconductor interfaces and its impact on device properties in a number of applications, including transistors, light-emitting diodes, and photovoltaics. Recent progress and challenges in computer simulations of supramolecular assembly and orientational anisotropy at these interfaces is also addressed.",3
Ab initio electronic structure calculations using a real-space Chebyshev-filtered subspace iteration method.,"Ab initio electronic structure calculations within Kohn-Sham density functional theory requires a solution for the Kohn-Sham equation. However, the traditional self-consistent field (SCF) approach of solving the equation using iterative diagonalization exhibits an inherent cubic scaling behavior and becomes prohibitive for large systems. The Chebyshev-filtered subspace iteration (CheFSI) method holds considerable promise for large-system calculations by substantially accelerating the SCF procedure. Here, we employed a combination of the real space finite-difference formulation and CheFSI to solve the Kohn-Sham equation, and implemented this approach in ab initio Real-space Electronic Structure (ARES) software in a multi-processor, parallel environment. An improved scheme was proposed to generate the initial subspace of Chebyshev filtering in ARES efficiently, making it suitable for large-scale simulations. The accuracy, stability, and efficiency of the ARES software were illustrated by simulations of large-scale crystalline systems containing thousands of atoms.",3
Corrigendum: Strain-stress relationship and dislocation evolution of W-Cu bilayers from a constructed n-body W-Cu potential (2019 J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 31 305002).,"An n-body W-Cu potential is constructed under the framework of the embedded-atom method by means of a proposed function of the cross potential. This W-Cu potential is realistic to reproduce mechanical property and structural stability of WCu solid solutions within the entire composition range, and has better performances than the three W-Cu potentials already published in the literature. Based on this W-Cu potential, molecular dynamics simulation is conducted to reveal the mechanical property and dislocation evolution of the bilayer structure between pure W and W0.7Cu0.3 solid solution. It is found that the formation of the interface improves the strength of the W0.7Cu0.3 solid solutions along tensile loading perpendicular to the interface, as the interface impedes the evolution of the dislocation lines from the W0.7Cu0.3 solid solutions to the W part. Simulation also reveals that the interface has an important effect to significantly reduce the tensile strength and critical strain of W along the tensile loading parallel to the interface, which is intrinsically due to the slip of the edge or screw dislocations at low strains as a result of the lattice mismatch.",3
Highly in-plane anisotropic 2D semiconductors beta-AuSe with multiple superior properties: a first-principles investigation.,"Discovering highly in-plane anisotropic two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors with multiple superior properties (good stability, widely tunable bandgap and high mobility) are of great interest for fundamental studies and for developments of novel (opto)electronic devices. By means of state-of-the-art first-principles calculations, herein we present a thorough investigation on the stability, electronic properties and promising applications of previously unexplored 2D semiconductors-gold-selenium (beta-AuSe) with strong in-plane anisotropy, whose layered bulk counterpart was synthesized fifty years ago. We show that they have stable structures, widely tunable bandgap varying from 1.66 eV in monolayer to 0.70 eV in five-layer, strong light absorption coefficient (~10(5) cm(-1)) within the whole visible light range, and high/ultrahigh carrier mobility (10(3)-10(5) cm(2) V (-1) s (-1)). More importantly, they show highly in-pane anisotropic behaviors in absorption coefficients, photoconductance and carrier mobility. Especially, the anisotropic ratio of carrier mobility is much higher than the literature reported ones. The above findings show that the in-plane anisotropic 2D beta-AuSe are promising candidates for developing polarization-sensitive photodetectors, synaptic devices and micro digital inverters based on multiple superior properties and highly anisotropic behaviors. Besides, few-layer beta-AuSe systems can serve as channel materials in field-effect transistors with high mobility or be applied in solar cells with strong light absorption. Our findings demonstrate that few-layer 2D beta-AuSe have great potential for multifunctional applications and thus stimulate immediately experimental interests.",3
Sliding Luttinger liquid with alternating interwire couplings.,"We study a phase diagram for the sliding Luttinger liquid (SLL) of coupled one-dimensional quantum wires packed in a two-dimensional array in the absence of a magnetic field. We analyse whether the nearest-neighbour inter-wire interactions, stabilise the SLL phase. We construct an analogue of a Su-Schriefer-Heeger (SSH) model (allowing alternating couplings between wires). Calculating the scaling dimensions of the two most relevant perturbations, charge-density wave, and superconducting inter-wire couplings, but excluding the inter-wire single-particle hybridisation, we find a finite stability region for the SLL. It emerges due to the inter-wire forward scattering interaction, and remains stable up to a significant asymmetry between alternating couplings.",3
Exploring the write-in process in molecular quantum cellular automata: a combined modelingand first-principle approach.,"The molecular quantum cellular automata paradigm (m-QCA) offers a promising alternative framework to current CMOS implementations. A crucial aspect for implementing this technology concerns the construction of a device which effectively controls intramolecular charge-transfer processes. Tentative experimental implementations have been developed in which a voltage drop is created generating the forces that drive a molecule into a logic state. However, important factors such as the electric field profile, its possible time-dependency and the influence of temperature in the overall success of charge-transfer are relevant issues to be considered in the design of a reliable device. In this work, we theoretically study the role played by these processes in the overall intramolecular charge-transfer process. We have used a Landau-Zener (LZ) model, where different time-dependent electric field profiles have been simulated. The results have been further corroborated employing density functional tight-binding method. The role played by the nuclear motions in the electron-transfer process has been investigated beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation by computing the effect of the external electric field in the behavior of the potential energy surface. Hence, we demonstrate that the intramolecular charge-transfer process is a direct consequence of the coherent LZ nonadiabatic tunneling and the hybridization of the diabatic vibronic states which effectively reduces the trapping of the itinerant electron at the donor group.",3
Enhanced sensitivity of MoSe2 monolayer for gas adsorption induced by electric field.,"According to recent studies, gas sensors based on MoSe2 have better detection performance than graphene-based sensors, especially for N-based gas molecules, but the reason for that is not fully understood at the microscopic level. Here, we investigate the adsorption of CO, CO2, NH3, NO and NO2 gas molecules on MoSe2 monolayer by the density functional theory calculations. Our results reveal that indeed MoSe2 monolayer is more sensitive to adsorption of N-containing gas molecules than C-containing, which can be attributed to the distinct charge transfer between the gas molecules and MoSe2. The conductance was further calculated using the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism. The reduced conductance was found for NH3 and NO2 adsorbed MoSe2, consistent with the high sensitivity of MoSe2 for NH3 and NO2 molecules in the recent experiments. In addition, the adsorption sensitivity can significantly be improved by an external electric field, which implies the controllable gas detection by MoSe2. The magnetic moments of adsorbed NO and NO2 molecules can also be effectively modulated by the field-sensitive charge transfer. Our results not only give microscopic explanations to the recent experiments, but also suggest using MoSe2 as a promising material for controlled gas sensing.",3
The effect of disordered substrate on crystallization in 2D.,"In this work, the effect of amorphous substrate on crystallization is addressed. By performing Monte-Carlo simulations of solid on solid models, we explore the effect of the disorder on crystal growth. The disorder is introduced via local geometry of the lattice, where local connectivity and transition rates are varied from site to site. A comparison to an ordered lattice is accomplished and for both, ordered and disordered substrates, an optimal growth temperature is observed. Moreover, we find that under specific conditions the disordered substrate may have a beneficial effect on crystal growth, i.e. better crystallization as a direct consequence of the presence of disorder.",3
Investigation of room temperature ferromagnetism in transition metal doped BiFeO3.,"Spintronic functionality in ferromagnetic materials is a next-generation technique, to be used in data storage, high-frequency communications, and logic devices with minimum energy consumption. Ultra-low energy consumption in high-speed logic devices can be envisioned by inducing ferromagnetic behavior into room temperature multiferroic materials. However, there is a scarcity of room temperature multiferroic materials which have a definite spin degree of freedom. To fully exploit these technological challenges, we introduce the induced ferromagnetism in bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3, BFO) by doping transition metal (Cr, Ni, Co) elements. Our investigation initiates with the experimental study on chemically synthesized BiFe(1-x)M x O3 samples where x = 0.0625 (6.25%) and M = Cr, Ni and Co. Experimental findings are verified by theoretical simulation using density functional theory (DFT + U) and gauge including projector augmented wave (GIPAW) based calculation. All the experimental studies are done at room temperature while the theoretical verification using DFT is carried to understand the underlying mechanism behind the magnetic behavior of doped BiFeO3. It is done by optimizing the structural parameters comparable to the room temperature values. Microstructural and magnetic properties are studied using x-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). All these experimental studies confirm the structural changes and induced ferromagnetism with doping. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) verified the reason behind this ferromagnetic property on the basis of oxygen vacancy content. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy shows the tuning of Deltag values due to enhanced magnetization. The density of states (DOS) calculations were performed on BFO (band-gap 1.89 eV) after structural optimization using DFT + U method, confirm our experimental findings. Magnetic moment values change drastically with doping elements (M), i.e. almost negligible for BFO (antiferromagnetic) to maximum (2.85 mu B/f.u.) for Ni-doped sample. We also compute the EPR g-tensor using GIPAW method to confirm the tuning of Deltag values due to enhanced magnetization. These results can highlight the impact and importance of suitable transition element doping to induce the room temperature ferromagnetism in BiFeO3.",3
Topological crystalline superconductors in two dimensions.,"We propose a general framework to classify the topological edge modes in two dimensional topological crystalline superconductors with time-reversal symmetry, which are protected by different crystalline symmetries. The realization of topological crystalline phases is investigated in the superconductors and a criterion for distinguishing topological phases in crystalline superconductor both with mirror and mirror-inversion symmetry is founded. In these topological phases, Majorana edge modes can be identified along the mirror invariant line, while topological edge modes in the AIII class exist along the mirror-inversion invariant line. Furthermore, for the time-reversal invariant superconductor when only the mirror-inversion symmetry is preserving, topological edge modes in the AIII class with nearly flat band emerge in the mirror-inversion parity subspace.",3
Interstitial clustering in metallic systems as a source for the formation of the icosahedral matrix and defects in the glassy state.,"The paper presents molecular dynamics and -statics simulations of a prototypical mono-atomic metallic system (aluminum) and its defects in the crystalline and glassy states. It is shown that there is a thermodynamic driving force for the association of dumbbell interstitials in the crystalline lattice into clusters consisting of different amounts of defects. Clusters containing seven interstitials constitute perfect icosahedra. Within the general framework of the interstitialcy theory, melting of simple metallic crystals is intrinsically related to a rapid increase of the concentration of dumbbell interstitials, which remain identifiable structural units in the liquid state. Then, the glass produced by rapid melt quenching contains interstitial-type defects. The idea of the present work is to argue that the major structural feature of many metallic glasses-icosahedral ordering-originates from the clustering of interstitial-type defects frozen-in upon melt quenching. Separate defects and their small clusters represent the defect part of the glassy structure.",3
Oxygen and potassium vacancies in KTP calculated from first principles.,"The atomic geometry and energetics of oxygen and potassium vacancies in potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) as well as their electronic and optical properties are studied within density-functional theory in dependence of their charge state. Oxygen vacancies formed between Ti and P are characterized by a negative-U behavior. Their neutral charge state is favored for Fermi levels near the conduction band and gives rise to a defect level in the band gap, which leads to an additional optical absorption peak. In contrast, the two-fold positive charge state, stable for low and intermediate values of the Fermi level, modifies the KTP optical response only slightly. Oxygen vacancies formed between two Ti atoms are two-fold positively charged, while potassium vacancies are negatively charged irrespective of the Fermi level position. In both these cases, the KTP optical response is essentially not affected.",3
Tight-binding calculations of SiGe alloy nanocrystals in SiO2 matrix.,In the empirical tight-binding approach we study the electronic states in spherical SiGe nanocrystals embedded in SiO2 matrix. For the SiGe alloy and the matrix we use the virtual crystal approximation. The energy and valley structure of electron states is obtained as a function of Ge composition and nanocrystal size. Calculations show that the mixing of hot electrons in the nanocrystal with the electrons in wide band gap matrix is possible and this mixing strongly depends on the Ge composition in the nanocrystal.,3
"Predictions of the structures and properties of the substituted layered ternary compound series (Zr1-x T x )3Al3C5 (T = Hf, Nb, and V) through first-principles studies.","The (Zr1-x T x )3Al3C5 (T = Hf, Nb, and V) series can be potential candidates to extend the domain of MAX phases. In this work, the structures and properties of (Zr1-x T x )3Al3C5 (T = Hf, Nb, and V) are studied using first-principles calculations. The obtained structural parameters are in good accordance with previously reported data in the literature. Based on the phase stability investigations, the potentially stable layered (Zr1-x T x )3Al3C5 (T = Hf, Nb, and V) solid solutions are proposed, which confirms that Zr3Al3C5 and Hf3Al3C5 can be synthesized. The substitution, especially with group VB transitional metals, endows layered (Zr1-x T x )3Al3C5 series with greatly enhanced mechanical and thermal properties. It is indicated that the bulk modulus B of all the three systems increase with increasing substitution concentration x. A significant increase in the ratio of bulk modulus to shear modulus, B/G, is found with increasing V concentration, which corresponds to the improved ductility. Moreover, solid solutions with V substitution, (Zr1-x V x )3Al3C5, yield a larger effect on thermal conductivity with respect to x, indicating flexible modulation of the thermal conductivity of (Zr1-x V x )3Al3C5 by V substitution can be achieved, which may promote them as promising coating materials. The intrinsic mechanism involved in the enhancements of the mechanical and thermal properties were elucidated through thorough electronic band structure analysis. The difference in the electronic structure and bonding between Zr and T in (Zr1-x T x )3Al3C5 compounds are shown to account for the abnormal variations in their properties.",3
Topological phase transition induced by magnetic proximity effect in two dimensions.,"We study the magnetic proximity effect on a two-dimensional topological insulator in a CrI3/SnI3/CrI3 trilayer structure. From first-principles calculations, the BiI3-type SnI3 monolayer without spin-orbit coupling has Dirac cones at the corners of the hexagonal Brillouin zone. With spin-orbit coupling turned on, it becomes a topological insulator, as revealed by a non-vanishing Z 2 invariant and an effective model from symmetry considerations. Without spin-orbit coupling, the Dirac points are protected if the CrI3 layers are stacked ferromagnetically, and are gapped if the CrI3 layers are stacked antiferromagnetically, which can be explained by the irreducible representations of the magnetic space groups [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], corresponding to ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic stacking, respectively. By analyzing the effective model including the perturbations, we find that the competition between the magnetic proximity effect and spin-orbit coupling leads to a topological phase transition between a trivial insulator and a topological insulator.",3
Tuning spin filtering by anchoring groups in benzene derivative molecular junctions.,"One of the important issues of molecular spintronics is the control and manipulation of charge transport and, in particular, its spin polarization through single-molecule junctions. Using ab initio calculations, we explore spin-polarized electron transport across single benzene derivatives attached with six different anchoring groups (S, CH3S, COOH, CNH2NH, NC and NO2) to Ni(1 1 1) electrodes. We find that molecule-electrode coupling, conductance and spin polarization (SP) of electric current can be modified significantly by anchoring groups. In particular, a high spin polarization (SP > 80%) and a giant magnetoresistance (MR > 140%) can be achieved for NO2 terminations and, more interestingly, SP can be further enhanced (up to 90%) by a small voltage. The S and CH3S systems, on the contrary, exhibit rather low SP while intermediate values are found for COOH and CNH2NH groups. The results are analyzed in detail and explained by orbital symmetry arguments, hybridization and spatial localization of frontier molecular orbitals. We hope that our comparative and systematic studies will provide valuable quantitative information for future experimental measurements on that kind of systems and will be useful for designing high-performance spintronics devices.",3
"Systematic investigations of the electron, phonon and elastic properties of monolayer M2C (M = V, Nb, Ta) by first-principles calculations.","Based on first-principles calculations and theoretical analysis, we investigated various properties of pristine monolayer M2C (M = V, Nb, Ta). Firstly, we optimized the structures of monolayer M2C and computed the corresponding electronic band structures, the results show that they are metallic. And there exists Dirac points in the band structure, which make them may being potential candidates for investigating Dirac-physics-based applications. Secondly, we analyzed the phonon spectra combining with the corresponding projected phonon density of states of monolayer M2C. The results indicate that the three monolayers M2C are dynamically stable. The large energy gap between the optical phonon ZO and ZO' mode gets wider with the mass of translation metal increasing. Thirdly, the related thermodynamic properties, such as the Raman (E g, A 1g), infrared active (E u, A 2u) mode, Debye temperature, sound speed, temperature-dependent heat capacity, entropy, free energy and lattice thermal conductivity were also investigated. Finally, the planar elastic stiffness coefficients and other derived elastic properties of monolayer M2C were determined. We find that the Y s value of Nb2C and Ta2C is larger than that of monolayer Ti2C (130 N m(-1)). By using the uniaxial tensile, we obtained the stress-strain properties of monolayer M2C. The monolayer Ta2C has the strongest peak strength in the direction of armchair. Its maximum stress is 83GP at epsilon arm = 0.19. Thus, those MXene materials can be considered as extremely stiff 2D materials.",3
Evidence of Slater-type mechanism as origin of insulating state in Sr2IrO4.,"For iridates with large spatially extended 5d orbitals, it may be anticipated that distant neighbor interactions would play a crucial role in their ground state properties. From this perspective, we investigate the magnetic structure of Sr2IrO4 by including interactions beyond first and second neighbors, via supercell modeling. Adopting to first-principles scalar relativistic methods, it is found that the minimum in total energy among various magnetic structures correspond to a [Formula: see text] type antiferromagnetic ordering of the Ir ions for which the magnitude of the electronic gap, that of the Ir local moments and, the facsimile of the two-peaked structure in the optical conductivity spectra of Sr2IrO4 were found to be in good agreement with the experiments. The results unequivocally show that the origin of the electronic gap in Sr2IrO4 is due to an unconventional antiferromagnetic ordering of Ir ions, thereby classifying the system as a Slater magnet, rather than the spin-orbit coupling driven [Formula: see text] Mott insulator.",3
Low-frequency phonon dynamics and related thermal properties of axially stressed single-walled carbon nanotubes.,"Synthesis temperatures of composite materials are usually far less than the ones of their use, thus carbon nanotubes (CNTs) embedded into a polymer matrix undergo significant axial stress. We develop a continuous theory, which describes the dynamics of stressed single-walled (SW-) CNTs and predicts their low-frequency phonon spectra. The changes in dispersion laws of SWCNT low-frequency phonon modes due to the axial stress of different signs are discussed. Then, the results obtained are used to analyze low-temperature (T < 70 K) heat capacity and thermal conductivity of individual nanotubes. We demonstrate that compressive stress leads to increase in heat capacity C V of an individual SWCNT, while tensile stress causes C V to decrease. In the latter case at T --> 0 heat capacity diminishes according to a linear law ~T instead of a power one ~T (1/2). Nevertheless, according to our results, axial stress hardly affects low-temperature thermal conductance of SWCNTs. Influence of investigated effects on the corresponding macroscopic properties of CNT-based composite materials are also discussed.",3
Iron self diffusion in liquid pure iron and iron-carbon alloys.,"With incoherent quasielastic neutron scattering self-diffusion coefficients [Formula: see text] in pure iron, and iron-carbon alloys containing 8.7 at% and 16.9 at% carbon have been measured. At the melting point [Formula: see text] in liquid iron is [Formula: see text] m(2) s(-1). For the close-to-eutectic Fe83.1C16.9 composition [Formula: see text] m(2) s(-1) at T[Formula: see text] K. Contradicting conclusions drawn from literature values of tracer diffusion experiments the addition of carbon has only a minor effect on the iron mobility: at a given temperature the self-diffusion coefficient in Fe83.1C16.9 is only 10% larger than in liquid iron, although mixing has a drastic effect on liquidus temperature and phase behavior.",3
Heisenberg-Kitaev physics in magnetic fields.,"Magnetic insulators in the regime of strong spin-orbit coupling exhibit intriguing behaviors in external magnetic fields, reflecting the frustrated nature of their effective interactions. We review the recent advances in understanding the field responses of materials that are described by models with strongly bond-dependent spin exchange interactions, such as Kitaev's celebrated honeycomb model and its extensions. We discuss the field-induced phases and the complex magnetization processes found in these theories and compare with experimental results in the layered Mott insulators [Formula: see text]-RuCl3 and Na2IrO3, which are believed to realize this fascinating physics.",3
"Structural, magnetic, grain and grain boundary mediated conduction features of low dimensional LaFeO3 nanoparticles.","A detailed investigation of crystal structure, magnetic and electrical conduction properties of a low dimensional LaFeO3 is reported. The sample is synthesized by Sol-Gel method with a low preparation temperature. Synchrotron x-ray diffraction, Raman and FTIR spectroscopy methods were used to establish the structural phase and vibrational modes present in the sample. The low dimensionality and morphology of the prepared sample is probed through transmission electron microscopy. From the explicitly field and temperature dependent magnetization, the magnetic phase exhibited by the nanoparticle is weak ferromagnetic which is further evidencing from the Fe(57) Mossbauer spectroscopy. To gain further understanding of electrical conduction mechanism and related features of AC conductivity, impedance spectroscopy techniques are used. It is noticed that, the grain effect is dominated while the electrode effect is suppressed with temperature. The activation energies due to grain and grain boundary effect are found to be 0.0780 eV, 0.175 eV for T < 90 degrees C and 0.451 eV, 0.525 eV for T > 90 degrees C respectively. Finally, jump relaxation model and Jonscher's power law are used to explain the frequency-dependent conduction behavior in the system.",3
Octahedral tilting and emergence of ferrimagnetism in cobalt-ruthenium based double perovskites.,"Rare earth based cobalt-ruthenium double perovskites A2CoRuO6 (A = La, Pr, Nd and Sm) were synthesized and investigated for their structural and magnetic properties. All the compounds crystallize in the monoclinic P21/n structure with the indication of antisite disorder between Co and Ru sites. While La compound is already reported to have an antiferromagnetic state below 27 K, the Pr, Nd and Sm systems are found to be ferrimagnetic below [Formula: see text], 55 and 78 K respectively. Field-dependent magnetization data indicate prominent hysteresis loop below [Formula: see text] in the samples containing magnetic rare-earth ions, however, magnetization does not saturate even at the highest applied fields. Our structural analysis indicates strong distortion in the Co-O-Ru bond angle, as La(3+) is replaced by smaller rare-earth ions such as Pr(3+) , Nd(3+) , and Sm(3+) . The observed ferrimagnetism is possibly associated with the enhanced antiferromagnetic superexchange interaction in the Co-O-Ru pathway due to bond bending. The Pr, Nd and Sm samples also show the small magnetocaloric effect with the Nd sample showing the highest value of magnitude approximately 3 J kg(-1)K(-1) at 50 kOe. The change in entropy below 20 K is found to be positive in the Sm sample as compared to the negative value in the Nd counterpart.",3
Poisson-Boltzmann equation with a random field for charged fluids.,"The classical Poisson-Boltzmann equation (CPBE), which is a mean field theory by averaging the ion fluctuation, has been widely used to study ion distributions in charged fluids. In this study, we derive a modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation with a random field from the field theory and recover the ion fluctuation through a multiplicative noise added in the CPBE. The Poisson-Boltzmann equation with a random field (RFPBE) captures the effect of the ion fluctuation and gives different ion distributions in the charged fluids compared to the CPBE. To solve the RFPBE, we propose a Monte Carlo method based on the path integral representation. Numerical results show that the effect of the ion fluctuation strengthens the ion diffusion into the domain and intends to distribute the ions in the fluid uniformly. The final ion distribution in the fluid is determined by the competition between the ion fluctuation and the electrostatic forces exerted by the boundaries. The RFPBE is general and feasible for high dimensional systems by taking the advantage of the Monte Carlo method. We use the RFPBE to study a two dimensional system as an example, in which the effect of ion fluctuation is clearly captured.",3
"A comparative study of the thermoelectric performance of graphene-like BX (X = P, As, Sb) monolayers.","The electronic and phonon transport properties of graphene-like boron phosphide (BP), boron arsenide (BAs), and boron antimonide (BSb) monolayers are investigated using first-principles calculations combined with the Boltzmann theory. By considering both the phonon-phonon and electron-phonon scatterings, we demonstrate that the strong bond anharmonicity in the BAs and BSb monolayers can dramatically suppress the phonon relaxation time but hardly affect that of electron. As a consequence, both systems exhibit comparable power factors with that of the BP monolayer but much lower lattice thermal conductivities. Accordingly, a maximum ZT value above 3.0 can be realized in both BAs and BSb monolayers at optimized carrier concentration. Interestingly, very similar p - and n-type thermoelectric performance is observed in the BSb monolayer along the zigzag direction, which is of vital importance in the fabrication of thermoelectric modules with comparable efficiencies.",3
Thermal gradient driven domain wall dynamics.,"The issue of whether a thermal gradient acts like a magnetic field or an electric current in the domain wall (DW) dynamics is investigated. Broadly speaking, magnetization control knobs can be classified as energy-driving or angular-momentum driving forces. DW propagation driven by a static magnetic field is the best known example of the former in which the DW speed is proportional to the energy dissipation rate, and the current-driven DW motion is an example of the latter. Here we show that DW propagation speed driven by a thermal gradient can be fully explained as the angular momentum transfer between thermally generated spin current and DW. We found DW-plane rotation speed increases as DW width decreases. Both DW propagation speed along the wire and DW-plane rotation speed around the wire decrease with the Gilbert damping. These facts are consistent with the angular momentum transfer mechanism, but are distinct from the energy dissipation mechanism. We further show that magnonic spin-transfer torque (STT) generated by a thermal gradient has both damping-like and field-like components. By analyzing DW propagation speed and DW-plane rotational speed, the coefficient ([Formula: see text]) of the field-like STT arising from the non-adiabatic process, is obtained. It is found that [Formula: see text] does not depend on the thermal gradient; increases with uniaxial anisotropy [Formula: see text] (thinner DW); and decreases with the damping, in agreement with the physical picture that a larger damping or a thicker DW leads to a better alignment between the spin-current polarization and the local magnetization, or a better adiabaticity.",3
Epitaxial growth of magnetostrictive TbFe2 films on piezoelectric LiNbO3.,"The TbFe2 compound has been deposited by molecular beam epitaxy on lithium niobate (LN) substrates with different orientations (LN Z-, 128 Y- and 41 Y-cuts). Despite the challenging growth on these unconventional substrates, crystalline TbFe2 films (as a single orientated domain or with a limited number of orientations) of reasonable structural quality could be obtained after the deposition of a Mo buffer layer. Detailed and combined RHEED and x-ray analysis permitted to unravel the complex Mo and TbFe2 crystal orientations and to reveal common 3D orientation relationships between the different lattices, whatever the initial LN cut. The magnetic properties and especially the magnetic anisotropy have been investigated in taking magnetocrystalline, magnetoelastic and magnetostatic contributions into account. These promising results on the epitaxial growth of hybrid piezoelectric/magnetostrictive crystalline system constitute an important step towards the control of magnetization via electrically generated static and/or dynamic strains, and towards the development of magnetic sensors based on surface acoustic wave devices.",3
Local atomic arrangement in LaCuAl3 and LaAuAl3 by NMR and density functional theory.,"CeCuAl3 and CeAuAl3, crystallizing in the non-centrosymmetric BaNiSn3 tetragonal structure, are known mainly for their unusual neutron scattering spectra involving additional excitations ascribed to vibron quasi-bound quantum state in CeCuAl3 and anti-crossing of phonon and crystal field excitations in CeAuAl3. In this work, we present results of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments on their lanthanum analogues-[Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]. The character of NMR spectra of [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and (65)Cu measured in [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] is dominated by electric quadrupole interaction. The spectral parameters acquired from experimental data are confronted with values obtained from the electronic structure calculations. The results show remarkable differences for the two compounds. The [Formula: see text] spectrum in [Formula: see text] can be interpreted by a single spectral component corresponding to uniform environment of La atoms in the crystal structure, whereas for [Formula: see text] the spectrum decomposition yields a wide distribution of spectral parameters, which is not possible to explain by a single La environment, and multiple non-equivalent La positions in the crystal structure are required to interpret the spectrum.",3
"Isovalent substitution effects on thermoelectric transport properties of CoSbX (X = S, Se, Te) system.","We demonstrate a transition of the thermoelectric transport characteristics in the CoSbX (X = S, Se or Te) systems from a p -type semiconductor to metallic conductor with increasing size of the X constituent. From DFT calculations CoSbS is found as an indirect semiconductor with band-gap of 0.38 eV, while both CoSbSe and CoSbTe appear as metals. For the two metals, the calculations reveal two degenerate electron pockets (located near the U point for CoSbSe and near the T point for CoSbTe) and a hole pocket along the X-Gamma-Y points. In line with the theoretical predictions, electrical transport measurements reveal semiconducting-type temperature dependence of resistivity and positive room-temperature Seebeck coefficient (+570 microV K(-1)) for CoSbS, and metallic-type temperature dependence for CoSbSe and CoSbTe with negative Seebeck coefficient (-14 and -7.5 microV K(-1)). The Hall coefficient is positive for CoSbS(Se) and negative for CoSbTe. Room-temperature charge carrier densities were estimated at 3 x 10(18)/~10(21)/~10(22) cm(-3) for CoSbS/CoSbSe/CoSbTe. Thermal conductivity is dominated by lattice rather than electronic contribution, the RT value being of the roughly same magnitude for all the three compounds. The temperature dependence of thermal conductivity bear resemblance to a typical semiconductor in the case of CoSbS and to a metallic alloy for CoSbSe and CoSbTe.",3
Drag thermopower in nanowires and bulk potassium crystals under the conditions of competition between the boundary and bulk mechanisms of phonon relaxation.,"At low temperatures, the influence of anisotropy of elastic energy on the electron-phonon drag and thermopower in square cross-section single crystals of potassium has been studied. Change in the role of quasi-longitudinal and quasi-transverse phonons in the anisotropy of the drag thermopower under the conditions of transition from nanowires to bulk single crystals has been analyzed. In the regime of the Knudsen phonon gas flow, slow quasi-transverse phonons are shown to predominantly contribute to the drag thermopower in the nanowires but only in the directions close to the focusing of longitudinal phonons. Change in the drag thermopower anisotropy under the conditions of competition between the boundary and bulk phonon relaxation mechanisms has been investigated. As the sample's cross-section increases, the drag thermopower anisotropy varies non-monotonically. This occurs due to stronger scattering of longitudinal phonons by electrons. When transitioning from the Knudsen phonon gas flow regime to the bulk relaxation mechanisms, the drag thermopower anisotropy first rises, then reaches a maximum and afterward disappears. The contribution of quasi-transverse phonons in bulk potassium crystals exceeds that of longitudinal phonons by an order of magnitude. This result evidences that the model of an isotropic medium cannot properly describe the electron-phonon drag in metals.",3
Skyrmions and Hall transport.,"We review recent progresses towards an understanding of the skyrmion Hall transport in insulating as well as conducting materials. First, we consider a theoretical breakthrough based on the quantum field theory ward identity, a first principle analysis, relying on symmetries and conservation laws. Broken parity (inversion) symmetry plays a crucial role in skyrmion Hall transport. In addition to the well known thermal and electric Hall conductivities, our analysis has led us to the discovery of a new and unforeseen physical quantity, Hall viscosity-an anti-symmetric part of the viscosity tensor. We propose a simple way to confirm the existence of Hall viscosity in the measurements of Hall conductivity as a function of momentum. We provide various background materials to assist the readers to understand the quantum field theory ward identity. In the second part, we review recent theoretical and experimental advancements of the skyrmion Hall effects and the topological (magnon) Hall effects for conducting (insulting) magnets. For this purpose, we consider two enveloping themes: spin torque and thermo-electromagnetic effect. First, we overview various spin torques, such as spin transfer torque, spin-orbit torque, and spin Hall torque, and generalized Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equations and Thiele equations using a phenomenological approach. Second, we consider irreversible thermodynamics to survey possible thermo-electromagnetic effects, such as Seebeck, Peltier and Thompson effects in the presence of the electric currents, along with the Hall effects in the presence of a background magnetic field. Recently developed spin Seebeck effects are also a significant part of the survey. We also accommodate extensive background materials to make this review self-contained. Finally, we revisit the skyrmion Hall transport from the ward identity view point.",3
Electronic correlations in dense iron: from moderate pressure to Earth's core conditions.,"We discuss the role of dynamical many-electron effects in the physics of iron and iron-rich solid alloys under applied pressure on the basis of recent ab initio studies employing the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). We review in detail two particularly interesting regimes: first, a moderate pressure range up to 60 GPa and, second, the ultra-high pressure of about 360 GPa expected inside the solid inner core of Earth. Electronic correlations in iron under the moderate pressure of several tens GPa are discussed in the first section. DMFT-based methods predict an enhancement of electronic correlations at the pressure-induced body-centered cubic alpha to hexagonal close-packed [Formula: see text] phase transition. In particular, the electronic effective mass, scattering rate and electron-electron contribution to the electrical resistivity undergo a step-wise increase at the transition point. One also finds a significant many-body correction to the [Formula: see text]-Fe equation of state, thus clarifying the origin of discrepancies between previous DFT studies and experiment. An electronic topological transition is predicted to be induced in [Formula: see text]-Fe by many-electron effects; its experimental signatures are analyzed. The next section focuses on the geophysically relevant pressure-temperature regime of the Earth's inner core (EIC) corresponding to the extreme pressure of 360 GPa combined with temperatures up to 6000 K. The three iron allotropes ([Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] and face-centered-cubic [Formula: see text]) previously proposed as possible stable phases at such conditions are found to exhibit qualitatively different many-electron effects as evidenced by a strongly non-Fermi-liquid metallic state of [Formula: see text]-Fe and an almost perfect Fermi liquid in the case of [Formula: see text]-Fe. A recent active discussion on the electronic state and transport properties of [Formula: see text]-Fe at the EIC conditions is reviewed in details. Estimations for the dynamical many-electron contribution to the relative phase stability are presented. We also discuss the impact of a Ni admixture, which is expected to be present in the core matter. We conclude by outlining some limitation of the present DMFT-based framework relevant for studies of iron-base systems as well as perspective directions for further development.",3
Field-induced magnetic transitions and strong anisotropy in alpha-CoV2O6 single crystal.,"The Ising-like antiferromagnet alpha-CoV2O6 has received considerable interests because of stabilized 1/3 magnetization plateau around 5 K under magnetic field applied along magnetic easy c-axis. In this work, this magnetization plateau was studied by varying temperature or rotating magnetic field. As temperature decreased, this stabilized plateau collapsed, and additional magnetic transitions were observed. As a result, a rich magnetic phase diagram was constructed and extended to temperature lower than previously reported. When magnetic field moved from the c to b (or a) axis, the magnetization plateau developed with field directions and vanished finally when the field was restricted in the ab plane. An impressive observation is that this 1/3-plateau can be stabilized and remain robust even when magnetic field deviated from the c axis, accompanied by the evolutions of the magnetic moments and the critical transition fields. We suppose that the origins of these temperature and angular dependences of the 1/3 magnetization plateau are related to strong spin-orbital coupling. Indeed, electron spin resonance (ESR) measurement gives large Lande factor of 8.9, evidencing that there exists strong spin-orbital coupling.",3
Band-structure engineering of the magnetically Cr-doped topological insulator Sb2Te3 under mechanical strain.,"Magnetic doping in topological insulator Sb2Te3 can produce very novel physical phenomena such as quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE). However, experimental observations of QAHE in the magnetic atoms doped Sb2Te3 have encountered significant challenges due to the complexity of the electronic structure and the relatively small band gap. Generally, mechanical strain can effectively modulate the band structure, thus we theoretically investigate the electronic structures of Cr-doped Sb2Te3 under mechanical strain using first-principles calculations within density functional theory. The band gap of Cr-doped Sb2Te3 is 0.031 eV. When the compressive strain eta becomes as -2%, the band gap will be further enlarged to 0.045 eV, which is 45% larger than that of the unstrained material. However, as the compressive strain eta exceed -2%, strong hybridization between Cr and Te atoms will cause the overlap of bands, which leads to the closure of band gap. In addition, when tensile strain is applied to Cr-doped Sb2Te3, the decrease in the spacing between quintuple layers can enhance the coupling between Te and Sb atoms, which can also result in the closing of the band gap. Finally, we used HSE06 to calculated the band gaps. The band gaps may be underestimated, but HSE06 and GGA have the same band structures evolution tendency under mechanical strain. Our calculated results provide a guideline for the modulation of band structure by mechanical strain, which pave the way for the observation of QAHE in Cr-doped Sb2Te3.",3
Analyzing scanning tunneling spectroscopy for Fe-based superconductors and extracting sample density of states.,"We extract the density of states (DOS) from the scanning tunneling spectroscopy data for Ba1-x K x Fe2As2 superconductor. The obtained sample DOS is composed of two ordinary s-wave types from the band at [Formula: see text] point and a linear-like DOS within the s-wave gap from the band at M point in the Brillouin zone, and is consistent with the corresponding data from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We clarify that the major peak of the tunneling conductance is not related to the DOS but is rather the effect of nonequilibrium coherent tunneling including all coherent spins in the tip and sample.",3
A finite element method towards acoustic phononic crystals by weak formulation.,"A weak formulation method is presented to analyze the propagation of acoustic waves in periodic crystal-like systems called phononic crystals. First, a compact circle and double split ring resonators with high impedance contrast to air background are employed to compute band structures with not only real parts of wavevectors but also imaginary parts of them. Calculating the imaginary part, which directly predicts a propagation length in band gaps, is not readily available in previous studies. It analytically enables us to more understand the behavior of evanescent mode in band gaps. Moreover, we present that the weak formulation method is advantageous in calculating equi-frequency contour.",3
Breakdown of coherence in Kondo alloys: crucial role of concentration versus band filling.,"We study the low energy states of the Kondo alloy model (KAM) as function of the magnetic impurity concentration per site, x, and the conduction electron average site occupation, n c . In previous works, two different Fermi liquid regimes had been identified at strong Kondo coupling [Formula: see text], that may be separated by a transition at x = n c . Here, we analyze the KAM for finite [Formula: see text] on a Bethe lattice structure. First, using the mean-field coherent potential approximation (DMFT-CPA) which is exact at lattice coordination [Formula: see text], we show that the real part of the local potential scattering may be located outside the conduction electron band, revealing a possible breakdown of Luttinger theorem for intermediate values of impurity concentration x. Unusual physical signatures are expected, e.g. in ARPES experiments. In order to take into account fluctuations associated with finite dimensionality, i.e. finite Z, we extend this analysis by studying the KAM with an adaptation of the statistical-DMFT method that was developped elsewhere. We review the distributions of local potential scattering and their evolution with model parameters: concentration, strength of Kondo coupling, coordination number, local site neighborhood, connection with percolation issue. Relevence for Kondo alloys material with f -electrons is also discussed.",3
Critical behavior of ensembles of superparamagnetic nanoparticles with dispersions of magnetic parameters.,"Different processes governing magnetic properties of an ensemble of magnetic nanoparticles in the temperature region close to a transition from superparamagnetic to paramagnetic state are analyzed and the ways to separate them are suggested. Enhanced role of paraprocess in magnetization behavior near Curie temperature is stressed. A procedure to isolate paraprocess contribution and adequately determine spontaneous magnetization of the ensemble of superparamagnetic nanoparticles is proposed. Critical behavior of the spontaneous magnetization is experimentally determined for the ensemble of nanoparticles of lanthanum-strontium manganites, which are considered as promising materials for self-controlled magnetic nanohyperthermia. Effect of dispersion of magnetic parameters on effective magnetic characteristics of nanoparticles and their critical behavior is discussed. Theoretical background for the use of the 'effective Curie temperature for the ensemble of nanoparticles' concept is proposed for ensembles of particles with dispersion of their Curie temperature. Based on the results obtained, various strategies to develop novel biomedical applications, in particular those suitable for noninvasive temperature monitoring, are discussed.",3
Photoluminescence and structural properties of the nitrogen doped TiO2 and the influence of SiO2 and Ag nanoparticles.,"Mixtures of nitrogen-doped titanium dioxide (TiO2:N) with different concentrations of Ag and/or SiO2 particles (0.5, 1 and 2 wt.%) were prepared in solid state by mechanico-chemical interactions. Using UV-VIS spectroscopy, Raman scattering, photoluminescence (PL) and photoluminescence excitation (PLE), the influence of the particles on the host material is evaluated. UV-VIS spectroscopy studies indicate a TiO2:N band gap shift to the UV range with increasing concentrations of SiO2 and Ag particles. PL intensities decrease with increasing concentrations of Ag and/or SiO2 particles in the TiO2:N host matrix, which in turn could effectively restrict the electron and hole recombination. To explain these processes, the different de-excitation ways will be advanced, taking into account the energy levels diagram of TiO2:N/Ag, TiO2:N/SiO2 and TiO2:N/Ag/SiO2 systems. PLE spectra show a gradual decrease in their relative intensities after 165 min of continuous irradiation due to photosensitivity of TiO2:N. The plasmonic effect of Ag particles in the TiO2:N/Ag system is highlighted for the first time by PLE studies.",3
Yb-doping effect on structure and lattice dynamics of Gd2O3.,We report the results of a study that examines the effects of trivalent Yb impurities occupying different sites in cubic Gd2O3 on the latter's structure and vibrational spectrum. The shell model is employed to compute relaxed structures and phonon symmetrized local densities of states. The lattice structure and dynamics of Yb-doped Gd2O3 are calculated using a cluster approach. The frequencies of localized vibrations caused by Yb ions are also determined. The results of lattice-dynamical calculations are compared with experimental data in literature.,3
Development of cubic anvil type high pressure apparatus for neutron diffraction.,"High-pressure neutron diffraction (HPND) experiments in extended pressure and temperature ranges can provide invaluable information for understanding many pressure-induced emergent phenomena, such as unusual phase transitions and quantum critical behavior involving spin, orbital, charge and structural degrees of freedom, in strongly correlated materials. Many apparatuses for different purposes of HPND experiments have been developed in several laboratories. Recently, a clamp-type cubic anvil high pressure cell that can generate pressure over 7 GPa at 3 K was developed for low-temperature HPND measurements. In this paper, characteristics of the clamp-type cubic anvil high pressure cell are presented and its performances are demonstrated by measuring magnetic neutron scattering under pressure on MnP single crystal samples.",3
Emergence of three-dimensional order and structure in growing biofilms.,"Surface-attached bacterial biofilms are self-replicating active liquid crystals and the dominant form of bacterial life on earth (1-4). In conventional liquid crystals and solid-state materials, the interaction potentials between the molecules that comprise the system determine the material properties. However, for growth-active biofilms it is unclear whether potential-based descriptions can account for the experimentally observed morphologies, and which potentials would be relevant. Here, we overcame previous limitations of single-cell imaging techniques (5,6) to reconstruct and track all individual cells inside growing three-dimensional (3D) biofilms with up to 10,000 individuals. Based on these data, we identify, constrain, and provide a microscopic basis for an effective cell-cell interaction potential, which captures and predicts the growth dynamics, emergent architecture, and local liquid crystalline order of Vibrio cholerae biofilms. Furthermore, we show how external fluid flows control the microscopic structure and 3D morphology of biofilms. Our analysis implies that local cellular order and global biofilm architecture in these active bacterial communities can arise from mechanical cell-cell interactions, which cells can modulate by regulating the production of particular matrix components. These results establish an experimentally validated foundation for improved continuum theories of active matter and thereby contribute to solving the important problem of controlling biofilm growth.",3
Pressure dependence of the structure of liquid NiTi: a molecular dynamics study.,"We evaluate the structure of liquid NiTi under various pressures from 0 GPa to 40 GPa in the atomic level using molecular dynamics simulations. The structure factor and radial distribution function are used to investigate the general structural change of the system. Further identification of the local structures is examined by the bond-angle method and bond-angle distribution analysis. From our results, we found that the count of the local structure of fcc, hcp, bcc, and icosahedral short-range order monotonically increase when the pressures increase. We also observed in our results that the size of the local cluster grows as the pressure increases, and the long-range connectivity of the quasi-crystal is achieved at high pressure.",3
Possible cluster pairing correlation in the checkerboard Hubbard model: a quantum Monte Carlo study.,Constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo method is applied to study the pairing correlation in the checkerboard Hubbard model with inhomogeneous nearest-neighbor hopping at a low doping of holes. The inhomogeneous hopping can enhance the pairing correlation among different plaquette clusters. An obvious maximum for the pairing correlation is observed at a certain inhomogeneous hopping. The cluster pairing correlation shows the strongest long-range behavior at the optimal inhomogeneity. The enhancement of cluster pairing correlation might be associated with the transition of the Fermi surface structure. This work indicates that the inhomogeneous hopping could tailor the pairing correlation effectively.,3
First universality of conductivity spectra in superprotonic (NH4)3H(SO4)2 single crystal.,"We present the frequency study of electric conductivity in the superprotonic single crystal in a wide temperature range covering the superprotonic phase I and the low conducting, ferroelastic phase II. The data below microwave frequencies are analyzed using the Summerfield scaling method to check for presence of the first universality. The scaled conductivity obtained from the raw experimental data plotted versus scaled frequency do not show the universality because it contains, in a low temperature range, steps related to relaxational dielectric contribution. The contribution, evidenced by a temperature study of frequency dependence of epsilon'', presumably comes from polar ammonia and therefore does not reflect properties of the hopping motion of mobile ions. To get rid of it, the conductivity is calculated using the impedance data obtained from the fitting procedure of the Nyquist plots. The resulting scaled ac conductivity plot forms a single curve in a wide temperature range. Thus, (NH4)3H(SO4)2 meets criteria for the first universality, despite the fact that it undergoes the structural, superionic phase transition in the temperature range studied.",3
Theory of angle-dependent marginal Fermi liquid self-energy and its existence at all dopings in cuprates.,"Various angle-dependent measurements in hole-doped cuprates suggested that non-Fermi liquid (NFL) and Fermi-liquid (FL) self-energies coexist in the Brillouin zone. Moreover, it is also found that NFL self-energies survive up to the overdoped region where the resistivity features a global FL-behavior. To address this problem, we compute the momentum dependent self-energy from a single band Hubbard model. The self-energy is calculated self-consistently by using a momentum-dependent density-fluctuation (MRDF) method. One of our main results is that the computed self-energy exhibits a marginal-FL (MFL)-like frequency dependence only in the antinodal region, and FL-like behavior elsewhere at all dopings. The MFL self-energy stems from the fluctuations between the itinerant and localized densities-a result that appears when self-energy is calculated self-consistently and features an intermediate coupling behavior of cuprates. We also calculate the DC conductivity by including the full momentum dependent self-energy. We find that the resistivity-temperature exponent n becomes 1 near the optimal doping, while the MFL self-energy occupies largest momentum-space volume. Surprisingly, even in the NFL state near the optimal doping, the nodal region contains FL-like self-energies; while in the under- and over-dopings ([Formula: see text]), the antinodal region remains NFL-like. These results highlight the non-local correlation physics in cuprates and in other similar intermediately correlated materials, where a direct link between the microscopic single-particle spectral properties and the macroscopic transport behavior can not be well established.",3
First-principles studies of spin-orbital physics in pyrochlore oxides.,"The pyrochlore oxides [Formula: see text]O7 exhibit a complex interplay between geometrical frustration, electronic correlations, and spin-orbit coupling (SOC), due to the lattice structure and active charge, spin, and orbital degrees of freedom. Understanding the properties of these materials is a theoretical challenge, because their intricate nature depends on material-specific details and quantum many-body effects. Here we review our recent studies based on first-principles calculations and quantum many-body theories for 4d and 5d pyrochlore oxides with B = Mo, Os, and Ir. In these studies, the SOC and local electron correlations are treated within the local density approximation (LDA) + U and LDA + dynamical mean-field theory formalisms. We also discuss the technical aspects of these calculations.",3
"Weak ferromagnetism and time-stable remanence in hematite: effect of shape, size and morphology.","A number of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) driven canted antiferromagnets or weak ferromagnets (WFM) including hematite exhibit two distinct time scales in magnetization relaxation measurements, one of which is ultra-slow. This leads to the observation of a part of remanence that is time-stable in character. In this work, our endeavor is to optimize the magnitude of this time-stable remanence for the hematite, a room temperature WFM, as a function of shape size and morphology. A substantial enhancement in the magnitude of this unique remanence is observed in porous hematite, consisting of ultra-small nano particles, as compared to crystallites grown in regular morphology, such as cuboids or hexagonal plates. This time-stable remanence exhibits a peak-like pattern with magnetic field, which is significantly sharper in porous sample. Experimental data suggest that the extent and the magnitude of the spin canting associated with the WFM phase can be best gauged by the presence of this remanence and its unusual magnetic field dependence. Temperature variation of lattice parameters bring out correlations between strain effects that alter the bond length and bond angle associated with primary super exchange paths, which in-turn systematically alter the magnitude of the time-stable remanence. This study provides insights regarding a long standing problems of anomalies in the magnitude of magnetization on repeated cooling in case of hematite. Our data caps on these anomalies, which we argue, arise due to spontaneous spin canting associated with WFM phase. Our results also elucidate on why thermal cycling protocols during bulk magnetization measurements are even more crucial for hematite which exhibits both canted as well as pure antiferromgnetic phase.",3
All-optical spin switching under different spin configurations.,"All-optical spin switching represents a new frontier in femtomagnetism. However, its underlying principles are quite different from traditional thermal activated spin switching. Here, we employ an atomic spin model and present a systematic investigation from a single spin to a large system of over a million spins. We find that for a single spin without an external perturbation, the conservation of total angular momentum requires that the spin change, if any, exactly matches the orbital momentum change, but a laser pulse significantly alters this relation, where the spin change does not necessarily follow the orbital change. This is reflected in the strong dependence of switching on laser polarization. To have an efficient spin switching, the electron initial momentum direction must closely follow the spin's orientation, so the orbital angular momentum is transverse to the spin and consequently the spin-orbit torque lies in the same direction as the spin. The module of the spin-orbit torque is [Formula: see text], where [Formula: see text] is the angle between spin [Formula: see text] and position [Formula: see text] (momentum [Formula: see text]) and [Formula: see text] is the angle between [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]. These findings are manifested in a much larger system. We find that the spin response depends on underlying spin structures. A linearly polarized laser pulse creates a dip in a uniform inplane-magnetized thin film, but has little effects on Neel and Bloch walls. Both right- and left- circularly polarized light ([Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]) have stronger but different effects in both uniform spin domains and Neel walls. While [Formula: see text] light creates a basin of spins pointing down, [Formula: see text] light creates a mound of spins pointing up. In the vicinity of the structure spins are reversed, similar to the experimental observation. [Formula: see text] light has a dramatic effect, disrupting spins in Bloch walls. By contrast, [Formula: see text] light has a small effect on Bloch walls because [Formula: see text] only switches down spins up and once the spins already point up, there is no major effect. These findings are expected to have important implications in the future.",3
High intrinsic ZT in InP3 monolayer at room temperature.,"Two-dimensional thermoelectric (TE) materials which have the figure of merit ZT that is greater than 1.5 at room temperature would be highly desirable in energy conversion since the efficiency is competitive to conventional energy conversion techniques. Here, we report that the indium triphosphide (InP3) monolayer shows a large ZT of 1.92 at 300 K, based on the quantum calculations within the ballistic thermal transport region. A remarkably low and isotropic phononic thermal conductivity is found due to the flat lattice vibration modes, which takes a major responsibility for the impressively high ZT at room temperature. Moreover, a large ZT of 1.67 can still be achieved even under a 1% mechanical tension on the lattice. These results suggest that the InP3 monolayer is a promising candidate for low dimensional TE applications.",3
Poisson-Boltzmann theory with non-linear ion correlations.,"The Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) theory is widely used to depict ionic systems. As a mean-field theory, the PB theory neglects the correlation effect in the ionic atmosphere and leads to deviations from experimental results as the concentration or charge valance increases. A modified PB theory including ion correlation effect while retaining its simplicity is critical for many important applications in which ion correlation effect can be significant. In this paper, we present a new model to incorporate ion correlations into the original PB equation by utilizing the Green's function with a non-linear form of the self-energy, which is different from the linear self-energy equation obtained by the field-theoretic (FT) approach. Both equations are solved numerically and compared with our molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The co-ion distribution calculated by the FT approach deviates significantly from the MD simulation, while our results for both counter-ion and co-ion distributions are justified by the MD simulation.",3
Magnetic and transport properties of low-carrier-density Kondo semimetal CeSbTe.,"Single crystals of CeSbTe with a ZrSiS-type structure were synthesized using vapor transport method. The stoichiometry is deviated from the nominal composition, which may cause some disorder in this compound. The physical properties were characterized by measuring the magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity, Hall resistivity and specific heat. One antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition related to Ce(3+) ions was found at [Formula: see text] K, and a field-induced metamagnetic transition was observed below [Formula: see text]. The moderately enhanced Sommerfeld coefficient [Formula: see text] mJ mol(-1) . K(-2) and the estimated Kondo temperature [Formula: see text] K, indicate that CeSbTe is a moderately correlated AFM Kondo lattice compound with crystalline electric field effect. The carrier concentration of CeSbTe derived from the Hall coefficient is in the order of 10(21) cm(-3), lower than most Kondo metals, which indicates that CeSbTe is a low-carrier-density Kondo semimetal.",3
Physical properties of epitaxial SrMnO2.5-delta F gamma oxyfluoride films.,"Recently, topotactic fluorination has become an alternative way of doping epitaxial perovskite oxides through anion substitution to engineer their electronic properties instead of the more commonly used cation substitution. In this work, epitaxial oxyfluoride SrMnO2.5-delta F gamma films were synthesized via topotactic fluorination of SrMnO2.5 films using polytetrafluoroethylene as the fluorine source. Oxidized SrMnO3 films were also prepared for comparison with the fluorinated samples. The F content, probed by x-ray photoemission spectroscopy, was systematically controlled by adjusting fluorination conditions. Electronic transport measurements reveal that increased F content (up to gamma = 0.14) systematically increases the electrical resistivity, despite the nominal electron-doping induced by F substitution for O in these films. In contrast, oxidized SrMnO3 exhibits a decreased resistivity and conduction activation energy. A blue-shift of optical absorption features occurs with increasing F content. Density functional theory calculations indicate that F acts as a scattering center for electronic transport, controls the observed weak ferromagnetic behavior of the films, and reduces the inter-band optical transitions in the manganite films. These results stand in contrast to bulk electron-doped La1-x Ce x MnO3, illustrating how aliovalent anionic substitutions can yield physical behavior distinct from A-site substituted perovskites with the same nominal B-site oxidation states.",3
Density functional study of methyl butanoate adsorption and its C-O bonds cleavage on MoS2-based catalyst with various loads of Ni promoters.,"Due to the increasing demands of new and renewable energy sources by utilising plant oils, uncovering the underlying physico-chemical phenomena at the atomic level responsible for the effective deoxygenation plays a vital role in improving the performance of well-known as well as in looking for the possible new catalysts. This study aims at investigating the adsorption and C-O bonds cleavage of methyl butanoate (MB) over MoS2-based catalyst with various loads of Ni promoters by using first-principles density functional theory (DFT). This study employs surface model that never been used by previous researchers for their investigations of adsorption and bonds cleavage on Ni promoted MoS2-based catalysts. The introduction of nickel into MoS2-based catalyst allows the surface charges when interacts with MB to redistribute in such a way that induces stronger Coulombic attractive forces. This in turn could result in a more stable adsorption configuration. However only in certain Ni-loads will results in the most stable adsorption. Nevertheless the most stable adsorption of MB occurs on M-edge configuration which consists of two Ni atoms, i.e. M-2-Ni-A with adsorption energy at about -2.96 eV. As a comparison, the adsorption energy of MoS2 with the absent of Ni, i.e. M-0-Ni is just -2.79 eV. Since there are three C-O bonds in MB, this study proposes three possible reactions for these bonds to cleave. By using CI-NEB method, the activation energies of those three reaction are calculated. It shows that the presence of Ni with appropriate load could promote C-O bond cleavage, especially in one reaction C-O bond is weaken considerably. Further evaluation on bond dissociation energies of the closest C-C bond to the catalyst surface, M-2-Ni-A shows better reactivity on C-C bond cleavage than M-0-Ni, disregarding of those three reaction routes.",3
Spin-orbit-induced hole spin relaxation in a quantum dot molecule: the effect of s-p coupling.,"We study the effect of the coupling between the hole s shell of one quantum dot and the p shell in the other dot forming a vertically stacked self-assembled quantum dot molecule on the spin relaxation between the sublevels of the hole s state. Using an effective model that captures the spin-orbit effects in the p shell irrespective of their origin, we show that the strong spin mixing in the p shell can be transferred to the s shell of the other dot, leading to enhanced spin relaxation in a certain energy range around the s-p resonance if the dots are misaligned and the magnetic field is tilted from the sample plane.",3
Disordered contacts can localize helical edge electrons.,"It is well known that quantum spin Hall (QSH) edge modes being helical are immune to backscattering due to non-magnetic disorder within the sample. Thus, QSH edge modes are non-localized and show a vanishing Hall resistance along with quantized 2-terminal, longitudinal and non-local resistances even in presence of sample disorder. However, this is not the case for contact disorder. This paper shows that when all contacts are disordered in a N-terminal QSH sample, then transport via these helical QSH edge modes can have a significant localization correction. All the resistances in a N-terminal QSH sample deviate from their values derived while neglecting the phase acquired at disordered contacts, and this deviation is called the quantum localization correction. This correction term increases with the increase of disorderedness of contacts but decreases with the increase in number of contacts in a N terminal sample. The presence of inelastic scattering, however, can completely destroy the quantum localization correction.",3
Enhancement of crossed Andreev reflection in a Kitaev ladder connected to normal metal leads.,"We study nonlocal transport in a two-leg Kitaev ladder connected to two normal metals. The coupling between the two legs of the ladder when the legs are maintained at a (large) superconducting phase difference, results in the creation of subgap Andreev states. These states in turn are responsible for the enhancement of crossed Andreev reflection (CAR). We find that tuning the different parameters of the system suitably leads to enhancement of CAR signalled by transconductance acquiring the most negative value possible. Furthermore, subgap states cause oscillations of the transconductance as a function of various system parameters such as chemical potential and ladder length, which are seen to be a consequence of Fabry-Perot resonance.",3
Manifestation of charge/orbital order and charge transfer in temperature-dependent optical conductivity of single-layered Pr0.5Ca1.5MnO4.,"Half-doped single-layered manganite, [Formula: see text] has shown a charge/orbital order of the e g electrons and CE-type spin order of the t 2g electrons of the Mn ions. A previous experimental study on that system, supported by a simple modelling, has suggested that the charge/orbital ordering play an important role in governing the temperature dependence of optical conductivity of a broad peak around 0.7-0.8 eV. In addition, another peak around 3.5 eV, which is less sensitive to temperature, has been attributed to the charge transfer from O-p to Mn-e g orbitals. Nevertheless, the theoretical explanation was incomplete as the role of O-p orbitals was not considered in the model. In this paper, we propose to improve the model by incorporating both Mn-e g and O-p orbitals. We assume the existence of charge/orbital ordering and investigate how this ordering as well as the charge-transfer phenomenon control the temperature dependence of the optical conductivity. Our results reveal the charge/orbital-ordering peak in the region 0.7-1.2 eV, which is blue-shifted with decreasing temperature, and the charge-transfer peak around 3.5 eV, which is less sensitive to temperature. The capability of our model to capture the general profile and temperature dependence of the optical conductivity suggests the validity of our theory.",3
Cross-linker mediated compaction and local morphologies in a model chromosome.,"Chromatin and associated proteins constitute the highly folded structure of chromosomes. We consider a self-avoiding polymer model of the chromatin, segments of which may get cross-linked via protein binders that repel each other. The binders cluster together via the polymer mediated attraction, in turn, folding the polymer. Using molecular dynamics simulations, and a mean field description, we explicitly demonstrate the continuous nature of the folding transition, characterized by unimodal distributions of the polymer size across the transition. At the transition point the chromatin size and cross-linker clusters display large fluctuations, and a maximum in their negative cross-correlation, apart from a critical slowing down. Along the transition, we distinguish the local chain morphologies in terms of topological loops, inter-loop gaps, and zippering. The topologies are dominated by simply connected loops at the criticality, and by zippering in the folded phase.",3
Swimming Euglena respond to confinement with a behavioral change enabling effective crawling.,"Some euglenids, a family of aquatic unicellular organisms, can develop highly concerted, large amplitude peristaltic body deformations. This remarkable behavior has been known for centuries. Yet, its function remains controversial, and is even viewed as a functionless ancestral vestige. Here, by examining swimming Euglena gracilis in environments of controlled crowding and geometry, we show that this behavior is triggered by confinement. Under these conditions, it allows cells to switch from unviable flagellar swimming to a new and highly robust mode of fast crawling, which can deal with extreme geometric confinement and turn both frictional and hydraulic resistance into propulsive forces. To understand how a single cell can control such an adaptable and robust mode of locomotion, we developed a computational model of the motile apparatus of Euglena cells consisting of an active striated cell envelope. Our modeling shows that gait adaptability does not require specific mechanosensitive feedback but instead can be explained by the mechanical self-regulation of an elastic and extended motor system. Our study thus identifies a locomotory function and the operating principles of the adaptable peristaltic body deformation of Euglena cells.",3
Titanium carbide sheet: metallic 2D structure with intrinsic and high catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction.,"Searching for a metallic material that possesses intrinsic and high catalytic activity is interesting for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in the electrochemical reduction of water. In this work, via density functional theory, we identified a promising two-dimensional (2D) catalyst material, namely TiC (1 0 0) sheet, which is composed of two atomic layers. Phonon spectrum calculation shows that all vibrational modes of the TiC (1 0 0) sheet are real. Even at 1200 K, the geometrical structure of TiC (1 0 0) sheet is still well kept. Interestingly, TiC (1 0 0) sheet is metallic, which means that TiC (1 0 0) sheet can possess high conductivity. Moreover, the Gibbs free energy ([Formula: see text]) of hydrogen on TiC (1 0 0) sheet at a low coverage is about 0.13 eV, which can be further optimized to an ideal value of 0 eV by introducing a strain. Besides, the effect of thickness on its catalytic activity is also assessed. We observed that TiC (1 0 0) sheet with a large thickness is also metallic. Calculated values of [Formula: see text] for four-layered and six-layered TiC (1 0 0) sheets at a moderate coverage can be about -0.06 and -0.04 eV, respectively. Our results highlight a new promising 2D catalyst material for the HER in the electrochemical reduction of water.",3
Electron transport through NiSi2-Si contacts and their role in reconfigurable field-effect transistors.,"A model is presented which describes reconfigurable field-effect transistors (RFETs) with metal contacts, whose switching is controlled by manipulating the Schottky barriers at the contacts. The proposed modeling approach is able to bridge the gap between quantum effects on the atomic scale and the transistor switching. We apply the model to transistors with a silicon channel and NiSi2 contacts. All relevant crystal orientations are compared, focusing on the differences between electron and hole current, which can be as large as four orders of magnitude. Best symmetry is found for the [Formula: see text] orientation, which makes this orientation most advantageous for RFETs. The observed differences are analyzed in terms of the Schottky barrier height at the interface. Our study indicates that the precise orientation of the interface relative to a given transport direction, perpendicular or tilted, is an important technology parameter, which has been underestimated during the previous development of RFETs. Most of the conclusions regarding the studied metal-semiconductor interface are also valid for other device architectures.",3
Nanofocusing and deceleration of terahertz plasma waves in tapered metal-insulator-graphene heterostructure.,"Nanofocusing and deceleration of terahertz plasma waves in tapered metal-insulator-graphene heterostructure is studied theoretically. It is shown that, choosing an appropriate value of taper length for given values of the taper angle and the Fermi energy in a doped or gated graphene, the plasma wave energy density value in the vicinity of the taper apex exceeds its value in the taper inlet cross-section by tens of percent in spite of the Drude losses in graphene. The plasma wave decelerates while moving toward taper apex and its energy velocity becomes several times smaller as compared to that in the taper inlet cross-section.",3
An experimental and theoretical study of magnetocaloric effect in Nd0.5Dy0.5FeO3.,A significant magnetocaloric effect (MCE) has been revealed in our investigation on polycrystalline Nd0.5Dy0.5FeO3 below 30 K. Observed magnetization of the system at low temperature is 32% higher than the expected average magnetization of NdFeO3 and DyFeO3. Such an enhancement in the magnetization led to a large change in magnetic entropy (10.4 Jkg(-1) K(-1)) at 4 K. The observed entropy change is remarkable considering the higher natural abundance of Nd compared to that of Dy and negligible MCE seen in case of NdFeO3. Theoretical calculations performed using mean-field approximation and Monte Carlo simulations on an Ising type spin model indicate that the high magnetocaloric effect is caused primarily by the ordering of rare-earth ions in C-type antiferromagnetic state in presence of molecular exchange field created by Fe ions.,3
Pressure-induced ferromagnetism and enhanced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy of bilayer CrI3.,"Using the first principles calculations, we explored the pressure dependent magnetic properties of CrI3 bilayer for AB and AA type stacking. We found an anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) ground state in both pristine bilayer systems with indirect band gaps of 1.71 and 1.68 eV for AB and AA type system. However, the transition from AFM to ferromagnetic (FM) state was achieved with the pressure and the band gap was decreased although the indirect band gap nature remains unchanged. We obtained a substantially enhanced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy with pressure. In the pristine AFM bilayer, both Cr and iodine atoms almost equally contributed to the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. However, the contribution from the iodine atoms was almost four times larger than the Cr contribution with increasing the pressure. Particularly, the interface iodine atoms played a major role for the enhancement of the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. We found that both AB and AA type bilayer displayed the same tendency.",3
The s-d exchange model as the underlying mechanism of magnetoresistance in ZnO doped with alkali metals.,"High field magnetoresistance has been studied in epitaxial n-type ZnO:Na and ZnO:Li thin films in a temperature range between 4 K and 150 K. The resulting negative magnetoresistance can be well fitted using a semiempirical model of Khosla and Fischer based on third order contributions to the s-d exchange Hamiltonian. The parameters obtained from this model were carefully analyzed. One of these parameters is related to a ratio between electron mobilities at zero field (a non-exchange scattering mobility [Formula: see text] and an exchange or spin dependent one [Formula: see text]). From Hall effect measurements [Formula: see text] was obtained, displaying a weak temperature dependence in accordance with highly n-doped ZnO while the extracted [Formula: see text] exhibits an anomalous T-dependence. On the other hand, our magnetoresistance data cannot be properly fitted using Kawabata's expression based on a weak-localization model.",3
Competing interactions in a long-range spin-lattice coupled model and tricriticality.,"The interplay of spin and lattice degrees of freedom on the critical behavior of magnetic phase transitions in strongly correlated systems can be studied analytically by constructing an effective model Hamiltonian for the corresponding order parameters. Here we consider such a model C-type Hamiltonian involving the coupling between order parameter and the strain field. Taking the strain interaction to be long-range (LR) in nature, we carry out a renormalization-group analysis at one-loop order. This reveals a non-trivial critical behavior dictated by an LR fixed point. We show that the critical behavior differs in the presence of competing short-range interaction. For the case of purely nonlocal theory, we find a signature of first-order instability at the leading order of the perturbation expansion. We also discuss briefly the applicability of the model in capturing the experimental results.",3
Off-centered-symmetry-based band structure modulation of hexagonal WO3.,"The accurate band gap of 2.24 eV for hexagonal WO3 is obtained by adopting the revised Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof screened hybrid functional. The large band gap is a result of the off-centered symmetry where the W atom forms two short and two long bonds with four neighboring in-plane O atoms. By adding/removing electrons into/from the crystal, the effect of charge doping is investigated. With introducing electrons, the off-centered symmetry gets weakened with a slight narrowing in band gap. However, the doping lifts the Fermi level into the conduction band, inducing an increase in transition energy for electrons. Similarly, the hole doping also results in a remarkable increase in the transition energy. Such band structure modulation can be used in high efficient photoabsorption, photocatalysis and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy.",3
Nonequilibrium magnetic properties in oxygen-rich LaMnO3 nanoparticles.,"Nonequilibrium magnetic properties of oxygen-rich LaMnO3.21 nanoparticles have been investigated by comprehensive magnetic measurements. The composition falls in the metamagnetic canted spin region of the magnetic phase diagram. However, the zero-field-cooling memory effect and frequency-dependent AC susceptibility reveal a re-entrant glassy state at low temperature. In contrast to the super-spin glass or cluster glass that re-enter from the high-temperature ferromagnetic state in previous studies, analyses based on the power law and Vogel-Fulcher law indicate strongly a conventional spin glass nature. As the magnetic field increases, an anomalous enhancement of the irreversible temperature is observed, suggesting a field-induced nonequilibrium magnetic state. These results can be understood by considering the interaction between the antiferromagnetic clusters and the metamagnetic canted-spin matrix inside the nanoparticles.",3
Topological phases of higher Chern numbers in Kitaev-Heisenberg ferromagnet with further-neighbor interactions.,"Emergence of multiple topological phases with a series of Chern numbers, [Formula: see text]1, [Formula: see text]1, [Formula: see text]2, [Formula: see text]2, [Formula: see text]3 and [Formula: see text]4, is found in a ferromagnetic Kitaev-Heisenberg-spin-anisotropic model on honeycomb lattice with next-next-nearest-neighbor interactions in the presence of an external magnetic field. Magnon Chern insulating dispersions of this two-band model are studied by using linear spin-wave theory formulated on the exact ferromagnetic ground state. Magnon edge states are obtained for the respective topological phases along with density of states. A topological phase diagram of this model is presented. Behavior of thermal Hall conductivity for those phases is studied. Sharp jumps of thermal hall conductivity is noted near the vicinity of phase transition points. Topological phases of the Kitaev spin-liquid compounds, [Formula: see text]-RuCl3, X2IrO3, X = (Na, Li) and CrY3, Y = (Cl, Br, I) are characterized based on this theoretical findings.",3
Ab initio semi-classical electronic transport in ZnSe: the role of inelastic scattering mechanisms.,"We present a detailed ab initio study of semi-classical transport in n-ZnSe using Rode's iterative method. Inclusion of ionized impurity, piezoelectric, acoustic deformation and polar optical phonon scattering and their relative importance at low and room temperature for various n-ZnSe samples are discussed in depth. We have clearly noted that inelastic polar optical phonon scattering is the most dominant scattering mechanism over most of the temperature region. Our results are in good agreement with the experimental data for the mobility and conductivity obtained at different doping concentrations over a wider range of temperatures. Also we compare these results with the ones obtained with relaxation time approximation (RTA) which clearly demonstrate the superiority of the iterative method over RTA.",3
"Study of magneto capacitance effect, exchange bias, XMCD and XAS in La0.8Bi0.2Fe0.7Mn0.3O3/LaNiO3/LaAlO3 multiferroic thin film.","Magneto capacitance (MC) property of La0.8Bi0.2Fe0.7Mn0.3O3/LaNiO3/LaAlO3 thin film has been studied at an applied magnetic field of 0 T and 5 T. Variation of capacitance versus frequency at different temperatures (80 K, 100 K,180 K and 200 K) with the application of magnetic field depicts the unification of ferroic (ferroelectric and ferromagnetic) properties. This is a significant aspect for a system to be multiferroic, a choice for better device application. Exchange bias effect is observed on meticulous study of hysteresis loop taken at 5 K and 10 K upto ~1 Tesla (while cooling thin film in 5 kOe of applied magnetic field) in the form of systematic shift in loops on positive side of applied magnetic field. Hysteresis loop shifts accordingly on negative side on changing the polarity of field (-5 kOe) in field cooled mode, confirming the intrinsic nature of exchange bias effect in thin film. The NEXAFS technique has been used in finding the electronic structure, charge state and local symmetry of ions present in thin film; therefore the mechanism(s) responsible for its major properties. Magnetic character of thin film is studied using x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements. NEXAFS data of Mn L3,2- edge spectra indicates the presence of Mn(2+) /Mn(3+) valence states with contribution from Mn(4+) ions in the system, which corroborates the ferrimagnetic nature revealed by thin film. L3,2- edge of Fe along with reference compound (Fe2O3) reveals that these ions are present in trivalent state (Fe(3+)) in octahedral symmetry. O K-edge features compliment the magneto-electric (ME) properties of the thin film. Charge transfer multiplet calculations confirm that Mn ions exist in different charge states (Mn(2+,3,+4+)) whereas Fe ions exhibit single (Fe(3+)) valent state in thin film.",3
Effect of electrophilic substitution and destructive quantum interference on the thermoelectric performance in molecular devices.,"Using density function theory combined with the non-equilibrium Green's function method, the thermoelectric properties of para-Xylene-based molecular devices are investigated. It is found that destructive quantum interference can be triggered in n-type of para-connected para-Xylene-based molecular device and can obviously enhance the thermoelectric performance of the devices. Moreover, bridge atom electrophilic substitution can significantly improve the thermoelectric properties of p-type monolayer molecular device. The ZT value of p-type monolayer molecular device with doped electrodes can be optimized to 2.2 at 300 K and 2.8 at 500 K, and n-type bilayer molecular device can achieve the value of 1.2 at 300 K and 2.0 at 500 K. These results offer the information to design the complete molecular thermoelectric device with p-type and n-type of components and to promote the thermoelectric properties of bilayer molecular junctions by employing destructive quantum interference effects.",3
Topological phase transition with p orbitals in the exciton-polariton honeycomb lattice.,"We study the topological phase transition with the TE-TM splitting in the p-orbital exciton-polariton honeycomb lattice. We find that some Dirac points survive at the high-symmetry points with space-inversion symmetry breaking, which reflects the characteristic of p orbitals. A phase diagram is obtained by the gap Chern number, from which the topological phase transition takes place in the intermediate gap. There is no topological phase transition in the bottom or top gap, and its edge state has the potential application for transporting signals in optoelectronic devices. When taking into account the non-degenerate p orbitals, we find that the bottom gap arises owing to the competition between the Zeeman energy and rotating angular velocity, and topological phase transition also appears in the complete gaps. These results can facilitate the experimental investigations of the topological properties of p-orbital exciton-polariton lattice structure.",3
Engineering magnetoresistance: a new perspective.,"A new proposal is given to achieve high degree of magnetoresistance (MR) in a magnetic quantum device where two magnetic layers are separated by a non-magnetic (NM) quasiperiodic layer that acts as a spacer. The NM spacer is chosen in the form of well-known Aubry-Andre or Harper (AAH) model which essentially gives the non-trivial features in MR due to its gaped spectrum and yields the opportunities of controlling MR selectively by tuning the AAH phase externally. We also explore the role of dephasing on magnetotransport to make the model more realistic. Finally, we illustrate the experimental possibilities of our proposed quantum system.",3
First principles study of semihydrogenated graphene and topological insulator heterojunction.,"Based on first principles calculations, we study the electronic properties of heterostructures formed by a 2D ferromagnetic insulator semihydrogenated graphene (SG) and topological insulator Bi2Se3 thin films of a few quintuple layers (QLs). It is found that the unsaturated C atoms in SG form bonds with Se atoms in Bi2Se3 thin film and the top surface states (at the interface) are strongly hybridized with SG. Due to breaking of time-reversal symmetry, the surface states open gaps of 40 meV and 150 meV for SG/3QL-Bi2Se3 and SG/5QL-Bi2Se3 heterostructures, respectively. Furthermore, a giant Rashba spin splitting is found induced by the SG layer.",3
An evidence of local structural disorder across spin-reorientation transition in DyFeO3: an extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) study.,"The present work is aimed at exploring the local atomic structure modifications related to the spin reorientation transition (SRT) in DyFeO3 orthoferrite exploiting x-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy. For this purpose we studied by XAFS the evolution of the local atomic structure around Fe and Dy as function of temperature (10-300 K) in a DyFeO3 sample having the SRT around 50-100 K. For sake of comparison we studied a YFeO3 sample having no SRT. The analysis of the extended region has revealed an anomalous trend of Fe-O nearest neighbour distribution in DFO revealing (i) a weak but significant compression with increasing temperature above the SRT and (ii) a peculiar behavior of mean square relative displacement (MSRD) [[Formula: see text]] of Fe-O bonds showing an additional static contribution in the low temperature region, below the SRT. These effects are absent in the YFO sample supporting these anomalies related to the SRT. Interestingly the analysis of Dy L 3-edge data also reveal anomalies in the Dy-O neighbour distribution associated to the SRT, pointing out a role of magnetic Re ions across [Formula: see text]. These results point out micro-structural modification at both Fe and Dy sites associated to the magnetic transitions in DFO, it can be stated in general terms that such local distortions across [Formula: see text] and magnetic Re(3+) may be present in other orthoferrites exhibiting multiferroic nature.",3
Insulator-metal transition and quasi-flat-band of Shastry-Sutherland lattice.,"Insulator-metal transition is investigated self-consistently on the frustrated Shastry-Sutherland lattice in the framework of Slave-Boson mean-field theory. Due to the presence of quasi-flat band structure characteristic, the system displays a spin-density-wave (SDW) insulating phase at the weak doping levels, which is robust against frustration, and it will be transited into an SDW metallic phase at high doping levels. As further increasing the doping, the temperature or the frustration on the diagonal linking bonds, the magnetic order m will be monotonically suppressed, resulting in the appearance of a paramagnetic metallic phase. Although the Fermi surface of the SDW metallic phase may be immersed by temperature, the number of mobile charges is robust against temperature at weak doping levels.",3
Basic modelling of effects of geometry and magnetic field for quantum wires injecting electrons into a two-dimensional electron reservoir.,"High-mobility two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) which resides at the interface between GaAs and AlGaAs layered semiconductors has been used experimentally and theoretically to study ballistic electron transport. The present paper is motivated by recent experiments in magnetic electron focusing. The proposed device consists of two quantum point contacts (QPCs) serving as electron injector and collector which are placed in the same semiconductor GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure. Here we focus on a theoretical study of the injection of electrons via a quantum wire/QPC into an open two-dimensional (2D) reservoir. The transport is considered for non-interacting electrons at different transmission regimes using the mode-matching technique. The proposed mode-matching technique has been implemented numerically. Electron flow through the quantum wire with hard-wall rectangular, conical and rounded openings has been studied. We have found for these three cases that the geometry of the opening does not play a crucial role for the electron propagation. When a perpendicular magnetic field is applied the electron paths in the 2D reservoir are curved. We analyse this case both classically and quantum-mechanically. The effect of spin-splitting due to exchange interactions on the electron flow is also considered. The effect is clearly present for realistic choices of device parameters and consistent with observations. The results of this study may be applied in designing magnetic focusing devices and spin separation.",3
Intrinsic phonon-mediated superconductivity in graphene-like BSi lattice.,"The research of new superconductors is an ongoing field for the fundamental significances and potential applications, and two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials open a new alluring branch for exploration. Here we predict by first-principles calculations that 2D pristine graphene-like BSi monolayer is a phonon-mediated superconductor above the boiling point of liquid helium. The intrinsic covalent-metallic ground state, large density of states at Fermi energy, proper electronic organization as well as strong coupling of out-of-plane phonons and electrons endow an intermediate electron-phonon coupling of ~1.12, rendering this honeycomb sheet as a conventional superconductor with a relatively high T c ~ 11 K. As the global minimum structure in the 2D space previously predicted, this superconducting BSi monolayer may be feasible experimentally. Our finding provides a new field of superconducting nanomaterials for study.",3
Selective probing of magnetic order on Tb and Ir sites in stuffed Tb2Ir2O7 using resonant x-ray scattering.,"We study the magnetic structure of the 'stuffed' (Tb-rich) pyrochlore iridate Tb2+x Ir2-x O7-y (x approximately 0.18), using resonant elastic x-ray scattering (REXS). In order to disentangle contributions from Tb and Ir magnetic sublattices, experiments were performed at the Ir L 3 and Tb M 5 edges, which provide selective sensitivity to Ir 5d and Tb 4f magnetic moments, respectively. At the Ir L 3 edge, we found the onset of long-range [Formula: see text] magnetic order below [Formula: see text] K, consistent with the expected signal of all-in all-out (AIAO) magnetic order. Using a single-ion model to calculate REXS cross-sections, we estimate an ordered magnetic moment of [Formula: see text] at 5 K. At the Tb M 5 edge, long-range [Formula: see text] magnetic order appeared below approximately [Formula: see text] K, also consistent with an AIAO magnetic structure on the Tb site. Additional insight into the magnetism of the Tb sublattice is gleaned from measurements at the M 5 edge in applied magnetic fields up to 6 T, which is found to completely suppress the Tb AIAO magnetic order. In zero applied field, the observed gradual onset of the Tb sublattice magnetisation with temperature suggests that it is induced by the magnetic order on the Ir site. The persistence of AIAO magnetic order, despite the greatly reduced ordering temperature and moment size compared to stoichiometric Tb2Ir2O7, for which [Formula: see text] K and [Formula: see text], indicates that stuffing could be a viable means of tuning the strength of electronic correlations, thereby potentially offering a new strategy to achieve topologically non-trivial band crossings in pyrochlore iridates.",3
Small non-uniform basal crystal fields in HVPE free-standing GaN:Mg as evidenced by angular dependent and frequency-dependent EPR.,"We studied thin-film and free-standing Mg-doped GaN using multi-frequency electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) at 3-3.5 K and 9.4-130 GHz. Free-standing samples exhibit a highly anisotropic intensity, varying by a factor of 20 from 0 degrees to 60 degrees . In contrast, the intensity of the thin-film samples is significantly more isotropic, varying by no more than 10% over the same range of angles. The angular dependent intensity can be modeled in both free-standing and thin-film samples similarly to the g-factor anisotropy reported for thin films, supporting the theoretical predictions that the hole is on a basal site around the Mg acceptor. In addition, frequency-dependent transmission EPR measurements reveal a distribution of [Formula: see text] in free-standing samples, indicating that the local basal crystal field is non-uniform.",3
Tunable surface plasmon polaritons in a Weyl semimetal waveguide.,"Weyl semimetals have recently attracted extensive attention due to their anomalous band structure manifested by topological properties that lead to some unusual and unique physical properties. We investigate novel features of surface plasmon polaritons in a slot waveguide comprised from two semi-infinite Weyl semimetals. We consider symmetric Voigt-Voigt and Faraday-Faraday configurations for plasmon polaritons in two interfaces of waveguide and show that the resulting dispersion is symmetric and the propagation of surface plasmon polaritons is bidirectional. We introduce exotic and novel asymmetric structures making use of difference in magnitude or orientation of chiral anomalies in two Weyl semimetals in both Voigt and Faraday configurations. These structures show a tremendous nonreciprocal dispersion and unidirectional propagation of surface plasmon polaritons. Moreover, we study a hybrid configuration of Voigt-Faraday for surface plasmon polartions in two interfaces of the waveguide. We find that this structure possesses unique futures. It shows surface plasmon polariton modes with unidirectional propagation above the bulk plasmon frequency. Furthermore, we find a surface plasmon polariton band which admits the Voigt and Faraday features simultaneously. Also, we show that the waveguide thickness and the chemical potential of the Weyl semimetals can be used as a fine-tuning parameters in these structures. Our findings may be employed in optical devices which exploit the unidirectional surface plasmon propagation features.",3
Cross-plane heat conduction in III-V semiconductor superlattices.,"Thermal management is a crucial component in analyzing the performance of III-V semiconductor superlattice-based optoelectronic devices. Here we provide a rigorous physical analysis of cross-plane thermal conduction in GaAs/AlAs and their alloy-based superlattices while rigorously accounting for phonon interlayer coupling and interfacial structural characteristics. We present a comprehensive study of superlattice thermal transport, including structure-property relations, spectral and modal descriptions, and contrast it with in-plane heat conduction thereby explaining the resultant anisotropy in III-V semiconductor superlattices. Our results provide key physical insights into rational material design for thermal modulation in optoelectronic devices.",3
Molecules with dipoles in periodic boundary conditions in a tetragonal cell.,"When a system which contains a dipole, and whose dimensionality is less than three, is studied in a code which imposes periodic boundary conditions in all three dimensions, an artificial electric field arises which keeps the potential periodic. This has an impact on the total energy of the system, and on any other attribute which would respond to an electric field. Simple corrections are known for 0D systems embedded in a cubic geometry, and 2D slab systems. This paper shows how the 0D result can be extended to tetragonal geometries, and that for a particular c/a ratio the correction is zero. It also considers an exponential error term absent from the usual consideration of 2D slab geometries, and discusses an empirical form for this.",3
Direct evaluation of the isotope effect within the framework of density functional theory for superconductors.,"Within recent developments of density functional theory, its numerical implementation and of the superconducting density functional theory is nowadays possible to predict the superconducting critical temperature, [Formula: see text], with sufficient accuracy to anticipate the experimental verification. In this paper we present an analytical derivation of the isotope coefficient within the superconducting density functional theory. We calculate the partial derivative of [Formula: see text] with respect to atomic masses. We verified the final expression by means of numerical calculations of isotope coefficient in monatomic superconductors (Pb) as well as polyatomic superconductors (CaC6). The results confirm the validity of the analytical derivation with respect to the finite difference methods, with considerable improvement in terms of computational time and calculation accuracy. Once the critical temperature is calculated (at the reference mass(es)), various isotope exponents can be simply obtained in the same run. In addition, we provide the expression of interesting quantities like partial derivatives of the deformation potential, phonon frequencies and eigenvectors with respect to atomic masses, which can be useful for other derivations and applications.",3
"Structural, magnetic, grain and grain boundary mediated conduction features of low dimensional LaFeO<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles.","A detail investigation of crystal structure, magnetic and electrical conduction properties of a low dimensional LaFeO3 (LFO) is reported. The sample is synthesized by Sol-Gel method with a low preparation temperature. Synchrotron x-ray diffraction (SXRD), Raman and FTIR spectroscopy methods were used to establish the structural phase and vibrational modes present in the sample. The low dimensionality and morphology of the prepared sample is probed through Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). From the explicitly field and temperature dependent magnetization, the magnetic phase exhibited by the nanoparticle is weak ferromagnetic which is further evidencing from the Fe57 Mossbauer spectroscopy. To gain further understanding of electrical conduction mechanism and related features of AC conductivity, impedance spectroscopy techniques are used. It is noticed that, the grain effect is dominated while the electrode effect is suppressed with temperature. The activation energies due to grain and grain boundary effect are found to be 0.0780 eV, 0.175 eV for T &amp;lt; 90 degrees C and 0.451 eV, 0.525 eV for T &amp;gt; 90 degrees C respectively. Finally, Jump relaxation model (JRM) and Jonscher's power law are used to explain the frequency-dependent conduction behavior in the system.",3
An examination of scaling behavior in unstable epitaxial mound growth via kinetic Monte Carlo simulations.,"We investigate the scaling behavior for roughening and coarsening of mounds during unstable epitaxial growth. By using kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations of two lattice-gas models of crystal surfaces, we find scaling exponents that characterize roughening and coarsening at long times. Our simulation data show that these exponents have a complicated dependence on key model parameters that describe a step edge barrier and downward transport mechanisms. This behavior has not been fully described in previous works. In particular, we find that these scaling exponents vary continuously with parameters controlling the surface current. The kinetic processes of the KMC models that we employ include surface diffusion, edge diffusion, step-edge barriers, and also account for transient kinetics during deposition via downward funneling and transient mobility. Our extensive simulations make evident the salient interplay between step-edge barrier strength and transient kinetic processes.",3
"Structural, vibrational and electronic properties of SnMBO4 (M = Al, Ga): a predictive hybrid DFT study.","We propose two new members of the mullite-type family, SnAlBO4 and SnGaBO4, and carry out an in-depth study of their crystal properties using the hybrid method PW1PW. Both are isostructural to PbMBO4 (M = Fe, Mn, Al, Ga), which show axial negative linear compressibility (ANLC), among other interesting features. We find that, although Sn(2+) is susceptible of being oxidized by oxygen, a suitable range of experimental parameters exists in which the compounds could be synthesized. We observe absence of ANLC below 20 GPa and explain it by the small space occupied by the lone electron pairs, as indicated by the small length of the corresponding Liebau Density Vectors. In agreement with this fact, the structures present a low number of negative mode-Gruneisen parameters, which may also suggest lack of negative thermal expansion. The electronic properties show a remarkable anisotropic behaviour, with a strong dependence of the absorption spectra on light polarization direction.",3
Inducing half metallicity with alloying in Heusler Compound CoFeMnSb.,"First principles studies were performed in order to find out the possibility of inducing half-metallicity in Heusler Compound CoFeMnSb, by means of alloying it with 3d-transition metal elements. Proper alloying element is selected through the calculations of formation energies. These calculations were tested with different concentrations of alloying elements at different atomic sites. Among the selected transition metal elements Sc and Ti are proposed to be excellent alloying elements, particularly at Mn site. By using these alloying elements complete half metallic behaviour is obtained in [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] and CoFeTiSb alloys. Shifting of Co-Fe d-states towards lower energy region leads to zero density of states at Fermi level for the spin minority channel. Alloying effects on the electronic structure and magnetization are discussed in details. Thermodynamical stability of these new alloys is a major part of this study. The Curie temperatures of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] were found to be 324.5 K and 682 K; respectively, showing good candidature for spintronics applications. For understanding the bonding nature of the constituent atom of CoFeMnSb, crystal orbital Hamiltonian populations have been analysed.",3
First-principles calculation of correlated electron materials based on Gutzwiller wave function beyond Gutzwiller approximation.,"We propose an approach that is under the framework of Gutzwiller wave function but goes beyond the commonly adopted Gutzwiller approximation to improve the accuracy and flexibility in treating the correlation effects. Detailed formalism is described for a dimer which is straightforwardly generalized later to more complicated periodic bulk systems. The accuracy of the approach is demonstrated by evaluating the potential energy curves of spin-singlet N2 dimer, spin-triplet O2 dimer, and 1D hydrogen chain. The computational workload of the approach can be easily handled by efficient parallel computing.",3
Strain-induced N-N bonding and magnetic changes in monolayer intrinsic ferromagnetic TmN2 (Tm = Tc and Nb).,"The modulation of magnetic property in two-dimensional (2D) intrinsic ferromagnets is important for their future application in spintronic devices at the nanoscale. In this work, using first-principles calculation, we investigate the effects of strain on the structures, electronic structures and magnetic properties of monolayer 1H-NbN2 and 1H-TcN2. The results show that both the unstrained monolayer 1H-NbN2 and 1H-TcN2 are 2D intrinsically ferromagnetic (FM) metal, in which the magnetic moment of the 1H-NbN2 and 1H-TcN2 comes mainly from the d orbitals of Nb atom and the p orbitals of N atom, respectively. Remarkably, two neighboring N atoms in the unstrained 1H-NbN2 form N-N bond, while those in the 1H-TcN2 do not. When lattice constant a increases to 3.17 A, monolayer 1H-TcN2 undergoes N-N nonbonding-bonding transition at which the distance between the N atoms d N-N suddenly drops by almost 25%. In particular, due to the bonding between two neighboring N atoms, the magnetic moment of N atoms in 1H-TcN2 are quenched and the ground state transfers to non-magnetic. In contrast, when a decreases to 3.18 A, monolayer 1H-NbN2 undergoes N - N bonding-nonbonding transition at which the d N-N suddenly increases from 1.79 A to 1.97 A. The N-N bonding-nonbonding transition induces the magnetic moments to transfer from the d orbitals of Nb atom to the p orbitals of N atom, while ground state of monolayer 1H-NbN2 remains FM metal.",3
"First principle study on the predicted phase transition of MN (M = Zr, La and Th).","First principle (FP) calculations were performed to systematically study the structural properties of ZrN, LaN and ThN with GGA correction. The ground state properties, wave velocities and Debye temperature of B1, P63/mmc, Pnma and B2 phase in ZrN, LaN and ThN were investigated and agree well with other theoretical and experimental results. More importantly, some novel phases are predicted in these materials, i.e. with the increasing pressure the phase transition sequence in ZrN and ThN is found to be B1 --> P63/mmc --> B2 phase, while in LaN, the sequence of B1 --> Pnma --> B2 is observed. Furthermore, our calculated elastic properties also confirm the prediction of phase transition under high pressure. These phase transitions arise from the optical phonon softening of B1 at around X, M and G points of Brillouin zone and P63/mmc (or Pnma) structure at around G, and H-K points.",3
Strain induced electronic and magnetic properties of 2D magnet CrI3: a DFT approach.,"In the post-graphene era, out of several monolayer 2D materials, Chromium triiodide ([Formula: see text]) has triggered an exotic platform for studying the intrinsic ferromagnetism and large anisotropy at the nanoscale regime. Apart from that, its strong spin-orbit coupling of I also plays a key role in tailoring the electronic properties. In this work, the composition of compressive and tensile strain (uniaxial as well as biaxial) upto 12% have been applied to study the variation of the electronic and magnetic properties of [Formula: see text] employing density functional theory in (LDA+U) exchange correlation scheme. The stability limits of the structures under the influence of strains have been carried out via the deformation potential (DP) and stress-strain relation. For compressive strains in specific directions, the down-spin band gap is seen to be decreasing steadily. The magnetic moment computed from the density of states (DOS) is enhanced significantly under the influence of compressive strain. However, it has been observed that after the application of strain in some specific crystal directions, the magnetic moment of monolayer [Formula: see text] remains almost unchanged. Thus, with the help of strain, the tunning band gap along with underlying characteristic ferromagnetism of this material can unfold a new avenue for potential usage in spintronic devices.",3
Quasiparticle self-consistent GW electronic band structures of Be-IV-N2 compounds.,"The electronic band structures of BeSiN2 and BeGeN2 compounds are calculated using the quasiparticle self-consistent GW method. The lattice parameters are calculated for the wurtzite based crystal structure commonly found in other II-IV-N2 compounds with the Pbn21 space group. They are determined both in the local density approximation and generalized gradient approximation, which provide lower and upper limits. At the GGA lattice constants, which gives lattice constants closer to the experimental ones, BeSiN2 is found to have an indirect band gap of 6.88 eV and its direct gap at [Formula: see text] is 7.77 eV, while in BeGeN2 the gap is direct at [Formula: see text] and equals 5.03 eV. To explain the indirect gap in BeSiN2 comparisons are made with the parent III-N compound w-BN band structure. The effective mass parameters are also evaluated and found to decrease from BeSiN2 to BeGeN2.",3
A model for individual quantal nano-skyrmions.,"A quantal model description of a discrete localized skyrmion singularity embedded in a ferromagnetic environment is proposed. It allows discussing the importance of various parameters in the appearance of a quantal skyrmion singularity. Analysis of the skyrmion reveals a few specific quantal properties: presence of a whole series of skyrmion states, non-classical nature of the local spins, presence of superposition states and presence of extra-skyrmion states due to the quantization of the central spin of the singularity. The interaction of an electron, tunneling or substrate, with the skyrmion is also described allowing a new view at the origin of the skyrmion stability as well as the possibility to discriminate between ferromagnetic and skyrmion phase in an inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy experiment, based on the skyrmion quantal properties.",3
First principles investigation of topological phase in XMR material TmSb under hydrostatic pressure.,"In this article, we report emergence of topological phase in extremely large magnetoresistance (XMR) material TmSb under hydrostatic pressure using first principles calculations. We find that TmSb, a topologically trivial semimetal, undergoes a topological phase transition with band inversion at X point without breaking any symmetry under a hydrostatic pressure of 12 GPa. At 15 GPa, it again becomes topologically trivial with band inversion at [Formula: see text] as well as X point. We find that the pressures corresponding to the topological phase transitions are far below the pressure corresponding to structural phase transition at 25.5 GPa. The reentrant behaviour of topological quantum phase with hydrostatic pressure would help in finding a correlation between topology and XMR effects through experiments.",3
Investigation of quantum and thermal fluctuations ferromagnetic spin chains with easy-plane anisotropy.,"One-dimensional ferromagnetic S = 1/2 and S = 1 spin chains with easy-plane and easy-axis exchange anisotropy are studied by the double-time Green's function method. The XYZ model can be used to describe several chain systems as the ferromagnetic spin chain of [Formula: see text] (CHAB). Alternatively, ferromagnetic spin-spirals with Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction. To study quantum and thermal fluctuations the magnetization and susceptibility are calculated and analyzed as a function of the external field, the strength of the anisotropy and the chain length.",3
Photon diffusion in microscale solids.,"This paper presents a theoretical and experimental investigation of photon diffusion in highly absorbing microscale graphite. A Nd:YAG continuous wave laser is used to heat the graphite samples with thicknesses of 40 mum and 100 mum. Optical intensities of 10 kW cm(-2) and 20 kW cm(-2) are used in the laser heating. The graphite samples are heated to temperatures of thousands of kelvins within milliseconds, which are recorded by a 2-color, high speed pyrometer. To compare the observed temperatures, differential equation of heat conduction is solved across the samples with proper initial and boundary conditions. In addition to lattice vibrations, photon diffusion is incorporated in the analytical model of thermal conductivity for solving the heat equation. The numerical simulations showed close matching between experiment and theory only when including the photon diffusion equations and existing material properties data found in the previously published works with no fitting constants. The results indicate that the commonly-overlooked mechanism of photon diffusion dominates the heat transfer of many microscale structures near their evaporation temperatures. In addition, the treatment explains the discrepancies between thermal conductivity measurements and theory that were previously described in the scientific literature.",3
Unveiling optical in-plane anisotropy of 2D materials from oblique incidence of light.,"In this work, we present a theoretical study of the dispersion of linearly polarized light between two dielectric media separated by an anisotropic two-dimensional (2D) material under oblique incidence. Assuming that the 2D material is a conducting sheet of negligible thickness, generalized Fresnel coefficients are derived as a function of usual quantities (e.g. refraction indexes and scattering angles) and the anisotropic in-plane optical conductivity of the interstitial 2D material. In particular, we analyzed the modifications due to the 2D material of two classical optical phenomena: the Brewster effect and the total internal reflection. As a application, our general findings are particularized for uniaxially strained graphene. Effects of a uniaxial strain on the Brewster angle and the reflectance (under total internal reflection) are evaluated as a function of the magnitude and direction of strain.",3
The role of magnetic order in VOCl.,"VOCl and other transition metal oxychlorides are candidate materials for next-generation rechargeable batteries. We have investigated the influence of the underlying magnetic order on the crystallographic and electronic structure by means of density functional theory. Our study shows that antiferromagnetic ordering explains the observed low-temperature monoclinic distortion of the lattice, which leads to a decreased distance between antiferromagnetically coupled V-V nearest neighbors. We also show that the existence of a local magnetic moment removes the previously suggested degeneracy of the occupied levels, in agreement with experiments. To describe the electronic structure, it turns out crucial to take the correct magnetic ordering into account, especially at elevated temperature.",3
Pressure effects on iron-based superconductor CaFe0.88Co0.12AsF.,"Systematic measurements of electrical resistivity and Hall coefficient under high pressure were performed on CaFe0.88Co0.12AsF single crystal samples. The superconductivity is suppressed quickly by pressure and can not be detected down to 2 K at above 12.7 GPa, while the magnitude of the Hall coefficient [Formula: see text] shows a very weak pressure and temperature dependence. A comprehensive analysis considering the pressure dependence of [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], residual resistivity ratio, and the Fermi-liquid term of the resistivity indicates that the electron correlation is an important factor in superconductivity of iron-based superconductors.",3
Normal-state properties of the quasi-one-dimensional superconductor Ta4Pd3Te16.,"We examined the physical properties of the quasi-one-dimensional superconductor Ta4Pd3Te16 in the normal state by detailed measurements of susceptibility, in-plane anisotropic resistivity, magnetoresistance, Hall resistivity, and Seebeck coefficient. The large Wilson ratio, as inferred from normal-state susceptibility, indicates strong electron-electron interaction. The Hall and Seebeck coefficients show not only significant temperature-dependent behavior, indicating the multiband effect, but also an obvious anomaly around T 1 = 40 K. Analyses of both the Hall resistivity and thermopower using a two-band model indicate that the electrons dominate the electrical transport at low temperatures. Our results imply that it is the quantum fluctuations of the charge order taking place in the temperature range 30-50 K that may result in the abnormal normal-state properties of Ta4Pd3Te16.",3
Screening of Coulomb interactions in liquid dielectrics.,"The interaction of charges in dielectric materials is screened by the dielectric constant of the bulk dielectric. In dielectric theories, screening is assigned to surface charges appearing from preferential orientations of dipoles along the local field in the interface. For liquid dielectrics, such interfacial orientations are affected by the interfacial structure characterized by a separate interfacial dipolar susceptibility. We argue that dielectric properties of polar liquids should be characterized by two distinct susceptibilities responsible for local response (solvation) and long-range response (dielectric screening). A microscopic model for dipolar screening in polar liquids is developed here. It shows that the standard bulk dielectric constant is responsible for screening at large distances. The potential of mean force between ions in polar liquids becomes oscillatory at short distances. Oscillations arise from the coupling of collective longitudinal excitations (dipolarons) of the polar liquid with its interfacial density profile. Interfacial electrostatics demonstrates a crossover beyond the solute radius of approximately 1 nm from the scaling laws roughly consistent with continuum expectations for small solutes to new scaling trends characterizing the much softer nano-scale solute-solvent interface. This crossover also marks the transition to a continuum-type electrostatic screening between ions, when short-distance oscillation of the potential of mean force become strongly damped. Screening oscillations are enhanced for more structured interfaces.",3
Photogalvanic effect in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides under double illumination.,"We study the photogalvanic effect caused by a simultaneous action of two light sources: circular-polarized interband and linearly-polarized intraband. It is found that, in such conditions, the steady photocurrent appears. The effect originates from the valley-selective pumping by the circular-polarized light, the trigonal symmetry of the valleys and the linear polarization of intraband electromagnetic field, that produces a polar in-plane asymmetry of the electron and hole distribution functions, leading to the photocurrent. The approach is based on the solution of the classical kinetic equation for carriers with accounting for the quantum interband excitation.",3
The influence of long-range interaction on the structure of a two-dimensional multi scale potential system.,"We present the results of a computer simulation study of a finite temperature phase diagram of two-dimensional and quasi two-dimensional core-softened systems both taking into account long-range Coulomb-like forces and ignoring them. The system structure was determined from analysis of the behavior of radial distribution functions, order parameters and number of nearest neighbors. The system has been shown to have a large number of different phases. We have found that long-range forces substantially affected the structure and the melting point of the system at low and moderate densities, while at high densities the effect of long-range forces was negligible.",3
Electronic states of pseudospin-1 fermions in [Formula: see text] lattice ribbons in a magnetic field.,The electronic states on a finite width [Formula: see text] ribbon in a magnetic field are studied in the framework of low-energy effective theory. Both zigzag and armchair types of boundary conditions are analyzed. The analytical solutions are compared with the results of numerical tight-binding calculations. It is found that the flat band of zero energy survives for all types of boundary conditions. The analytical estimates for the spectral gap in a weak magnetic field are discussed. For zigzag type boundary conditions the approximate expressions for the edge and bulk electron states in the strong magnetic field are found.,3
Omnidirectional optical spectra for a nanocomposite cholesteric elastomer.,"We perform a theoretical model for studying the propagation of electromagnetic waves, within a cholesteric elastomer slab, doped with metallic inclusions aleatorily distributed, whose corresponding dielectric properties can be expressed in terms of a resonant effective uniaxial tensor. We have obtained an omnidirectional narrow conducting band and two narrow reflection bands created in the optical spectrum for right and left circularly polarized light, as well as narrow reflection bands for right circularly polarized light. We have found that the transmission and reflection spectra depend on light incidence angle and the filling fraction of metallic inclusions.",3
XAS studies of pressure-induced structural and electronic transformations in alpha-FeOOH.,"Structural and electronic transformation taking place in alpha-FeOOH goethite have been studied by Fe K-edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy at pressures up to 50 GPa. These studies have shown the symmetrization of FeO6 octahedra coinciding with the Fe(3+) high to low spin transition at pressure above ~45 GPa. Our data are in excellent agreement with the results of recent single crystal XRD and Mossbauer spectroscopy studies (Xu et al 2013 Phys. Rev. Lett. 111 175501), supporting the H-bonds symmetrization in iron oxyhydroxide, resulting from the Fe(3+) high-to-low spin crossover at above 45 GPa. Our study shows an applicability of the x-ray absorption spectroscopy in a further study of the H-bonds symmetrization phenomenon.",3
The fifty years it has taken to understand the dynamics of UO<sub>2</sub> in its ordered state.,"In 1966 Roger Cowley (together with Gerald Dolling) reported the first neutron inelastic scattering from the magnetic excitations from UO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; below its antiferro-magnetic ordering temperature of 31 K. They showed the strong magnon-phonon coupling in this material and that the excitations appeared to contain an additional mode that was not anticipated. Cowley never returned to UO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;, but showed a keen interest in the developments. 40 years after this pioneering work, unambiguous evidence was found (using resonance X-ray techniques) for the ordering below T&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;N&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; of the electric quadrupoles involving the anisotropy of the 5&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;f &amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;charge distribution around the uranium nuclei. A further 10 years later, now armed with a full theory for the excitation spectrum expected for phonons, magnons, and quadrupoles, we can identify the latter as the source of the ""extra"" mode reported first in 1966. The story is a long winding one, with the expected serendipity and dead ends, but is now (almost) completed.&amp;#13.",3
Fermi- to non-Fermi-liquid crossover and Kondo behavior in two-dimensional (Cu2/3V1/3)V2S4.,"By means of a specific heat (C) and electrical resistivity ([Formula: see text]) study, we give evidence of a pronounced Fermi liquid (FL) behavior with sizable mass renormalization, [Formula: see text], up to unusually high temperatures approximately 70 K in the layered system (Cu2/3V1/3)V2S4. At low temperature, a marked upturn of both C and [Formula: see text] is suppressed by magnetic field, which suggests a picture of Kondo coupling between conduction electrons in the VS2 layers and impurity spins of the V(3+) ions located between layers. This picture opens the possibility of controlling electronic correlations and the FL to non-FL crossover in simple layered materials. For instance, we envisage that the coupling between layers provided by the impurity spins may realize a two-channel Kondo state.",3
Positron lifetimes of bare and hydrogenated zirconium vacancies in cubic yttria-stabilized zirconia: an ab initio study.,"Recent studies by positron-annihilation spectroscopy (PAS) in single-crystal and nanostructured yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) revealed extensive positron trapping at vacancy-type point defects and other structural imperfections. The present work reports first principles calculations of formation energies and positron lifetimes of Zr vacancies in 10.3 mol% cubic YSZ. The lifetime calculations are based on two-component density-functional theory within the local-density approximation for the electron-positron correlation energy. Gradient-correction effects were also examined. Zr monovacancies were found to be potent trapping sites for positrons with large binding energies and lifetimes in excess of 220 ps. A strong dependency of the lifetimes on the Zr site and local coordination number was observed, a consequence of the structural disorder of the stabilized lattice. In contrast, oxygen vacancies did not act as attractive centers for positrons, either as single defects or as nearest neighbors to seven-fold coordinated Zr vacancies. Defect association of the Zr vacancies with hydrogen led to stable ([Formula: see text]-H) complexes with hydrogen bound to oxygen ions which are nearest neighbors to the vacancies. The negatively-charged ([Formula: see text]-H) defects were also found to trap positrons with corresponding lifetimes strongly dependent upon the hydrogen content within the complex.",3
Structure and superconductivity of protactinium hydrides under high pressure.,"We systematically study the stability, crystal structure, electronic property, and superconductivity of protactinium hydride (PaH n ) (n = 1-9) at a pressure range of 1 atm to 300 GPa by using the first principle of density functional theory. PaH n compounds are very rich, featuring six stoichiometries, such as PaH, PaH3, PaH4, PaH5, PaH8 and PaH9. PaH8 possesses the highly symmetrical crystal structure Fm-3m with cubic H8 units, which is predicted to be thermodynamically stable above 32 GPa. This phase maintains a dynamically stable decompression at 10 GPa. Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) calculations show that Fm-3m-PaH8 exhibits high superconducting critical transition temperature (T c) value of 79 K at 10 GPa due to a strong EPC and large logarithmic average frequency. The T c values of Fm-3m-PaH8 decrease with increasing pressure. Interestingly, superconducting PaH8 appears at low pressure, prompting experimental research.",3
Optical control of the layer degree of freedom through Wannier-Stark states in polar 3R MoS2.,"Electrons in two-dimensional layered crystals gain a discrete positional degree of freedom over layers. We propose the two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide homostructure with polar symmetry as a prototypical platform where the degrees of freedom for the layers and valleys can be independently controlled through an optical method. In 3R MoS2, a model system, the presence of the spontaneous polarization and built-in electric field along the stacking axis is theoretically proven by the density functional theory. The K valley states under the electric field exhibit Wannier-Stark type localization with atomic-scale confinement driven by double group symmetry. The simple interlayer-dynamics-selection rule of the valley carriers in 3R homostructure enables a binary operation, upward or downward motion, using visible and infrared light sources. Together with the valley-index, a 2 [Formula: see text] 2 states/cell device using a dual-frequency polarized light source is suggested.",3
"Green function, quasi-classical Langevin and Kubo-Greenwood methods in quantum thermal transport.","With the advances in fabrication of materials with feature sizes at the order of nanometers, it has been possible to alter their thermal transport properties dramatically. Miniaturization of device size increases the power density in general, hence faster electronics require better thermal transport, whereas better thermoelectric applications require the opposite. Such diverse needs bring new challenges for material design. Shrinkage of length scales has also changed the experimental and theoretical methods to study thermal transport. Unsurprisingly, novel approaches have emerged to control phonon flow. Besides, ever increasing computational power is another driving force for developing new computational methods. In this review, we discuss three methods developed for computing vibrational thermal transport properties of nano-structured systems, namely Green function, quasi-classical Langevin, and Kubo-Green methods. The Green function methods are explained using both nonequilibrium expressions and the Landauer-type formula. The partitioning scheme, decimation techniques and surface Green functions are reviewed, and a simple model for reservoir Green functions is shown. The expressions for the Kubo-Greenwood method are derived, and Lanczos tridiagonalization, continued fraction and Chebyshev polynomial expansion methods are discussed. Additionally, the quasi-classical Langevin approach, which is useful for incorporating phonon-phonon and other scatterings is summarized.",3
Generating pure spin current with spin-dependent Seebeck effect in ferromagnetic zigzag graphene nanoribbons.,"Pure spin current is of great importance in spintronics and may be achieved by spin dependent Seebeck effect (SDSE) in magnetic systems. Zigzag-edged graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) are very well-known 2D magnetic nanostructures. However, perfect and pristine ZGNRs either in the anti-ferromagnetic ground state or in the ferromagnetic (FM) state are not capable of producing pure spin current by SDSE at low temperature. In this work, by density functional theory calculations, we propose a scheme for generating pure spin current using SDSE in FM-ZGNRs by introducing antidots. Specifically, by creating a hexagonal antidot with either armchair edges or zigzag edges in the scattering region, we can get finite Seebeck thermopower for both spin channels with opposite signs, leading to the opposite flow directions of the two spin channels. The mechanism is well explained by the cooperation of the varying localization features of states around the Fermi level and the antidot induced scattering potential. By slightly tuning the chemical potential, pure spin current can be achieved. The size and edge shape effects have also been systematically studied. The findings indicate a novel scheme for thermally generating pure spin current in zigzag graphene nanoribbons and may find important application in graphene based spintronics.",3
Staggered potential and magnetic field tunable electronic switch in a kagome nanoribbon junction.,"We propose a possible electronic switch on a two dimensional (2D) kagome lattice by applying a perpendicular inhomogeneous magnetic field and a staggered sublattice potential. By means of the tight-binding lattice model and the non-equilibrium Green's function method, we calculate the quantum Hall conductance of the device at zero temperature limit. The numerical results demonstrate that when a staggered lattice potential is considered, the conventional integer Hall effect is changed into discrete fractional conductance peaks, and a finite energy gap can be opened in the system, which may induce a metal-insulator transition and can be designed as a 2D electronic valve. The conductance valve phenomena mainly come from the interplay between the asymmetry energy band induced by the magnetic field and a band gap opened by the staggered potential. The ON(OFF) state of the electron transport is efficiently controlled by the device parameters such as the magnetic field, the staggered lattice potential and the Fermi level. Our findings might be useful for designing efficient current valves in 2D nano-electronic devices.",3
A study of structural phase transitions and optoelectronic properties of perovskite-type hydride MgFeH3: ab initio calculations.,"In this study, the structural phase transition and optoelectronic properties of perovskite-hydride MgFeH3 under high pressure have been performed by ab initio calculations based on GGA-PBE functional. The phase transitions were observed from the cubic structure ([Formula: see text]) to the orthorhombic [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] structure. During the phase transition, the [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] intermediate phases were predicted. The energy-volume (E-V) relationships show that the most stable phase is [Formula: see text]. The lattice parameters and volume increased as based on the phase transforms. From the electronic band analysis, the MgFeH3 shows a metallic character from the cubic to orthorhombic structure. The MgFeH3 indicates the peaks at 2.67 eV (464 nm) for [Formula: see text] phase, 5.21 eV (238 nm) for [Formula: see text] phase and 2.63 eV (471 nm) for [Formula: see text] phase. [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] phases correspond to the visible region. The absorption peaks are getting wider and have higher magnitude from [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text] phase. The optical conductivity for the cubic structure with [Formula: see text] phase was found to be higher than orthorhombic structures with [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text] phases. The reflectivity maxima decrease from [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text].",3
New stoichiometric compounds of Au-Hg system under high pressure.,"We have extensively explored Au-Hg system under high pressure in the range of 0-300 GPa with and without spin-orbit coupling (SOC) inclusion. The variable-composition methodology has been used as employed in Universal Structure Predictor: Evolutionary Xtallograpgy (USPEX) in combination with Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). We have predicted several thermodynamically stable stoichiometric compounds of Au-Hg system, i.e. Au3Hg (space group 194, P63/mmc), AuHg (space group 62, Pnma), AuHg2 (space group 15, C2/c), AuHg9 (space group 38, Amm2) at 50 GPa; AuHg3 (space group 44, Imm2) at 100 GPa; Au3Hg2 (space group 15, C2/c) at 200 GPa and AuHg4 (space group 15, C2/c) at 300 GPa. We also found a phase transition of AuHg3 from Imm2 to P63/mmc at 248.5 GPa and 246.5 GPa with and without SOC, respectively.",3
Effect of indium doping on motions of <a>-prismatic edge dislocations in wurtzite gallium nitride.,"The influences of indium doping on dynamics of <a>-prismatic edge dislocation along [Formula: see text] shuffle plane in wurtzite GaN have been investigated employing classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The dependence of dislocation motion mode and dislocation velocity on indium doping concentration, temperature, and applied shear stress was clarified. Moreover, the simulation results were further analyzed using elastic theory of dislocation and thermal activation theory of dislocation motion, showing excellent agreement with the simulation. Our findings help gain deep insights into modifying dynamic behaviors of TDs through the alloying doping and offer generic tools to the study of other wurtzite materials of promising application prospects, such as AlGaN and ZnO.",3
Discretized dynamics of exchange spin wave bulk and edge modes in honeycomb nanoribbons with armchair edge boundaries.,"We develop a field theory to study the dynamics of long wavelength exchange spin wave excitations on honeycomb nanoribbons characterized by armchair edge boundaries and the Neel antiferromagnetic ordering state. Appropriate boundary conditions are established by requiring that the bulk and edge spins precess with the same frequency for any given spin wave eigenmode in these systems. A set of characteristic boundary equations, common for bulk and edge spin wave modes, are hence derived. The equations of motion for the spin dynamics are then solved to determine the propagating and evanescent exchange spin wave modes. We obtain the expected discretized bulk spin waves spectrum due to the finite width of the nanoribbon. For an isotropic magnetic nanoribbon, the Dirac cone is reduced to a single linear dispersion curve due to this discretization. The number and wavelengths of allowed bulk modes for isotropic and anisotropic nanoribbons are determined from the derived characteristic boundary equations. As witnessed by our numerical results for different examples it is shown that the characteristics of these modes depend on the width of the nanoribbon and its antiferromagnetic anisotropy. Further, anisotropic nanoribbons, even those with the slightest anisotropy, present evanescent modes with non-linear dispersion relations. The spatial variation of the amplitudes of the evanescent exchange spin waves across the finite widths of the nanoribbons, is found to be strongly dependent on the system magnetic anisotropy and its width. The developed theoretical approach is general and can be applied for nanoribbons with all types of boundary edges.",3
Signatures of Majorana doublet in the Fano-Rashba interferometer.,"We theoretically study the quantum transport through a Fano-Rashba interferometer with an embedded Majorana doublet which generates at one end of the DIII-class topological superconductor. It shows that the Rasbha spin-orbit interaction in the reference arm drives the apparent and terminal-dependence spin polarization of the electron tunneling and crossed Andreev reflection, accompanied by their opposite directions. However, spin degeneracy holds in the local Andreev reflection. Next once the Majorana doublet is replaced by the Andreev bound state, the spin-polarization properties of the Andreev reflections are interchanged. Therefore, the Fano-Rashba interferometer can be a promising candidate for differentiating the Majorana doublet from other bound states.",3
Plasmonic performance of AuxAgyCu1-x-y alloys from many-body perturbation theory.,"We present a detailed appraisal of the optical and plasmonic properties of ordered alloys of the form AuxAgyCu1-x-y, as predicted by means of first-principles many-body perturbation theory augmented by a semi-empirical Drude-Lorentz model. In benchmark simulations on elemental Au, Ag, and Cu, we find that the random-phase approximation (RPA) fails to accurately describe inter-band transitions when it is built upon semi-local approximate Kohn-Sham density-functional theory band-structures. We show that non-local electronic exchange-correlation interactions sufficient to correct this, particularly for the fully-filled, relatively narrow d-bands which contribute strongly throughout the low-energy spectral range (0-6 eV), may be modeled very expediently using band-stretching operators that imitate the effect of a perturbative [Formula: see text] self-energy correction incorporating quasiparticle (QP) mass renormalization. We thereby establish a convenient work-flow for carrying out approximated [Formula: see text] spectroscopic calculations on alloys and, in particular here, we have considered alloy concentrations down to 12.5% in [Formula: see text], including all possible crystallographic orderings of face-centred cubic type. We develop a pragmatic procedure for calculating the Drude plasmon frequency from first principles, including self-energy effects, as well as a semi-empirical scheme for interpolating the plasmon inverse lifetimes between stoichiometries. A distinctive M-shaped profile is observed in both quantities for binary alloys, in qualitative agreement with previous experimental findings. A range of optical and plasmonic figures of merit are discussed, and plotted for ordered [Formula: see text] at three representative solid-state laser wavelengths. On this basis, we predict that certain compositions may offer improved performance over elemental Au for particular application types. We predict that while the loss functions for both bulk and surface plasmons are typically diminished in strength through binary alloying, certain stoichiometric ratios may exhibit higher-quality (longer-lived) localized surface-plasmons and surface-plasmon polaritons, at technologically-relevant wavelengths, than those in elemental Au.",3
CLEASE: a versatile and user-friendly implementation of cluster expansion method.,"Materials exhibiting a substitutional disorder such as multicomponent alloys and mixed metal oxides/oxyfluorides are of great importance in many scientific and technological sectors. Disordered materials constitute an overwhelmingly large configurational space, which makes it practically impossible to be explored manually using first-principles calculations such as density functional theory due to the high computational costs. Consequently, the use of methods such as cluster expansion (CE) is vital in enhancing our understanding of the disordered materials. CE dramatically reduces the computational cost by mapping the first-principles calculation results on to a Hamiltonian which is much faster to evaluate. In this work, we present our implementation of the CE method, which is integrated as a part of the atomic simulation environment (ASE) open-source package. The versatile and user-friendly code automates the complex set up and construction procedure of CE while giving the users the flexibility to tweak the settings and to import their own structures and previous calculation results. Recent advancements such as regularization techniques from machine learning are implemented in the developed code. The code allows the users to construct CE on any bulk lattice structure, which makes it useful for a wide range of applications involving complex materials. We demonstrate the capabilities of our implementation by analyzing the two example materials with varying complexities: a binary metal alloy and a disordered lithium chromium oxyfluoride.",3
Carrier-induced antisymmetric-symmetric tendencies of spin stiffness in zigzag graphene nanoribbons.,"The generalized Bloch theorem was applied to calculate the spin stiffness and to consider its tendencies when introducing the doping in zigzag graphene nanoribbons. To reach the intentions, two different flat spin spiral formations were constructed by fixing the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic spin arrangements at the two different edges by applying a constraint scheme method. A spin stiffness was then calculated by means of a quadratic order function, which maps the total energy difference in the self-consistent calculations onto the Heisenberg Hamiltonian. We found a very high spin stiffness as predicted previously by the supercell calculation. We also showed that the antisymmetric-symmetric tendencies of spin stiffness are induced by the hole-electron doping. The dependence of ribbon widths of zigzag graphene nanoribbon on the spin stiffness was also provided with similar tendencies when the doping is taken into account.",3
In pursuit of the mechanics that shape cell surfaces.,"Robust and responsive, the surface of a cell is as important as its interior when it comes to mechanically regulating form and function. New techniques are shedding light on this role, and a common language to describe its properties is now needed.",3
Correlation effect on the electronic properties of pair-checkerboard AFM monolayer FeSe: a first-principles study.,"We presented a study of the influence of on-site Coulomb correlation U and Hund coupling J on the electronic properties of monolayer FeSe in a pair-checkerboard antiferromagnetic (PAFM) state based on Hubbard-corrected density functional theory (DFT + U). The results demonstrated the Hubbard-U have a strong influence on the electronic bands and lattice structure of monolayer FeSe in PAFM state. The in-plane lattice constant changes under U > 1.85 eV has been identified under full structure optimization. Furthermore, the Hund coupling J has significant influence on the electronic bands and exhibits a remarkable orbital selective behavior at U = 0. Additionally, our results also demonstrated the Hund coupling J has a weaker effect on electronic properties of FeSe when U gets larger. These results are useful for elucidating the possible role of correlation strength on the electronics band and magnetic ground state of monolayer FeSe.",3
Longitudinal and transverse magnetoresistance of SrTiO3 with a single closed Fermi surface.,"The magnetoresistance (MR) of SrTiO3 is theoretically investigated based on the Boltzmann equation by considering its detailed band structure. The formula for MR proposed by Mackey and Sybert is extended to be applicable to a system with an arbitrarily shaped Fermi surface. It is shown that the angular dependence of the diagonal component of the mass tensor causes transverse MR, whereas that of the off-diagonal component causes longitudinal MR with only a single closed Fermi surface, which overturns the textbook understanding of MR. The calculated MR (300% at 10 T) quantitatively agrees with the experimental results for SrTiO3 including the behavior of the linear MR. The negative Gaussian curvature of the Fermi surface of SrTiO3 and its resulting negative longitudinal and transverse MR are also discussed.",3
Tunable spin-state bistability in a spin crossover molecular complex.,"The spin crossover (SCO) transitions at both the surface and over the entire volume of the [Fe{H2B(pz)2}2(bipy)] polycrystalline films on Al2O3 substrates have been studied, where pz = pyrazol-1-yl and bipy = 2,2'-bipyridine. For [Fe{H2B(pz)2}2(bipy)] films of hundreds of nm thick, magnetometry and x-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements show thermal hysteresis in the SCO transition with temperature, although the transition in bulk [Fe{H2B(pz)2}2(bipy)] occurs in a non-hysteretic fashion at 157 K. While the size of the crystallites in those films are similar, the hysteresis becomes more prominent in thinner films, indicating a significant effect of the [Fe{H2B(pz)2}2(bipy)]/Al2O3 interface. Bistability of spin states, which can be inferred from the thermal hysteresis, was directly observed using temperature-dependent x-ray diffraction; the crystallites behave as spin-state domains that coexist during the transition. The difference between the spin state of molecules at the surface of the [Fe{H2B(pz)2}2(bipy)] films and that of the molecules within the films, during the thermal cycle, indicates that both cooperative (intermolecular) effects and coordination are implicated in perturbations to the SCO transition.",3
Optical determination of spin diffusion length and interfacial spin mixing conductance in epitaxial Pd/Fe bilayers.,"We present a detailed study of the photoinduced magnetization precession and magnetic relaxation in epitaxial Pd/Fe films on MgO(0 0 1) substrates via all-optical pump-probe techniques. We explicitly formulate the correlation between the Gilbert damping and the effective damping in the optical approach. Furthermore, a non-local Gilbert damping induced by spin pumping is demonstrated self-consistently by the Gilbert damping dependence on Pd thickness and the [Formula: see text] relationship of damping with Fe thickness [Formula: see text]. The non-local Gilbert damping enables the determination of spin diffusion length [Formula: see text] in Pd and interfacial spin mixing conductance [Formula: see text]. Our work paves the way toward the optical determination of spin transport parameters.",3
Strain-stress relationship and dislocation evolution of W-Cu bilayers from a constructed n-body W-Cu potential.,"An n-body W-Cu potential is constructed under the framework of the embedded-atom method by means of a proposed function of the cross potential. This W-Cu potential is realistic to reproduce mechanical property and structural stability of WCu solid solutions within the entire composition range, and has better performances than the three W-Cu potentials already published in the literature. Based on this W-Cu potential, molecular dynamics simulation is conducted to reveal the mechanical property and dislocation evolution of the bilayer structure between pure W and W0.7Cu0.3 solid solution. It is found that the formation of the interface improves the strength of the W0.7Cu0.3 solid solutions along tensile loading perpendicular to the interface, as the interface impedes the evolution of the dislocation lines from the W0.7Cu0.3 solid solutions to the W part. Simulation also reveals that the interface has an important effect to significantly reduce the tensile strength and critical strain of W along the tensile loading parallel to the interface, which is intrinsically due to the slip of the edge or screw dislocations at low strains as a result of the lattice mismatch.",3
Magnetic properties of the BaNi2(As1-x V x )2O8 honeycomb system.,"The Kitaev model for magnetic interactions on a honeycomb lattice, which underlies the exotic quantum spin liquid (QSL) state in such systems, has long been established and experimentally confirmed. Current studies on Kitaev QSLs have focused on heavy-metal-based Mott insulators where strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) leads to bond-dependent spin anisotropy. Here we examine a 3d transition-metal-based honeycomb lattice material BaNi2(As1-x V x )2O8, where the SOC is weak but spin exchange coupling is strongly frustrated due to the crystal field. We present an investigation of the crystal structure and magnetization of this series of Ni-based honeycomb materials, providing an alternative perspective in the search for the QSL in 3d-element-based honeycomb systems.",3
An electronic perturbation in TiC supported platinum monolayer catalyst for enhancing water-gas shift performance: DFT study.,"The water-gas shift (WGS) reaction behaviors over the TiC(0 0 1) supported Pt monolayer catalyst (PtML/TiC(0 0 1)) are investigated by using the spin-unrestricted density functional theory calculations. Importantly, we find that the PtML/TiC(0 0 1) system exhibits a much lower density of Pt-5d states nearby the Fermi level compared with that for Pt(1 1 1), and the monolayer Pt atoms undergo an electronic perturbation when in contact with TiC(0 0 1) support that would strongly improve the WGS activity of supported Pt atoms. Our calculations clearly indicate that the dominant reaction path follows a carboxyl mechanism involving a key COOH intermediate, rather than the common redox mechanism. Furthermore, through the detailed comparisons, the results demonstrate that the strong interactions between the monolayer Pt atoms and TiC(0 0 1) support make PtML/TiC(0 0 1) a highly active catalyst for the low-temperature WGS reaction. Following the route presented by Bruix et al (2012 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 134 8968-74), the positive effect derived from strong metal-support interaction in the metal/carbide system is revealed.",3
Electric field and curvature effects on relativistic Landau levels on a pseudosphere.,"In this paper relativistic Landau levels on a carbon pseudosphere, whose curvature is a negative constant K = -R (-2), are investigated analytically in the presence of orthogonal electric and magnetic fields. It has been shown that the magnetic field tends to create bound states while the electric field tends to destroy them. Consequently there exists a critical electric field such that beyond this critical field the Landau levels collapse although negative curvature of the pseudosphere acts towards preventing the collapse of Landau levels at the critical value.",3
Layer breathing and shear modes in multilayer graphene: a DFT-vdW study.,"In this work, we study structural and vibrational properties of multilayer graphene using density-functional theory with van der Waals (vdW) functionals. Initially, we analyze how different vdW functionals compare by evaluating the lattice parameters, elastic constants and vibrational frequencies of low energy optical modes of graphite. Our results indicate that the vdW-DF1-optB88 functional has the best overall performance on the description of vibrational properties. Next, we use this functional to study the influence of the vdW interactions on the structural and vibrational properties of multilayer graphene. Specifically, we evaluate binding energies, interlayer distances and phonon frequencies of layer breathing and shear modes. We observe excellent agreement between our calculated results and available experimental data, which suggests that this functional has truly predictive power for layer-breathing and shear frequencies that have not been measured yet. This indicates that careful selected vdW functionals can describe interlayer bonding in graphene-related systems with good accuracy.",3
Spontaneous dewetting of a hydrophobic micro-structured surface.,"Inspired by recent experimental observations and natural phenomena that spontaneous dewetting transition occurs on a hydrophobic micro-structured surface, a thermodynamic model of a condensed water droplet on a micro-pillar arrayed surface is established in order to disclose the mechanical mechanism. Based on a general model of an arbitrary-shaped micro-structured surface, surfaces with conical, rectangular and parabolic micro-pillars are investigated. A critical water droplet volume is found, beyond which dewetting transition can be realized. The effect of the micro-pillar's size and intrinsic contact angle on the free energy difference and critical water droplet volume are further studied. The theoretical model may provide a possible explanation for the abnormal Wenzel wetting state of condensed water droplets on lotus leaves and the anti-fogging behavior of a mosquito's compound eyes. The present results should be very useful for the biomimetic design of functional dewetting surfaces in practical applications.",3
The gapless energy spectrum and spin-Peierls instability of 1D Heisenberg spin systems in polymeric complexes of transition metals and hypothetical carbon allotropes.,"We investigate the spin-Peierls instability of some periodic 1D Heisenberg spin systems having a gapless energy spectrum at different values of coupling J between the unit cells. Using the density-matrix renormalization group method we numerically study the dependence of critical exponents p of spin-Peierls transition of above spin systems on the value of J. In contrast to chain systems, we find significantly non-monotonous dependence p (J) for three-legs ladder system. In the limit of weak coupling J we derive effective spin s chain Hamiltonians describing the low-energy states of the system considered by means of perturbation theory. The value of site spin s coincides with the value of the ground-state spin of the isolated unit cell of the system considered. This means that at small J values all the systems with the singlet ground state and the same half-integer value of s should have a similar critical behavior which is in agreement with our numerical study. The presence of gapped excitations inside the unit cells at small values of J should give, for our spin systems, at least one intermediate plateau in field dependence of magnetization at low temperatures. The stability of this plateau against the increase of the values of J and temperature is studied using the quantum Monte-Carlo method.",3
Boundary behaviour of open vesicles in axisymmetric case.,"A continuous transformation from a closed vesicle to an open vesicle requires that the area of open hole enlarges from zero. Since the shape equation and boundary conditions of lipid open vesicles with free edges have been obtained, we want to know whether this process can be achieved with valid parameters. By studying the boundary conditions in the axisymmetric case, the analytic expression of the boundary edges is obtained generally. It reveals that the radius and line tension of boundary edges are confined strongly by bending moduli. In some cases, there is the minimal nonzero boundary radius and the line tension needs to surmount the maxim following the increase of boundary radius. Without the spontaneous curvature, the line tension will trend to infinite when the boundary radius shrinks to zero. The continuous opening up process requires that the spontaneous curvature is nonzero and the ratio between the bending moduli of Gauss curvature and mean curvature satisfies [Formula: see text], which is smaller than the value [Formula: see text] from experiments and simulations. This result indicates that the opening up process is discontinuous.",3
Large-scale curvature sensing by directional actin flow drives cellular migration mode switching.,"Cell migration over heterogeneous substrates during wound healing or morphogenetic processes leads to shape changes driven by different organizations of the actin cytoskeleton and by functional changes including lamellipodial protrusions and contractile actin cables. Cells distinguish between cell-sized positive and negative curvatures in their physical environment by forming protrusions at positive ones and actin cables at negative ones; however, the cellular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we report that concave edges promote polarized actin structures with actin flow directed towards the cell edge, in contrast to well-documented retrograde flow at convex edges. Anterograde flow and contractility induce a tension anisotropy gradient. A polarized actin network is formed, accompanied by a local polymerization-depolymerization gradient, together with leading-edge contractile actin cables in the front. These cables extend onto non-adherent regions while still maintaining contact with the substrate through focal adhesions. The contraction and dynamic reorganization of this actin structure allows forward movements enabling cell migration over non-adherent regions on the substrate. These versatile functional structures may help cells sense and navigate their environment by adapting to external geometric and mechanical cues.",3
Multifunctional 2D CuSe monolayer nanodevice.,"In a very recent experimental work (Gao et al 2018 Adv. Mater. 30 1707055), a graphene-like CuSe monolayer (ML) was realized. Motivated by this success, we performed first-principles calculations to investigate its electronic transport and photoelectronic properties. We find that the CuSe ML shows a strong electrical anisotropy, and its current-voltage (I-V) curves along the zigzag and armchair directions are noticeably different. The CuSe ML also displays a useful negative differential resistance (NDR) effect along the both directions when the bias is beyond 1.0 V. Moreover, it has a large photon absorption to orange light. Our study suggests that CuSe ML is a multifunctional material and has various potential applications in electrical-anisotropy-based, NDR-based, and even optical nanodevices.",3
Ab initio study of negative electron affinity from light metals on the oxygen-terminated diamond (1 1 1) surface.,"Recent computational work has shown that light metals adsorbed onto the oxygenated diamond (1 0 0) surface have the potential to give diamond a temperature-stable negative electron affinity (NEA). Here, we use density functional theory to study three of these metals, lithium, magnesium and aluminium, on the (1 1 1) surface. We show that all three of these metals adsorbed onto the ketone O-terminated diamond surface can possess a large NEA and adsorption energies above that of H-termination at monolayer (ML) or sub-ML coverages. Adsorption onto the ether O-terminated surface gives similarly large NEAs but lower adsorption energies. These results are promising for the development of novel NEA surfaces such as those required for thermionic devices.",3
van der Waals exchange-correlation functionals over bulk and surface properties of transition metals.,"The correct description of van der Waals (vdW) interaction forces is required for accurately describing dispersion bonded systems. Several approaches have been proposed to include London dispersion in density functional theory exchange-correlation functionals, where the family of so-called van der Waals (vdW-DF) exchange-correlation functionals have shown a better performance than local or semi local exchange-correlation functionals for describing molecular adsorption on metals. Despite the numerous benchmarks performed with these functionals, their performance in predicting bulk properties of transition metals has hitherto not been investigated in detail. We have therefore tested five vdW-DF exchange-correlation functionals, vdW-DF2, optPBE-vdW, BEEF-vdW, optB88-vdW and C09 x -vdW to assess their performance in the prediction of lattice constants, bulk moduli, cohesive energies and surface energies of bulk Ni, Cu, Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir, Pt and Au (in fcc crystal structure). These transition metals are commonly used for benchmarking density functionals because they are important for applications in catalysis. The results are compared with experimental data and the PBE exchange-correlation functional. We found that both the optB88-vdW and the C09 x -vdW exchange-correlation functionals estimate all properties with high accuracy, in better agreement with experimental data than PBE and other considered vdW functionals. The C09 x -vdW functional clearly outperforms all other exchange-correlation functionals for surface energies for the (1 1 1) termination of different metals. We have also evaluated the interatomic electron density emerging from different functionals, and concluded that the observed differences are a result of the predicted lattice parameter, rather than a direct consequence of the functional form. Plane-wave and real-space grid-based expansions of the electron density are also compared, revealing good agreement between the two approaches for lattice parameters, cohesive energies, and surface energies, but more severe differences in bulk moduli. On the basis of our results, we recommend using the C09 x -vdW for studying bulk properties and surface energies of transition metals.",3
Electric field driven multi-state magnetization switching in triangular nanomagnets on piezoelectric substrate.,"Electric field control of magnetic state switching mediated by magneto-elastic coupling in multiferroic heterostructures consisting of shape anisotropic magnetostrictive nanomagnets elastically coupled with a piezoelectric substrate has a promising potential for next generation magneto-elastic memory and logic devices. In this work, by using micromagnetic simulation, we showed that localized strain-induced magnetic anisotropy caused by the electric field-induced piezostrain combined with strong multifold shape anisotropy effect can be used for achieving a multistate switching of magnetization in a triangular soft magnetic nano-island on a piezoelectric substrate. A piezostrain-induced uniaxial magnetic anisotropy pulse applied in specific directions switches the magnetization within the triangular nanomagnet by an angle of 60 degrees from the initial state. The relation between critical magnitude of the strain pulse for the switching of the magnetization states and geometric parameters (thickness and lateral size) within the triangular nanomagnets has been worked out. Complete cycles of clockwise as well as counter-clockwise switching of the magnetization states of the triangular nanomagnet have been achieved by a series of sequential switching with different directions of applied strain-induced magnetic anisotropy. This local gating scheme-based multistate switching can be used for electric field-induced ultra-fast, deterministic and reversible magnetization switching which are the key challenges in designing of the magnetoelastic and/or magnetoelectric memory and logic devices.",3
Crystal field coefficients for yttrium analogues of rare-earth/transition-metal magnets using density-functional theory in the projector-augmented wave formalism.,"We present a method of calculating crystal field coefficients of rare-earth/transition-metal (RE-TM) magnets within density-functional theory (DFT). The principal idea of the method is to calculate the crystal field potential of the yttrium analogue ('Y-analogue') of the RE-TM magnet, i.e. the material where the lanthanide elements have been substituted with yttrium. The advantage of dealing with Y-analogues is that the methodological and conceptual difficulties associated with treating the highly-localized 4f electrons in DFT are avoided, whilst the nominal valence electronic structure principally responsible for the crystal field is preserved. In order to correctly describe the crystal field potential in the core region of the atoms we use the projector-augmented wave formalism of DFT, which allows the reconstruction of the full charge density and electrostatic potential. The Y-analogue crystal field potentials are combined with radial 4f charge densities obtained in self-interaction-corrected calculations on the lanthanides to obtain crystal field coefficients. We demonstrate our method on a test set of ten materials comprising nine RE-TM magnets and elemental Tb. We show that the calculated easy directions of magnetization agree with experimental observations, including a correct description of the anisotropy within the basal plane of Tb and NdCo5. We further show that the Y-analogue calculations generally agree quantitatively with previous calculations using the open-core approximation to treat the 4f electrons, and argue that our simple approach may be useful for large-scale computational screening of new magnetic materials.",3
Binding potentials for vapour nanobubbles on surfaces using density functional theory.,"We calculate density profiles of a simple model fluid in contact with a planar surface using density functional theory (DFT), in particular for the case where there is a vapour layer intruding between the wall and the bulk liquid. We apply the method of Hughes et al (2015 J. Chem. Phys. 142 074702) to calculate the density profiles for varying (specified) amounts of the vapour adsorbed at the wall. This is equivalent to varying the thickness h of the vapour at the surface. From the resulting sequence of density profiles we calculate the thermodynamic grand potential as h is varied and thereby determine the binding potential as a function of h. The binding potential obtained via this coarse-graining approach allows us to determine the disjoining pressure in the film and also to predict the shape of vapour nano-bubbles on the surface. Our microscopic DFT based approach captures information from length scales much smaller than some commonly used models in continuum mechanics.",3
Optical and electrical properties of MoO2 and MoO3 thin films prepared from the chemically driven isothermal close space vapor transport technique.,"Chemically-driven isothermal close space vapour transport was used to prepare pure MoO2 thin films which were eventually converted to MoO3 by annealing in air. According to temperature-dependent Raman measurements, the MoO2/MoO3 phase transformation was found to occur in the 225 degrees C-350 degrees C range while no other phases were detected during the transition. A clear change in composition as well as noticeable modifications of the band gap and the absorption coefficient confirmed the conversion from MoO2 to MoO3. An extensive characterization of these two pure phases was carried out. In particular, a procedure was developed to determine the dispersion relation of the refractive index of MoO2 from the shift of the interference fringes of the used SiO2/Si substrate. The obtained data of the refractive index was corrected taking into account the porosity of the samples calculated from elastic backscattering spectrometry. The Debye temperature and the residual resistivity were extracted from the electrical resistivity temperature dependence using the Bloch-Gruneisen equation. MoO3 converted samples presented a very high resistivity and a typical semiconducting behavior. They also showed intense and broad luminescence spectra composed by several contributions whose temperature behavior was examined. Furthermore, surface photovoltage spectra were taken and their relation with the photoluminescence is discussed.",3
Prediction of colossal magnetocrystalline anisotropy for transition metal triiodides.,"In virtue of first principle calculations based on density functional theory, we have investigated the magnetism of transition metal triiodides XI3 (X = Cr, Mn, Fe, Mo, Tc, Ru, W, Re, Os) monolayers. Our results indicate that CrI3, TcI3, RuI3, ReI3 and OsI3 monolayers are ferromagnetic (FM), while MnI3, FeI3, MoI3 and WI3 monolayers are antiferromagnetic (AFM). Interestingly, TcI3, RuI3, ReI3 and OsI3 monolayers have considerable magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE). Especially, ReI3 monolayer exhibits the largest MAE (-36.22 meV/ReI3) in known two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) crystals. We further demonstrate that biaxial strain can greatly change MAEs of ReI3 and OsI3 monolayers. From the electronic structure analysis, the change in MAE is mainly attributed from the charge transfer between the a and e 2 states induced by biaxial strain. In addition, we have also found that a tensile strain can lead to a phase transition of ReI3 from FM to AFM. We predicted that 2D FM XI3 monolayers are promising candidates for the application in tunable magnetic storage technology.",3
A computational study on the effect of minor yttrium on the interfacial adherence of Al oxide film to aluminum substrate.,"It is well documented that minor rare-earth can improve interfacial adherence of oxide films to passive metallic substrates. However, such benefit vanishes when the amount of rare-earth increases. The mechanism for such a change has never been well clarified. This article reports our ab initio calculations to investigate the role that yttrium plays in promoting the interfacial adherence of Al oxide film to Al substrate. Influences of Y(3+)-ions on Al2O3/Al interfacial bonding, strength of Y-doped Al2O3 layer and that of Y-contained Al substrate were analyzed. Efforts are made to elucidate the beneficial effect of minor yttrium on the interfacial bonding and how an opposite effect is caused as the amount of yttrium increases.",3
Oxygen vacancies and hydrogen doping in LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures: electronic properties and impact on surface and interface reconstruction.,"We investigate the effect of oxygen vacancies and hydrogen dopants at the surface and inside slabs of [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text]/[Formula: see text] heterostructures on the electronic properties by means of electronic structure calculations as based on density functional theory. Depending on the concentration, the presence of these defects in a [Formula: see text] slab can suppress the surface conductivity. In contrast, in insulating [Formula: see text] slabs already very small concentrations of oxygen vacancies or hydrogen dopant atoms induce a finite occupation of the conduction band. Surface defects in insulating [Formula: see text]/[Formula: see text] heterostructure slabs with three [Formula: see text] overlayers lead to the emergence of interface conductivity. Calculated defect formation energies reveal strong preference of hydrogen dopant atoms for surface sites for all structures and concentrations considered. Strong decrease of the defect formation energy of hydrogen adatoms with increasing thickness of the [Formula: see text] overlayer and crossover from positive to negative values, taken together with the metallic conductivity induced by hydrogen adatoms, seamlessly explains the semiconductor-metal transition observed for these heterostructures as a function of the overlayer thickness. Moreover, we show that the potential drop and concomitant shift of (layer resolved) band edges is suppressed for the metallic configuration. Finally, magnetism with stable local moments, which form atomically thin magnetic layers at the interface, is generated by oxygen vacancies either at the surface or the interface, or by hydrogen atoms buried at the interface. In particular, oxygen vacancies in the [Formula: see text] interface layer cause drastic downshift of the 3d e g states of the Ti atoms neighboring the vacancies, giving rise to strongly localized magnetic moments, which add to the two-dimensional background magnetization.",3
Broken cubic symmetry driven co-emergence of type-I and type-II Dirac points in topological crystalline insulator ThTaN3.,"ThTaN3 is known as a rare cubic perovskite nitride topological crystalline insulator (TCI). Here, we propose, using first-principles calculations, that compressive uniaxial (0 0 1) strained ThTaN3 can host a three dimensional nodal-chain semimetal state when spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is ignored. When SOC is turned on, the nodal-chain is gapped out, resulting in a pair of type-II Dirac points as protected by C 4 crystal symmetry. Intriguingly, under an increasing compressive uniaxial (0 0 1) strain, a new pair of type-I Dirac points emerges, realizing a novel Dirac semimetal that hosts both type-I and type-II Dirac points in momentum space. The electronic structures of the projected surfaces are also discussed, and the unique Fermi arcs are observed. Our results make ThTaN3 a promising platform for experimental realization of multiple types of Dirac fermions in a single material system.",3
Surface plasmon polaritons in thin-film Weyl semimetals.,"We theoretically investigate surface plasmon polaritons propagating in the thin-film Weyl semimetals. We show how the properties of surface plasmon polaritons are affected by hybridization between plasmons localized at the two metal-dielectric interfaces. Generally, this hybridization results in new mixed plasmon modes, which are called short-range surface plasmons and long-range surface plasmons, respectively. We calculate dispersion curves of these mixed modes for three principle configurations of the axion vector describing axial anomaly in Weyl semimetals. We show that the partial lack of the dispersion and the non-reciprocity can be controlled by fine-tuning of the thickness of the Weyl semimetals, the dielectric constants of the outer insulators, and the direction of the axion vector.",3
Observation of magnetoelastic and magnetoelectric coupling in Sc doped BaFe12O19 due to spin-glass-like phase.,"The present work reports magnetic, magnetoelastic and magnetoelectric (ME) response of scandium (Sc) doped barium hexaferrite, BaFe10Sc2O19. DC magnetization shows that partial substitution of non-magnetic Sc for Fe in barium hexaferrite results in a reduction of Curie temperature (T C) from 730 K known for the parent compound BaFe12O19 to 430 K. Magnetization measurements show that, in BaFe10Sc2O19, in addition to the magnetic transition at 250 K corresponding to longitudinal conical magnetic structure, another magnetic anomaly occurs in the vicinity of 50 K (T max). Ac susceptibility and magnetic relaxation show that the magnetic transition at T max is associated with spin glass like dynamics. Field dependence of this glassy transition temperature follows the Almeida-Thouless (A-T) line expected for spin glass-like behaviour. Unit cell volume obtained from the neutron diffraction (ND) measurements shows deviation from the Debye-Gruneisen behaviour below 50 K, revealing the magnetoelastic coupling. Existence of magnetoelastic coupling is also confirmed by Raman spectra as Raman modes show anomalous changes around 50 K and also indicates presence of lattice modulation. Further, the magnetic structure obtained from ND data shows that incommensurate longitudinal conical ferrimagnetic structure persists from 210 K to 3 K. The integrated intensity of (0 0 2) peak and magnetic moments undergoes a subtle change below 50 K that seems to favour coexistence of long range magnetic ordering and spin glass-like dynamics. Significant magneto-dielectric effect was observed around 50 K. Temperature dependent studies of dielectric constant and pyroelectric current indicate the presence of ferroelectricity even in zero magnetic field. Further, existence of ME coupling below 50 K is confirmed by temperature dependence of pyroelectric current under magnetic fields up to 70 kOe. In short, this work identifies a new magnetic anomaly around 50 K, which is spin-glass-like inducing magnetoelastic and ME anomalies, even in the absence of external magnetic fields.",3
Effective detection of spatio-temporal carrier dynamics by carrier capture.,"The spatio-temporal dynamics of electrons moving in a 2D plane is challenging to detect when the required resolution shrinks simultaneously to nanometer length and subpicosecond time scale. We propose a detection scheme relying on phonon-induced carrier capture from 2D unbound states into the bound states of an embedded quantum dot. This capture process happens locally and here we explore if this locality is sufficient to use the carrier capture process as detection of the ultrafast diffraction of electrons from an obstacle in the 2D plane. As an example we consider an electronic wave packet traveling in a semiconducting monolayer of the transition metal dichalcogenide MoSe2, and we study the scattering-induced dynamics using a single particle Lindblad approach. Our results offer a new way to high resolution detection of the spatio-temporal carrier dynamics.",3
The coupling effects of surface plasmons and Fermi arc plasmons in Weyl semimetals.,We study the effects of coupling between surface plasmon and Fermi arc plasmon modes on a planar surface of the Weyl semimetal. A model Hamiltonian is proposed in the second quantization representation for the system of coupled surface plasmon and Fermi arc plasmon modes. We obtain the dispersion relations of coupled modes using the Bogoliubov transformation technique. We identify the upper coupled mode as the renormalized surface plasmon and the lower coupled mode as the renormalized Fermi arc plasmon. It is shown how the magnitude of the coupling depends on both the bare mode dispersions and their dampings. We also demonstrate that coupling increases the surface plasmon mode lifetime. Obtained results for the surface plasmon mode are qualitatively consistent with the recent experimental data of Weyl semimetals.,3
Half-metallic fully compensated ferrimagnetism and multifunctional spin transport properties of Mn3Al.,"The complete (100%) spin polarization, zero net magnetic moment and high Curie temperature (605 K) make the recently fabricated half-metallic fully compensated ferrimagnet Mn3Al a promising spintronic material. In order to explore the potential applications in spintronic devices, in this work, we give a theoretical analysis for the Mn3Al/GaAs(0 0 1) heterostructure and the Mn3Al/GaAs/Mn3Al(0 0 1) magnetic tunnel junction. Using the first-principles calculations combined with nonequilibrium Green's function method, we demonstrate from the calculated bias-dependent spin transport properties that the heterostructure exhibits perfect spin filtering effect and spin diode effect, and the magnetic tunnel junction behaves a large tunnel magnetoresistance ratio (up to 10 900%). The physical origins of these versatile spin transport properties are discussed in terms of the half-metallic band structure, the spin-dependent transmission spectra and the band-to-band transmission theory.",3
Stress-sign-tunable Poisson's ratio in monolayer blue phosphorus oxide.,"Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) materials have attracted tremendous interest due to their unusual physical properties and potential applications. Certain two-dimensional (2D) monolayer materials have also been found to exhibit NPR and the corresponding deformation mechanism varies. In this study, we found, based on first-principles calculations, that the Poisson's ratio (PR) sign of monolayer blue phosphorus oxide (BPO) can be tuned by strain: the PR is positive under uniaxial strain [Formula: see text] but becomes negative under [Formula: see text] > 0. The deformation mechanism for BPO under strain depends on the mutual competition between the P-P attraction and P-O repulsion effect, and these two factors induce two different deformation pathways (one with positive PR, and the other with NPR). Moreover, with increasing of strain, both the decreased strength of P-P attraction and the increased strength of P-O repulsion effect modulates the PR of BPO from positive to negative.",3
Interface induced enhancement of inverse spin Hall voltage in NiFe/Pt bilayers capped by MgO layer.,"In ferromagnet/heavy metal bilayers, a spin current can be generated under the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) condition, and then converted into a charge current in adjacent nonmagnetic metals through inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE). Here, we report an experimental observation of interface induced ISHE enhancement in NiFe/Pt bilayers covered by MgO layer. Compared to bare NiFe/Pt bilayers, Pt/MgO interface induces an enhancement of the spin-charge conversion in the NiFe/Pt/MgO trilayers with very thin Pt layers, in agreement with the corresponding trend of Gilbert damping enhancement. When the thickness of Pt is below 1.6 nm, the ISHE induced charge current has about 70% enhancement. These results open a new pathway to improve the spin-charge conversion efficiency by interface engineering.",3
A self-consistent investigation of the topological state in the Ising superconductors.,"By self-consistently solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations, we investigate the superconductivity, the magnetization and the local density-of-state (DOS) of the Ising superconductor. The calculations show that the Ising spin orbital coupling is responsible for the anisotropic behaviors of the Ising superconductor in response to the external magnetic field. In the absence of the magnetic impurities, only opposite spin triplet superconducting (SC) pairing correlations can be induced from the intrinsic on-site singlet SC pairing. The equal spin triplet SC correlations can be induced when a magnetic impurity chain with in-plane spin direction is deposited on the Ising superconductor. The chain could support a pair of Majorana Fermions, which are originated from the induced 1-dimensional equal spin triplet SC pairing correlations. The local DOS for the Majorana Fermion states exhibits an excellent agreement with the experimental observations. The low energy spectrum as a function of the exchange coupling strength forms two hourglass shapes. The waist of the hourglass may serves as a boundary to separate the zero energy crossings of the two lowest energy levels into topologically trivial and non-trivial quantum states. These results not only account for the experimental observations in a realistic way, but also clarify several important questions in the studies of the Ising superconductors.",3
From networks to optimal higher-order models of complex systems.,"Rich data is revealing that complex dependencies between the nodes of a network may escape models based on pairwise interactions. Higher-order network models go beyond these limitations, offering new perspectives for understanding complex systems.",3
Lateral scaling and positioning effects of top-gate electrodes on single-molecule field-effect transistors.,"Molecular electronics aims at integrating controllable molecular devices into circuits or machines to realize certain functions. According to device configuration, molecular field-effect transistors with top-gate electrodes have great advantages for integration. Nevertheless, from technical aspects, it is difficult to control lateral scale and position of a top-gate electrode precisely. Therefore, one problem arises in how lateral scaling and positioning effects of a top-gate electrode affect device performance. To solve this problem, the electronic transport properties of single-molecule field-effect transistor configurations modulated by a series of partial-scale top-gate electrodes with different lateral scales and positions are studied by using non-equilibrium Green's function in combination with density functional theory, and compared with those of the full gate electrode (can be considered as a bottom gate electrode). The results show that lateral scaling and positioning effects indeed have a great impact on electronic transport properties of single-molecule field-effect transistor configurations. For [Formula: see text]-saturated 1,12-dodecanedithiol devices, larger lateral scale of a partial-scale top-gate electrode obtains larger amplification coefficient [Formula: see text] (ratio of device conductances with/without a gate electrode), and even larger [Formula: see text] than that of the full gate electrode. While lateral positioning effect has little influence on this device. For [Formula: see text]-conjugated 1,3,5,7,9,11-dodehexaene-1,12-dithiol devices, performance of a partial-scale top-gate electrode mainly depends on locations of its two edges, i.e. the number of [Formula: see text] bonds that it breaks. These results will provide theoretical directions in device designing and manufacturing in the future.",3
Excitation of coherent optical phonons in iron garnet by femtosecond laser pulses.,"We employed femtosecond pump-probe technique to investigate the dynamics of coherent optical phonons in iron garnet. A phenomenological symmetry-based consideration reveals that oscillations of the terahertz T 2g mode are excited. Selective excitation by a linearly polarized pump and detection by a circularly polarized probe confirm that impulsive stimulated Raman scattering (ISRS) is the driving force for the coherent phonons. Experimental results obtained from ISRS measurements reveal excellent agreement with spontaneous Raman spectroscopy data, analyzed by considering the symmetry of the phonon modes and corresponding excitation and detection selection rules.",3
Phase transformations in Pt/Fe bilayers during post annealing probed by resistometry.,"X-ray diffraction (XRD), secondary neutral mass spectrometry (SNMS) depth profiling, and electrical resistivity measurements were used to follow the phase transformations in Pt/Fe bi-layered thin films during annealing. Initially, the electrical resistivity increases linearly with temperature up to 150 degrees C due to the contribution of phonon scattering of the metallic Pt and Fe bilayer. Further increase of the annealing temperature leads to a steeper linear increase, which is associated with the initial formation of the chemically disordered A1-phase followed by the formation of the chemically ordered L10-FePt phase, as confirmed by XRD and SNMS studies. Finally, at about 620 degrees C the single L10-FePt phase has formed throughout the film. Moreover, the electrical resistivity contains also the magnetic contribution to the total resistivity. In this case, the loss in magnetic order is indicated by a change in temperature dependence of the resistivity at about 310 degrees C, representing the Curie temperature of the initially formed A1-FePt alloy, while the finally formed L10-FePt alloy reveals a higher magnetic transition temperature of about 410 degrees C. In this study, it has been demonstrated that resistometry in combination with structural and chemical analysis provides valuable information on diffusion processes, structural phase formations and its stability range, as well as on the magnetic transition temperature.",3
Pseudo-fragment approach for extended systems derived from linear-scaling DFT.,"We present a computational approach which is tailored for reducing the complexity of the description of extended systems at the density functional theory level. We define a recipe for generating a set of localized basis functions which are optimized either for the accurate description of pristine, bulk-like Wannier functions, or for the in situ treatment of deformations induced by defective constituents such as boundaries or impurities. Our method enables one to identify the regions of an extended system which require dedicated optimization of the Kohn-Sham degrees of freedom, and provides the user with a reliable estimation of the errors-if any-induced by the locality of the approach. Such a method facilitates on the one hand an effective reduction of the computational degrees of freedom needed to simulate systems at the nanoscale, while in turn providing a description that can be straightforwardly put in relation to effective models, like tight binding Hamiltonians. We present our methodology with SiC nanotube-like cages as a test bed. Nonetheless, the wavelet-based method employed in this paper makes possible calculation of systems with different dimensionalities, including slabs and fully periodic systems.",3
Influence of the magnon-phonon relaxation in the magnon transport under thermal gradient in yttrium iron garnet.,"We investigate the influence of the magnon-phonon relaxation processes in the magnon transport under thermal gradient in the ferrimagnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet (YIG). Based on the Boltzmann equation we calculate the magnon contribution in the thermal conductivity in YIG and the longitudinal spin Seebeck effect in YIG/Pt films, including the influence of the magnon relaxation to the lattice through a phenomenological damping parameter. Our results are in good agreement with reported experimental data showing that besides the magnon-magnon relaxation processes, the magnon-phonon relaxation plays an important role in the thermal properties in YIG films.",3
Hubbard excitons in two-dimensional nanomaterials.,Excitons in two-dimensional nanomaterials are studied by solving the many-electron Hamiltonian with a configuration-interaction approach. It is shown that graphene or phosphorene nanoflakes can not accommodate any excitonic bound states if the long-range Coulomb interaction is suppressed when the systems are placed in a high-k dielectric environment or on a metal substrate. Hence it is revealed that an electron-hole pair created by an optical excitation does not always form an exciton even in a confined nanostructure. The negative exciton binding energy is found to exhibit distinct dependence on the strength of short-range Coulomb interaction as the system undergoes a phase transition from non-magnetic to anti-ferromagnetic. It is further shown that the electron-hole pair may form an exciton state only when the long-range Coulomb interaction is recovered in the nanoflakes.,3
Magnetism study on a triangular lattice antiferromagnet Cu2(OH)3Br.,"Magnetism of Cu2(OH)3Br single crystals based on a triangular lattice is studied by means of magnetic susceptibility, pulsed-field magnetization, and specific heat measurements. There are two inequivalent Cu(2+) sites in an asymmetric unit. Both Cu(2+) sublattices undergo a long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM) order at [Formula: see text] K. Upon cooling, an anisotropy crossover from Heisenberg to XY behavior is observed below 7.5 K from the anisotropic magnetic susceptibility. The magnetic field applied within the XY plane induces a spin-flop transition of Cu(2+) ions between 4.9 T and 5.3 T. With further increasing fields, the magnetic moment is gradually increased but is only about half of the saturation of a Cu(2+) ion even in 30 T. The individual reorientation of the inequivalent Cu(2+) spins under field is proposed to account for the magnetization behavior. The observed spin-flop transition is likely related to one Cu site, and the AFM coupling among the rest Cu spins is so strong that the 30 T field cannot overcome the anisotropy. The temperature dependence of the magnetic specific heat, which is well described by a sum of two gapped AFM contributions, is a further support for the proposed scenario.",3
Magnetic and transport properties of Zr1-x Nb x Co2Sn.,"ZrCo2Sn is a potential candidate as a Weyl semimetal with a ferromagnetic ground state, and Nb-doping is expected to shift the Weyl points to the vicinity of Fermi level. We successfully synthesized a series of Zr1-x Nb x Co2Sn single crystals with various concentrations of Nb (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.275, 0.4, 0.5). All samples have a spinel structure and the lattice constant decrease as the Nb doping level increases. The magnetization and transport measurements suggest that the ferromagnetic ordering temperature can be strongly modified by the Nb doping. When x increases, the Curie temperature decreases significantly, accompanied by a change from metal-like to semiconductor-like behavior. There is a crossover for positive to negative MR at a temperature between 30 K to 50 K. In constant, the magnitude of the anomalous Hall resistance increases monotonously with decreasing temperature.",3
Effects of uniaxial tensile strain on the electron-phonon scattering limited carrier mobility in an n-type monolayer MoS2 at room temperature: first-principles calculations.,"In the present work, we theoretically study the strain effect on the room temperature mobility (RTM) of a n-type Monolayer MoS2 limited by electron-phonon (e-ph) scattering. Our numerical results indicate that the RTM along zigzag direction of such a 2D material can be efficiently modulated by a uniaxial tensile strain. Such an RTM, denoted as [Formula: see text], has a sizable reduction (enhancement) as a moderate tensile strain is applied in a parallel (perpendicular) direction. For example, when the strain strength amounts to 7%, [Formula: see text] the two distinct cases of the strain applied in x and y directions differ from each other by roughly two times. In contrast, the RTM in armchair direction is not so sensitive to a tensile strain. The underlying mechanism for such a strain effect on the mobility is then analysed in depth. Our results are obtained completely on the level of first-principles calculations, free from any empirical simplifications. Therefore, our above findings provide reliable and detailed information for experimentally manipulating the RTM of a n-type monolayer MoS2 by simply stretching the sample.",3
Disorder-induced localisation and suppression of superconductivity in YSr2Cu3O6+x.,"By means of ab initio calculations within the local density approximation to density functional theory, we investigate the electronic structure of the 60 K superconductor YSr2Cu3O6+x (YSCO). We focus on the effects of the Sr/Ba substitution and on the main structural modifications induced by this substitution experimentally found in the Sr compound, namely the tetragonal symmetry and the oxygen disorder in the basal plane. In the calculations, this disorder is simulated by using a supercell approach. Due to band structure effects, we find a larger stabilisation free energy of the orthorhombic structure in YBa2Cu3O6+x (YBCO). In YSCO, the tetragonal disordered phase is found to be stabilized by oxygen overdoping (x > 1) and by sufficiently large mass-enhancement factors, [Formula: see text]. The analysis of the atomic site projected density of states suggests that oxygen disorder in the CuO basal planes of YSCO induces hole localisation, which accounts for the large 30 K reduction of [Formula: see text] with respect to YBCO.",3
Quantum interference of Josephson current in topological Anderson insulator junctions.,"We investigate the critical supercurrent in Josephson junctions consisting of topological Anderson insulators (TAIs) via the Matsubara Green's function formalism. Our numerical results show that the disorder-induced edge states display distinct differences in dominating normal and supercurrent transport in the TAI phase. Unlike the hallmark of the TAI phase which exhibits a quantized conductance plateau, the critical supercurrent over the disorder strength exhibits a peak structure where the maximum value is reached at the weak-disorder boundary of the TAI phase. Although the magnitude of the averaged critical supercurrent is suppressed with increasing disorder strength, periodic oscillations of the supercurrent on an external magnetic flux survive in the TAI phase. These findings indicate that the supercurrent quantum interference effect can be an effective probe in detecting the emergence of disorder-induced edge state in TAIs.",3
Manipulating the particle-hole symmetry of quasiparticle bound states in geometric-size-varying Fe clusters on one-unit-cell FeSe/SrTiO3(0 0 1).,"The particle-hole symmetry (PHS) of quasiparticle bound states, which is generally expected in theory, is present or absent experimentally in a seemingly irregular manner, with the physical origin little understood yet. Here, we report a study on the bound states induced by Fe clusters with different sizes on one-unit-cell (1-UC) FeSe/SrTiO3(0 0 1) by in situ scanning tunneling spectroscopy. Statistically, on the larger-scale cluster, a pair of bias-symmetric minipeaks are detected within the superconducting-gap energies. As increasing temperature, the minipeak states show negligible energy dispersion. The temperature-independent bias-symmetric minipeaks are identified as the quasiparticle bound states that preserve the PHS. However, on the smaller-scale cluster, the bound state appears as a single resonance instead. These results reveal a geometric-size-tuning effect of the PHS, which may help reconcile the contradiction between the superconductivity theory and the PHS-breaking experiments.",3
Many-body perturbation theory calculations using the yambo code.,"yambo is an open source project aimed at studying excited state properties of condensed matter systems from first principles using many-body methods. As input, yambo requires ground state electronic structure data as computed by density functional theory codes such as Quantum ESPRESSO and Abinit. yambo's capabilities include the calculation of linear response quantities (both independent-particle and including electron-hole interactions), quasi-particle corrections based on the GW formalism, optical absorption, and other spectroscopic quantities. Here we describe recent developments ranging from the inclusion of important but oft-neglected physical effects such as electron-phonon interactions to the implementation of a real-time propagation scheme for simulating linear and non-linear optical properties. Improvements to numerical algorithms and the user interface are outlined. Particular emphasis is given to the new and efficient parallel structure that makes it possible to exploit modern high performance computing architectures. Finally, we demonstrate the possibility to automate workflows by interfacing with the yambopy and AiiDA software tools.",3
Gd2Te3: an antiferromagnetic semimetal.,"We report high-precision magnetization ([Formula: see text]), magnetic susceptibility ([Formula: see text]), specific heat (C p (T, H)) and 'zero-field' electrical resistivity, [Formula: see text], data taken on Gd2Te3 single crystal over wide ranges of temperature and magnetic field (H), with either [Formula: see text]-axis or [Formula: see text]-plane. [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] unambiguously establish that the b-axis is the easy direction of magnetization whereas any direction in the ac-plane is a hard direction. The [Formula: see text]-type anomaly in 'zero-field' specific heat, C p (T, H = 0), and an abrupt drop in [Formula: see text] (characteristic of the paramagnetic (PM) - antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase transition) are observed at the Neel temperature, [Formula: see text] K. [Formula: see text] and C p (T,H) clearly demonstrate that [Formula: see text] shifts to lower temperatures with increasing H irrespective of whether H points in the easy or hard direction. When [Formula: see text], the [Formula: see text] isotherms at temperatures in the range 2.5 K [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] K reveal the existence of a field-induced spin-flop (SF) transition at fields 4.0 T [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] 4.5 T. The first principles electronic band structure and density of states calculations, based on the density functional theory, correctly predict an AFM ground state (stabilized primarily by the 4f Gd(3+) - 5p Te(2-)- 4f Gd(3+) superexchange interactions) and the observed semi-metallic behavior for the Gd2Te3 compound. Moreover, these calculations yield the values [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] for the ordered magnetic moment per Gd atom at T = 0, [Formula: see text] mJ mol(-1) K(-2) for the Sommerfeld coefficient for the electronic specific heat contribution and [Formula: see text] K for the Curie-Weiss temperature, respectively. These theoretical estimates conform well with the corresponding experimental values [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] mJ mol(-1) K(-2) and [Formula: see text] K.",3
Conduction mechanism and switchable photovoltaic effect in (1 1 1) oriented BiFe0.95Mn0.05O3 thin film.,"Epitaxial 200 nm BiFe0.95Mn0.05O3 (BFO) film was grown by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on (1 1 1) oriented SrTiO3 substrate buffered with a 50 nm thick SrRuO3 electrode. The BFO thin film shows a rhombohedral structure and a large remnant polarization of Pr = 104 microC cm(-2). By comparing I(V) characteristics with different conduction models we reveal the presence of both bulk limited Poole-Frenkel and Schottky interface mechanisms and each one dominates in a specific range of temperature. At room temperature (RT) and under 10 mW laser illumination, the as grown BFO film presents short-circuit current density (J sc) and open circuit voltage (V oc) of 2.25 mA cm(-2) and -0.55 V respectively. This PV effect can be switched by applying positive voltage pulses higher than the coercive field. For low temperatures a large V oc value of about -4.5 V (-225 kV cm(-1)) is observed which suggests a bulk non-centrosymmetric origin of the PV response.",3
Topological electronic structure and Rashba effect in Bi thin layers: theoretical predictions and experiments.,"The goal of the present review is to cross-compare theoretical predictions with selected experimental results on bismuth thin films exhibiting topological properties and a strong Rashba effect. The theoretical prediction that a single free-standing Bi(1 1 1) bilayer is a topological insulator has triggered a large series of studies of ultrathin Bi(1 1 1) films grown on various substrates. Using selected examples we review theoretical predictions of atomic and electronic structure of Bi thin films exhibiting topological properties due to interaction with a substrate. We also survey experimental signatures of topological surface states and Rashba effect, as obtained mostly by angle- and spin-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy.",3
Magnetocaloric effects from an interplay of magnetic sublattices in Nd2NiMnO6.,"We present a combined experimental and theoretical study to understand the magnetism and magnetocaloric behavior of the double perovskite Nd2NiMnO6. The magnetic susceptibility data confirms a ferromagnetic transition with [Formula: see text] K. An additional feature at T = 25 K, indicative of antiferromagnetic correlations, is present. A positive magnetocaloric effect (MCE) near [Formula: see text] and a negative MCE around T = 25 K is inferred from the temperature dependence of the change in magnetic entropy at low magnetic fields. The negative MCE peak is suppressed on the application of a magnetic field and can be made to switch to a conventional positive MCE upon increasing magnetic field. We understand and reproduce these features in Monte Carlo simulations of a phenomenological Heisenberg model for Nd2NiMnO6. The validity of the model is tested using density functional theory calculations. We argue that this simple understanding of the experimental observations in terms of two antiferromagnetically coupled sublattices allows these results to be useful across a broader class of magnetocaloric materials.",3
Tight-binding model for electronic structure of hexagonal boron phosphide monolayer and bilayer.,"Graphene-like hexagonal boron phosphide with its moderate band gap and high carrier mobility is considered to be a high potential material for electronics and optoelectronics. In this work, the tight-binding Hamiltonian of hexagonal boron phosphide monolayer and bilayer with two stacking orders are derived in detail. Including up to fifth-nearest-neighbor in plane and next-nearest-neighbor interlayer hoppings, the tight-binding approximated band structure can well reproduce the first-principle calculations based on the screened Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof hybrid functional level over the entire Brillouin zone. The band gap deviations for monolayer and bilayer between our tight-binding and first-principle results are only 2 meV. The low-energy effective Hamiltonian matrix and band structure are obtained by expanding the full band structure close to the K point. The results show that the iso-energetic lines of maximum valence band in the vicinity of K point undergo a pseudo-Lifshitz transition from h-BP monolayer to AB_B-P or AB_B-B bilayer. The mechanism of pseudo-Lifshitz transition can be attributed to two interlayer hoppings rather than one.",3
DFT calculations of energetic stability and geometry of O-terminated B- and N-doped diamond (1 1 1)-1 x 1 surfaces.,"The non- and O-terminated diamond (1 1 1)-1 x 1 surfaces, with the substitutional B (or N) dopants in different atomic layers, have been modelled in the present study. The influences of the O adsorbates, dopant and dopant position on the adsorption energy, have been studied by performing the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Various parameters were additionally calculated in order to analyze the obtained results: bond lengths, total electron densities, bond populations, atomic charges, Fukui functions (FFs) and density-of-states. Dangling bonds on non-terminated surfaces, O adsorbates, as well as dopants within various atomic layers were all found to induce local effects. In fact, the degree of influences of the dopant on the adsorption energy of the O adsorbates, as well as on parameters like the near-surface bond lengths, total electron density, bond populations and atomic charges, were all found to be dependent on the dopant position. More generally, the deeper the dopant position, the less influence it had on the surface structures and properties. The influences by the dopant in the 1st or 2nd C atomic layer were observed to be significant, but those in the 3rd to 5th C layers were almost negligible. It was also found that the B dopant would decrease the adsorption energy of the adjacent O adsorbates, while the N dopant in the 2nd layer would increase it. Furthermore, the combination of the O adsorbates, together with the dopants within the 1st or 2nd C layer, could induce significant elongation of the bonds between neighboring atoms within the 1st and 2nd layers (i.e. C-C, C-B or C-N bonds). Moreover, all the terminating O atoms could react strongly with either the electrophilic or the nucleophilic species.",3
Diffraction patterns of amorphous materials as a series expansion of neighbor distribution functions.,"An exact analytical expression for the static structure factor [Formula: see text] in disordered materials is derived from Fourier transformed neighbor distribution decompositions in real space, and permits to reconstruct the function [Formula: see text] in an iterative fashion. The result is successfully compared to experimental data of archetypal glasses or amorphous materials (GeS2, As2Se3, GeTe), and links quantitatively knowledge of structural information on short and intermediate -range order with the motifs found on the diffraction patterns in reciprocal space. The approach furthermore reveals that only a limited number of neighbor shells is sufficient to reasonably describe the structure factor for k > 2 [Formula: see text]. In the limit of the high momentum transfer, the oscillation characteristics of the interference function are related with new informations on the short-range order of disordered materials.",3
"Charge, lattice and magnetism across the valence crossover in EuIr2Si2 single crystals.","We present a detailed study of the temperature evolution of the crystal structure, specific heat, magnetic susceptibility and resistivity of single crystals of the paradigmatic valence-fluctuating compound [Formula: see text]. A comparison to stable-valent isostructural compounds [Formula: see text] (with Eu(3+)), and [Formula: see text], (with Eu(2+)) reveals an anomalously large thermal expansion indicative of the lattice softening associated to valence fluctuations. A marked broad peak at temperatures around 65-75 K is observed in specific heat, susceptibility and the derivative of resistivity, as thermal energy becomes large enough to excite Eu into a divalent state, which localizes one f electron and increases scattering of conduction electrons. In addition, the intermediate valence at low temperatures manifests in a moderately renormalized electron mass, with enhanced values of the Sommerfeld coefficient in the specific heat and a Fermi-liquid-like dependence of resistivity at low temperatures. The high residual magnetic susceptibility is mainly ascribed to a Van Vleck contribution. Although the intermediate/fluctuating valence duality is to some extent represented in the interconfiguration fluctuation model commonly used to analyze data on valence-fluctuating systems, we show that this model cannot describe the different physical properties of [Formula: see text] with a single set of parameters.",3
"Local magnetism, magnetic order and spin freezing in the 'nonmetallic metal' FeCrAs.","We present the results of x-ray scattering and muon-spin relaxation ([Formula: see text]SR) measurements on the iron-pnictide compound FeCrAs. Polarized non-resonant magnetic x-ray scattering results reveal the 120 degrees periodicity expected from the suggested three-fold symmetric, non-collinear antiferromagnetic structure. [Formula: see text]SR measurements indicate a magnetically ordered phase throughout the bulk of the material below [Formula: see text] K. There are signs of fluctuating magnetism in a narrow range of temperatures above [Formula: see text] involving low-energy excitations, while at temperatures well below [Formula: see text] behaviour characteristic of freezing of dynamics is observed, likely reflecting the effect of disorder in our polycrystalline sample. Using density functional theory we propose a distinct muon stopping site in this compound and assess the degree of distortion induced by the implanted muon.",3
Temperature effect on the magnetic oscillations in 2D materials.,"We study the magnetic oscillations (MO) in 2D materials with a buckled honeycomb lattice, considering a perpendicular electric and magnetic field. At zero temperature the MO consist of the sum of four sawtooth oscillations, with two unique frequencies and phases. The values of these frequencies depend on the Fermi energy and electric field, which in turn determine the condition for a beating phenomenon in the MO. We analyse the temperature effect in the MO by considering its local corrections over each magnetization peak, given by Fermi-Dirac like functions. We show that the width of these functions is related to the minimum temperature necessary to observe the spin and valley properties in the MO. In particular, we find that in order to observe the spin splitting, the width must be lower than the MO phase difference. Likewise, in order to observe valley mixing effects, the width must be lower than the MO period. We also show that at high temperatures, all the maxima and minima in the MO shift to a constant value, in which case we obtain a simple expression for the MO and its envelope. The results obtained show unique features in the MO in 2D materials, given by the interplay between the valley and spin.",3
Quasi-2D superconductivity in FeTe0.55Se0.45 ultrathin film.,"Iron-chalcogenide FeTe0.55Se0.45 was found to be a promising topological superconducting candidate recently, which may host Majorana bound state in the vortex core and thus attracts intensive research interests in this material. In this report, mechanically exfoliated FeTe0.55Se0.45 superconducting thin films close to the two-dimensional (2D) limit, i.e. sample thickness is on the order of coherence length, were studied systematically by means of electrical transport and point-contact Andreev-reflection spectroscopy (PCARS) measurements. The quasi-2D nature of FeTe0.55Se0.45 thin films is evidenced by the observation of Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition and anisotropic upper critical fields in the vicinity of superconducting transition. Compared to bulk samples, we found that the superconducting transition temperature is only slightly suppressed even for films down to 5 nm. The superconducting gap symmetry remains unchanged and the gap size is weakly affected by tailoring thickness. Our findings suggest that the superconductivity of FeTe0.55Se0.45 thin films is rather robust against reduced dimensions. It provides a novel platform for device applications for quantum computations in combination with possible realization of Majorana modes in this material.",3
Vortex-lattice in a uniform Bose-Einstein condensate in a box trap.,"We study numerically the vortex-lattice formation in a rapidly rotating uniform quasi-two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a box trap. We consider two types of boxes: square and circle. In a square-shaped 2D box trap, when the number of generated vortices is the square of an integer, the vortices are found to be arranged in a perfect square lattice, although deviations near the center are found when the number of generated vortices is arbitrary. In case of a circular box trap, the generated vortices in the rapidly rotating BEC lie on concentric closed orbits. Near the center, these orbits have the shape of polygons, whereas near the periphery the orbits are circles. The circular box trap is equivalent to the rotating cylindrical bucket used in early experiment(s) with liquid He II. The number of generated vortices in both cases is in qualitative agreement with Feynman's universal estimate. The numerical simulation for this study is performed by a solution of the underlying mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation in the rotating frame, where the wave function for the generated vortex lattice is a stationary state. Consequently, the imaginary-time propagation method can be used for a solution of the GP equation, known to lead to an accurate numerical solution. We also demonstrated the dynamical stability of the vortex lattices in real-time propagation upon a small change of the angular frequency of rotation, using the converged imaginary-time wave function as the initial state.",3
Bandgap engineering of PbTe ultra-thin layers by surface passivations.,"We calculate the electronic structures of the PbTe (1 1 1) ultra-thin films by performing the first-principles calculations. The PbTe (1 1 1) ultra-thin films possess direct or indirect band gaps depending sensitively on surface passivations with hydrogen or halogen atoms, and the band gaps depend sensitively on the passivation elements. The bandgaps of PbTe (1 1 1) ultra-thin films with hydrogen passivations can be tuned from 15 meV to 65 meV by applying external strains, making PbTe ultra-thin films promising candidates for optoelectronic device applications in terahertz regime.",3
"Block copolymers for supercapacitors, dielectric capacitors and batteries.","Block copolymer-based energy storage emerges as an active interdisciplinary research field. This topical review presents a survey of the recent advances in block copolymers for energy storage. In the first section, we introduce the background of electrochemical energy storage and block copolymer thermodynamics. In the second section, we discuss the current understandings of block copolymer chemistry, processing, pore size, and ionic conductivity. In the third section, we summarize the design principles and state-of-the-art applications of block copolymers in three energy storage devices, namely, supercapacitors, dielectric capacitors, and batteries. Lastly, we present our perspectives on future possible breakthroughs and associated challenges that are essential to propel the development of advanced block copolymers for energy storage. We expect the review to encourage innovative studies on integrating block copolymers into energy storage applications.",3
Cooper instability generated by attractive fermion-fermion interaction in the two-dimensional semi-Dirac semimetals.,"Cooper instability (CI) associated with superconductivity in the two-dimensional semi-Dirac semimetals is attentively studied in the presence of attractive Cooper-pairing interaction, which is the projection of an attractive fermion-fermion interaction. Performing the standard renormalization group analysis shows that the Cooper theorem is violated at zero chemical potential but instead CI can be generated only if the absolute strength of fermion-fermion coupling exceeds certain critical value and transfer momentum is restricted to a confined region, which is determined by the initial conditions. Rather, the Cooper theorem would be instantly restored once a finite chemical potential is introduced and thus a chemical potential-tuned phase transition is expected. Additionally, we briefly examine the effects of impurity scatterings on the CI at zero chemical potential, which in principle are harmful to CI although they can enhance the density of states of systems. Furthermore, the influence of competition between a finite chemical potential and impurities upon the CI is also simply investigated. These results are expected to provide instructive clues for exploring unconventional superconductors in the kinds of semimetals.",3
Spectral functions of Sr2IrO4: theory versus experiment.,"The spin-orbit Mott insulator Sr2IrO4 has attracted a lot of interest in recent years from theory and experiment due to its close connection to isostructural high-temperature copper oxide superconductors. Despite not being superconductive, its spectral features closely resemble those of the cuprates, including Fermi surface and pseudogap properties. In this article, we review and extend recent work in the theoretical description of the spectral function of pure and electron-doped Sr2IrO4 based on a cluster extension of dynamical mean-field theory ('oriented-cluster DMFT') and compare it to available angle-resolved photoemission data. Current theories provide surprisingly good agreement for pure and electron-doped Sr2IrO4, both in the paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases. Most notably, one obtains simple explanations for the experimentally observed steep feature around the M point and the pseudo-gap-like spectral feature in electron-doped Sr2IrO4.",3
Pressure-induced phase transitions and structural evolution across the insulator-metal transition in bulk and nanoscale BiFeO3.,"The pressure-induced phase-transition sequences and structural evolution across the insulator-metal transition (IMT) in multiferroic BiFeO3 still remain unclear. Here we use a combination of high-pressure XRD, XAFS experiment and first principle calculation to investigate the pressure-derived structural transformations and structure-related properties in bulk and nanoscale BiFeO3 up to 55 GPa. A new Imma structure of BiFeO3 has been discovered in the pressure range of 48-52 GPa, which presents ferromagnetic (FM) metallic properties and therefore plays a key role in the IMT. Local structure study reveals that the Bi(3+) cation gradually shifts toward the centrosymmetric position in BiO12 cluster during IMT. Besides, the detailed structural information of post-perovskite Cmcm phase has also been determined and thus the complete phase sequence up to 60 GPa is obtained. Our research provides a structural origin of the IMT and a new way to understand the FM release in BiFeO3 system.",3
"Adsorption, diffusion, and limited dissociation of a single water molecule on the alpha-Pu2O3 (1 1 1) surface.","We have investigated the adsorption, diffusion and dissociation of single water molecule on the alpha-Pu2O3 (1 1 1) surface using DFT + U approach. We show that, with very low absorption energies, the H2O molecule prefers to be absorbed at the surface oxygen vacancies. We futher reveal that the electrons transferred from the H2O molecule to the surface Pu atom mostly belong to the O atom in H2O. We also find that diffusion energy barriers are very low, indicating that the adsorbed H2O molecules are easy to diffuse. The trajectories obtained from ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and the dissociation barrier calculated using nudged elastic band (NEB) methods both show that the absorbed H2O prefers to dissociate into hydrogen atom and hydroxyl group, other than into hydrogen molecule and oxygen atom. The present work suggests that the absorbed H2O easily diffuses but dissociates limitedly on the the alpha-Pu2O3 (1 1 1) surface.",3
Investigation of multi-mode spin-phonon coupling and local B-site disorder in Pr2CoFeO6 by Raman spectroscopy and correlation with its electronic structure by XPS and XAS studies.,"Electronic structure of Pr2CoFeO6 (at 300 K) was investigated by x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and x-ray absorption spectroscopy techniques. All three cations, i.e. Pr, Co and Fe were found to be trivalent in nature. XPS valance band analysis suggested the system to be insulating in nature. The analysis suggested that Co(3+) ions exist in low spin state in the system. Moreover, Raman spectroscopy study indicated the random distribution of the B-site ions (Co/Fe) triggered by same charge states. In temperature-dependent Raman study, the relative heights of the two observed phonon modes exhibited anomalous behaviour near magnetic transition temperature T N ~ 270 K, thus indicating towards interplay between spin and phonon degrees of freedom in the system. Furthermore, clear anomalous softening was observed below T N which confirmed the existence of strong spin-phonon coupling occurring for at least two phonon modes of the system. The line width analysis of the phonon modes essentially ruled out the role of magnetostriction effect in the observed phonon anomaly. The investigation of the lattice parameter variation across T N (obtained from the temperature-dependent neutron diffraction measurements) further confirmed the existence of the spin-phonon coupling.",3
Soliton fractional charge of disordered graphene nanoribbon.,"We investigate the properties of the gap-edge states of half-filled interacting disordered zigzag graphene nanoribbons, and find that the midgap states can display a quantized fractional charge of 1/2. These gap-edge states can be represented by topological kinks with their site probability distribution divided between the left and right zigzag edges with different chiralities. In addition, there are numerous spin-split gap-edge states, similar to those in a Mott-Anderson insulator.",3
Optical properties of Fe-Mn-Ga alloys.,"The first-principles calculations of the electronic structures and the interband optical conductivity (OC) spectra have been performed for the stoichiometric Fe2MnGa alloy with L21 and L12 types of atomic ordering. The calculated optical properties of Fe2MnGa alloy for the L21 and L12 phases are complemented by the experimental OC spectra for bulk and thin film Fe-Mn-Ga alloy samples near the stoichiometry 2:1:1 with L21 and L12 (for bulks) as well as the body-centered-cubic and face-centered-cubic (for films) structures, respectively. A reasonable agreement between experimental and calculated interband OC spectra was obtained for both phases of the alloy. The experimental data show no significant difference in the OC spectra with respect to the degrees of atomic and magnetic orders of the samples.",3
Large thermal anisotropy in monoclinic niobium trisulfide: a thermal expansion tensor study.,"We present a method based on the Gruneisen formalism to calculate the thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) tensor that is applicable to any crystal system, where the number of phonon calculations associated with different deformations scales linearly with the number of lattice parameters. Compared to simple high-symmetry systems such as cubic or hexagonal systems, a proper consideration of low-symmetry systems such as monoclinic or triclinic crystals demands a clear distinction between the TEC tensor and the lattice-parameter TECs along the crystallographic direction. The latter is more complicated and it involves integrating the equations of motion for the primitive lattice vectors, with input from the TEC tensor. A first-principles study of the TEC is carried out for the first time on a monoclinic crystal, where we unveil high TEC anisotropies in a recently reported monoclinic phase of niobium trisulfide (NbS3-IV) crystal with a relatively large primitive cell (32 atoms per cell) using density-functional theory. We find the occurrence of a negative TEC tensor component is largely due to the mechanical property rather than the anharmonic effect, contrary to common belief. Our theoretical treatment of the monoclinic system with a single off-diagonal tensor element could be routinely generalized to any crystal system, including the lowest-symmetry triclinic system with three off-diagonal tensor elements.",3
Mechanics and dynamics of lysozyme immobilisation inside nanotubes.,"Lysozyme is an enzyme often used as an antibacterial agent in food industries and biochemical and pharmaceutical laboratories. Immobilisation of lysozyme by encapsulating in a nanotube has received much interest as it can enhance stability of the enzyme in ambient condition. Experimentally, various types of nanotubes have been proposed as a host for lysozyme. Here, we mathematically model the immobilisation process and the interaction between lysozyme and various types of nanotubes in order to compare the effectiveness of different nanotube materials. In this paper, we consider boron nitride, carbon, silicon, silicon carbide and titania nanotubes. For each type of nanotubes, we determine the critical radius that will maximise the interaction between the lysozyme molecule and the nanotube. Our results suggest that titania nanotube stands out as the most promising candidate for lysozyme storage and delivery. The model presented here can be extended to further investigate the interaction between different types of nanotube materials and protein structures for the development of effective molecular storage.",3
First-principles study of order-disorder transitions in multicomponent solid-solution alloys.,"In this review, we will focus on the recent development of the order-disorder transition in metallic materials. The past decades have witnessed fast development in the first-principles methodologies and their applications to ordering transitions in multi-component alloys, particularly the high-entropy alloys. The driving force for the proceedings comes from (i) the advance of algorithms and increasingly cheaper hardware, and also (ii) the great passion to model alloys with increasing number of components. The review starts with a brief introduction of the history for the ordering transitions. More detailed scientific proceedings prior to the 1970s had been well summarized in Krivoglaz and Smirnov (1965 The Theory of Order-Disorder in Alloys (New York: Elsevier)) and Stoloff and Davies (1968 Prog. Mater. Sci. 13 1-84). In the second part, the methods to study the ordering transitions, primarily on the theoretic methods are introduced. These will include (i) KKR-CPA method and supercell methods for energetic calculations; and (ii) thermodynamic and statistical methods to compute the transition temperatures. The third part will focus on representative applications in alloys, including our own work and many others. This part supplies the primary information of this review to the readers. The fourth part will summarize the connections between ordering transitions and broader physical properties (e.g. the mechanical properties). In the last part, some concluding remarks and perspectives will be given.",3
On the competition between the Kondo effect and the exchange interaction in a parallel double quantum dot system.,"We study the competition between the Kondo effect and the exchange interaction in the parallel double quantum dot (DQD) system within an effective action field theory. The strong on-site Coulomb interactions in DQDs are treated by using the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation and the introduction of scalar potential fields. We show that a self-consistent perturbation approach, which takes into account the statistical properties of the potential fields acting on electrons in DQDs, describes well the crossover from the Kondo regime to the spin-singlet state in this system. The linear conductance and the intradot/interdot spin excitation spectra of this system are obtained.",3
Lattice dynamics in FeSi measured by inelastic x-ray scattering.,"The phonon dispersion of FeSi was measured by inelastic x-ray scattering. The study of its temperature evolution in the range of 100 K-300 K showed that the phonon modes soften to a different extent. The phonons exhibiting specifically strong softening were revealed to belong to the weakly dispersive optical branch. At the same time, the calculations of the lattice dynamics of FeSi suggest that this branch corresponds mainly to the atomic displacements that change the Fe-Fe nearest neighbor distance. It points to the role of the Fe-Fe interaction in the phonon softening.",3
Non-vertical optical transition in near-field enhanced spectroscopy of graphene.,"We theoretically investigate the optical transition of an electron in graphene that is excited by near-field around a conical Au tip. The interaction between the near-field and the electron is calculated by tight-binding method. In the case of near-field, the wavevector of the electron changes by the optical absorption from the valence band to the conduction band. We show that the change of the wavevector is inversely proportional to the localization width of the near-field, which is given as a function of the distance between the tip and graphene. We calculate the near-field absorption probability as a function of k in the Brillouin zone.",3
Graphene-based heterostructures with moire superlattice that preserve the Dirac cone: a first-principles study.,"In van der Waals heterostructures consisting of graphene and a substrate, lattice mismatch often leads to a moire pattern with a huge supercell, preventing its treatment within first-principles calculations. Previous theoretical works considered mostly simple stacking models such as AB, AA with straining the lattice of graphene to match that of the substrate. Here, we propose a moire superlattice build from graphene and porous graphene or graphyne like monolayers, having a lower interlayer binding energy, needing little strain in order to match the lattices. In contrast to the results from the simple stacking models, the present ab initio calculations for the moire superlattices show different properties in lattice structure, energy, and band structures. For example, the Dirac cone at the K point is preserved and a linear energy dispersion near the Fermi level is obtained.",3
Verticalization of bacterial biofilms.,"Biofilms are communities of bacteria adhered to surfaces. Recently, biofilms of rod-shaped bacteria were observed at single-cell resolution and shown to develop from a disordered, two-dimensional layer of founder cells into a three-dimensional structure with a vertically-aligned core. Here, we elucidate the physical mechanism underpinning this transition using a combination of agent-based and continuum modeling. We find that verticalization proceeds through a series of localized mechanical instabilities on the cellular scale. For short cells, these instabilities are primarily triggered by cell division, whereas long cells are more likely to be peeled off the surface by nearby vertical cells, creating an ""inverse domino effect"". The interplay between cell growth and cell verticalization gives rise to an exotic mechanical state in which the effective surface pressure becomes constant throughout the growing core of the biofilm surface layer. This dynamical isobaricity determines the expansion speed of a biofilm cluster and thereby governs how cells access the third dimension. In particular, theory predicts that a longer average cell length yields more rapidly expanding, flatter biofilms. We experimentally show that such changes in biofilm development occur by exploiting chemicals that modulate cell length.",3
"Comparative study of methodologies to compute the intrinsic Gilbert damping: interrelations, validity and physical consequences.","Relaxation effects are of primary importance in the description of magnetic excitations, leading to a myriad of methods addressing the phenomenological damping parameters. In this work, we consider several well-established forms of calculating the intrinsic Gilbert damping within a unified theoretical framework, mapping out their connections and the approximations required to derive each formula. This scheme enables a direct comparison of the different methods on the same footing and a consistent evaluation of their range of validity. Most methods lead to very similar results for the bulk ferromagnets Fe, Co and Ni, due to the low spin-orbit interaction (SOI) strength and the absence of the spin pumping mechanism. The effects of inhomogeneities, temperature and other sources of finite electronic lifetime are often accounted for by an empirical broadening of the electronic energy levels. We show that the contribution to the damping introduced by this broadening is additive, and so can be extracted by comparing the results of the calculations performed with and without SOI. Starting from simulated ferromagnetic resonance spectra based on the underlying electronic structure, we unambiguously demonstrate that the damping parameter obtained within the constant broadening approximation diverges for three-dimensional bulk magnets in the clean limit, while it remains finite for monolayers. Our work puts into perspective the several methods available to describe and compute the Gilbert damping, building a solid foundation for future investigations of magnetic relaxation effects in any kind of material.",3
Recovery of photoexcited magnetic ordering in Sr2IrO4.,The recovery of antiferromagnetic and lattice order of Sr2IrO4 upon laser excitation was measured by time-resolved x-ray diffraction on nanosecond time scales. The in situ measurements of both magnetic and lattice order parameters allow direct comparison of their time evolutions without ambiguity. We found that the magnetic order recovers with two time constants. The fast sub-nanosecond recovery is associated with the re-establishment of three dimensional antiferromagnetic order while the slow sub-nanosecond recovery agrees with the lattice cooling on tens of nanoseconds. The strong oscillating behavior of magnetic order during the long time recovery may be related to complicated dynamics of defect-pinned magnetic domains.,3
Plasmonic metaresonances: harnessing nonlocal effects for prospective biomedical applications.,"Metal nanoparticles (MNPs) possess optical concentration capabilities that can amplify and localize electromagnetic fields into nanometer length scales. The near-fields of MNPs can be used to tailor optical response of luminescent semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), resulting in fascinating optical phenomena. Plasmonic metaresonances (PMRs) form a class of such optical events gaining increasing popularity due to their promising prospects in sensing and switching applications. Unlike the basic excitonic and plasmonic resonances in MNP-QD nanohybrids, PMRs occur in the space/time domain. A nanohybrid experiences PMR when system parameters such as QD dipole moment, MNP-QD centre separation or submerging medium permittivity reach critical values, resulting in the plasmonically induced time delay of the effective Rabi frequency experienced by the QD asymptotically tending to infinity. Theoretical analyses of PMRs available in the literature utilize the local response approximation (LRA) which does not account for the nonlocal effects of the MNP, and neglect the MNP dependence of the QD decay and dephasing rates which hinder their applicability to QDs in the close vicinity of small MNPs. Here, we address these limitations using an approach based on the generalized nonlocal optical response (GNOR) theory which has proven to yield successful theoretical explanations of experimentally observed plasmonic phenomena. Our results indicate that, omission of the MNP nonlocal response and the associated decay/dephasing rate modifications of the QD tend to raise implications such as significant over-estimation of the QD dipole moment required to achieve PMR, under-estimation of the critical centre separation and prediction of significantly lower near-PMR QD absorption rates, in comparison to the improved GNOR based predictions. In light of our observations, we finally suggest two prospective applications of PMR based nanoswitches, namely, aptamer based in vitro cancer screening and thermoresponsive polymer based temperature sensing. To demonstrate the latter application, we develop and utilize a proof of concept (two dimensional) skin tumor model homogeneously populated by MNP-QD nanohybrids. Our simulations reveal a novel near-PMR physical phenomenon observable under perpendicular illumination, which we like to call the margin pattern reversal, where the spatial absorption pattern reverses when the near-PMR QDs switch from the bright to dark state.",3
Influence of orbital two-channel Kondo effect on anomalous Hall effect in ferrimagnetic composites of LaNiO3 and CoFe2O4.,"In this report, we have investigated the magnetoresistance (MR) and Hall effect of the ferrimagnetic composites containing LaNiO3 and CoFe2O4 (CFO) (with CFO content 15% and 20%) which exhibit orbital two-channel Kondo (2CK) effect and therefore pronounced resistivity upturn at low temperature. Both composites manifest a negative to positive crossover in MR with increasing temperature. The MR is described by the Khosla and Fisher model of spin fluctuations scattering of conduction electrons and the two-band theory based on hybridized p-d sub-bands. The Hall resistivity of the composites consists of both ordinary and anomalous part. The negative sign of the ordinary Hall coefficient suggests electrons as the dominating charge carriers. The coefficient of anomalous Hall resistivity ([Formula: see text]) follows the scaling relation ([Formula: see text]) with longitudinal resistivity ([Formula: see text]) at high temperature above the resistivity upturn. However, at low temperature [Formula: see text] shows non-monotonous behaviour and deviates from the scaling relation where orbital 2CK effect takes place. More detailed study below the resistivity upturn of the composite with 20% CFO reveals that this deviation occurs around the Kondo temperature. This breakdown of scaling relation around the Kondo temperature indicates the possible influence of orbital 2CK on the anomalous Hall effect.",3
Quantum singularity in topological insulators.,"Dislocations in the three-dimensional topological insulator have a similar effect as a hole threading magnetic flux. In this study, we have analytically considered a dislocation in three-dimensional topological insulator using the Dirac and the modified Dirac equation. A quantum singularity that originated in the dislocation creates a defect in momentum space. This defect relates to a phase transition and causes topologically protected zero-energy mode bound to the quantum singularity.",3
Structural change in liquid sulphur from chain polymeric liquid to atomic simple liquid under high pressure.,"The structural properties of liquid sulphur under high pressure up to approximately 500 GPa have been investigated by means of ab initio molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations. The obtained pair distribution functions and spatial distribution of electron density under high pressure indicate the existence of a covalent-like interaction even in the metallic state and the covalent-like interaction gradually decreases with increasing pressure. By analyzing the static structure factor, it is found that the covalent-like interaction still remains at approximately 200 GPa, and liquid sulphur has a simple liquid structure at 320 GPa and higher pressures. These results indicate that the covalent-like interaction disappears at a pressure between 200 and 320 GPa. In this study, we also estimate the pressure range of structural change in other liquid chalcogens in a similar manner as liquid S. The pressures at which liquid Se and Te have simple liquid structure are estimated to be larger than approximately 100 and 20 GPa, respectively.",3
Physical properties of Si-Ge alloys in C2/m phase: a comprehensive investigation.,"A new phase of C2/m Ge16 is first proposed in this paper. The structures and mechanical, anisotropic, electronic, transport and optical properties of Si-Ge alloys in the C2/m phase are studied using first principles calculations. All Ge16 and Si16-x Ge x alloys in the C2/m phase are proven to have mechanical and dynamic stability. By analyzing the three-dimensional (3D) perspective of the effective mass and Young's modulus, obvious anisotropies of transport and mechanical properties are found. Higher-resolution full band structures are obtained to determine the positions of the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM). All materials have a higher photoelectron absorption than that of diamond Si. A high electronic mobility (16 527 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1)) and hole mobility (3033 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1)) are found in C2/m Si8Ge8 and Si4Ge12, respectively. Based on the large mobility and photoelectron absorption, the Si-Ge alloys in the C2/m phase are promising materials for electronics and optoelectronics applications.",3
Misaligned anisotropies in spin-valve films studied through magnetoresistance and magnetization measurements.,"Magnetization and magnetoresistance properties of Py/Cu/Py/IrMn spin valve (SV) films are studied in the framework of the modified antiferromagnetic domain-wall model applied to a granular multidomain system. In the simulations, a misalignment between the in-plane easy magnetization axes of the Py and IrMn is considered. Magnetization and magnetoresistance data are simulated for a number of field orientations and a fairly good agreement with the experiment is found. The same holds for the respective distributions of the coercive and exchange-bias field values determined from magnetoresistance first-order reversal curves (MR-FORC) obtained for magnetic field parallel to the direction of that applied during the sample deposition. Both experimental and theoretical data of the angular variations of the magnetoresistance at constant fields are successfully used to obtain the misalignment angles. For some samples, mostly those with thinner Py layer coupled to IrMn one, our results indicate that the misalignment is due to interfacial magnetic frustration. Moreover, it is shown that MR-FORC diagrams are useful to extract information about the alignment of the grains along the field-cooling directions in SVs, as well as that these can be used to determine the threshold of the continuity of the pinned magnetic layer.",3
Direct and indirect methods based on effective Hamilton for electrocaloric effect of BaTiO3 nanoparticle.,"Low dimensional ferroelectric materials, including nano thin films, nanowires and nanoparticules, exhibit excellent electrocaloric effect (ECE) and have potential application in solid-state cooling devices. Predicting the ECE property of nanoscale ferroelectrics is of scientific significance and practice importance. Here, the direct and indirect methods based on effective Hamilton are employed to study the ECE in BaTiO3 nanoparticle under different electric fields and temperatures. In indirect method, the Monte Carlo simulation is used to obtain the polarization changes with temperature under different electric fields. The ECE is calculated indirectly based on the Maxwell relation. In direct method, the demon energy is introduced into the system in order to obtain the ECE directly. The results shows that the difference between the peak values of direct method and indirect method is less than 5%, which means both direct method and indirect method can be used to simulate the ECE of ferroelectric nanoparticle.",3
Calculated optical properties of Co in ZnO: internal and ionization transitions.,"Previous luminescence and absorption experiments in Co-doped ZnO revealed two ionization and one intrashell transition of [Formula: see text] electrons. Those optical properties are analyzed within the generalized gradient approximation to the density functional theory. The two ionization channels involve electron excitations from the two [Formula: see text] gap states, the [Formula: see text] triplet and the [Formula: see text] doublet, to the conduction band. The third possible ionization channel, in which an electron is excited from the valence band to the [Formula: see text] level, requires energy in excess of 4 eV, and cannot lead to absorption below the ZnO band gap, contrary to earlier suggestions. We also consider two recombination channels, the direct recombination and a two-step process, in which a photoelectron is captured by [Formula: see text] and then recombines via the internal transition. Finally, the observed increase the band gap with the Co concentration is well reproduced by theory. The accurate description of ZnO:Co is achieved after including +U corrections to the relevant orbitals of Zn, O, and Co. The [Formula: see text] value was calculated by the linear response approach, and independently was obtained by fitting the calculated transition energies to the optical data. The respective values, 3.4 and 3.0 eV, agree well. Ionization of Co induces large energy shifts of the gap levels, driven by the varying Coulomb coupling between the [Formula: see text] electrons, and by large lattice relaxations around Co ions. In turn, over approximately 1 eV changes of [Formula: see text] levels induced by the internal transition are mainly caused by the occupation-dependent [Formula: see text] corrections.",3
Magnetostructural behavior in the non-centrosymmetric compound Nd7Pd3.,"A systematic study of the physical properties and microscopic magnetism of Nd7Pd3 compound, which in the paramagnetic state crystallizes in the non-centrosymmetric hexagonal Th7Fe3-type structure (hP20-P63 mc; with a = 10.1367(1) A and c = 6.3847(1) A at 300 K), confirms multiple magnetic ordering transitions that occur upon cooling. Antiferromagnetic transition is observed at T N = 37 K, which is followed by ferromagnetic transformation at T C = 33 K. The first-order magnetic transition at T C is magnetoelastic: it involves a change of crystal symmetry from P63 mc to Cmc21 and leads to anisotropic changes of the unit cell parameters. While the antiferromagnetic structure is symmetry allowed in P63 mc, the ferromagnetic structure with magnetic moments along the a-direction of the original hexagonal unit cell induces the first order transition to Cmc21. Density functional theory calculations confirm the experimentally observed ground state with the a-axis as the easy magnetization direction.",3
Strain induced disordered phonon modes in Cr doped PrFeO3.,"Room temperature optical absorption spectroscopy (OAS) and Raman spectroscopy measurements have been carried out in order to understand the effect of structural disorder on the electronic and phononic states. For this purpose, polycrystalline samples of Cr doped PrFeO3 have been prepared via wet chemical route. OAS analysis suggests the systematic scaling of electronic disorder with Cr doping; whereas, shifting in Raman line shapes and an increase in Raman line width has been observed with Cr doping. X-ray diffraction analysis clearly suggests the increase in structural disorders in the form of crystallographic strain with Cr doping, which is consistent with the broadening in Raman line shapes. The major contribution to Raman line width has been understood in terms of temperature independent terms i.e. structural disorder induced by doping. The generation of a new phonon mode at ~510 cm(-1) has been observed and understood as a disorder phonon mode due to strain induced structural disorder. Moreover, a systematic correlation between crystallographic strain, Raman line width, disordered parameter (sigma) and Urbach energy has been observed, which implies that structural disorder affects phononic as well as electronic states of the system. Such comparative study allows us to find the correlation between densities of tail states, structural disorders and anharmonic effects probed by Raman spectroscopy.",3
New topological invariants in non-Hermitian systems.,"Both theoretical and experimental studies of topological phases in non-Hermitian systems have made a remarkable progress in the last few years of research. In this article, we review the key concepts pertaining to topological phases in non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with relevant examples and realistic model setups. Discussions are devoted to both the adaptations of topological invariants from Hermitian to non-Hermitian systems, as well as origins of new topological invariants in the latter setup. Unique properties such as exceptional points and complex energy landscapes lead to new topological invariants including winding number/vorticity defined solely in the complex energy plane, and half-integer winding/Chern numbers. New forms of Kramers degeneracy appear here rendering distinct topological invariants. Modifications of adiabatic theory, time-evolution operator, biorthogonal bulk-boundary correspondence lead to unique features such as topological displacement of particles, 'skin-effect', and edge-selective attenuated and amplified topological polarizations without chiral symmetry. Extension and realization of topological ideas in photonic systems are mentioned. We conclude with discussions on relevant future directions, and highlight potential applications of some of these unique topological features of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.",3
"Structural phase transitions in malononitrile, CH2(CN)2: crystal structure of the delta phase by neutron powder diffraction, and ab initio calculations of the structures and phonons of the alpha and delta phases.","The crystal structure of the low-temperature [Formula: see text] phase of crystalline malononitrile, CH2(CN)2 (stable phase below 260 K), has been determined using Rietveld refinement on neutron powder diffraction data. The [Formula: see text] phase has a slightly lower density than the other three low-pressure phases, and unlike those phases it has a polar structure. The transition from the [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text] phase involves a major reconstruction of the structure, including establishing a network of hydrogen bonds. DFT simulations of the structure and phonon dispersion curves of both [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] phases give free energy curves consistent with the phase transitions. It is noted that the transition from the [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text] phase at 260 K is facilitated by the entropy arising from the low-frequency phonons associated with the soft mode for the sequence of [Formula: see text]-[Formula: see text]-[Formula: see text] phase transitions.",3
Stability of pyridine-like and pyridinium-like nitrogen in graphene.,"Identification of N configurations in N-doped graphene is important to improve its functionalities. In most experiments, graphite-like, pyridine-like, and pyrrole-like N was usually chosen to assign the spectral features of N-doped graphene. Based on the first-principles simulations, we find that since one of nitrogen's electrons occupies the LUMO state, stability of pyridinium-like N (pyridine-like N with hydrogen termination) in multi-benzenes systems increases with the HOMO-LUMO gap decreasing. Therefore, unlike benzene with a large HOMO-LUMO gap, pyridinium-like N is a stable configuration in graphene with zero band gap, and the pyridinium-like N should be considered during the assignments of N configurations even under the environments with higher temperatures and lower hydrogen partial pressure than ambient conditions.",3
Liquid-liquid transition in supercooled gallium alloys under nanoconfinement.,"NMR studies of the thermal evolution of the Ga-In-Sn and Ga-In liquid alloys embedded into opal matrices were carried out. Temperature dependences of the gallium lineshape, shift of the resonance frequency (Knight shift), and intensity were obtained upon cooling down to the alloy freezing and subsequent warming. A second high-frequency (71)Ga NMR signal emerged for both alloys upon cooling, the NMR line intensity transferring gradually into this additional signal. The Knight shifts of the signals differed noticeably. The transformations of the gallium line upon warming were continuous and not affected by changes in the alloy compositions induced by melting. (115)In NMR measurements were conducted to monitor the alloy compositions at freezing and melting. The findings suggest the occurrence of the liquid-liquid phase transition in the strongly supercooled alloys under nanoconfinement.",3
Evolution of electronic and magnetic properties of nominal magnetite nanoparticles at high pressure probed by x-ray absorption and emission techniques.,"We present a study of electronic and magnetic properties of nominal magnetite nanoparticles (NPs) (~6 nm) at high pressure in the presence of silicon pressure medium using x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) and non-resonant x-ray emission spectroscopy (XES). XANES data show a reduction of Fe charge state, a change in local environment around Fe at tetrahedral sites, and a reduced occupation of Fe 4p orbitals, not seen in previous pressure studies of bulk magnetite. XMCD data show a continuous magnetic moment reduction of ~50% between ambient pressure and 20 GPa, similar to what was observed in previous bulk magnetite studies. XES spectra of NPs indicate a gradual change in spin configuration away from the high-spin state consistent with a postulated charge transfer from Fe 4p to 3d states and the observed reduction in XMCD signal. Taken together, the results point to substantial differences in the response of electronic and magnetic properties of the nano-counterparts of bulk magnetite at high pressure.",3
"First-principles DFT insights into the structural, elastic, and optoelectronic properties of alpha and beta-ZnP2: implications for photovoltaic applications.","Binary II-V semiconductors are highly optically active materials, possess high intrinsic mechanical and chemical durability, and have electronic properties ideal for optoelectronic applications. Among them, zinc diphosphide (ZnP2) is a promising earth-abundant absorber material for solar energy conversion. We have investigated the structural, mechanical, and optoelectronic properties of both the tetragonal (alpha) and monoclinic (beta) phases of ZnP2 using standard, Hubbard-corrected and screened hybrid density functional theory methods. Through the analysis of bond character, band gap nature, and absorption spectra, we show that there exist two polymorphs of the beta phase (denoted as beta 1 and beta 2) with distinct differences in the photovoltaic potential. While beta 1 exhibits the characteristics of metallic compounds, beta 2 is a semiconductor with predicted thin-film photovoltaic absorbing efficiency of almost 10%. The alpha phase is anticipated to be an indirect gap material with a calculated efficiency limited to only 1%. We have also analysed and gained insights into the electron localization function, projected density of states and projected crystal orbital Hamilton populations for the analogue bonds between the alpha and beta-ZnP2. In light of these calculations, a number of previous discrepancies have been solved and a solid ground for future employment of zinc diphosphides in photovoltaics has been established.",3
Strain engineering of valley polarized currents in topological crystalline insulators.,"Although the existence of four valley degrees of freedom in the (0 0 1) surface of IV-VI semiconductor topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) provides the opportunity to multiply the valleytronic functionality, it makes the generation of highly polarized valley currents less plausible. We investigate quantum adiabatic valley pumping in (0 0 1) surface of these TCIs and show that applying shear strains and exchange field gives the possibility of control and manipulation of the valley resolved currents with high polarizations. Interchange of polarizations, simply by turning the tensile strain into compressive mode and vice versa, highlights the potential application for valleytronic switching process. Furthermore, since the surface states are robust against disorders, we can increase the lengths of driving regions and pump significantly larger currents without breaking the coherency of the quantum transport regime.",3
In-plane and out-of-plane properties of a BaFe2As2 single crystal.,"Anisotropy of transport and magnetic properties of parent compounds of iron based superconductors is a key ingredient of superconductivity. In this work, we investigate in-plane and out-of-plane properties, namely thermal, electric, thermoelectric transport and magnetic susceptibility in a high quality BaFe2As2 single crystal of the 122 parent compound, using a combined experimental and theoretical approach. Combining the ab initio calculation of the band structure and the measured in-plane and out-of-plane resistivity, we evaluate the scattering rates which turn out to be strongly anisotropic and determined by spin excitations in the antiferromagnetic state. The observed anisotropy of thermal conductivity is discussed in terms of anisotropy of sound velocities which we estimate to be [Formula: see text]. Remarkably, we find that thermal conductivity is characterized by a sizeable electronic contribution at low temperature, which is ascribed to the high purity of our crystal.",3
Design and characterization of electrons in a fractal geometry.,"The dimensionality of an electronic quantum system is decisive for its properties. In one dimension electrons form a Luttinger liquid and in two dimensions they exhibit the quantum Hall effect. However, very little is known about the behavior of electrons in non-integer, or fractional dimensions1. Here, we show how arrays of artificial atoms can be defined by controlled positioning of CO molecules on a Cu (111) surface2-4, and how these sites couple to form electronic Sierpinski fractals. We characterize the electron wave functions at different energies with scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy and show that they inherit the fractional dimension. Wave functions delocalized over the Sierpinski structure decompose into self-similar parts at higher energy, and this scale invariance can also be retrieved in reciprocal space. Our results show that electronic quantum fractals can be artificially created by atomic manipulation in a scanning tunneling microscope. The same methodology will allow future study to address fundamental questions about the effects of spin-orbit interaction and a magnetic field on electrons in non-integer dimensions. Moreover, the rational concept of artificial atoms can readily be transferred to planar semiconductor electronics, allowing for the exploration of electrons in a well-defined fractal geometry, including interactions and external fields.",3
Entropic effects in cell lineage tree packings.,"Optimal packings [1, 2] of unconnected objects have been studied for centuries [3-6], but the packing principles of linked objects, such as topologically complex polymers [7, 8] or cell lineages [9, 10], are yet to be fully explored. Here, we identify and investigate a generic class of geometrically frustrated tree packing problems, arising during the initial stages of animal development when interconnected cells assemble within a convex enclosure [10]. Using a combination of 3D imaging, computational image analysis, and mathematical modelling, we study the tree packing problem in Drosophila egg chambers, where 16 germline cells are linked by cytoplasmic bridges to form a branched tree. Our imaging data reveal non-uniformly distributed tree packings, in agreement with predictions from energy-based computations. This departure from uniformity is entropic and affects cell organization during the first stages of the animal's development. Considering mathematical models of increasing complexity, we investigate spherically confined tree packing problems on convex polyhedrons [11] that generalize Platonic and Archimedean solids. Our experimental and theoretical results provide a basis for understanding the principles that govern positional ordering in linked multicellular structures, with implications for tissue organization and dynamics [12, 13].",3
Emergence of photo-induced multiple topological phases on square-octagon lattice.,"In this study, a tight-binding model on square-octagon lattice with nearest-neighbour and next-nearest-neighbour hoppings is considered. The system is topologically trivial although it exhibits quadratic band-touching points in its band-structure. It is shown that the system drives towards topologically non-trivial phases as soon as it is exposed to monochromatic circularly polarized light. Multiple topological phases are found to emerge with the variation of amplitude of light. An effective time-independent Hamiltonian of the system is obtained following the Floquet-Bloch formulation. Quasi-energy band-structures along with definite values of Chern numbers for respective bands are obtained. Characterization of topological phases are made in terms of band structure and Chern numbers. In addition, Hall conductance and topologically protected chiral edge states are obtained to explain the topological properties. Density of states is obtained in every case. The system undergoes a series of topological phase transitions among various topological phases upon variations of both amplitude of light and hopping strengths. It exhibits Chern insulating and Chern semimetallic phases depending on the values of lattice filling.",3
Towards magnetic alumina: uncovering the roles of transition metal doping and electron hybridization in spin delocalization.,"Judicious doping of normally diamagnetic alumina (Al2O3) could lead to bulk magnetism that would enable the usage of cutting edge technology, such as magnetoforming, to create advanced systems that take advantage of the high chemical and physical resilience of alumina. This study builds upon initial results (Nykwest et al 2018 J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 30 395801) which have shown that alumina doped with magnetic elements such as Fe and Ni should exhibit heightened magnetic activity. Here we expand the analysis to several additional transition metals that are otherwise non-magnetic (Sc, Ti, V, Mn, and Co) and use density functional theory to understand the origin of the spin delocalization, as well as to predict the structural, electronic, energetic, and magnetic properties of doped [Formula: see text]-alumina. The results indicate that adding small concentrations of such elements to [Formula: see text]-alumina may increase magnetic activity by generating coordination environments with magnetic moments. Our findings show conclusively that significant spin delocalization can only occur when there are unpaired electrons in the transition metal e g states.",3
Mirror-symmetry induced topological valley transport along programmable boundaries in a hexagonal sonic crystal.,"Valley states, labeling the frequency extrema in momentum space, carry a new degree of freedom (valley pseudospin) for topological transport of sound in sonic crystals. Recently, the field of valley acoustics has become a hotspot due to its potentials in developing various topological-insulator-based devices. In most previous works, topological valley transport is implemented at the interfaces of two connected artificial crystals. With respect to the interface, the mirror symmetry of crystal structures supports either even-mode or odd-mode valley states. In this work, we propose a physical insight of transforming one hexagonal crystal into a virtual lattice by utilizing the mirror operation of rigid or soft boundaries, which greatly reduces the dimension of the acoustic structure and provides a possible way to implement the programmable routing of topological propagation. We investigate two cases that the rigid and soft boundaries are introduced either at the edge or inside a single hexagonal crystal. Our results clearly demonstrate the high-transmission valley transport along the folded boundaries, where reflection or scattering is prohibited at the sharp bending or corners due to topological protection. Three functional devices are exemplified, which are single-crystal-based topological delay-line filter, delay-line switcher and beam splitter. Our work reveals the inherent relation between the field symmetries of valley states and structural symmetries of sonic crystals. Programmable routing of topological sound transport through boundary engineering provides a platform for developing integrated and versatile topological-insulator-based devices.",3
Microscopic investigation of low dimensional magnet Sc2Cu2O5: combined experimental and ab initio approach.,"Sc2Cu2O5 is a non centro-symmetric oxide comprising of zig-zag chains made up of Cu(2+) ions in a distorted square planer coordination. We present here a combined experimental and theoretical investigation on this compound, which is based on magnetization, electron spin resonance (ESR), heat capacity as well as density functional theory (DFT) based calculations. Short range magnetic correlation prior to the long range order at [Formula: see text] K is evidenced by a broad hump like feature ([Formula: see text]43 K) found in the magnetic contribution of the heat capacity as well as by deviations from a regular Curie-Weiss behavior observed in the bulk magnetization and the Cu(2+) ESR intensity. The DFT results indicate the existence of ferro-orbital ordering at the Cu-sites, which gives rise to chain like arrangements of Cu ions along the crystallographic b axis. It also signifies complex nature of the spin structure with nonuniform magnetic interactions along the zig-zag chains. The ground state energy is found to be minimum for ferromagnetically coupled spin-dimers along the chains, whereas the adjacent chains are themselves antiferromagnetically coupled. The experimentally observed short range magnetic correlations possibly arise due to this chain like structure.",3
Evidence of the isoelectronic character of F doping in SmFeAsO1-x F x : a first-principles investigation.,"We study the electronic structure of the SmFeAsO1-x F x alloy by means of first-principle calculations. We find that, contrary to common believe, F-doping does not change the charge balance between electrons and holes free-carriers in SmFeAsO1-x F x . For energies within a narrow energy range accross [Formula: see text], the effect of F-doping on the band structure dispersion is tiny in both the paramagnetic and stripe antiferromagnetic phase. The charge balance between the conducting FeAs-layer and the SmO1-x F x charge reservoir layer is not influenced by the compositional change. The additional charge carried by fluorine, with respect to the oxygen, is compensated by a change in the oxidation state of the Sm ion from 3+ to 2+. A comparison with the SmFe1-x Co x AsO system shows that such charge compensation by the Sm ion is not shared by donors substituting at the Fe site.",3
Theoretical investigation of Hall sign change in SrRuO3.,"The appearance of Hall sign change in perovskite SrRuO3 thin films at Curie temperature was confirmed from our fabricated samples and the result was simulated by our proposed theoretical model. In particular, our simulation results are consistent with experimental results mainly due to the introduction of an impurity band in a two-band model. We found the other important factors in our theory responsible for observed consistency Hall measurements are the itinerant carrier density and its intrinsic carrier type. Eventually the theory possibly interprets the mechanism of Hall sign change.",3
Electronic and magnetic properties of the Fe2N monolayer film tuned by substrate symmetry.,The robust bonding between Fe and N atoms has the potential to fabricate a ferromagnetic Fe2N monolayer of a square lattice independently of the symmetry of the substrate. The electronic and magnetic properties tuned by the symmetry of the substrates are investigated by comparing the results of scanning tunnel microscopy and x-ray absorption spectroscopy/magnetic circular dichroism of the square Fe2N monolayer on the Cu(1 1 1) substrate with that on the Cu(0 0 1) substrate. A periodic electronic modulation of the Fe2N monolayer on the Cu(1 1 1) substrate is induced by the stripe superlattice due to the difference of the lattice symmetry between the Fe2N monolayer and the Cu(1 1 1) substrate. The electronic and magnetic properties of the monolayer are largely affected by the hybridization with the Cu substrate and the Fe magnetic moment is much reduced compared to the monolayer on the Cu(0 0 1) substrate.,3
Photo-induced charge density distribution in metal surfaces and its extraction with apertureless near-field optics.,"Electromagnetic (EM) waves impinging on finite metallic structures can induce non-uniform electrical currents and create oscillating charge densities. These local charges govern the important physical processes such as plasmonic behavior or enhanced Raman scattering. Yet the quantitative calculation and probing of the spatial distribution of the charge density still remain challenging at the subwavelength scale. This is especially the case if one considers the boundary effect, where the charge density can become divergent and conventional finite element methods fail to obtain accurate information. With an approach we recently developed, we calculate this charge density for subwavelength structures with and without sharp corners: gold disks and equilateral triangles. We also devise an independent way to extract the surface charge density distributions from experiments using scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscope (s-SNOM). We found that the charge density [Formula: see text] is related to the near field signal S n by [Formula: see text] With no adjustable parameters, the extracted surface charge distribution from the experiments matches well with that from the theoretical prediction, both in magnitude and phase. Our work provides a quantitative study of the surface charge distributions and a systematic and rigorous treatment to extract surface charge distributions at the nanoscale, opening opportunities for mining the near-field data from s-SNOM.",3
Ground states of long-range interacting fermions in one spatial dimension.,"We systematically explore the ground state properties of one dimensional fermions with long-range interactions decaying in a power law approximately [Formula: see text] through the density matrix renormalization group algorithm. By comparing values of Luttinger liquid parameters precisely measured in two different ways, we show convincing evidence that Luttinger liquid theory is valid if [Formula: see text] is larger than some threshold, otherwise the theory breaks down. Combining analysis on structure factor, charge gap and charge stiffness, we determine how the metal-insulator transition point develops as the interaction range is continuously tuned. A region in the range of [Formula: see text] has small interactions and finite charge gaps, but, interestingly, it shows metallic nature at the same time. We obtain approximate phase diagrams for the entire parameter space and for band fillings equal to 1/2 and 1/3. Finally, we compare certain bosonization and field theory formulas with our quasi-exact numerical results, from which disagreements are found.",3
Quasiparticle states of on-demand coherent electron sources.,"We introduce a general approach to extract the wave function of quasiparticles from the scattering matrix of a quantum conductor, which offers a unified way to study the features of quasiparticles from on-demand coherent electron sources with different configurations. We first show that the quasiparticles are particle-hole pairs in the Fermi sea, which can be indexed with the flow density [Formula: see text]. Both the excitation probability and the particle/hole components of the quasiparticles can be solely decided from the polar decomposition of the scattering matrix. By using such approach, we then investigate the quasiparticles from the electron sources based on a quantum point contact and a quantum dot (QD). We find that the quasiparticles from different electron sources have different features, which can be seen from the corresponding [Formula: see text]-dependence of the excitation probability and the particle/hole components. We further show that these features can also be characterized by the full counting statistics of the quasiparticles, which can be approximated by a binomial distribution with cumulant generating function [Formula: see text]. For the quantum-point-contact-based electron sources, both [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] are monotonically increasing functions of the driving strength. In contrast, for the quantum-dot-based electron sources, both [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] can exhibit oscillations, which can be attributed to the interplay between the charge excitation and charge relaxation processes in the QD.",3
Phase stability of three-dimensional bulk and two-dimensional monolayer As1-x Sb x solid solutions from first principles.,"The mixing thermodynamics of both three-dimensional bulk and two-dimensional mono-layered alloys of As1-x Sb x as a function of alloy composition and temperature are explored using a first-principles cluster-expansion method, combined with canonical Monte-Carlo simulations. We observe that, for the bulk phase, As1-x Sb x alloy can exhibit not only chemical ordering of As and Sb atoms at x = 0.5 to form an ordered compound of AsSb stable upon annealing up to [Formula: see text] K, but also a miscibility gap at 475 K [Formula: see text] T [Formula: see text] 550 K in which two disordered solid solutions of As1-x Sb x of different alloy compositions thermodynamically coexist. At T > 550 K, a single-phase solid solution of bulk As1-x Sb x is predicted to be stable across the entire composition range. These results clearly explain the existing uncertainties in the alloying behavior of bulk As1-x Sb x alloy, as previously reported in the literature, and also found to be in qualitative and quantitative agreement with the experimental observations. Interestingly, the alloying behavior of As1-x Sb x is considerably altered, as the dimensionality of the material reduces from the three-dimensional bulk state to the two-dimensional mono-layered state-for example, a single-phase solid solution of monolayer As1-x Sb x is predicted to be stable over the whole composition range at T > 250 K. This distinctly highlights an influence of the reduced dimensionality on the alloying behavior of As1-x Sb x .",3
Hydrogen interactions with low-index surface orientations of tungsten.,"We report on density functional theory calculations that have been performed to systematically investigate the hydrogen-surface interaction as a function of surface orientation. The interactions that were analyzed include stable atomic adsorption sites, molecular hydrogen dissociation and absorption energies, migration pathways and barriers on tungsten surfaces, and the saturation coverage limits on the (1 1 1) surface. Stable hydrogen adsorption sites were found for all surfaces. For the reconstructed W(1 0 0), there are two primary adsorption sites: namely, the long-bridge and short-bridge sites. The threefold hollow site (3F) was found to be the most stable for W(1 1 0), while the bond-centered site between the first and second layer was found to be most stable for the W(1 1 1) surface. No bound adsorption sites for H2 molecules were found for the W surfaces. Hydrogen (H) migration on both the (1 0 0) and (1 1 0) surfaces is found to have preferred pathways for 1D motion, whereas the smallest migration barrier for net migration of H on the W(1 1 1) surface leads to 2D migration. Although weaker H interactions are predicted for the W(1 1 1) surface compared to the (1 0 0) or (1 1 0) surfaces, we observe higher H surface concentrations of Theta = 4.0 at zero K, possibly due to the corrugated surface structure. These results provide insight into H adsorption, surface saturation coverage and migration mechanisms necessary to describe the evolution from the dilute limit to concentrated coverages of H.",3
Interface electron transfer and thickness dependent transport characteristics of La0.7Sr0.3VO3 thin films.,"La0.7Sr0.3VO3 (LSVO) thin films, 5-30 unit cells (u.c.) in thickness, have been epitaxially deposited on (0 0 1) SrTiO3 (STO) single crystal substrates. Although LSVO is metallic in bulk, insulating behavior is observed, from 2 to 390 K, in LSVO films less than 9 u.c. in thickness, while thicker films show a metal-insulator transition with the critical temperature increasing with the decrease of film thickness. X-ray absorption spectra reveal a charge transfer across the LSVO/STO interface for a continuous increase of V valence in LSVO, as well as a decrease of Ti valence in interfacial STO, with the LSVO film thickness increases. The transport characteristics are discussed in terms of enhanced electron localization due to the reduction of film thickness and V 3d band filling induced by the charge transfer.",3
Controlled self-aggregation of polymer-based nanoparticles employing shear flow and magnetic fields.,"Star polymers with magnetically functionalized end groups are presented as a novel polymeric system whose morphology, self-aggregation, and orientation can easily be tuned by exposing these macromolecules simultaneously to an external magnetic field and to shear forces. Our investigations are based on a specialized simulation technique which faithfully takes into account the hydrodynamic interactions of the surrounding, Newtonian solvent. We find that the combination of magnetic field (including both strength and direction) and shear rate controls the mean number of magnetic clusters, which in turn is largely responsible for the static and dynamic behavior. While some properties are similar to comparable non-magnetic star polymers, others exhibit novel phenomena; examples of the latter include the breakup and reorganization of the clusters beyond a critical shear rate, and a strong dependence of the efficiency with which shear rate is translated into whole-body rotations on the direction of the magnetic field.",3
Emergence of intrinsic superconductivity below 1.178 K in the topologically non-trivial semimetal state of CaSn3.,"Topological materials which are also superconducting are of great current interest, since they may exhibit a non-trivial topologically-mediated superconducting phase. Although there have been many reports of pressure-tuned or chemical-doping-induced superconductivity in a variety of topological materials, there have been few examples of intrinsic, ambient pressure superconductivity in a topological system having a stoichiometric composition. Here, we report that the pure intermetallic CaSn3 not only exhibits topological fermion properties, but also has a superconducting phase at ~1.178 K under ambient pressure. The topological fermion properties, including the nearly zero quasi-particle mass and the non-trivial Berry phase accumulated in cyclotron motions, were revealed from the de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) quantum oscillation studies of this material. Although CaSn3 was previously reported to be superconducting with T c = 4.2 K, our studies show that the T c = 4.2 K superconductivity is extrinsic and caused by Sn on the degraded surface, whereas its intrinsic bulk superconducting transition occurs at 1.178 K. These findings make CaSn3 a promising candidate for exploring new exotic states arising from the interplay between non-trivial band topology and superconductivity, e.g. topological superconductivity (TSC).",3
Phase transition in phase transition lines of quantum XY model.,"Phase transitions in quantum systems, including symmetry breaking and topological types, always associate with gap closing and opening. We analyze the topological features of the quantum phase boundary of the XY model in a transverse magnetic field. Based on the results from graphs in the auxiliary space, we find that gapless ground states at boundary have different topological characters. On the other hand, in the framework of Majorana representation, the Majorana lattice is shown to be two coupled SSH chains. The analysis of the quantum fidelity for the Majorana eigen vector, which is shown to be identical to the square of that for ground states of the XY model, indicates the signature of the gapless phase transition (GPT). Furthermore analytical and numerical results for second-order derivative of groundstate energy density show that such a GPT obeys scaling behavior.",3
The modulation of terahertz photoconductivity in CVD grown n-doped monolayer MoS2 with gas adsorption.,"The as-grown atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) usually have extremely large surface-to-volume ratios. Hence, the electrical and optical properties are always affected by the adsorption of atmospheric gases. By using optical pump terahertz (THz) probe spectroscopy, THz photoconductivity dynamics of chemical vapor deposition grown monolayer MoS2 has been investigated in nitrogen, air and oxygen atmospheric environments. Our study reveals that the photoconductivity of MoS2 at THz frequencies is dramatically altered by the adsorption of oxygen. The relaxation dynamics of photoconductivity strongly depends on atmospheres, which is attributed to photo-excited different quasi-particles, such as free charge carriers, excitons and trions. This study highlights the role of oxygen passivation of the photoconductivity in monolayer MoS2, which may have important applications for the design of future MoS2-based electronic devices.",3
Preferential quenching of 5d antiferromagnetic order in Sr3(Ir1-x Mn x )2O7.,"The breakdown of [Formula: see text] antiferromagnetism in the limit of strong disorder is studied in Sr3(Ir1-x Mn x )2O7. Upon Mn-substitution, antiferromagnetic ordering of the Ir cations becomes increasingly two-dimensional, resulting in the complete suppression of long-range Ir magnetic order above [Formula: see text]. Long-range antiferromagnetism however persists on the Mn sites to higher Mn concentrations (x > 0.25) and is necessarily mediated via a random network of majority Ir sites. Our data suggest a shift in the Mn valence from Mn(4+) to Mn(3+) at intermediate doping levels, which in turn generates nonmagnetic Ir(5+) sites and suppresses long-range order within the Ir network. The collapse of long-range [Formula: see text] antiferromagnetism and the survival of percolating antiferromagnetic order on Mn-sites demonstrates a complex 3d-5d exchange process that surprisingly enables minority Mn spins to order far below the conventional percolation threshold for a bilayer square lattice.",3
Wavelength-scale errors in optical localization due to spin-orbit coupling of light.,"Far-field optical imaging techniques allow the determination of the position of point-like emitters and scatterers [1-3]. Although the optical wavelength sets a fundamental limit to the image resolution of unknown objects, the position of an individual emitter can in principle be estimated from the image with arbitrary precision. This is used for example in the determination of stars position [4] or in optical super-resolution microscopy [5]. Furthermore, precise position determination is an experimental prerequisite for the manipulation and measurement of individual quantum systems, such as atoms, ions, and solid-state-based quantum emitters [6-8]. Here we demonstrate that spin-orbit coupling of light in the emission of elliptically polarized emitters can lead to systematic, wavelength-scale errors in the estimation of the emitters position. Imaging a single trapped atom as well as a single sub-wavelength-diameter gold nanoparticle, we demonstrate a shift between the emitters measured and actual positions which is comparable to the optical wavelength. For certain settings, the expected shift can become arbitrarily large. Beyond optical imaging techniques, our findings could be relevant for the localization of objects using any type of wave that carries orbital angular momentum relative to the emitters position with a component orthogonal to the direction of observation.",3
Formation free energies of point defects and thermal expansion of bcc U and Mo.,"[Formula: see text]-U is a high temperature body-centred cubic (bcc) phase of uranium which is mechanically unstable at T = 0 K. The point defect properties in pure bcc uranium are not sufficiently well studied. In this work we use classical molecular dynamics simulations with the thermodynamic integration approach to calculate the formation free energies of vacancies and interstitials in bcc uranium and, for comparison, in bcc molybdenum. Contrary to the majority of other metals where the formation free energy is (much) higher for interstitials than for vacancies, our results show that in [Formula: see text]-uranium interstitials are the dominating type of defects in thermal equilibrium. We discuss the possible implications of this finding in the context of the thermal expansion data for [Formula: see text]-U that provide a certain supporting evidence.",3
Quenching dissipative quantum Ising chain: an exact result for nonequilibrium dynamics.,"To create a more comprehensive understanding of nonequilibrium dynamics of open quantum many-body systems, we visit an exactly solvable example, that is a quenched transverse-field Ising chain coupled to Markovian baths, which act locally on the Jordan-Wigner fermionic space. Performing explicit calculations on the heat transfer, transverse magnetization, and kink density, we find that the imbalance of two opposite damping mechanisms play a crucial role in constructing a nontrivial nonequilibrium steady state accompanied with a dissipative quantum phase transition, also that the competition between unitary drive and decoherence does not necessarily lead to a quasi-stationary state or prethermalization under certain ordinary relaxation.",3
Polaronic effect in the x-ray absorption spectra of La1-x Ca x MnO3 manganites.,"X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is performed to study changes in the electronic structures of colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and charged ordered (CO) La1-x Ca x MnO3 manganites with respect to temperature. The pre-edge features in O and Mn K-edge XAS spectra, which are highly sensitive to the local distortion of MnO6 octahedral, exhibit contrasting temperature dependence between CMR and CO samples. The seemingly counter-intuitive XAS temperature dependence can be reconciled in the context of polarons. These results help identify the most relevant orbital states associated with polarons and highlight the crucial role played by polarons in understanding the electronic structures of manganites.",3
Large easy-plane anisotropy induced spin reorientation in magnetoelectric materials (Co4-x Mn x )Nb2O9.,"Neutron powder diffraction experiments were carried out on the magnetoelectric compound series (Co4-x Mn x )Nb2O9 (x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 3.5, 3.9, 3.95 and 4) from base temperature to above their Neel temperatures. Their magnetic structures were analysed by using the irreducible representation analysis and Rietveld refinement method. Similar to Co4Nb2O9, the compounds with x 3.9 have noncollinear in-plane magnetic structures (Gamma6) with magnetic moments lying purely in the ab plane with certain canting angles. Mn4Nb2O9 has a collinear antiferromagnetic structure (Gamma2) with magnetic moments aligning along the c axis. The compound of x = 3.95 shows two magnetic phases in the magnetization, which was confirmed to have the Gamma2 magnetic structure above 60 K and develop a second Gamma6 local phase in addition to the main Gamma2 phase due to doping. This study indicates 2.5 at% Co(2+) doping is sufficient to alter the collinear easy-axis magnetic structure of Mn4Nb2O9 into the noncollinear easy-plane magnetic structure, which is attributed to the large easy-plane anisotropy of Co(2+) and relative small Ising-like anisotropy of Mn(2+). The doping effects on the Neel temperature and occupancy are also discussed.",3
Doping-induced insulator-metal transition in the Lifshitz magnetic insulator NaOsO3.,"By means of first principles schemes based on magnetically constrained density functional theory and on the band unfolding technique we study the effect of doping on the conducting behaviour of the Lifshitz magnetic insulator NaOsO3. Electron doping is treated within a supercell approach by replacing sodium with magnesium at different concentrations ([Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]). Undoped NaOsO3 is subjected to a temperature-driven Lifshitz transition involving a continuous closing of the gap due to longitudinal and rotational spin fluctuations (Kim et al 2016 Phys. Rev. B 94 241113). Here we find that Mg doping suppresses the insulating state, gradually drives the system to a metallic state (via an intermediate bad metal phase) and the transition is accompanied by a progressive lowering of the Os magnetic moment. We inspected the role of longitudinal spin fluctuations by constraining the amplitude of the local Os moments and found that a robust metal state can be achieved below a critical moment. In analogy with the undoped case we conjecture that the decrease of the local moment can be controlled by temperature effects, in accordance with the theory of itinerant electron magnetism.",3
Viewpoint: the road to room-temperature conventional superconductivity.,"It is a honor to write a contribution on this memorial for Sandro Massidda. For both of us, at different stages in our lives, Sandro was first and foremost a friend. We both admired his humble, playful and profound approach to life and physics. In this contribution we describe the route which permitted to meet a long-standing challenge in solid state physics, i.e. room temperature superconductivity. In less than 20 years the critical temperature of conventional superconductors, which in the last century had been widely believed to be limited to 25 K, was raised from 40 K in MgB2 to 265 K in LaH10. This discovery was enabled by the development and application of computational methods for superconductors, a field in which Sandro Massidda played a major role.",3
Hund's metal regimes and orbital selective Mott transitions in three band systems.,"We analyze the electronic properties of interacting crystal field split three band systems. Using a rotationally invariant slave boson approach we analyze the behavior of the electronic mass renormalization as a function of the intralevel repulsion U, the Hund's coupling J, the crystal field splitting, and the number of electrons per site n. We first focus on the case in which two of the bands are identical and the levels of the third one are shifted by [Formula: see text] with respect to the former. We find an increasing quasiparticle mass differentiation between the bands, for system away from half-filling (n = 3), as the Hubbard interaction U is increased. This leads to orbital selective Mott transitions where either the higher energy band (for 4 > n > 3) or the lower energy degenerate bands (2 < n < 3) become insulating for U larger than a critical interaction [Formula: see text]. Away from the half-filled case [Formula: see text] there is a wide range of parameters for [Formula: see text] where the system presents a Hund's metal phase with the physics dominated by the local high spin multiplets. Finally, we study the fate of the n = 2 Hund's metal as the energy splitting between orbitals is increased for different possible crystal distortions. We find a strong sensitivity of the Hund's metal regime to crystal fields due to the opposing effects of J and the crystal field splittings on the charge distribution between the bands.",3
"High-pressure phase transformations in NdVO4 under hydrostatic, conditions: a structural powder x-ray diffraction study.","Room temperature angle dispersive powder x-ray diffraction experiments on zircon-type NdVO4 were performed for the first time under quasi-hydrostatic conditions up to 24.5 GPa. The sample undergoes two phase transitions at 6.4 and 19.9 GPa. Our results show that the first transition is a zircon-to-scheelite-type phase transition, which has not been reported before, and contradicts previous non-hydrostatic experiments. In the second transition, NdVO4 transforms into a fergusonite-type structure, which is a monoclinic distortion of scheelite-type. The compressibility and axial anisotropy of the different polymorphs of NdVO4 are reported. A direct comparison of our results with former experimental and theoretical studies on other rare-earth orthovanadates found in literature highlights the importance of the role played by non-hydrostatic stresses in their high-pressure structural behavior.",3
Strong long-range electron-phonon interaction as possible driving force for charge ordering in cuprates.,"A model resulting in charge ordering (CO) similar to that observed in cuprate superconductors is under study. It includes strong long-range electron-phonon interaction (EPI) and high density of correlated carriers. Coexistence of large bipolarons and delocalized carriers is a feature of such system. We develop generalized variation method to calculate the bipolaron size (CO period) in the ground normal state of such system at various doping. The approach allows the revealing of a possible physical reason of strongly different doping behavior of the CO wave vector in different cuprates. Obtained doping dependences of the CO period and temperature of the CO decay demonstrate quantitative agreement with those observed in cuprates. Predicted in the suggested approach ratio of the CO wave vector to the wave vector of the high-energy anomaly (HEA) in ARPES spectrum is in consent with that in cuprates. Calculated resonant x-rays scattering on the CO emerging in the model is in good agreement with experiments on cuprates including the asymmetry of the CO peaks' cross-section. A gap arises in the spectrum of delocalized carriers near antinodal direction due to their scattering on the periodic potential created by autolocalized carriers, analogously to photon crystal effect.",3
Tunable 2D-gallium arsenide and graphene bandgaps in a graphene/GaAs heterostructure: an ab initio study.,"The bandgap behavior of 2D-GaAs and graphene have been investigated with van der Waals heterostructured into a yet unexplored graphene/GaAs bilayer, under both uniaxial stress along c axis and different planar strain distributions. The 2D-GaAs bandgap nature changes from [Formula: see text]-K indirect in isolated monolayer to [Formula: see text]-[Formula: see text] direct in graphene/GaAs bilayer. In the latter, graphene exhibits a bandgap of 5 meV. The uniaxial stress strongly affects the graphene electronic bandgap, while symmetric in-plane strain does not open the bandgap in graphene. Nevertheless, it induces remarkable changes on the GaAs bandgap-width around the Fermi level. However, when applying asymmetric in-plane strain to graphene/GaAs, the graphene sublattice symmetry is broken, and the graphene bandgap is open at the Fermi level to a maximum width of 814 meV. This value is much higher than that reported for just graphene under asymmetric strain. The [Formula: see text]-[Formula: see text] direct bandgap of GaAs remains unchanged in graphene/GaAs under different types of applied strain. The analyses of phonon dispersion and the elastic constants yield the dynamical and mechanical stability of the graphene/GaAs system, respectively. The calculated mechanical properties for bilayer heterostructure are better than those of their constituent monolayers. This finding, together with the tunable graphene bandgap not only by the strength but also by the direction of the strain, enhance the potential for strain engineering of ultrathin group-III-V electronic devices hybridized by graphene.",3
A resummed thermodynamic perturbation theory for positive and negative hydrogen bond cooperativity in water.,"In this paper a resummed thermodynamic perturbation theory is developed which accounts for both positive and negative hydrogen bond cooperativity in water. The theory is developed in Wertheim's multi-density statistical mechanics. We demonstrate that the hydrogen bonded structure of water is controlled by positive hydrogen bond cooperativity in homodromic hydrogen bonded clusters. Inclusion of negative anti-cooperativity in antidromic hydrogen bonded structures has little effect on the underlying hydrogen bond structure of liquid water. The resummed perturbation theory is shown to give hydrogen bond statistics consistent with first principles ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. In addition, the theory is shown to be in good agreement with experiment in the prediction of the average number of hydrogen bonds per water molecule in a liquid at ambient conditions. Finally, we develop a full thermodynamic model for water by including contributions to the free energy for isotropic square well attractions. We demonstrate that the model gives good representation of saturated liquid density, hydrogen bonding and vapor pressure. In addition, we show the full model predicts the anomalous minima in isothermal compressibility and isobaric heat capacity.",3
Large magnetoresistance effects in Fe3O4.,"We investigated the magnetoresistance (MR) of a single crystal of magnetite, Fe3O4. In an effort to distinguish between different contributions to the MR the samples were prepared in two different initial magnetic states, i.e. by either zero-field or by field cooling from room temperature. The different magnetic structures in this sample have a dramatic effect on the magnetoresistance: for initially zero-field-cooled conditions a negative MR of about -20% is observed just below the Verwey transition at [Formula: see text] K. For decreasing temperature the MR increases, changes sign at approximately 78 K and reaches a record positive value of approximately 45% at around 50 K. This behavior is completely absent in the field-cooled sample. Magnetization measurements corroborate an alignment of the easy magnetization direction in applied magnetic fields below [Formula: see text] as a cause of the strong effects observed in both, magnetization and MR. Our results point to a complex interplay of structural and magnetocrystalline effects taking place upon cooling Fe3O4 through [Formula: see text].",3
A polymerization scenario of the liquid-liquid transition of GeI4.,"SnI4 and GeI4 have been shown to exhibit similar polyamorphic nature. We examine the microscopic nature of the liquid-liquid transition in GeI4 by conducting an isothermal-isobaric molecular dynamics simulation for the system composed of rigid tetrahedral molecules. The model allows us to semiquantitatively discuss the structural properties of liquid GeI4 below 1 GPa. We define a physical bond between the nearest intermolecular iodine sites satisfying the conditions of forming the metallic I2 bond. We then focus on the formation of molecular clusters in dynamic networks of the bonds. The clusters are mainly formed by molecules whose nearest pairs are in edge-to-edge, face-to-edge, and vertex-to-edge orientations. The clusters grow as pressure increases, and the onset of percolation is observed below 1 GPa. The finite-size scaling analysis for the percolation probability identifies that the threshold pressure is [Formula: see text] GPa for the present model, which is near the extension of the boundary between the two liquid phases. We thus speculate that the liquid-liquid transition of GeI4 is attained by polymerization, i.e. percolation of molecular networks. The same percolation scenario with a slight modification such as introducing a bootstrap mechanism is expected to apply to the transition in liquid SnI4.",3
Realization of Weyl semimetal phase in a non-centrosymmetric superlattice in Kane-Mele model.,We investigate a superlattice alternately composed of quantum spin Hall insulators in Kane-Mele model and two-dimensional normal insulators due to the staggered lattice potential. The staggered lattice potential in normal insulators as a spacer layer has a role of breaking an inversion symmetry in current study. We show a realization of Weyl semimetal (WSM) phase in a finite region and a phase transition to a weak topological insulator. We estimate [Formula: see text] topological invariants by means of Wannier charge center method which is practical for non-centrosymmetric topological insulators. We also discuss Fermi arcs and chiral charges of WSM phase in surface Brillouin zone.,3
"Driven spheres, ellipsoids and rods in explicitly modeled polymer solutions.",Understanding the transport of driven nano- and micro-particles in complex fluids is of relevance for many biological and technological applications. Here we perform hydrodynamic multiparticle collision dynamics simulations of spherical and elongated particles driven through polymeric fluids containing different concentrations of polymers. We determine the mean particle velocities which are larger than expected from Stokes law for all particle shapes and polymer densities. Furthermore we measure the fluid flow fields and local polymer density and polymer conformation around the particles. We find that polymer-depleted regions close to the particles are responsible for an apparent tangential slip velocity which accounts for the measured flow fields and transport velocities. A simple two-layer fluid model gives a good match to the simulation results.,3
Tailoring the optical properties of MoS2 and WS2 single layers via organic functionalization.,"Tailoring the structural and electronic properties of 2D materials is fundamental to boost their use in a wide range of technological applications. In this paper, by means of first principles simulations, we show how methyl functionalization of MoS2 and WS2 monolayers can be employed to change their energy gap, tune their optoelectronic properties and modify the relative stability of their structural phases (or polytypes). In particular for both compound monolayers, we find that the most stable semiconducting H phase becomes metallic upon methyl functionalization, while in the metastable T' phase the band gap increases as a function of the -CH3 coverage; correspondingly the phase stability is reversed and the on-set of the optical absorption is blue-shifted.",3
Crossover from negative to positive magnetoresistance in Sr2CrWO6/Sr2Fe10/9Mo8/9O6 superlattices.,"Sr2CrWO6/Sr2Fe10/9Mo8/9O6 (SCWO/SFMO) superlattices with 4, 6, 7, 10 periods (abbreviated as S-1, S-2, S-3, and S-4) were prepared on (0 0 1) SrTiO3 (STO) substrates by pulsed laser deposition. All superlattices show macroscopic ferromagnetic behavior, and the magnetization increases with increasing period. The S-1 superlattice demonstrates semiconductor-like temperature-dependent resistivity in the whole measuring temperature range and negative magnetoresistance of -5.3% at 2 K with 2 T magnetic field, while the other superlattices illustrate metallic behaviors and increasing positive magnetoresistance of 223.1%, 275.4%, and 766.1% under the same conditions. This work not only provides a feasible way to tune the MR effect in magnetic perovskite oxides, but also may stimulate further work on artificially micro-structured thin films with designable magnetic properties.",3
Charge and spin transport on surfaces and atomic layers measured by multi-probe techniques.,"Thanks to advances in in situ measurement techniques for electrical transport in ultra-high vacuum together with emergent materials such as Rashba-type surfaces, topological insulators, atomic-layer superconductors, and 2D materials like graphene, surface states and edge states on crystals provide intriguing topics, e.g. dissipation-less currents, spin-polarized electric current, and pure spin current. This is due to broken symmetry and strong spin-orbit and electron-phonon interactions. Here we review some examples of experimental techniques of multi-probe methods at macroscopic and microscopic scales, followed by transport phenomena revealed by them. These are opening a field in condensed matter physics driven by symmetry breaking at surfaces and atomic layers.",3
Electronic and optical properties of metal decorated nitrogen-doped vacancy defects in graphene.,"We present a first principles study of the stability, and of the electronic and optical properties of graphene with nitrogen doped vacancies. Moreover, we use the vacancies as anchoring sites for Mg, Zn, Pd al Pt atoms and vary the concentration of defects. Decoration of the defects with metal atoms produces semi-metallic systems for any studied size of the cell, with linear bands crossing at the Fermi level. The peculiar electronic properties of massless Dirac fermions in graphene are hence kept, although with anisotropic Fermi velocities. New sharp peaks appear in the optical conductivity in the visible range, thus strongly enhancing the optical response of graphene.",3
Correlated annealing and formation of vacancy-hydrogen related complexes in silicon.,"We report on a deep level transient spectroscopy study of annealing kinetics of a deep, vacancy-hydrogen related level, labeled E5(*), at 0.42 eV below the conduction band in hydrogen-implanted n-type silicon. The E5(*) annealing correlates with the formation of another commonly observed vacancy-hydrogen related level, labeled E5, at 0.45 eV below the conduction band. The annealing of E5(*) and the formation of E5 exhibit first-order kinetics with an activation energy of 1.61 +/- 0.07 eV and a pre-factor of ~10(13)-10(14) s(-1). The pre-factor indicates a dissociation or structural transformation mechanism. The analysis of electron capture cross-sections for E5(*) and E5 reveals considerable transition entropies for both states and a temperature dependent capture cross-section for E5(*). Two possible identifications of E5(*) and E5 are put forward. Firstly, E5(*) can be attributed to V 2H2(-/0) or V 2H3(-/0), which dissociate with the emission of VH (E5). Secondly, E5(*) and E5 can be assigned to two different configurations of V 3H.",3
A revisit to the effect of annealing temperature on magnetic properties of LaFe0.5Mn0.5O3.,"We report an experimental study for the structural and magnetic properties of highly pure LaFe0.5Mn0.5O3 perovskite phase. The impurity free LaFe0.5Mn0.5O3 has been prepared by sol-gel technique at 500 degrees C and annealed at different temperatures up to 1000 degrees C. Previous works on LaFe0.5Mn0.5O3 revealed presence of secondary phases along with contradicting magnetic properties. Such as, Bhame et al (2005 Phys. Rev. B 72 054426-7) reported the superparamagnetic or spin-glass like behavior for 200 degrees C treated sample that persisted even at 700 degrees C sample. However, Wei et al (2012 Mater. Chem. Phys. 136 755-61) claimed room temperature ferromagnetism in all the samples annealed in the range of 600 degrees C-700 degrees C where the saturation magnetization decreases with the increase in temperature. These contradicting results lead us to revisit the effect of annealing temperature on the magnetic properties of LaFe0.5Mn0.5O3. We noticed a gradual increase in magnetization with increase in annealing temperatures without any signature of long range spin ordering for pure single phase samples. The increased magnetic moment with annealing temperatures has been attributed to the suppression of surface contribution of disordered spin. The low temperature magnetic behaviors can be explained by the interacting cluster glass behavior for the pristine as well as for 1000 degrees C annealed samples.",3
Numerical investigations on the electromagnetic enhancement effect to tip-enhanced Raman scattering and fluorescence processes.,"In the present work, we theoretically study the electromagnetic (EM) enhancement of the Raman and fluorescence signals for a molecule placed in a nanocavity formed by a metallic tip and substrate that mimics a tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) setup using three-dimensional finite element method calculations. The influence of tip size and tip-molecule distance on the EM enhancements of the incident field as well as the radiative and non-radiative decay rates of the molecule are systematically investigated. Simulation results show that the maximum EM enhancement to the incident light as provided by the localized surface plasmon resonance in the nanocavity can reach approximately 285 for the configuration considered in the present work. Meanwhile, it was found that, at the classical limit, decreasing the apex radius or the tip-molecule distance can both reduce the spatial distribution (as characterized by the full width at half maximum) of the Raman enhancement in a linear fashion. Moreover, simulation results show that the nonlocal dielectric response of the tip and the substrate plays a key role to the fluorescence quantum yield of the molecule. However, it was found that the strong EM excitation enhancement is the dominating factor for the tip enhanced fluorescence (TEF) effect and stronger fluorescence enhancement has been found when increasing the apex radius or reducing the tip-molecule distance with an incident wavelength of 532 nm. The best TERS and TEF enhancements were found to be approximately [Formula: see text] and approximately [Formula: see text], respectively, with the tip-molecule distance around 1 nm.",3
Fano effect in Aharonov-Bohm ring with topologically superconducting bridge.,"Taking into account an inner structure of the arms of the Aharonov-Bohm ring (AB ring) we have analyzed the transport features related to the topological phase transition which is induced in a superconducting wire (SC wire) with strong spin-orbit interaction (SOI). The SC wire acts as a bridge connecting the arms. The in-plane magnetic-field dependence of linear-response conductance obtained using the nonequilibrium Green's functions in the tight-binding approximation revealed the Breit-Wigner and Fano resonances (FRs) if the wire is in the nontrivial phase. The effect is explained by the presence of two interacting transport channels in the system. As a result, the FRs are attributed to bound states in continuum (BSCs). The BSC lifetime is determined by both hopping parameters between subsystems and the SC-wire properties. It is established that the FR width and position are extremely sensitive to the type of the lowest-energy excitation in the SC wire, the Majorana or Andreev bound state (MBS or ABS, respectively). Moreover, it is shown that in the specific case of the AB ring, the T-shape geometry, the FR disappears for the transport via the MBS and the conductance is equal to one quantum. It doubles in the local transport regime. On the contrary, in the ABS case the local conductance vanishes. The influence of the mean-field Coulomb interactions and diagonal disorder in the SC wire on the FR is investigated.",3
Structural transition in AuAgTe4 under pressure.,"Gold is inert and forms very few compounds. One of the most interesting of those is calaverite AuTe2, which has incommensurate structure and which becomes superconducting when doped or under pressure. There exist a 'sibling' of AuTe2, the mineral sylvanite AuAgTe4, which properties are almost unknown. In sylvanite Au and Ag ions are ordered in stripes, and Te6 octahedra around metals are distorted in such a way that Ag becomes linearly coordinated, what is typical for Ag(1+) , whereas Au is square coordinated-it is typical for d (8) configurations, i.e. one can assign to Au the valence 3+. Our theoretical study shows that at pressure [Formula: see text] GPa there should occur in it a structural transition such that above this critical pressure Te6 octahedra around Au and Ag become regular and practically identical. Simultaneously Te-Te dimers, existing at P = 0 GPa, disappear, and material from a bad metal becomes a usual metal with predominantly Te 5p states at the Fermi energy. We expect that, similar to AuTe2, AuAgTe4 should become superconducting above [Formula: see text].",3
Na-doping effects on structural evolution and superconductivity in (K1-x Na x )2Cr3As3 (x = 0-1).,"In this report, we studied the effects of isovalent Na-doping on the recently discovered quasi-one-dimensional Cr-based unconventional superconductor K2Cr3As3. A series of polycrystalline samples with nominal component (K1-x Na x )2Cr3As3 (x = 0-1) were synthesized by the solid state reaction method. From crystal structure and chemical phase characterizations, we found two distinct chemical phases with the same hexagonal structure but distinguished by different site occupancy of Na(+) ions at the two kinds of K-site in the K2Cr3As3 lattice structure. When x 0.4, the doped samples form a continuous sosoloid phase of (K1-x Na x )2Cr3As3 with the Na(+) ions randomly doping at the K-sites (denoted as alpha-phase); when x 0.5, a novel individual phase of (K0.25Na0.75)2Cr3As3 emerges, in which the Na(+) ions selectively occupy all the '3k' sites and the K(+) ions occupy the '1c' sites (denoted as beta-phase). No chemical phase of Na2Cr3As3 was detected. Superconductivity in these samples was studied by electrical transport and magnetic susceptibility measurements, and it evolves in a much sophisticated manner. In the alpha-phase, the superconducting T c decreases quickly upon Na-doping. All these alpha-phase samples have surprisingly low superconducting volume fraction and relatively low T c compared with the undoped K2Cr3As3. However, the beta-phase has a clearly enhanced T c up to 7.6 K which locates between the values of K2Cr3As3 and Na2Cr3As3, and exhibits a full superconducting shielding signal.",3
A high-quality spin and valley beam splitter in WSe2 tunnelling junction through the Goos-Hanchen shift.,"We have theoretically studied the Goos-Hanchen shift of spin and valley electron in single and double barrier WSe2 tunnelling junctions. For single barrier structure, it has shown that a two-fold degenerate lateral shift induced by the spin-valley locking occurs at Fabry-Perot resonance width. By introducing the ferromagnetic exchange field, one spin and valley dependent lateral shift can be further obtained. Different from single barrier structure, the double barrier structure exhibits two series of Fabry-Perot interferences with lateral shifts exceeding thousands of Fermi wavelengths due to the effect of localized states, and more important, these interferences generated between two potential barriers are even higher than the shift formed inside of two potential barriers. In addition, for a specified Fermi energy, one can modulate the desired spatial separation of spin and valley beam by controlling the incident angle or potential barrier. Our results demonstrate that the proposed WSe2 double barrier structure is a fascinating candidate for designing high-quality spin and valley beam splitter.",3
Oscillations of the bandgap with size in armchair and zigzag graphene quantum dots.,"We determine here the evolution of the bandgap energy with size in graphene quantum dots (GQDs). We find oscillatory behaviour of the bandgap and explain its origin in terms of armchair and zigzag edges. The electronic energy spectra of GQDs are computed using both the tight binding model and ab initio density functional methods. The results of the tight binding model are analyzed by dividing zigzag graphene quantum dots into concentric rings. For each ring, the energy spectra, the wave functions and the bandgap are obtained analytically. The effect of inter-ring tunneling on the energy gap is determined. The growth of zigzag terminated GQD into armchair GQD is shown to be associated with the addition of a one-dimensional Lieb lattice of carbon atoms with a shell of energy levels in the middle of the energy gap of the inner zigzag terminated GQD. This introduces a different structure of the energy levels at the bottom of the conduction and top of the valence band in zigzag and armchair GQD which manifests itself in the oscillation of the energy gap with increasing size. The evolution of the bandgap with the number of carbon atoms is compared with the notion of confined Dirac Fermions and tested against ab initio calculations of Kohn-Sham and TD-DFT energy gaps.",3
Klein tunnelling and Hartman effect in graphene junctions with proximity exchange field.,"Tunnelling of electrons in graphene-based junctions is studied theoretically. Graphene is assumed to be deposited either directly on a ferromagnetic insulator or on a few atomic layers of boron nitride which separate graphene from a metallic ferromagnetic substrate. Such junctions can be formed by appropriate external gating of the corresponding system. To describe low-energy electronic states near the Dirac points, certain effective Hamiltonians available in the relevant literature are used. These Hamiltonians include staggered potential and exchange interaction due to ferromagnetic substrates. Tunnelling in the systems under consideration is then spin-dependent. The main focus is on Klein tunnelling and also on the group delay and the associated Hartman effect. The impact of a gap induced in the spectrum at the Dirac points on tunnelling is analysed in detail.",3
Anisotropy of W-band complex permittivity in Al2O3.,"The dielectric anisotropy of Al2O3 is studied here by characterizing W-band (75-110 GHz) complex permittivity of four different orientations of sapphire (Al2O3 single crystals). This was done using free-space, focused beam methods. Dielectric polarizability ([Formula: see text]) of these orientations is then calculated and these values are related to their complex permittivity. Based on this relationship, a framework is developed for rapid and straightforward estimation of dielectric anisotropy using a known crystal structure and a dielectric permittivity measurement performed on one orientation of the material. This framework can be applied to other materials with dielectric anisotropy (e.g. SnO2, LiGaO2) to predict permittivity for different orientations, enabling rapid design of high-frequency systems (e.g. radomes, electromagnetic windows). These permittivity measurements were also used to determine the dominant polarization mechanisms leading to dielectric anisotropy of Al2O3 in the W-band; electronic and ionic polarization orthogonal to the direction of the focused beam.",3
Thermodynamic heterogeneity and crossover in the supercritical state of matter.,"A hallmark of a thermodynamic phase transition is the qualitative change of system thermodynamic properties such as energy and heat capacity. On the other hand, no phase transition is thought to operate in the supercritical state of matter and, for this reason, it was believed that supercritical thermodynamic properties vary smoothly and without any qualitative changes. Here, we perform extensive molecular dynamics simulations in a wide temperature range and find that a deeply supercritical state is thermodynamically heterogeneous, as witnessed by different temperature dependence of energy, heat capacity and its derivatives at low and high temperature. The evidence comes from three different methods of analysis, two of which are model-independent. We propose a new definition of the relative width of the thermodynamic crossover and calculate it to be in the fairly narrow relative range of 13%-20%. On the basis of our results, we relate the crossover to the supercritical Frenkel line.",3
Antiferromagnetic skyrmions overcoming obstacles in a racetrack.,"Topological objects interacting with lattice defects is an important topic in condensed matter physics. In this paper, we would like to explore the ballistic trajectory of an antiferromagnetic skyrmion in a racetrack to study processes such as collisions of skyrmions and holes in the magnetic sample. The skyrmion is impelled against the hole-obstacle by means of a spin polarized current. Depending on the skyrmion velocity (associated to the strength of the applied current) and the type of collision (frontal or lateral), it will be captured, scattered or completely destroyed by the hole. In some cases, this obstacle can shift the skyrmion center from a straight line to another one, and it appears as an effective way of manipulating skyrmion trajectories and dynamics.",3
"Relating local structures, energies, and occurrence probabilities in a two-dimensional silica network.","Recently, it became possible to experimentally generate and characterize a very thin silica system on a substrate which can be basically described as a 2D random network. The key structural properties, in particular related to the ring statistics, could be numerically reproduced by performing molecular dynamics simulations with an appropriately chosen 2D force field. Using a maximum entropy formulation it is shown that the probability distribution of the individual rings and triplets can be related to the ring and triplet energies, respectively, obtained from the simulations. Using additional Lagrange parameters, the correct average properties of random networks are guaranteed. In agreement with previous work, based on distributions of complementary rings and triplets, respectively, one finds a Boltzmann-type relation albeit with an effective temperature which largely deviates from the bath temperature. Furthermore, it is shown that the ring and triplet energies can be estimated based on the properties of their average inner angles. This calculation supports, on a quantitative level, the previously suggested angle mismatch theory. It suggests that correlations among adjacent rings originate from the net mismatch in the inner ring angles in a triplet of rings. By taking into account an average effect from the surrounding rings of a triplet, an even better estimate of the correlations can be provided. That approach is also applied to estimate the Aboav-Wearie parameter.",3
Corrigendum: Self-consistent description of local density dynamics in simple liquids. The Case of Molten Lithium (2018 J. Phys.: Condens. Matter} 30 085102).,We inform about typos in our article [Mokshin A V and Galimzyanov B N 2018 J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 30 085102].,3
"From qualitative to quantitative description of the anomalous thermoelastic behavior of V, Nb, Ta, Pd and Pt.","To study the anomalous thermoelastic behavior of bcc V, Nb, Ta as well as fcc Pd and Pt a density functional theory (DFT) based model is used, which allows for the calculation of the elastic constant [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] as a function of temperature. Available experimental [Formula: see text] trends are correctly reproduced indicating that the electronic structure mechanisms enabling anomalous behavior are captured by the model. A DFT based correlative investigation between V, Nb, Ta, Pd and Pt with anomalous thermoelastic properties and Mo and Cu with ordinary behavior reveals a high density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level to be a necessary but not sufficient condition for an anomalous thermoelastic behavior. In addition, anomalous metals in contrast to ordinary metals reallocate electronic states in the vicinity of the Fermi level upon lattice distortion, causing an increase in bond strength as identified by crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) analysis. Hence, we have identified the combination of high DOS and electronic reallocation upon lattice distortion to be the physical origin for anomalous thermoelastic behavior in metals. The absence of an anomaly for [Formula: see text]-type distortion in V, Nb, Ta, Pd and Pt is suggested to be due to the less pronounced reallocation of states compared to [Formula: see text]-type distortion.",3
Quantum transport through the edge states of zigzag phosphorene nanoribbons in presence of a single point defect: analytic Green's function method.,"Zigzag phosphorene nanoribbons have quasi-flat band edge modes entirely detached from bulk states. We analytically study the electronic transport through such edge states in the presence of a localized defect for semi-infinite and finite ribbon widths. Using the tight-binding model, we derive analytical expressions for the Green's function and transmission amplitude of both pristine and defective nanoribbons. We find that the transmission of ribbons with both semi-infinite and finite width is sensitive to the location of a single impurity defect with respect to the edge. By the presence of an impurity on the outermost edge site of the ribbon, the transmission through the edge channel, similar to a one-dimensional chain, strongly suppresses for the entire energy spectrum of the quasi-flat band. In contrast, the transmission of low-energy [Formula: see text] states, is robust as the impurity is moved one position far away from the edge on the same sub-lattice. The analytical calculations are also complemented by exact numerical transport computations using the Landauer approach.",3
High-temperature superconductivity in ternary clathrate YCaH12 under high pressures.,"Binary hydrogen-rich compounds with H clathrate structures can serve as high-temperature superconductors under high pressures. Here, a novel ternary clathrate structure YCaH12 with space group Pm-3m is uncovered at high pressure using ab initio methods. It is predicted that YCaH12 can be stable above 180 GPa and decomposes into YH6 and CaH6 above 257 GPa. Our calculations show that YCaH12 is a potential high-temperature superconductor with T c of 230 K at 180 GPa owing to the strong electron-phonon coupling related to the optical phonon softening of H-cages. The pre-eminent pressure-induced superconductive behavior under attainable pressure is encouraging in the ternary hydrides.",3
Lateral heterostructures and one-dimensional interfaces in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides.,"The growth and exfoliation of two-dimensional (2D) materials have led to the creation of edges and novel interfacial states at the juncture between crystals with different composition or phases. These hybrid heterostructures (HSs) can be built as vertical van der Waals stacks, resulting in a 2D interface, or as stitched adjacent monolayer crystals, resulting in one-dimensional (1D) interfaces. Although most attention has been focused on vertical HSs, increasing theoretical and experimental interest in 1D interfaces is evident. In-plane interfacial states between different 2D materials inherit properties from both crystals, giving rise to robust states with unique 1D non-parabolic dispersion and strong spin-orbit effects. With such unique characteristics, these states provide an exciting platform for realizing 1D physics. Here, we review and discuss advances in 1D heterojunctions, with emphasis on theoretical approaches for describing those between semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides MX 2 (with M = Mo, W and X = S, Se, Te), and how the interfacial states can be characterized and utilized. We also address how the interfaces depend on edge geometries (such as zigzag and armchair) or strain, as lattice parameters differ across the interface, and how these features affect excitonic/optical response. This review is intended to serve as a resource for promoting theoretical and experimental studies in this rapidly evolving field.",3
Space charge layer effects in silicon studied by in situ surface transport.,"Electronic properties of low dimensional structures on surfaces can be comprehensively explored by surface transport experiments. However, the surface sensitivity of this technique to atomic structures comes along with the control of bulk related electron paths and internal interfaces. Here we analyzed the role of Schottky-barriers and space charge layers for Si-surfaces. By means of a metal submonolayer coverage deposited on vicinal Si(1 1 1), we reliably accessed subsurface transport channels via angle- and temperature-dependent in situ transport measurements. In particular, high temperature treatments performed under ultra high vacuum conditions led to the formation of surface-near bulk defects, e.g. SiC-interstitials. Obviously, these defects act as p-type dopants and easily overcompensate lightly n-doped Si substrates.",3
Low-temperature preferential oxidation of CO over Ag monolayer decorated Mo2C (MXene) for purifying H2.,"Selective removal of CO from reformate streams at low temperature is an important issue to be solved for anode catalysts of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Using density functional theory, we demonstrate that the Ag monolayer decorated Mo2C can be used as an effective low cost catalyst with high activity, selectivity and stability for preferential oxidation of CO. Ag monolayer decorated Mo2C can also be used as a filter membrane for separating H2 and CO. Meanwhile, the high selectivity is achieved because H2 hardly takes part in the reaction, and the good activity is obtained since the CO with moderate binding strength could be smoothly removed at various CO concentration. We propose a facile route for removing CO by injecting low O2 supply because it can resist CO poisoning with promoted activity for CO oxidation at higher CO concentration. We anticipate that Ag monolayer decorated Mo2C can be used as a promising H2 purifying pretreater by preferential oxidation of CO connecting to the anode of PEMFCs. We hope the present results could advance the development of catalysts for purifying H2 and inspire more researches on the application of MXene catalysts.",3
Analytical interatomic bond-order potential for simulations of oxygen defects in iron.,"We present an analytical bond-order potential for the Fe-O system, capable of reproducing the basic properties of wustite as well as the energetics of oxygen impurities in [Formula: see text]-iron. The potential predicts binding energies of various small oxygen-vacancy clusters in [Formula: see text]-iron in good agreement with density functional theory results, and is therefore suitable for simulations of oxygen-based defects in iron. We apply the potential in simulations of the stability and structure of Fe/FeO interfaces and FeO precipitates in iron, and observe that the shape of FeO precipitates can change due to formation of well-defined Fe/FeO interfaces. The interface with crystalline Fe also ensures that the precipitates never become fully amorphous, no matter how small they are.",3
A sum rule of uniaxial anisotropy and external magnetic field for formation of Neel-type skyrmion lattices in two-dimensional ferromagnets.,"It is generally believed that the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) plays an important role in stabilizing skyrmion lattices (SkL) in two-dimensional (2D) magnetic systems in which both Heisenberg exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions co-exist, and the skyrmion sizes in SkLs are mainly determined by the strengths of these two intrinsic interactions. To investigate the details, we employ here a quantum computational approach we develop in recent years to simulate the Neel-type skyrmion lattices formed on a 2D PdFe/Ir(1 1 1)-like film. From our simulated results, we find that: within an external magnetic field applied normal to the film plane, the PMA is indeed able to help induce Neel-type SkLs in a wider field range; however, to stabilize the SkLs, the PMA cannot be too strong, the strengths of the external magnetic field and the maximal PMA must satisfy a sum rule since the effective perpendicular magnetic field generated by these two interactions cannot exceed a largest value. We also notice that the periodical boundary condition imposed on the FM system in simulations is able to facilitate SkL formations, and it can also modify the skyrmion size in a certain extend.",3
Practical band interpolation with a modified tight-binding method.,"We present a scheme that interpolates the energy bands of a crystal with a modified tight-binding Hamiltonian. We start from a pseudopotential plane-wave calculation of the eigenvalues in a three-dimensional coarse uniform grid of k-points in the Brillouin zone and from the evaluation of the single particle Hamiltonian and overlap matrix elements for a small localised basis set of atomic orbitals in the same k-point grid. A simple matrix manipulation procedure that replaces the eigenvalues obtained from the atomic orbital method by the eigenvalues of the plane-wave method generates the modified tight-binding Hamiltonian on the coarse grid. A subsequent three-dimensional Fourier interpolation of the modified tight-binding Hamiltonian and overlap matrices leads to a fast, yet accurate, determination of interpolated Hamiltonians and overlap matrices at an arbitrary k-point, or in a denser grid of k-points. We present examples of the application of the scheme to density functional calculations of germanium, graphite, graphene, copper and a SiGe superlattice.",3
Molten barium titanate: a high-pressure liquid silicate analogue.,"The structure of molten BaTiO3 has been measured using laser heating, aerodynamic levitation and a combination of neutron diffraction with Ti isotope substitution, x-ray diffraction and spectroscopy. All measurements indicate a Ti-O coordination of n TiO = 4.4(2), far lower than the perovskite or hexagonal crystalline forms. However, n TiO > 4 suggests structural analogy with molten silicates at high pressures. We introduce methodology for ascertaining such analogies and demonstrate similarity with molten CaSiO3 at upper mantle pressures circa 5 GPa. Although some topological differences exist, we propose that planetary melt analogues provide rich insight into important processes relevant to hot exoplanets and Earth's early history.",3
Corrigendum: Statistical thermodynamics and magnetic moments of Landau quantized group VI dichalcogenides (2018 <i>J. Phys.: Condens.

Thermal properties and segregation phenomena in transition metals and alloys: modeling based on modified cohesive-energies.,"In spite of free-atom electronic-relaxation contributions to transition-metal cohesive-energies, numerous studies have misused the latter instead of using the solid-state interatomic bond-energy in modeling bulk and surface properties. This work reveals that eliminating the free-atom contributions from experimental cohesive-energies leads to highly accurate linear correlations of the resultant bond-energies with melting temperatures and enthalpies, as well as with inverse thermal-expansion coefficients, specifically for the fcc transition-metals. Likewise, predictions of surface segregation phenomena in Cu-Pd and Au-Pd alloys on the basis of the modified energetics are in much better agreement with reported low-energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEISS) experimental results, as compared to the use of cohesive-energy values. A last demonstration of the problem and its solution involves the significant impact of the modification on segregation (separation) phase transitions in Cu-Ni model nanoparticles.",3
Reversing the thermal equilibration by differential magneto-thermal force.,"A special magnetic body force, the differential magneto-thermal (DMT) force, was proposed to reverse thermal equilibration by 'pushing' a fluid element colder than its surroundings to a colder region, and a fluid element hotter than its surroundings to a hotter region [1]. In this work, we discuss the fulfilment of the requirements for this force and the experiment to verify it. We present experimental and analytical results that clearly demonstrate: (1) approaching thermal equilibrium in our magnetic fluid sample was indeed 'reversed' as the magnetic body force introduces the localized flows that stop the conventional convective heat transfer; (2) the DMT force density calculated with experimental parameters agrees with the design principle. These results prove the feasibility of the predicted mechanism for a new generation of heat transfer apparatus that can transfer heat energy with higher efficiency than the ones discussed in textbooks, such as heat engines.",3
Covalent organic framework with high capacity for the lithium ion battery anode: insight into intercalation of Li from first-principles calculations.,"Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) generally have high stability, large charge capacity and wide ion diffusion paths, and they may serve as the potential electrode materials for lithium ion batteries. Here we explored the structural, electronic, and lithium-storage properties of the newly synthesized NUS-2 COF material by first-principles calculations. The present results indicate that the micropore environment and the presence of the carbonyl oxygens in the NUS-2 COF can prevent the formation of lithium dimer and the aggregation of lithium bulk, which can improve lithiation efficiency. The predicted maximum theoretical capacity is as high as 742.8 mAh g(-1) and the average cell voltage varies from 3.35 V for Li@NUS-2 to 2.04 V for 14Li@NUS-2, suggesting that the NUS-2 COF material should be a quite suitable lithium-storage anode material.",3
Hydrogel micromotors with catalyst-containing liquid core and shell.,"Methacrylic anhydride-derived hydrogel microcapsules have unique properties, including reversibly tunable permeation, purification, and separation of dissolved molecular species. Endowing these dynamic encapsulant systems with autonomous motion will significantly enhance their efficiency and applicability. Here, hydrogel micromotors are realized using complex water-in-oil-in-water double emulsion drops and oil-in-water emulsion drops from glass capillary microfluidics and subsequent photopolymerization. Three hydrogel micromotor strategies are explored: microcapsules with thin shells and liquid cores with dispersed catalytic Pt nanoparticles, as well as water-cored microcapsules and homogeneous microparticles selectively coated with Ti/Pt catalytic layers. Autonomous motion of hydrogel particles and capsules is realized in hydrogen peroxide solutions, where generated oxygen microbubbles propel the dynamically responsive micromotors. The micromotors are balanced by weight, buoyancy, lateral capillary forces and show specific autonomous behaviours that significantly extend short range dynamic responses of hydrogels. Drop-based microfluidics represent a paradigm shift in the integration of multifunctional subsystems and high-throughput design of chemical micromachines in reasonable quantities towards their desired biomedical, environmental and flow/diffusion microreactor applications.",3
Critical current density and flux pinning in BaFe1.9Pt0.1As2 and La doped Ba0.95La0.05Fe1.9Pt0.1As2 polycrystals.,"We present the field and temperature dependence of the magnetizations of BaFe1.9Pt0.1As2 and Ba0.95La0.05Fe1.9Pt0.1As2 samples synthesized by solid-state reaction method. The samples were formed as a single phase in the ThCr2Si2-type structure. Replacing Ba with the smaller La atom results in a lattice shrinkage. The critical current, J c (H, T) has been determined (using Bean's critical state model) from magnetic hysteresis loops in a temperature range between T = 5 K and the superconducting transition temperatures (20 K), in fields up to H = 9 T. We find a nonmonotonic 'fishtail' shape (exhibiting a second peak) of the magnetization loops as well as a very large irreversibility. We observe a remarkable flux jump at T = 5 K for BaFe1.9Pt0.1As2 due to magneto-thermal instability, but a very sharp magnetization peak for Ba0.95La0.05Fe1.9Pt0.1As2 near H = 0, which corresponds to a much-reduced relaxation rate of vortices. J c decreases exponentially with temperature as well as with field in lower temperatures and fields ranges. La doping causes a considerable increase in the irreversibility, leading to a significant enhancement of J c. The analysis shows that the high J c is mainly due to collective (weak) pinning of vortices by dense microscopic point defects with some contribution from a strong pinning mechanism. The normalized pinning force F p/F p,max as a function of the reduced magnetic field h = H/H irr is also obtained. Using the approaches of Dew-Hughes (1974 Phil. Mag. 30 293) and Kramer (1973 J. Appl. Phys. 44 1360), we determine the nature of the pining sources. It is found that many different pinning mechanisms are active simultaneously. The modified expression of F p/F p,max based on collective pinning theory enables us to determine the field dependence of the relaxation rate S(H, T = 5 K) indirectly instead of using more difficult relaxation measurements. Finally, all drastic changes with La doping are clearly demonstrated and investigated under different models introduced in the literature.",3
Spin-orbit split two-dimensional states of BiTeI/Au(1 1 1) interfaces.,"We present an ab initio study of interfaces formed by placing a single trilayer of BiTeI on the Au(1 1 1) surface. We consider two possible interfaces with the parallel and antiparallel orientation of the trilayer dipole moment with respect to the surface normal, i.e. Te-Bi-I/Au(1 1 1) and I-Bi-Te/Au(1 1 1). We show that the resulting interface state that originates from the modified spin-orbit split surface state of the clean Au(1 1 1) surface resides at high energy above the Fermi level and acquires a large spin-splitting and reversal helicity as compared with the original surface state. The former lowest conduction state of the trilayer, which is one of the hitherto known giant Rashba spin-split states of few-atomic-layer structures, becomes partly occupied. In the I-Bi-Te/Au(1 1 1) interface, this state represents a Rashba system with strong spin-orbit interaction, where the outer branch of the spin-split state is mostly populated.",3
Role of grain boundaries in Ge-Sb-Te based chalcogenide superlattices.,"Interfacial phase change memory devices based on a distinct nanoscale structure called superlattice have been shown to outperform conventional phase-change devices. This improvement has been attributed to the hetero-interfaces, which play an important role for the superior device characteristics. However, the impact of grain boundaries (GBs), usually present in large amounts in a standard sputter-deposited superlattice film, on the device performance has not yet been investigated. Therefore, in the present work, we investigate the structure and composition of superlattice films by high resolution x-ray diffraction (XRD) cross-linked with state-of-the art methods, such as correlative microscopy, i.e. a combination of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography to determine the structure and composition of GBs at the nanometer scale. Two types of GBs have been identified: high-angle grain boundaries (HAGBs) present in the upper part of a 340 nm-thick film and low-angle grain boundaries present in the first 40 nm of the bottom part of the film close to the substrate. We demonstrate that the strongest intermixing takes place at HAGBs, where heterogeneous nucleation of Ge2Sb2Te5 can be clearly determined. Yet, the Ge1Sb2Te4 phase could also be detected in the near vicinity of a low-angle grain boundary. Finally, a more realistic view of the intermixing phenomenon in Ge-Sb-Te based chalcogenide superlattices will be proposed. Moreover, we will discuss the implications of the presence of GBs on the bonding states and device performance.",3
Dynamical screening in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides and its manifestations in the exciton spectrum.,"Monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (ML-TMDs) offer exciting opportunities to test the manifestations of many-body interactions through changes in the charge density. The two-dimensional character and reduced screening in ML-TMDs lead to the formation of neutral and charged excitons with binding energies orders of magnitude larger than those in conventional bulk semiconductors. Tuning the charge density by a gate voltage leads to profound changes in the optical spectra of excitons in ML-TMDs. On the one hand, the increased screening at large charge densities should result in a blueshift of the exciton spectral lines due to reduction in the binding energy. On the other hand, exchange and correlation effects that shrink the band-gap energy at elevated charge densities (band-gap renormalization) should result in a redshift of the exciton spectral lines. While these competing effects can be captured through various approximations that model long-wavelength charge excitations in the Bethe-Salpeter equation, we show that a novel coupling between excitons and shortwave charge excitations is essential to resolve several experimental puzzles. Unlike ubiquitous and well-studied plasmons, driven by collective oscillations of the background charge density in the long-wavelength limit, we discuss the emergence of shortwave plasmons that originate from the short-range Coulomb interaction through which electrons transition between the [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] valleys. The shortwave plasmons have a finite energy-gap because of the removal of spin-degeneracy in both the valence- and conduction-band valleys (a consequence of breaking of inversion symmetry in combination with strong spin-orbit coupling in ML-TMDs). We study the coupling between the shortwave plasmons and the neutral exciton through the self-energy of the latter. We then elucidate how this coupling as well as the spin ordering in the conduction band give rise to an experimentally observed optical sideband in electron-doped W-based MLs, conspicuously absent in electron-doped Mo-based MLs or any hole-doped ML-TMDs. While the focus of this review is on the optical manifestations of many-body effects in ML-TMDs, a systematic description of the dynamical screening and its various approximations allow one to revisit other phenomena, such as nonequilibrium transport or superconducting pairing, where the use of the Bethe-Salpeter equation or the emergence of shortwave plasmons can play an important role.",3
Electron spin resonance on the spin-1/2 triangular magnet NaYbS2.,"The delafossite structure of NaYbS2 contains a planar spin-1/2 triangular lattice of Yb(3+) ions and features a possible realisation of a quantum spin-liquid state. We investigated the Yb(3+) spin dynamics by electron spin resonance (ESR) in single-crystalline samples of NaYbS2. Very clear spectra with a well-resolved and large anisotropy could be observed down to the lowest accessible temperature of 2.7 K. In contrast to the ESR properties of other known spin-liquid candidate systems, the resonance seen in NaYbS2 is accessible at low fields (<1 T) and is narrow enough for accurate characterisation of the relaxation rate as well as the g factor of the Yb(3+) spins.",3
Ligand hyperfine interactions at silicon vacancies in 4H-SiC.,"The negative silicon vacancy ([Formula: see text]) in SiC has recently emerged as a promising defect for quantum communication and room-temperature quantum sensing. However, its electronic structure is still not well characterized. While the isolated Si vacancy is expected to give rise to only two paramagnetic centers corresponding to two inequivalent lattice sites in 4H-SiC, there have been five electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) centers assigned to [Formula: see text] in the past: the so-called isolated no-zero-field splitting (ZFS) [Formula: see text] center and another four axial configurations with small ZFS: T V1a, T V2a, T V1b, and T V2b. Due to overlapping with (29)Si hyperfine (hf) structures in EPR spectra of natural 4H-SiC, hf parameters of T V1a have not been determined. Using isotopically enriched 4H-(28)SiC, we overcome the problems of signal overlapping and observe hf parameters of nearest C neighbors for all three components of the S = 3/2 T V1a and T V2a centers. The obtained EPR data support the conclusion that only T V1a and T V2a are related to [Formula: see text] and the two configurations of the so-called isolated no-ZFS [Formula: see text] center, [Formula: see text] (I) and [Formula: see text] (II), are actually the central lines corresponding to the transition |-1/2> <--> |+1/2> of the T V2a and T V1a centers, respectively.",3
How adsorbates alter the metallic behavior of quasi-1D electron systems of the Si(5 5 3)-Au surface.,"The plasmonic signals of quasi-1D electron systems are a clear and direct measure of their metallic behavior. Due to the finite size of such systems in reality, plasmonic signals from a gold-induced superstructure on Si(5 5 3) can be studied with infrared spectroscopy. The infrared spectroscopic features have turned out to be extremely sensitive to adsorbates. Even without geometrical changes of the surface superstructure, the effects of doping, of the adsorbate induced electronic surface scattering, and of the electronic polarizability changes on top of the substrate surface give rise to measurable changes of the plasmonic signal. Especially strong changes of the plasmonic signal have been observed for gold, oxygen, and hydrogen exposure. The plasmonic resonance gradually disappears under these exposures, indicating the transion to an insulating behavior, which is in accordance with published results obtained from other experimental methods. For C70 and, as shown here for the first time, TAPP-Br, the plasmonic signal almost retains its original intensity even up to coverages of many monolayers. For C70, the changes of the spectral shape, e.g. of electronic damping and of the resonance position, were also found to be marginal. On the other hand, TAPP-Br adsorption shifts the plasmonic resonance to higher frequencies and strongly increases the electronic damping. Given the dispersion relation for plasmonic resonances of 1D electron systems, the findings for TAPP-Br indicate a push-back effect and therefore stronger confinement of the free charge carriers in the quasi-one-dimensonal channel due to the coverage by the flat TAPP-Br molecules. On the gold-doped Si(5 5 3)-Au surface TAPP-Br acts as counter dopant and increases the plasmonic signal.",3
"Lieb and hole-doped ferrimagnetism, spiral, resonating valence-bond states, and phase separation in large-U AB 2 Hubbard chains.","The ground state (GS) properties of the quasi-one-dimensional AB 2 Hubbard model are investigated taking the effects of charge and spin quantum fluctuations on equal footing. In the strong-coupling regime, a functional integral representation allows us to derive a low-energy Lagrangian suitable to describe the ferrimagnetic phase at half filling and the phases in the hole-doped regime. At half filling, a perturbative spin-wave analysis allows us to find the GS energy, sublattice magnetizations, and total spin per unit cell in the Lieb ferrimagnetic GS of the effective quantum Heisenberg model, in very good agreement with previous results. In the challenging hole doping regime away from half filling, we derive the corresponding [Formula: see text] Hamiltonian. Under the assumption that charge and spin quantum correlations are decoupled, the evolution of the second-order spin-wave modes in the doped regime unveils the occurrence of spatially modulated spin structures and the emergence of phase separation in the presence of resonating-valence-bond states. We also calculate the doping-dependent GS energy and total spin per unit cell, including both Zeeman and orbital contributions, in which case it is shown that the spiral ferrimagnetic order collapses at a critical hole concentration. Notably, our analytical results in the doped regime are in very good agreement with density matrix renormalization group studies, where our assumption of spin-charge decoupling is numerically supported by the formation of charge-density waves in anti-phase with the modulation of the magnetic structure.",3
Quantum dissonance in chiral graphene nanoribbons.,"Based on the effective spin-ladder model, we study the properties of quantum dissonance (Q) between two edge spins in chiral graphene nanoribbons (CGNRs) thermalized with a reservoir at temperature T, and discuss the influences of relative location between two edge spins, ribbon width, temperature, and on-site Coulomb repulsion (U) on Q. The results show that Q is widely present in Wannier edge states. For intra-edge coupled spin pairs, quantum entanglement (E) is zero, but there still exists considerable value of Q. Interestingly, Q always keeps a constant for entangled edge spin pairs. Considering the thermal effect, it shows that Q always decays with the increasing temperature T, and the decay rate is very sensitive to the intensity of U. Compared Q with E and total quantum correlation (quantum discord, denoted by D), we conjecture that the quantum correlations for a bipartite Wannier edge state in CGNRs satisfy the relation Q D-E.",3
Elucidating the origin of magnetic ordering in ferroelectric BaTiO3- d thin film via electronic structure modification.,"With the motive of unraveling the origin of native vacancy induced magnetization in ferroelectric perovskite oxide systems, here we explore the consequences of electronic structure modification in magnetic ordering of oxygen deficient epitaxial BaTiO[Formula: see text] thin films. Our adapted methodology employs state-of-the-art experimental approaches viz. photo-emission, photo-absorption spectroscopies, magnetometric measurements duly combined with first principles based theoretical methods within the frame work of density functional theory (DFT and DFT+U) calculations. Oxygen vacancy (O[Formula: see text]) is observed leading partial population of Ti 3d (t 2g ), which induces defect state in electronic structure near the Fermi level and reduces the band gap. The oxygen deficient BaTiO2.75 film reveals Mott-Hubbard insulator characteristic, in contrast to the band gap insulating nature of the stoichiometric BaTiO3. The observed magnetic ordering is attributed to the asymmetric distribution of spin polarized charge density in the vicinity of O[Formula: see text] site, which originates unequal magnetic moment values at first and second nearest neighboring Ti sites, respectively. Hereby, we present an exclusive method for maneuvering the band gap and on-site electron correlation energy with consequences on magnetic properties of BaTiO[Formula: see text] system, which can open a gateway for designing novel single phase multiferroic system.",3
Convergence of surface energy calculations for various methods: (0 0 1) hematite as benchmark.,"Different methods for calculating the surface energy from ab initio simulations are applied to the relaxed (0 0 1) surface of the metal oxide hematite ([Formula: see text]-Fe2O3). The simulations are carried out with a rather moderate k-point grid with shrinking factors of (6 6 6) for all bulk and (6 6) for all slab simulations. Very good convergence is obtained if a linear fit of the slab energies with respect to the number of layers in the slab is performed. In comparison to the other methods employed, this procedure is ultimately the most accurate and reliable method for extracting convergent surface energies from (0 0 1) hematite slabs. Additionally, we propose a way to determine the least possible starting point for calculating the surface energy by the linear-fit method. Furthermore, we find the Boettger method to perform nearly equally well, if the bulk energy is extracted from the energy difference per layer between the slabs with 12 and 18 layers thickness. Both methods give a surface energy of 2.43 J m(-2) with a deviation of less than [Formula: see text]0.005 J m(-2). The standard approach, which uses a separate bulk simulation, instead shows a significant linear divergence with increasing number of layers in the slab. We also carried out bulk simulations with a surface-oriented bulk unit cell, but found it in our case not to improve the convergence of the standard approach.",3
Collision cascades overlapping with self-interstitial defect clusters in Fe and W.,"Overlap of collision cascades with previously formed defect clusters become increasingly likely at radiation doses typical for materials in nuclear reactors. Using molecular dynamics, we systematically investigate the effects of different pre-existing self-interstitial clusters on the damage produced by an overlapping cascade in bcc iron and tungsten. We find that the number of new Frenkel pairs created in direct overlap with an interstitial cluster is reduced to essentially zero, when the size of the defect cluster is comparable to that of the disordered cascade volume. We develop an analytical model for this reduced defect production as a function of the spatial overlap between a cascade and a defect cluster of a given size. Furthermore, we discuss cascade-induced changes in the morphology of self-interstitial clusters, including transformations between [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] dislocation loops in iron and tungsten, and between C15 clusters and dislocation loops in iron. Our results provide crucial new cascade-overlap effects to be taken into account in multi-scale modelling of radiation damage in bcc metals.",3
Manipulating quantum spins by spin-polarized current: an approach based upon [Formula: see text]-symmetric quantum mechanics.,We propose a quantum processor based upon single-molecule magnets and spin transfer torque described by [Formula: see text]-symmetric quantum mechanics. In recent years [Formula: see text]-symmetric Hamiltonians have been used to obtain stability thresholds of various systems out of equilibrium. One such problem is the magnetization reversal due to the spin transfer torque generated by a spin-polarized current. So far the studies of this problem have mostly focused on a classical limit of a large spin. In this work we are discussing spin tunneling and quantum dynamics of a small spin induced by a spin polarized current within a [Formula: see text]-symmetric theory. This description can be used for manipulating spin qubits by electric currents.,3
Quantum Hall valley nematics.,"Two-dimensional electron gases in strong magnetic fields provide a canonical platform for realizing a variety of electronic ordering phenomena. Here we review the physics of one intriguing class of interaction-driven quantum Hall states: quantum Hall valley nematics. These phases of matter emerge when the formation of a topologically insulating quantum Hall state is accompanied by the spontaneous breaking of a point-group symmetry that combines a spatial rotation with a permutation of valley indices. The resulting orientational order is particularly sensitive to quenched disorder, while quantum Hall physics links charge conduction to topological defects. We discuss how these combine to yield a rich phase structure, and their implications for transport and spectroscopy measurements. In parallel, we discuss relevant experimental systems. We close with an outlook on future directions.",3
Recovery of the Dirac states of graphene by intercalating two-dimensional traditional semiconductors.,"The epitaxial growth of graphene on transition-metal substrates has proved to be an efficient method to synthesize high-quality large-area graphene. However, due to the interaction between graphene and the transition-metal substrate, the electronic structure of the as-fabricated graphene is distorted. Here, using density functional theory calculations, we investigated the effect of intercalating two-dimensional (2D) silicon and III-V materials, such as double-layer honeycomb AlAs, into the graphene-metal interface. We found that the intercalation of these 2D materials significantly reduces the interaction between graphene and the transition-metal substrate. The Dirac state is largely restored. The doping level of graphene induced by 2D intercalated material and the metal substrate is proportional to the work function difference between graphene and 2D materials/metal. This work provides a way for the formation of freestanding graphene and further fabrication of graphene-based devices.",3
Benchmark of correlation matrix renormalization method in molecule calculations.,"We report benchmark calculations of the correlation matrix renormalization (CMR) approach for 23 molecules in the well-established G2 molecule set. This subset represents molecules with spin-singlet ground state in a variety of chemical bonding and coordination environments. The QUAsi-atomic minimal basis-set orbitals (QUAMBOs) are used as local orbitals in both CMR and full configuration interaction (FCI) calculations for comparison. The results obtained from the calculations are also compared with available experimental data. It is shown that the CMR method produces binding and dissociation energy curves in good agreement with the QUAMBO-FCI calculations as well as experimental results. The CMR benchmark calculations yield a standard deviation of 0.09 A for the equilibrium bond length and 0.018 Hartree/atom for the formation energy, with a gain of great computational efficiency which scales like Hartree-Fock method.",3
2D selenium allotropes from first principles and swarm intelligence.,"Combining the particle-swarm optimization method with first-principles calculations, we explore a new category of two-dimensional (2D) monolayers composed of solely the element selenium. Three stable structures are screened from outputs of crystal search computations, namely T-Se (1T-MoS2-like), C-Se (tiled 1D helical chain), and S-Se (square structure). Phonon calculations, as well as formation energy calculations have been performed to confirm the stability of the three phases. The electronic structure calculations show that both T-Se and C-Se are indirect-band-gap semiconductors, with gap values of 1.11 eV and 2.64 eV respectively when using the hybrid HSE06 functional. In particular, C-Se has a centrosymmetry-breaking structure which provides a spontaneous in-plane ferroelectric polarization of about 2.68 x 10(-10) C m(-1) per layer. Interestingly, S-Se has a Dirac cone that can open up a band gap of 0.11 eV if spin-orbit coupling is included. The tilted Dirac cone of S-Se shows anisotropic band dispersion as characterized with different Fermi velocities of 1.26 x 10(6) and 0.24 x 10(6) m s(-1) around the Dirac point. Our works enrich the family of 2D materials of selenium allotropes and show that their versatile properties could give rise to potential application in various fields.",3
Continuous transition from weakly localized regime to strong localization regime in Nd0.7La0.3NiO3 films.,"We report an investigation of metal-insulator transition (MIT) using conductivity and magnetoconductance (MC) measurements down to 0.3 K in Nd0.7La0.3NiO3 films grown on crystalline substrates of LaAlO3 (LAO), SrTiO3 (STO), and NdGaO3 (NGO) by pulsed laser deposition. The film grown on LAO experiences a compressive strain and shows metallic behavior with the onset of a weak resistivity upturn below 2 K which is linked to the onset of weak localization contribution. Films grown on STO and NGO show a cross-over from a positive temperature coefficient (PTC) resistance regime to negative temperature coefficient (NTC) resistance regime at definite temperatures. We establish that a cross-over from PTC to NTC on cooling does not necessarily constitute a MIT because the extrapolated conductivity at zero temperature [Formula: see text] though small (<10 S cm(-1)) is finite, signaling the existence of a bad metallic state and absence of an activated transport. The value of [Formula: see text] for films grown on NGO is reduced by a factor of 40 compared to that for films grown on STO. We show that a combination of certain physical factors makes substituted nickelate (that are known to exhibit first-order Mott type transition), undergo a continuous transition as seen in systems undergoing disorder/composition driven Anderson transition. The MC measurement also supports the above observation and shows that at low temperatures, there exists a positive MC that arises from the quantum interference which co-exists with a spin-related negative MC that becomes progressively stronger as the electrons approach a strongly localized state in the film grown on NGO.",3
Insulator-metal transition induced by electric voltage in a ruthenate Mott insulator.,"We report the observation of electric-voltage induced insulator-metal phase transition in a ruthenate Mott insulator Ca3(Ru0.9Ti0.1)2O7. We show that the electric field effect dominates and leads to a sharp phase transition at measurement temperatures far below the Mott transition, whereas the thermal effect becomes more significant and broadens the phase transition as the measurement temperature approaches the insulator-metal transition. The electric field induced insulator-metal transition is presumably attributed to the avalanche breakdown of the correlated insulating state when driven out of equilibrium. This work highlights the strategy of using electric voltage to control the phase transition of this system in addition to other nonthermal parameters such as magnetic field and pressure reported previously.",3
Band structure engineering in 3D topological insulators.,"The discovery of novel topological phases has revolutionized the way we think about electronic matter. Topologically protected states have been demonstrated for many materials, however, creating materials that exhibit desired properties often remains a challenge. For example, one of the key challenges in three dimensional topological insulators has been the realization of insulating bulk, such that the unique properties of surface states could be fully employed in electron transport applications. Further challenges are in creating materials that simultaneously exhibit states protected by various symmetries on their different surfaces, inducing magnetic exchange coupling into the topological materials, as well as potentially creating non-trivial transient electronic states. This review presents theoretical concepts and a selection of experimental results from the point view of a spectroscopist, and as such might be useful for physicists who want to get familiar with the key concepts in a self-contained form with formalism reduced to readily understandable concepts.",3
Plasmons in Li under compression.,"We report the high-pressure behavior of plasmon in polycrystalline Li up to 15 GPa at room temperature studied by inelastic x-ray scattering and ab initio calculation. The plasmon energy ([Formula: see text]) increases with decreasing atomic volume ([Formula: see text]), and the [Formula: see text] slope exhibits a discontinuity at bcc --> fcc structural phase boundary reflecting the electronic band structure change. The plasmon peak width ([Formula: see text]) versus momentum transfer (q) curve of bcc-Li below 6.5 GPa keeps similar parabola-like shape. Above 8.4 GPa, where Li is in fcc, it changes from that of bcc-Li and has a convex shape.",3
Properties of the Majorana-state tunneling Josephson junction mediated by an interacting quantum dot.,"We consider a model of a Josephson junction of two topological superconducting wires mediated by an interacting quantum dot. An additional normal electrode coupled to the dot from the top allows to probe its density of states. The Majorana states adjacent to the dot hybridize across the junction and from a bound state in the dot. The dot is subjected to the effective magnetic field arising from the superposition of the fields driving each wire into topological states, which, dependent on the angle between the fields, introduces variable Zeeman splitting of the dot active level. We show that electron interactions in the dot diminish the characteristic for Majoranas zero bias peak arising in the transverse conductance through the dot and introduce an overall asymmetry of the conductance. They also renormalize the hybridization between the end-state Majoranas in shorter wires. The Majorana spin polarization is determined by the effective magnetic field in the dot. Phase-biased Josephson current exhibits spin polarization in thermal equilibrium, which possesses characteristic [Formula: see text] periodicity, and its sign can be switched when an unpaired Majorana state is present in the junction. We also observe spin-dependent Majorana state 'leaking', which can be controlled by the position of the dot level in energy scale.",3
Singling out the effect of quenched disorder in the phase diagram of cuprates.,"We investigate the specific influence of structural disorder on the suppression of antiferromagnetic order and on the emergence of cuprate superconductivity. We single out pure disorder, by focusing on a series of [Formula: see text] samples at fixed oxygen content y = 0.35, in the range [Formula: see text]. The gradual Y/Eu isovalent substitution smoothly drives the system through the Mott-insulator to superconductor transition from a full antiferromagnet with Neel transition [Formula: see text] K at z = 0 to a bulk superconductor with superconducting critical temperature [Formula: see text] K at z = 1, [Formula: see text]. The electronic properties are finely tuned by gradual lattice deformations induced by the different cationic radii of the two lanthanides, inducing a continuous change of the basal Cu(1)-O chain length, as well as a controlled amount of disorder in the active Cu(2)O2 bilayers. We check that internal charge transfer from the basal to the active plane is entirely responsible for the doping of the latter and we show that superconductivity emerges with orthorhombicity. By comparing transition temperatures with those of the isoelectronic clean system we determine the influence of pure structural disorder connected with the Y/Eu alloy.",3
Spin-charge-lattice coupling in quasi-one-dimensional Ising spin chain CoNb2O6.,"Magnetization, magnetostriction and dielectric constant measurements are performed on single crystals of quasi-one-dimensional Ising spin chain CoNb2O6 at temperatures below and above the antiferromagnetic phase transition. Field-induced magnetic transitions are clearly reflected in magnetodielectric and magnetostriction data. Sharp anomalies are observed around the critical fields of antiferromagnetic to ferrimagnetic and ferrimagnetic to saturated-paramagnetic transition in both magnetodielectric and magnetostriction experiments. Detailed analysis of temperature and field dependence of dielectric constant and magnetostriction suggests that spins are coupled with lattice as well as charges in CoNb2O6. Below the antiferromagnetic transition temperature, the overall resemblance in anomalies, observed in various physical parameters such as magnetization, dielectric constant, magnetostriction and magnetic entropy change gives a deeper insight about the influence of spin configuration on these parameters in CoNb2O6.",3
Fraternal twins: distinction between PbPc and SnPc by their switching behaviour in a scanning tunnelling microscope.,"In this contribution, we compare the optical absorbance behaviour and the structural properties of lead(II)-phthalocyanine (PbPc) and tin(II)-phthalocyanine (SnPc) thin films. To this end, we employ a Ag(1 1 1) substrate terminated with a monolayer of 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride constituting an internal interface whose main effect is an electronic decoupling of the phthalocyanine adlayer from the metal surface. As deduced from low-energy electron diffraction and scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) measurements, the epitaxial relations and unit cell compositions of the prevailing PbPc monolayer and multilayer domains are confusingly similar to those of SnPc on PTCDA/Ag(1 1 1). However, SnPc and PbPc can be readily distinguished by their STM-induced switching behaviours: while the former is capable of reversible configurational changes, no effect on the latter could be achieved by us under comparable conditions. This corroborates earlier theoretical predictions and even renders the chemical identification of individual shuttlecock-shaped metal-phthalocyanines feasible.",3
Tuning spin-orbit coupling in 2D materials for spintronics: a topical review.,"Atomically-thin 2D materials have opened up new opportunities in the past decade in realizing novel electronic device concepts, owing to their unusual electronic properties. The recent progress made in the aspect of utilizing additional degrees of freedom of the electrons such as spin and valley suggests that 2D materials have a significant potential in replacing current electronic-charge-based semiconductor technology with spintronics and valleytronics. For spintronics, spin-orbit coupling plays a key role in manipulating the electrons' spin degree of freedom to encode and process information, and there are a host of recent studies exploring this facet of 2D materials. We review the recent advances in tuning spin-orbit coupling of 2D materials which are of notable importance to the progression of spintronics.",3
Molecular dynamics simulation of beryllium oxide irradiated by deuterium ions: sputtering and reflection.,"The sputtering and reflection properties of wurtzite beryllium oxide (BeO) subjected to deuterium (D) ions bombardment at 300 K with ion energy between 10 eV and 200 eV is studied by classical molecular dynamics. Cumulative irradiations of wurtzite BeO show a D concentration threshold above which an 'unphysical dramatic' sputtering is observed. From the cumulative irradiations, simulation cells with different D concentrations are used to run non-cumulative irradiations at different concentrations. Using a D concentration close to the experimentally determined saturation concentration (0.12 atomic fraction), the simulations are able to reproduce accurately the experimental sputtering yield of BeO materials. The processes driving the sputtering of beryllium (Be) and oxygen (O) atoms as molecules are subsequently determined. At low irradiation energy, between 10 eV and 80 eV, swift chemical sputtering (SCS) is dominant and produces mostly OD z molecules. At high energy, the sputtered molecules are mostly Be x O y molecules (mainly BeO dimer). Four different processes are associated to the formation of such molecules: the physical sputtering of BeO dimer, the delayed SCS not involving D ions and the detachment-induced sputtering. The physical sputtering of BeO dimer can be delayed if the sputtering event implies two interactions with the incoming ion (first interaction in its way in the material, the other in its way out if it is backscattered). The detachment-induced sputtering is a characteristic feature of the 'dramatic' sputtering and is mainly observed when the concentration of D is close to the threshold leading to this sputtering regime.",3
Spin-wave propagation in alpha-Fe2O3 nanorods: the effect of confinement and disorder.,"Spin-wave excitations in alpha-Fe2O3 nanorods were directly detected using time-of-flight inelastic neutron spectroscopy. The dispersive magnon features are compared with those in bulk alpha-Fe2O3 particles at various temperatures to highlight differences in mode intensity and width. The interchanged spectral intensities in the nanorod are a consequence of a suppressed spin orientation, and this is also evident in the neutron diffraction which demonstates that the weak ferromagnetic phase survives to 1.5 K. Transmission electron microscopy shows that the ellipsoidal particles are single-crystalline with a typical length of 300 +/- 100 nm and diameter of 60 +/- 10 nm. The main magnon features are similar in bulk and nanoforms and can be explained using a model Hamiltonian based on Samuelson and Shirane's classical theory with exchange constants of J 1 = -1.03 meV, J 2 = -0.28 meV, J 3 = 5.12 meV and J 4 = 4.00 meV. Numerical simulations show that two distinct mechanisms may contribute to the magnon line broadening in the nanorods: a distribution of exchange interactions caused by disorder, and a shortened quasiparticle lifetime caused by the scattering of spin waves at surfaces.",3
Momentum distribution and tunneling density of states of one-dimensional Fermionic [Formula: see text] Hubbard model.,"We study the one-dimensional Fermionic Hubbard model with [Formula: see text] spin symmetry in the incommensurate filling case. The basic properties of Green's function, momentum distribution and tunneling density of states of the system at low temperature are studied in the frame work of Luttinger liquid theory combined with Bethe Ansatz solutions for arbitrary interaction. In the strong interacting case, the system enters the spin-incoherent regime at intermediate temperature [Formula: see text] and we obtain the Green's function and tunneling density of states by generalizing the path integral approach for the [Formula: see text] case to the [Formula: see text] case in this regime. The theoretical results we obtained agree qualitatively with the experiments on the one-dimensional alkaline earth atomic system with [Formula: see text] spin symmetry. The similarities and difference between the one-dimensional [Formula: see text] Fermionic Hubbard system at large N and the one-dimensional spinless Bosonic system are also investigated.",3
"Electron-phonon dynamics in 2D carbon based-hybrids XC (X = Si, Ge, Sn).","The effect of the presence of electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling in the SiC, GeC and SnC hybrids is studied in the framework of the ab initio perturbation theory. The electronic bang gap thermal dependence reveals a normal monotonic decrease in the SiC and GeC semiconductors, whereas SnC exhibits an anomalous behavior. The electron line widths were evaluated and the contributions of acoustic and optical phonon modes to the imaginary part of the self-energy were determined. It has been found that the e-ph scattering rates are globally controlled by the out-of-plane acoustic transverse mode ZA in SiC while both ZA and ZO are overriding in GeC. In SnC, the out-of-plane transverse optical mode ZO is the most dominant. The relaxation lifetime of the photo-excited electrons shows that the thermalization of the hot carrier occurs at 90 fs, 100 fs and 120 fs in SiC, GeC and SnC, respectively. The present study properly describes the subpicosecond time scale after sunlight illumination using an approach that requires no empirical data. The results make the investigated structures suitable for providing low cost and high-performance optical communication and monitoring applications using 2D materials.",3
Large magnetoresistance and large magnetothermopower effect in the Dirac material EuMn0.8Sb2.,"In this article, the structure, transport and magnetic properties were studied in details for EuMn0.8Sb2 crystals with the orthorhombic structure and Mn deficiencies. It was found that the temperature dependence of the resistivity exhibits a metallic behavior in the whole measuring temperature range, different from that in the crystals without Mn deficiencies. A large positive magnetoresistance (MR) ( approximately 127% at 2 K and approximately 25% at 300 K, in 9 T field) was observed, which can be ascribed to the combination of semiclassical MR and quantum limit MR of Dirac electrons. We also observed the high mobility of the carriers and large magnetothermopower effect at low temperatures, and two magnetic transitions emerging at approximately 24 K and approximately 10 K, respectively, corresponding to the antiferromagnetic ordering and canted arrangement of the Eu moments. Our findings shed new light on the intrinsic properties of EuMn0.8Sb2 and demonstrate the existence of Dirac fermions.",3
Real time scissor correction in TD-DFT.,"We demonstrate how the scissor correction to the optical band gap, common in linear-response time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT), may be extended to the domain of real-time TD-DFT. This requires modifying both the eigenvalues and momentum matrix elements of the underlying basis set. It provides a simple and computationally economical approach for calculating accurate electron dynamics in solids. We demonstrate the importance of this correction for prototypical semiconductors, diamond and silicon, where the energy absorption in both the linear and non-linear regimes is examined. We also show that for a particular system, ZnSe, using the adiabatic local density approximation together with a scissor correction can be advantageous over other approximations, as the underlying quasi-particle band structure is more accurate.",3
High-conductance contacts to functionalized molecular platforms physisorbed on Au(1 1 1).,"The conductances of molecules physisorbed to Au(1 1 1) via an extended [Formula: see text] system are probed with the tip of a low-temperature scanning tunneling microscope to maximize the control of the junction geometry. Inert hydrogen, methyl, and reactive propynyl subunits were attached to the platform and stand upright. Because of their different reactivities, either non-bonding (hydrogen and methyl) or bonding (propynyl) tip-molecule contacts are formed. The conductances exhibit little scatter between different experimental runs on different molecules, display distinct evolutions with the tip-subunit distance, and reach contact values of 0.003-0.05 G 0. For equal tip-platform distances the contact conductance of the inert methyl is close to that of the reactive propynyl. Under further compression, the inert species, hydrogen and methyl, are found to be better conductors. This shows that the current flow is not directly correlated with the chemical interaction. Atomistic calculations for the methyl case reproduce the conductance evolution and reveal the role of the junction geometry, forces and orbital symmetries at the tip-molecule interface. The current flow is controlled by orbital symmetries at the electrode interfaces rather than by the energy alignment of the molecular orbitals and electrode states. Functionalized molecular platforms thus open new ways to control and engineer electron conduction through metal-molecule interfaces at the atomic level.",3
Spin-orbit coupling driven novel magnetism in d (5) 6H-perovskite iridates Ba3IrTi2O9 and Ba3TiIr2O9.,"In the present paper, we have carried out a comparative first principles as well as model Hamiltonian study to understand the novel magnetism in 6H perovskite iridates Ba3IrTi2O9 and Ba3TiIr2O9 resulting from an unusual combination of geometrical as well as exchange frustration owing to their unique crystal geometry. Our model calculations corroborated with multipolar analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the spin-orbit entangled [Formula: see text] pseudo-spin states in both materials. While, the [Formula: see text] character is quite robust in the former compound, it is found to be directly related to the nature of magnetism in the latter iridate. The identification of the relevant spin model for the ideal structure of Ba3IrTi2O9 suggests that the Heisenberg exchange interaction dominates the Kitaev term favoring long range magnetic order in the system in line with the ab initio study while the other iridate Ba3TiIr2O9 has the posibility to host novel spin-orbital singlet state with no resultant moment.",3
Critical fluctuations in the spin-orbit Mott insulator Sr3Ir2O7.,"X-ray magnetic critical scattering measurements and specific heat measurements were performed on the perovskite iridate [Formula: see text]. We find that the magnetic interactions close to the Neel temperature [Formula: see text] are three-dimensional. This contrasts with previous studies which suggest two-dimensional behaviour like Sr2IrO4. Violation of the Harris criterion ([Formula: see text]) means that weak disorder becomes relevant. This leads a rounding of the antiferromagnetic phase transition at [Formula: see text], and modifies the critical exponents relative to the clean system. Specifically, we determine that the critical behaviour of [Formula: see text] is representative of the diluted 3D Ising universality class.",3
Multiferroicity and magnetoelectric coupling in the paramagnetic state of the metal-organic framework [(CH3)2NH2]Ni(HCOO)3.,"The metal-organic framework [(CH3)2NH2]Ni(HCOO)3 (DMA-Ni) has an ABX3 perovskite-like structure. At T C ~ 181 K, DMA-Ni displays a first-order ferroelectric transition, which is triggered by the disorder-order transition of hydrogen bonds. In addition, this compound exhibits a spin-canted antiferromagnetic order below T N ~ 37.6 K through the long-distance superexchange interaction, and a spin-reorientation transition appears near 15 K. The coexistence of magnetic and ferroelectric orders at low temperature testifies the multiferroic properties of DMA-Ni. Besides, the magnetoelectric (ME) coupling exists in the paramagnetic state, where the ferroelectric polarization can be modified by applying high magnetic fields. This behavior is attributed to the local magnetostriction effect.",3
Non-overlapping small polaron tunneling conduction coupled dielectric relaxation in weak ferromagnetic NiAl2O4.,"The inverse spinel nickel aluminate micro-particles was successfully synthesized via solid-state synthesis techniques. The single phase cubic structure with space group Fd3m of the as-prepared sample was entrenched from Rietveld refinement of x-ray diffraction pattern. In addition, the photoluminescence (PL) and FTIR spectra were also performed to give strong evidence of its pure phase formation. The narrow hysteresis m-h loop and UV-DRS spectra at room temperature demonstrate its weak ferromagnetic and semiconducting nature with saturation magnetization 64.96 x 10(-3) emu gm(-1) and direct optical band gap 2.03 eV respectively. The high-resolution FESEM micrographs and EDS elemental analysis exhibit its grain growth in microm range (217 microm) and presence of elemental compound Ni, Al and O respectively. The electrical transport properties were accomplished by complex impedance spectroscopy as a function of frequency (100 Hz-1 MHz) with the evolution of high temperature (300 degrees C-500 degrees C). The Nyquist plots (Z'' versus Z') were well fitted with an equivalent circuit model (QR) (QR) consisting of a series combination of intra and inter-granular contribution. Furthermore, the imaginary modulus spectra were also fitted with Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW) function, which represents two thermally activated peaks of grain and grain boundary effects. The low-frequency dispersive ac conductivity was elucidated using the following equation: [Formula: see text]. The increasing nature of temperature dependent frequency exponent (n) suggests the quantum mechanical tunneling: non-overlapping small polaron tunneling (NSPT) concept for conduction mechanism. In low-frequency region, the lattice and charge carrier polarization simultaneously contribute in dielectric permittivity.",3
Electric manipulation of magnetism in bilayer van der Waals magnets.,"The ferromagnetism of the two dimensional (2D) Cr2Ge2Te6 atomic layers with the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and the Curie temperature 30-50 K has recently been experimentally confirmed. By performing the density-functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that the magnetic properties of bilayer Cr2Ge2Te6 can be flexibly tailored, due to the effective band structure tuning by the external electric field. The electric field induces the semiconductor-metal transition and redistributes charge and spin between the two layers. Furthermore, the magnetic anisotropy energy of the bilayer Cr2Ge2Te6 can be obviously enhanced by the electric field, which is helpful to stabilize the long-range ferromagnetic order. Our study about the electric manipulation of magnetism based on the band structure engineering generally exists in 2D magnetic systems and will be of great significance in low-dimensional all-electric spintronics.",3
Band filling and disorder effects on the normal state thermoelectric behavior in MgB2.,"The goal of this work is providing a comprehensive interpretation framework for the wide and varied experimental phenomenology of the Seebeck effect in MgB2 samples with different levels of doping in either pi or sigma bands and different levels of disorder, using a combined experimental and theoretical approach. We calculate the temperature dependent diffusive Seebeck coefficient S diff(T) with the Boltzmann equation resolved in relaxation time approximation, taking into account the scattering with phonons and impurities, the effect of renormalization and the effect doping in a rigid band approximation. We show that selective disorder has a sizeable effect on the S diff magnitude, as it tunes the relative contributions of sigma and pi bands. Disorder also affects the S diff temperature dependences, eventually yielding a linear S diff(T) behavior in the dirty limit. We also show that band filling has opposite effects on S, depending on which band dominates transport. In parallel, we carry out the Seebeck effect measurements on neutron-irradiated Mg(11)B2, and on two series of doped samples Mg1-x Al x B2 and Mg(B1-x C x )2. From comparison of calculated S diff(T) and experimental S(T) curves, we demonstrate that diffusive and phonon drag terms give comparable contributions in clean samples, but the phonon drag term is progressively suppressed with increasing disorder. In C and Al doped samples we observe very different experimental behaviors in terms of sign, magnitude and temperature dependence. Indeed, notwithstanding the similar electron doping introduced by both substitutions, C or Al doping yields disorder which mainly affects either sigma or pi bands, respectively. With the help of our theoretical approach, we are able to disentangle the various effects and prove that the Seebeck coefficient is a very sensitive probe of this kind of disorder.",3
Critical phase boundaries of static and periodically kicked long-range Kitaev chain.,"We study the static and dynamical properties of a long-range Kitaev chain, i.e. a p -wave superconducting chain in which the superconducting pairing decays algebraically as [Formula: see text], where l is the distance between the two sites and [Formula: see text] is a positive constant. Considering very large system sizes, we show that when [Formula: see text], the system is topologically equivalent to the short-range Kitaev chain with massless Majorana modes at the ends of the system; on the contrary, for [Formula: see text], there exist symmetry protected massive Dirac end modes. We further study the dynamical phase boundary of the model when periodic [Formula: see text]-function kicks are applied to the chemical potential; we specially focus on the case [Formula: see text] and analyze the corresponding Floquet quasienergies. Interestingly, we find that new topologically protected massless end modes are generated at the quasienergy [Formula: see text] (where T is the time period of driving) in addition to the end modes at zero energies which exist in the static case. By varying the frequency of kicking, we can produce topological phase transitions between different dynamical phases. Finally, we propose some bulk topological invariants which correctly predict the number of massless end modes at quasienergies equal to 0 and [Formula: see text] for a periodically kicked system with [Formula: see text].",3
Multiscale local ordering in the prototypical uniaxial relaxor Sr0.6Ba0.4Nb2O6 single crystal at room temperature.,The structure and diffuse scattering in uniaxial relaxor Sr0.6Ba0.4Nb2O6 single crystal have been studied by x-ray diffraction at room temperature. Two different kinds of local ordering with different correlation lengths and different shapes of correlation functions have been revealed. The values of correlation lengths have been determined from analysis of experimental data. These types of orderings are connected with the intrinsic structure of crystal and can promote the appearance of relaxor properties.,3
Fluctuations and phase transitions of uniaxial and biaxial liquid crystals using a theoretically informed Monte Carlo and a Landau free energy density.,"In this work, we explore fluctuations during phase transitions of uniaxial and biaxial liquid crystals using a phenomenological free energy functional. We rely on a continuum-level description of the liquid crystal ordering with a tensorial parameter and a temperature dependent Landau polynomial expansion of the tensor's invariants. The free energy functional, over a three-dimensional periodic domain, is integrated with a Gaussian quadrature and minimized with a theoretically informed Monte Carlo method. We reconstruct analytical phase diagrams, following Landau and Doi's notations, to verify that the free energy relaxation reaches the global minimum. Importantly, our relaxation method is able to follow the thermodynamic behavior provided by other non-phenomenological approaches; we predict the first order character of the isotropic-nematic transition, and we identify the uniaxial-biaxial transition as second order. Finally, we use a finite-size scaling method, using the nematic susceptibility, to calculate the transition temperatures for 4-Cyano-4'-pentylbiphenyl (5CB) and N-(4-methoxybenzylidene)-4-butylaniline (MBBA). Our results show good agreement with experimental values, thereby validating our minimization method. Our approach is an alternative towards the relaxation of temperature dependent continuum-level free energy functionals, in any geometry, and can incorporate complicated elastic and surface energy densities.",3
Thermal transport in thermoelectric materials with chemical bond hierarchy.,"Chemical bond hierarchy (CBH) depicts a unique structural type of solids, in which fractions of the materials are loosely bonded in a relatively rigid framework. The weak bonding in materials with CBH induces special atomic vibrational motions and has a significant influence on the thermoelectric transport properties. The architecture of compounds with CBH was first proposed by Slack in his 'phonon glass electron crystal' paradigm and has led to the discovery of numerous new thermoelectric compounds over the years. This review covers various types of thermoelectric materials with different levels of CBH, focusing on their lattice thermal conductivities (kappa Ls). Caged compounds, with foreign impurities in the cages as the rattlers, are the first type of compounds stimulating the study of CBH. The fillers in both the clathrates and the filled skutterudites greatly reduce the kappa L accompanied by abnormal temperature dependence. As reviewed herein, the reduced kappa L is attributed to different mechanistic sources, i.e., the resonant scattering or the enhanced anharmonic phonon scatterings. Both may contribute to the kappa L reductions. In recent years, more materials with different types of CBH have been discovered, some containing complex atomic clusters as the rattlers, and others having flowing atoms that cause multiple equilibrium sites and even liquid-like behaviors. All CBHs strongly interfere with the heat transport of the corresponding materials. Future perspectives and possible research directions for thermal transport in thermoelectric materials with CBH have also been summarized herein.",3
Soliton defects and topological [Formula: see text]-periodic superconductivity from an orbital magnetic field effect in edge Josephson junctions.,"Recently, much research has been dedicated to understanding topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes induced by a magnetic field in hybrid proximity structures. This paper proposes a realization of topological superconductivity in a short Josephson junction at an edge of a 2D topological insulator subject to a perpendicular magnetic field. The magnetic field effect is entirely orbital, coming from a gradient of the order parameter phase at the edge, which results in a soliton defect at the junction with a pair of gapless Andreev bound states. The latter are reducible to Majorana zero modes by a unitary rotation and protected by a chiral symmetry. Furthermore, both ground state and excitations are quasiperiodic in the magnetic flux enclosed in the junction, with the period equal to the double flux quantum [Formula: see text]. This behaviour follows from the gauge invariance of the [Formula: see text]-phase periodicity of the Majorana states and manifests itself as [Formula: see text]-spaced magnetic oscillations of the critical current. Another proposed observable is a persistent current occurring in the absence of an external phase bias. Beside the oscillations, it shows a sign reversal prompted by the neutral Majorana zero modes. These findings offer the possibility to access topological superconductivity through low-field dc magnetotransport measurements.",3
Spectral functions of one-dimensional systems with correlated disorder.,"We investigate the spectral function of Bloch states in a one-dimensional tight-binding non-interacting chain with two different models of static correlated disorder, at zero temperature. We report numerical calculations of the single-particle spectral function based on the Kernel polynomial method, which has an [Formula: see text] computational complexity. These results are then confirmed by analytical calculations, where precise conditions were obtained for the appearance of a classical limit in a single-band lattice system. Spatial correlations in the disordered potential give rise to non-perturbative spectral functions shaped as the probability distribution of the random on-site energies, even at low disorder strengths. In the case of disordered potentials with an algebraic power-spectrum, [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text], we show that the spectral function is not self-averaging for [Formula: see text].",3
Electrostatic formation of the Majorana quasiparticles in the quantum dot-nanoring structure.,"Zero-energy Majorana quasiparticles can be induced at the edges of low dimensional systems. Non-Abelian statistics of these states make them valid candidates for the realisation of topological quantum computer. From the practical point of view, it is crucial to obtain a system in which an on demand creation and manipulation of this type of bound states is feasible. In this article, we show such a possibility in a setup comprising a quantum nanoring in which we specify a quantum dot region via electrostatic means. The presence of quantum dot can lead to the emergence of Andreev and Majorana bound states in the investigated system. We study the differences between those two types of bound states and the possibility of their manipulation. Moreover, the exact calculation method for spectral function has been proposed, which can be used to study the influence of bound states on the band structure of the proposed system. Using this method, it can be shown that the Majorana bound states, induced at the edge of the system, present themselves as a dispersionless zero-energy flat-band.",3
Blocking and remanence properties of weakly and highly interactive cobalt ferrite based nanoparticles.,"We compare both magnetic blocking properties and remanence curves for dilute ferrofluid and powder samples of ferrite magnetic nanoparticles. Low field DC magnetization, AC susceptibility, isothermal remanent magnetization and DC demagnetization techniques are employed to investigate the role of interparticle magnetic interactions on the superparamagnetic relaxation, the magnetic anisotropy and on the super-spin-glass state in closely packed particles. The samples used herein are 3 nm sized spinel-type nanocrystals made of a cobalt ferrite core covered by a layer of maghemite on its outermost surface and can be obtained as aqueous colloidal dispersions thanks to this core-shell strategy. They show large anisotropy attributed to an enhanced surface contribution and the blocking temperature is shifted towards higher values as interparticle distance decreases. For all investigated diluted liquids and powder samples the frequency dependency of the peak temperature is well accounted by a Vogel-Fulcher law, with the insertion of a phenomenological temperature associated to the magnitude of interparticle dipolar interactions. The fractional change of the peak temperature per decade of frequency enlights the presence of interactions between particles in dilute liquids and of a spin-glass-like state in powder samples. The remanence curves always show global demagnetizing behavior, attributed to the combination of both spin surface disorder and interparticle dipolar interactions, the former being predominant in isolated nanoparticles and the latter in powder samples. However, in the most compacted powder, exchange interaction between surface ions of different particles becomes more pronounced and promotes an additive magnetizing effect.",3
Self-assembled vortex crystals induced by inhomogeneous magnetic textures.,"We investigate the self-assembly of vortices in a type-II superconducting disk subjected to highly nonuniform confining potentials produced by inhomogeneous magnetic textures. Using a series of numerical experiments performed within the Ginzburg-Landau theory, we show that vortices can arrange spontaneously in highly nonuniform, defect-free crystals, reminiscent of conformal lattices, even though the strict conditions for the conformal crystal are not fulfilled. These results contradict continuum-limit theory, which predicts that the order of a nonuniform crystal is unavoidably frustrated by the presence of topological defects. By testing different cooling routes of the superconductor, we observed several different self-assembled configurations, each of which corresponding to one in a set of allowed conformal transformations, which depends on the magnetic and thermal histories of the system.",3
Negative linear compressibility in uranyl squarate monohydrate.,"The mechanical properties of the uranyl squarate monohydrate material, [Formula: see text], were studied using theoretical solid-state methods based in density functional theory employing plane waves and pseudopotentials. Very demanding calculation parameters were utilized in order to obtain a realistic description of the mechanical behavior of this material. Since the determination of the positions of the hydrogen atoms in the unit cell of uranyl squarate monohydrate was not possible from x-ray diffraction data by structure refinement, they were fully optimized theoretically. The computed lattice parameters, bond distances, angles, and x-ray powder diffraction patterns of this material were in very good agreement with the experimental data. This material was found to be mechanically and dynamically stable since the corresponding stability conditions were satisfied. The values of the bulk modulus and its pressure derivatives, shear and Young moduli, Poisson ratio, ductility, hardness, and mechanical anisotropy indices of this material were reported. Furthermore, this study showed that this material exhibits the important negative Poisson ratio (NPR) and negative linear compressibility (NLC) phenomena. Uranyl squarate monohydrate is a very anisotropic brittle material characterized by a bulk modulus of ~33 GPa, which shows a minimum value of the NPR of the order of -0.5. Besides, this material displays NLC values for a limited range of positive pressures, from 0.025 GPa to 0.094 GPa, applied along the direction of minimum negative Poisson ratio. The analysis of the crystal structure as a function of pressure demonstrates that the mechanism of NLC of this material is associated to the change in shape of the uranyl pentagonal bipyramids and unrelated to the wine-rack structural mechanism commonly used to rationalize this phenomenon.",3
"On defects' role in enhanced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in Pt/Co/Pt, induced by ion irradiation.","Modifications of magnetic and magneto-optical properties of Pt/Co(d Co )/Pt upon Ar(+) irradiation (with energy 1.2, 5 and 30 keV) and fluence, F at the range from 2 . 10(13)-2 . 10(16) Ar(+) cm(-2)) were studied. Two 'branches' of increased perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and enhanced magneto-optical response are found on 2D (d Co , F) diagrams. The difference in F between 'branches' is driven by ion energy. Structural features correlated with magnetic properties have been analysed thoroughly by x-ray diffraction, Rutherford backscattering spectrometry and positron annihilation spectroscopy. Experimental results are in agreement with TRIDYN numerical calculations of irradiation-induced layers intermixing. Our work discusses particularly structural factors related to crystal lattice defects and strain, created and modified by irradiation, co-responsible for the increase in the PMA.",3
Anisotropic 2D metallicity: plasmons in Ge(1 0 0)-Au.,"The low-energy plasmonic excitations of the Ge(0 0 1)-Au close to one monolayer coverage of Au were investigated by momentum-resolved high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy. A very weak plasmonic loss was identified dispersing along the chain direction of the [Formula: see text] formed at these Au coverages. The measured dispersion was compared with the Tomonaga-Luttinger-liquid (TLL) model and with a model for an anisotropic Fermi liquid. Using the TLL model both for single and arrays of wires, no consistent picture turned up that could describe all available data. On the contrary, a quasi-one-dimensional model of a confined 2D electron gas gave a satisfactorily consistent description of the data. From these results for the collective low-energy excitations we conclude that the Ge(0 0 1)-Au system is reasonably well described by a strongly anisotropic 2D Fermi liquid, but is incompatible with a TLL.",3
Heisenberg-exchange-free nanoskyrmion mosaic.,"Isotropic Heisenberg exchange naturally appears as the main interaction in magnetism, usually favouring long-range spin-ordered phases. The anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction arises from relativistic corrections and is a priori much weaker, even though it may sufficiently compete with the isotropic one to yield new spin textures. In this work, we challenge this well-established paradigm, and propose to explore a Heisenberg-exchange-free magnetic world. In this case, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction induces magnetic frustration in two dimensions, from which the competition with an external magnetic field results in a new mechanism producing skyrmions of nanoscale size. A single nanoskyrmion can already be stabilized in a few-atom cluster, and may then be used as LEGO((R)) block to build a large magnetic mosaic. The realization of such topological spin nanotextures in sp- and p -electron compounds or in ultracold atomic gases would open a new route toward robust and compact magnetic memories.",3
Interface properties of CoPc and CoPcF16 on graphene/nickel: influence of germanium intercalation.,"Photoelectron spectroscopy was used to investigate electronic interface properties and interactions of the organic semiconductors CoPc and CoPcF16 on graphene/nickel based substrates. Additional focus was put on the influence of germanium intercalation of graphene/nickel. The presented results demonstrate that germanium can decouple graphene from nickel and in this manner restore its buffer layer properties. No charge transfer from the substrate to the organic layer is observed in the germanium intercalated case, while interface related peaks in the Co 2p core level spectra indicate such charge transfer on graphene/nickel. Strong interface dipoles are found for CoPcF16 on graphene/nickel and on germanium intercalated graphene/nickel. Fluorine Auger parameters have been measured, and the results provide evidence for polarization and charge transfer screening effects of different amounts at the unlike film-substrate interfaces. The various contributions to the observed shifts are discussed.",3
Why have band theorists been so successful in explaining and predicting novel superconductors?,"In this contribution to the J. Phys.: Condens. Matter memorial issue in honor of Sandro Massidda I reflect on a phenomenon Sandro had been a part of. While theoretical condensed matter physicists have made, over the years, exciting and most elegant contributions to the theory of superconductivity (which, in and by itself, is one of the most beautiful constructs in theoretical physics), some of them of utmost importance, they have had less success in predicting and explaining superconducting states and mechanisms in specific materials. More down-to-earth computational materials scientists, who often go by the moniker 'band theorists', have been much more successful in applying (usually other people's) ideas in such circumstances. In this essay I give some examples, largely drawn from my own experience, and speculate on their meaning.",3
Fast recovery of the pristine magnetic and structural phases in superconducting LaFeAsO0.89F0.11 by Mn/Fe substitution.,"We report an experimental study on the effect of Mn impurities in the optimally doped [Formula: see text] compound. The results show that a very tiny amount of Mn, of the order of 0.1%, is enough to destroy superconductivity and to recover at low temperatures both the magnetic ground state and the orthorhombic structure of the pristine LaFeAsO parent compound. The results are discussed within a model where electron correlations enhance the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction among impurities.",3
Vacancies and interstitials in yttrium.,"The paper deals with the first principles simulation of formation energies and migration barriers of self point defects, including vacancies, di-vacancies and single interstitial atoms, in metallic yttrium. The vacancy formation energy in yttrium is shown to be relatively high (~1.8 eV), whereas the migration barriers are very similar for the jumps inside the basal planes and between basal planes, being equal to ~0.65 eV. The sum of these numbers reasonably reproduces the experimental values of the self-diffusion activation barriers. The vacancy pairs at the first nearest neighbor separation (divacancies) have binding energy of ~0.2 eV, which is only weakly sensitive to the divacancy orientation in the lattice, whereas vacancy pairs at the second and third nearest-neighbor separations are energetically unfavorable, suppressing the dissociation of divacancies. Together with the noticeably lower divacancy migration barriers with respect to single vacancies, this makes divacancies efficient mediators for mass transfer in Y. Among multiple possible configurations of a single interstitial, only the basal octahedral one is found to be the true energy minimum, while all the other considered possibilities are either unstable, or saddle points on the potential energy surface. This is in contrast to other hcp metals, where several metastable interstitial configurations often coexist. The lowest migration barriers for single interstitial diffusion along the basal plane and between planes are practically equal, ~0.4 eV, implying isotropic diffusion of interstitials in yttrium. Overall, the predicted properties of point defects in yttrium are in line with the general trends for hcp metals with the c/a ratio below [Formula: see text].",3
Active Tension Network model suggests an exotic mechanical state realized in epithelial tissues.,"Mechanical interactions play a crucial role in epithelial morphogenesis, yet understanding the complex mechanisms through which stress and deformation affect cell behavior remains an open problem. Here we formulate and analyze the Active Tension Network (ATN) model, which assumes that the mechanical balance of cells within a tissue is dominated by cortical tension and introduces tension-dependent active remodeling of the cortex. We find that ATNs exhibit unusual mechanical properties. Specifically, an ATN behaves as a fluid at short times, but at long times supports external tension like a solid. Furthermore, an ATN has an extensively degenerate equilibrium mechanical state associated with a discrete conformal - ""isogonal"" - deformation of cells. The ATN model predicts a constraint on equilibrium cell geometries, which we demonstrate to approximately hold in certain epithelial tissues. We further show that isogonal modes are observed in the fruit y embryo, accounting for the striking variability of apical areas of ventral cells and helping understand the early phase of gastrulation. Living matter realizes new and exotic mechanical states, the study of which helps to understand biological phenomena.",3
Grain-boundary segregation of 3d-transition metal solutes in bcc Fe: ab initio local-energy and d-electron behavior analysis.,"We present ab initio calculations of grain-boundary (GB) segregation of the series of 3d transition-metal (TM) solutes in bcc Fe, taking advantage of the local-energy analysis. For [Formula: see text]11(3 3 2) and [Formula: see text]3(1 1 1) [Formula: see text] symmetrical tilt GBs, the segregation behaviors of 3d-TM solutes can be classified into three groups. The early TMs (Sc, Ti and V) are preferentially segregated to the looser sites of GBs antiferromagnetically, the late TMs (Co, Ni and Cu) are preferentially segregated to the tighter sites of GBs ferromagnetically, and the middle TMs (Cr and Mn) are segregated antiferromagnetically without fixed site preference. TMs at both ends of the 3d series show larger segregation-energy gains, while Mn shows a cusp at the center, which is similar to the ab initio interaction energies between the 3d-TM solutes and a screw-dislocation core in bcc Fe. By the local-energy analysis combined with the local densities of states, the segregation of the early TMs is mainly attributed to the stabilization of surrounding Fe atoms by the TM solute at the looser sites of GBs, and that of the late TMs is mainly attributed to the stabilization of the TM solute itself from bulk Fe to GB sites and the destabilization of Fe atoms around the TM solute in bulk Fe. The cusp at Mn is mainly caused by the destabilization of Fe atoms around the Mn solute in bulk Fe, due to nearly-localized high-spin d states of Mn, in contrast to substantial d-d hybridization for Mn in GBs. For each group of 3d-TM solutes, the effects on the magnetic and mechanical properties of Fe GBs are also analyzed by the d-electron behavior in common with the segregation mechanism.",3
Unveiling spin-glass transition and antiferromagnetic order by muSR studies in spin-chain Sm2BaNiO5.,"We report the zero-field and longitudinal field muon spin relaxation studies in a spin-chain compound Sm2BaNiO5. Two magnetic transitions, that have not been previously detected by the heat capacity and magnetization measurements, are confirmed at 46 and 9 K. The antiferromagnetic order is suggested at 46 K. Analysis of the muon spin polarization unveils the spin-glass transition at 9 K. Time-field scaling relation of the muon spin polarization verifies the spin-spin autocorrelation function following the cut-off power law, which is approximated by the Ogielski form, as employed numerically for characterizing the spin-glasses.",3
"Electronic structure, carrier mobility and strain modulation of CH (SiH, GeH) nanoribbons.","Using first-principles calculations coupled with deformation potential (DP) theory, we have systematically studied the band structure, carrier mobility and strain modulation of monolayer graphane (CH), silicane (SiH) and germanane (GeH) nanoribbons. It is found that all the CH (SiH, GeH) nanoribbons are semiconductor with a wide range of band gap. The carrier mobility results show that the armchair germanane nanoribbon (AGeNR) has the characteristic of p -type semiconductor in electrical conduction because its hole mobility is larger than the electron mobility. While the graphane nanoribbon (CNR) behaves as n-type semiconductor in electrical conduction. Compared to AGeNR and CNR, the mobilities of other nanoribbons are much smaller. Moreover, the band structure and carrier mobility of AGeNR and CNR can be effectively tuned by strain. There are different state competing for the valence band maximum (VBM). When the strain exceeds certain value, the VBM is transited to a new band-edge state accompanied with a large increase of hole mobility. The new band-edge state has smaller DP constant because its bond character makes it less sensitive to strain, and thus resulting in higher hole mobility.",3
Shape of a skyrmion.,"We propose a method of determining the shape of a two-dimensional magnetic skyrmion, which can be parameterized as the position dependence of the orientation of the local magnetic moment, by using the expansion in terms of the eigenfunctions of the Schrodinger equation of a harmonic oscillator. A variational calculation is done, up to the next-to-next-to-leading order. This result is verified by a lattice simulation based on Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. Our method is also applied to the dissipative matrix in the Thiele equation as well as two interacting skyrmions in a bilayer system.",3
Temperature dependence of the transition packing fraction of thermal jamming in a harmonic soft sphere system.,"The glassy dynamics of soft harmonic spheres are often mapped onto the dynamics of hard spheres by considering an effective diameter for the soft particles and therefore an effective packing fraction. While in this approach the thermal fluctuations within valleys of the energy landscape are covered, the crossing of energy barriers from one valley into another usually is neglected. Here we argue-motivated by studies of the glass transition based on explorations of the energy landscape-that the crossing of energy barriers can be attributed by an effective decrease of the glass transition packing fraction with increasing temperature T according to T (0.2). Furthermore, we reanalyzing data of soft sphere simulations. Since fitting scaling laws to simulation data always allows for some arbitrariness, we cannot prove based on the simulation data that our idea of a shift of the glass transition packing fraction due to barrier crossings is the only possible way to explain the discrepancies that have been observed previously. However, we show that a possible explanation of the simulation data is given by our approach to characterize the dynamics of soft spheres by both, the previously-considered temperature-dependent effective packing fraction due to the increase of the mean overlap between neighboring particles with stronger thermal fluctuations and the newly introduced increase of the glass transition packing with an increasing probability of barrier crossings.",3
Long-range overlapping of Kondo clouds in open triple quantum dots.,"We study the phenomena of overlapping of Kondo clouds in an open triple quantum dots (OTQDs) system by using the dissipaton equation of motion (DEOM) theory. Motivated by the long-rang interaction of the TQDs system demonstrated in Cheng et al (2017 Phys. Rev. B 95 155417), we present a comprehensive picture of the long-range overlapping behavior of Kondo clouds via investigation of the spectral functions, spin-spin correlation, dot occupancies and susceptibility. For the configuration [Formula: see text], a conduction electron peak occurs in the spectral function of intermediate QD in the Kondo regime. This peak results from the overlapping of the two Kondo clouds forming from between the two peripheral QDs and leads, enhances with decreasing temperature and increasing dot-lead coupling. Both the spin-spin correlations between the two adjacent QDs and the two peripheral QDs own negative values. It also confirms the physical picture of the overlapping between left and right Kondo clouds via the intermediate QD. To understand the physical insight, we examine also the electron occupacies and the spectral functions, with their dependence on the temperature and dot-lead coupling. In addition, a distinct nonmonotonic behavior of the susceptibility associated with the Kondo clouds is characterized.",3
Dirac cones in a snub trihexagonal tiling lattice with reflective symmetry breaking.,"The present models of the two-dimensional (2D) Dirac materials always have reflective symmetry, but the essentiality has never been proved. Here we present an exceptional case: a snub trihexagonal tiling (STT) lattice without reflective symmetry. We demonstrate the existence of Dirac cones in this reflection-symmetry-free lattice by using a single-orbital tight-binding (TB) Hamiltonian. The SST lattice is also topologically nontrivial, because the Dirac cone can be gapped by spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect associated with robust gapless edge states. Using first-principles calculations, we predict a promising candidate 2D material, Be3C4 monolayer to realize this toy model. The Fermi velocities in this unique lattice are even higher than that in graphene. The stability and plausibility of the Be3C4 monolayer are verified by positive phonon modes, molecular dynamical simulations and mechanical criteria. This work eliminates the need for reflective symmetry in 2D Dirac materials, opening an avenue for designing new 2D Dirac materials.",3
Pressure induced topological and structural phase transitions in 1T-TiSe2: a Raman study.,"High pressure Raman spectroscopy studies on 1T-TiSe2 were carried out up to ~20.5 GPa. Based on the anomalies in phonon linewidth (lifetime) and phonon frequency of A 1g mode, we observe three transitions at ~2.5 GPa, ~6.0 GPa and ~15 GPa. The transitions at ~2.5 and ~6.0 GPa are the two topological phase transitions consistent with the theoretical prediction by Zhu et al in 1T-TiSe2 under pressure, namely, a topological trivial to non-trivial transition (Z 2 = 1) and topological non-trivial to trivial transition (Z 2 = 0). The trigonal (1T) phase of TiSe2 is stable up to ~15 GPa beyond which it undergoes structural transition as seen from the appearance of new Raman modes. There is a coexistence of the 1T and the new high-pressure phase up to ~19 GPa. The structural transition is completely reversible as seen from the appearance of 1T phase Raman spectra upon release of the pressure.",3
Radiative recombination of large polarons in halide perovskites.,"In hybrid organic/inorganic perovskites, the majority of charge carriers are large polarons. Slow recombination of the large polarons underlies long carrier lifetime and diffusion length, crucial to optoelectronic applications of the perovskites. However, microscopic mechanisms by which the large polarons recombine remain largely unknown. Here we propose a theoretical model to elucidate radiative recombination of large polarons. Six annihilation pathways are identified which involve the formation of mobile and immobile 'dying pairs', both responsible for charge recombination. The formation probability of the 'dying pair' and the corresponding annihilation rate can be estimated. The product of the formation probability and the annihilate rate gives rise to recombination rate along each pathway and weighted sum of the recombination rates yields an overall rate of radiative recombination in perovskites. The theory sheds light on the physical mechanism by which large polarons recombine via the formation of the dying pairs, assisted by thermal activation and quantum tunneling. The predictions from the theory in general agree well to corresponding experimental measurements on monomolecular and bimolecular recombination rates as well as peak frequency of photoluminescence spectrum.",3
Energy-level alignment at strongly coupled organic-metal interfaces.,"Energy-level alignment at organic-metal interfaces plays a crucial role for the performance of organic electronic devices. However, reliable models to predict energetics at strongly coupled interfaces are still lacking. We elucidate contact formation of 1,2,5,6,9,10-coronenehexone (COHON) to the (1 1 1)-surfaces of coinage metals by means of ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the x-ray standing wave technique, and density functional theory calculations. While for low COHON thicknesses, the work-functions of the systems vary considerably, for thicker organic films Fermi-level pinning leads to identical work functions of 5.2 eV for all COHON-covered metals irrespective of the pristine substrate work function and the interfacial interaction strength.",3
Coercive field enhancement in Co nanodisks: single-domain to vortex switching.,"Magnetic multi-layered nanodisks (ND) show great promise as these are relatively easy to assemble and control, facilitating biological and storage applications. In the present work, Ti/Co/Nb ND were fabricated with a varying Co layer thickness between 6 and 14 nm. Using vibrating sample magnetometry and micromagnetic simulations (OOMMF), their magnetic properties were investigated. Our results reveal a peak in coercive field at a critical thickness that separates the two magnetic phases; single domain and vortex phase. This peak is characterized by a substantially larger coercive field and allows to establish an explicit phase diagram as a function of diameter and thickness of the ND. This opens the possibility to investigate such enhancement in other ferromagnetic materials too.",3
Natural orbital functional for spin-polarized periodic systems.,"Natural orbital functional theory is considered for systems with one or more unpaired electrons. An extension of the Piris natural orbital functional (PNOF) based on electron pairing approach is presented, specifically, we extend the independent pair model, PNOF5, and the interactive pair model PNOF7 to describe spin-uncompensated systems. An explicit form for the two-electron cumulant of high-spin cases is only taken into account, so that singly occupied orbitals with the same spin are solely considered. The rest of the electron pairs with opposite spins remain paired. The reconstructed two-particle reduced density matrix fulfills certain N-representability necessary conditions, as well as guarantees the conservation of the total spin. The theory is applied to model systems with strong non-dynamic (static) electron correlation, namely, the one-dimensional Hubbard model with periodic boundary conditions and hydrogen rings. For the latter, PNOF7 compares well with exact diagonalization results so the model presented here is able to provide a correct description of the strong-correlation effects.",3
Recovery of the scattering symmetry looking at the conductance in asymmetric graphene nano-ribbons systems using pseudo-spin filters.,"In this work we study some applications for pseudo-spin filters. The filters are potential barriers with hyperboloid sub-band contributions that are locally applied over graphene nano-ribbons. These filters modulate the pseudo-spin and the quirality of the wave-function allowing the recovery of the conductance loss due to imperfections, bends, or constrictions (asymmetries) found in the system. The recovery of the conductance is fulfilled by a direct manipulation of the pseudo-spin polarization at both sides of the device by localizing the filters at the system's entrance and exit points. This procedure allows the recovery of the wave-function symmetry at these points with the consequent recovery of the conductance, even when it is zero, regardless of the different internal regions that affect the transmission, i.e. the filters are used as patches for damaged regions. Our results can be extrapolated for spatially asymmetrical potentials generated by electrical (or magnetic) impurities.",3
Modeling longitudinal spin fluctuations in chiral magnets.,We investigate the effect of evolution of energy of longitudinal spin fluctuations on the helimagnetic transition and specific heat in a Heisenberg magnet with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction that may arise in a result of applied pressure. Using the classical Monte Carlo calculations for the spin-lattice Hamiltonian accounting for variable spin amplitudes we find that the helical phase transition is pretty robust against the longitudinal spin fluctuations. At the same time the amplitude of the fluctuation hump seen in the specific heat dependence at [Formula: see text] and its position are significantly affected. Depending on the mode of evolution the hump either shifts to lower or higher temperatures increasing its amplitude with the amplitude of the fluctuations.,3
Electronic and optical characterization of 2D Ti2C and Nb2C (MXene) thin films.,"Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides and/or nitrides (MXenes) are a new class of 2D materials, with extensive opportunities for property tailoring due to the numerous possibilities for varying chemistries and surface terminations. Here, Ti2AlC and Nb2AlC MAX phase epitaxial thin films were deposited on sapphire substrates by physical vapor deposition. The films were then etched in LiF/HCl solutions, yielding Li-intercalated, 2D Ti2CT z and Nb2CT z films, whose terminations, transport and optical properties were characterized. The former exhibits metallic conductivity, with weak localization below 50 K. In contrast, the Nb-based film exhibits an increase in resistivity with decreasing temperature from RT down to 40 K consistent with variable range hopping transport. The optical properties of both films were determined from spectroscopic ellipsometry in the 0.75 to 3.50 eV range. The results for Ti2CT z films confirm the metallic behavior. In contrast, no evidence of metallic behavior is observed for the Nb2CT z film. The present work therefore demonstrates that one fruitful approach to alter the electronic and optical properties of MXenes is to change the nature of the transition metal.",3
Terahertz surface and interface emission spectroscopy for advanced materials.,"Surfaces and interfaces are of particular importance for optoelectronic and photonic materials as they are involved in many physical and chemical processes such as carrier dynamics, charge transfer, chemical bonding, transformation reactions and so on. Terahertz (THz) emission spectroscopy provides a sensitive and nondestructive method for surface or interface analysis of advanced materials ranging from graphene to transition metal dichalcogenides, topological insulators, hybrid perovskites, and mixed-dimensional heterostructures based on 2D materials. In this review paper, we start with the THz radiation mechanisms under ultrafast laser excitation. Then we concentrate on the recent progresses of THz emission spectroscopy on the surface and interface properties of advanced materials, including transient surface photocurrents, surface nonlinear polarization, surface states, interface potential, and gas molecule adsorption/desorption processes. This novel spectroscopic method can not only promote the development of new and compact THz sources, but also provide a nondestructive optical method for surface and interface characterization of photocurrent and nonlinear polarization dynamics of materials.",3
Charge localization in 1D tetramerized organic conductors: the special case of (tTTF)2ClO4.,"We report a detailed structural and spectroscopic study of the 1D 2:1 cation radical salt (tTTF)2ClO4, where tTTF = trimethylenetetrathiafulvalene, which exhibits a semiconductor-semiconductor phase transition at ca. T = 137 K. Crystal structures are determined above and below the transition; the tTTF molecules in stacks are grouped into weakly interacting tetramers. The reorganization of tTTF stacks is accompanied with an order-disorder transition in anion sublattice. Polarized infrared and Raman spectra of (tTTF)2ClO4 are measured in the broad frequency range as a function of the temperature (10-293 K). The structural and vibrational features are investigated to elucidate the origin of the semiconductor-semiconductor phase transition. We discuss the electron-intramolecular vibration coupling effects in the vibrational spectra of (tTTF)2ClO4 and identify signatures of high- and low-temperature states of charge localization in the tetramerized system. Both the C=C and C-S stretching modes of tTTF give evidence of strong charge distribution fluctuations in conducting stacks for T > 137 K, which are responsible for the appearance of molecules with charge +1e, and charge localization in tTTF tetramers for T < 137 K. The uniqueness of the salt (tTTF)2ClO4 in comparison with other tetramerized 1D systems is discussed.",3
Random phase approximation for the non-uniform Yukawa fluid.,"Mean-field density functional theory can be used to estimate the free energy of non-uniform fluids. The second functional derivative with respect to density of the free energy is related to the direct correlation function of the fluid and, in principle, this can be inverted to find an improved approximation for the pair correlation function and hence the free energy, the so-called 'random phase approximation'. If the repulsive molecular interaction is approximated by the local density approximation and the attractive interaction is assumed to be of the Yukawa form, the problem reduces to that of finding the eigenvalues of Schrodinger-like equations, which, for certain models (such as the 'Phi(4) model'), can be done analytically in the planar case. The relationship between this approach and field theoretical treatment of the vapour-liquid interface is discussed. The ultraviolet divergence of the expression can be eliminated by separating the first term in the expansion, although quantitative results still depend on the behaviour of the attractive potential in the repulsive core. In the case of a spherical droplet of radius R, correction terms to the free energy involving lnR appear due to (i) cluster translational invariance, (ii) the unstable mode corresponding to droplet growth, and (iii) capillary waves. The net effect of these terms is to modify the classical expression for the nucleation rate by a factor proportional to R (4/3).",3
Modified exchange interaction between magnetic impurities in spin-orbit coupled quantum wires.,"Indirect exchange interaction between magnetic impurities in one dimensional systems is a matter of long discussions since Kittel has established that in the asymptotic limit it decays as the inverse of distance x between the impurities. In this work we investigate this problem in a quantum wire with Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC). By employing a second order perturbation theory we find that one additional oscillatory term appears in each of the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY), the Dzaloshinkii-Moryia and the Ising couplings. Remarkably, these extra terms resulting from the spin precession of the conduction electrons induced by the SOC do not decay as in the usual RKKY interaction. We show that these extra oscillations arise from the finite momenta band splitting induced by the spin-orbit coupling that modifies the spin-flip scatterings occurring at the Fermi energy. Our findings open up a new perspective in the long-distance magnetic interactions in solid state systems.",3
Two-dimensional excitons in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides from radial equation and variational calculations.,"Exciton energy spectra of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) in various dielectric environments are studied with an effective mass model using the Keldysh potential for the screened electron-hole interaction. Two-dimensional (2D) excitons are calculated by solving a radial equation (RE) with a shooting method, using boundary conditions that are derived by applying the asymptotic properties of the Keldysh potential. For any given main quantum number n, the exciton Bohr orbit shrinks as [Formula: see text] becomes larger (m is the orbital quantum number) resulting in increased strength of the electron-hole interaction and a decrease of the exciton energy. Further, both the exciton energy and its effective radius decrease linearly with [Formula: see text]. The screened hydrogen model (SHM) (Olsen et al 2016 Phys. Rev. Lett. 116 056401) is examined by comparing its exciton energy spectra with our RE solutions. While the SHM is found to describe the nonhydrogenic exciton Rydberg series (i.e. the energy's dependence on n) reasonably well, it fails to account for the linear dependence of the exciton energy on the orbital quantum number. The exciton effective radius expression of the SHM can characterize the exciton radius's dependence on n, but it cannot properly describe the exciton radius's dependence on m, which is the cause of the SHM's poor description of the exciton energy's m-dependence. Analytical variational wave-functions are constructed with the 2D hydrogenic wave-functions for a number of strongly bound exciton states, and very close exciton energies and wave-functions are obtained with the variational method and the RE solution (exciton energies are within a 6% of deviation). The variational wave-functions are further applied to study the Stark effects in 2D TMDs, with an analytical expression derived for evaluating the redshift the ground state energy.",3
Optical properties and lattice dynamics of a novel allotrope of orthorhombic elemental germanium.,"Optical and vibrational properties of a novel allotrope of elemental germanium Ge(oP32), which crystallizes in the structure corresponding to the orthorhombic space group Pbcm, are studied experimentally by means of absorption and polarized Raman scattering measurements and theoretically using the first principles density functional theory. Material is found to be a direct band gap semiconductor with E g = 0.33 eV. Out of theoretically predicted 48 Raman-active modes, 27 are observed in the spectra and assigned to the specific lattice eigenmodes of the crystal based on their symmetry and a comparison with the results of first principles lattice dynamics calculations. Remarkably, the highest frequency vibration is observed at 316 cm(-1), that is higher than the cubic crystalline [Formula: see text]-Ge mode at 300 cm(-1). Exceptional sharpness of observed phonon lines (between 0.8 and 2.5 cm(-1) at T = 10 K) implies excellent crystallinity of Ge(oP32) crystals.",3
Magnetic orders and origin of exchange bias in Co clusters embedded oxide nanocomposite films.,"Magnetic nanoparticles embedded oxide semiconductors are interesting candidates for spintronics in view of combining ferromagnetic (FM) and semiconducting properties. In this work, Co-ZnO and Co-V2O3 nanocomposite thin films are synthesized by Co ion implantation in crystalline thin films. Magnetic orders vary with the implantation fluence in Co-ZnO, where superparamagnetic (SPM) order appears in the low-fluence films (2 x 10(16) and 4 x 10(16) ions cm(-2)) and FM order co-exists with the SPM phase in high-fluence films (1 x 10(17) ions cm(-2)). Exchange bias (EB) appears in the high-fluence films, with an EB field of about 100 Oe at 2 K and a blocking temperature of around 100 K. On the other hand, Co-V2O3 thin films with an implantation fluence of 3.5 x 10(16) ions cm(-2) exhibit a clear antiferromagnetic (AFM) coupling at low temperatures without the EB effect. The different magnetic behavior of the Co-implanted films with different Co content leads us to conclude that the observed EB effect in the Co-ZnO films results from the FM/AFM coupling between sizable Co nanoparticles and their CoO/Co3O4 surroundings in the (Zn,Co)O matrix. On the other hand, the absence of EB effect in Co-V2O3 appears to be due to the small size of the FM Co nanoparticles in spite of an AFM magnetic order. Detailed studies of magnetic orders and EB effect in magnetic nanocomposite semiconductors can pave the way for their application in spintronics.",3
Unusual exchange bias in Sr2FeIrO6/La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 multilayer.,"Here, we study interface induced magnetic properties in a 3d-5d based multilayer made of La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 and double perovskite Sr2FeIrO6, respectively. Bulk La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 is metallic and shows ferromagnetic (FM) ordering above room temperature. In contrast, bulk Sr2FeIrO6, is an antiferromagnet (AFM) with a Neel temperature around 45 K ([Formula: see text]) and exhibits an insulating behavior. Two set of multilayers have been grown on SrTiO3 (1 0 0) crystal with varying thickness of FM layer. A multilayer with equal thickness of La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 and Sr2FeIrO6 ( approximately 10 nm) shows exchange bias (EB) effect both in conventionally field cooled (FC) as well as in zero field cooled (ZFC) magnetic hysteresis measurements which is rather unusual. The ZFC EB effect is weakened both with increasing maximum field during initial magnetization process at low temperature and with increasing temperature. Interestingly, a multilayer with reduced thickness of La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 ( approximately 5 nm) does not exhibit ZFC EB phenomenon, however, the FC EB effect is strengthened showing much higher value. We believe that an AFM type exchange coupling at the interface and its evolution during initial application of magnetic field causes this unusual EB in present multilayers.",3
The mirror asymmetry induced nontrivial properties of polar WSSe/MoSSe heterostructures.,"Janus MoSSe and WSSe as new members to the family of transitional metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) present intriguing properties that absent in its parent MX 2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) monolayers due to the out-of-plane mirror asymmetry. For WSSe/MoSSe van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, intralayer/interlayer potential drops lead to significantly larger band offset than MX 2 heterobilayers, ensuring the long lifetimes for valley polarized interlayer excitons. Regard to the spin-valley-layer locking effects in WSSe/MoSSe vdW heterostructures, the band offset larger than the Zeeman-type spin splitting guarantees effective interlayer hopping and, therefore, large degree of valley polarization. Rashba-type spin splitting can coexist with the valley spin splitting and thus add the carrier transport paths, and intralayer/interlayer potential drops show obvious effects on the Rashba parameter. According to these results, WSSe/MoSSe vdW heterostructures manifest themselves the most promising candidates for spintronics and valleytronics with superiorities to the MX2 counterparts.",3
The effects of confinement in pores built of folded graphene sheets on the equilibrium of nitrogen monoxide dimerisation reaction.,"In the current work we have used reactive Monte Carlo simulations to systematically study the effects of graphene folding on equilibria of NO dimerisation occurring at isolated surfaces and in porous networks built of corrugated graphene sheets. It has been demonstrated that the folding of isolated graphene sheets significantly improves the yield of reactions occurring on their surface. Then, it has also been shown that in slit-like pores formed by the folded graphene sheets the reaction yield depends on the corrugation and arrangement of the pore walls. It has been found that the reaction yield increases when the walls' corrugation is high because of the appearance of narrow regions and/or wedge-like regions in the pores. The condensation of reacting fluid in such places, where the bulges at both walls are close one to another, leads to much higher reaction yield than on the surface of isolated sheets. Thus, we recommended the highly corrugated graphene to control the chemical reactions.",3
Pressure tuning of iron-based superconductor Ca10(Pt3As8) ((Fe0.95Pt0.05)2As2)5.,"Systematic high pressure transport measurements were performed on underdoped Ca10(Pt3As8)((Fe0.95Pt0.05)2As2)5 single crystal sample. At ambient pressure, the sample shows a metallic behavior at high temperatures and then increases with further decreasing temperature. The resistivity dip, which is associated with metal to semiconductor transition is monotonically suppressed by increasing pressure. In contrast, the superconducting transition temperature [Formula: see text] first increases with pressure and then decreases with further increasing pressure. Magnetization measurements, which gives the bulk [Formula: see text], show the same trend as the one obtained from resistivity measurements. An upward curvature is observed in the temperature dependence of the upper critical field [Formula: see text], which suggests the multiband nature of the superconductivity. The constructed temperature-pressure (T-P) phase diagram is very similar to the reported temperature-doping (T - x) phase diagram, suggesting the similar role played by pressure and chemical doping.",3
DFT/NEGF study of discrete dopants in Si/III-V 3D FET.,"In this work, electron densities around dopants in Si and GaAs have been calculated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. These extracted densities have been used to describe dopants in an in-house non-equilibrium Green functions device simulator. The transfer characteristics of nanowire gate all around field effect transistor have been calculated using DFT electron densities. These transport calculations were compared with those using a point charge model of the dopant. The dopants are located in the middle of the channel of the device. Specifically, DFT calculations of a 512 atom Si supercell with a single impurity atom have been carried out, both phosphorous and boron atoms have been used as donor and acceptor impurities respectively. The calculations were repeated on a gallium arsenide supercell, where the silicon atom substituted gallium and arsenide to act as donor and acceptor respectively. We found that for donors and acceptors, the DFT charge distribution extends similarly in both materials. In addition, the relaxed structure produces a 50% larger spread of electronic charge as compared with unrelaxed Si and GaAs. The extracted current voltage characteristics of the devices are altered significantly using the charge density obtained by DFT. At 0.7 V the current in Si is 20% larger using the DFT charge density compared to the point charge model for donors. Whereas the current using the point charge model in GaAs is 2.5 times larger than the distributed charge. Devices exhibit substantial tunnelling currents for donors and acceptors irrespective of the model of the dopant considered. In GaAs, this was 76% using a point charge and 78% using the distributed charge when using a donor; 61% and 68% in Si respectively. The tunnelling current using acceptors for Si was 100% and 99% using GaAs for both models.",3
Thermoelectric properties of nanostructured systems based on narrow armchair graphene nanoribbons.,"Thermoelectric properties of hybrid systems composed of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) coupled to rectangular rings or functionalized with aromatic carbon molecules are theoretically addressed here. Graphene-based nanostructures are designed with the purpose of enhancing thermopower responses compared to the thermal performance of pristine GNRs. The electronic transport is calculated using standard tight binding models and the Landauer transport formalism. We found that both semiconducting and metallic armchair nanoribbons coupled to rings exhibit a pronounced enhancement of the thermoelectric responses with comparable intensities, due to Fano antiresonance and Breit-Wigner-like resonances in the electronic transport. As expected, details of the ring geometry and ribbons are important in determining the precise chemical potential values for optimal performance. Different configurations of attached aromatic molecules (single and double molecules) at the graphene nanoribbon edges are addressed. Our findings show that the presence of a molecule induces a gap formation in the metallic pristine GNRs, and a pronounced peak of the Seebeck coefficient is revealed for low chemical potential values, independent of the molecule length. Other features on the Seebeck spectra are found to depend on the electronic nature of the GNRs and on the molecule length and distribution. We have shown that by playing with them, it is possible to design better thermoelectric devices based on GNRs.",3
Fractional charged edge states in ladder topological insulators.,"We propose a model of two-leg ladder topological insulator in which the spin-orbit couplings are presented in both intra-chain and inter-chain interactions. The topological phase supports four fractional charged edge states localized at opposite ends of the ladder, which belongs to the chiral symplectic (CII) class protected by time-reversal symmetry and chiral symmetry. In our model, the presence of time-reversal and chiral symmetry generates fourfold degeneracy for the edge states, and the two edge states with same chirality at one end of the ladder each carries half charge. In contrast to the two edge states spatially localized at one end of the ladder being not distinguished, these two edge states can be detected by the momentum density. The experimental scheme for realizing our model with cold atoms in optical lattice is discussed. By introducing a magnetic field in the x direction, the system is driven from CII class to AIII class. In AIII class, there exist two distinct topological phases that exhibit four degenerate edge states and two degenerate edge states in the gap, respectively. As same as the system in CII class, each edge state carries a half charge in AIII class.",3
Engineering the magnetic properties of PtSe2 monolayer through transition metal doping.,"Using first-principles calculations, we have studied the energetic feasibility and magnetic properties of transition metal (TM) doped PtSe2 monolayers. Our study shows that TM doped PtSe2 layers with 6.25% doping exhibit versatile spintronic behaviour depending on the nature of the dopant TM atoms. Groups IVB and VIII10 TM doped PtSe2 layers are non magnetic semiconductors, while groups IIIB, VB, VIII8, VIII9, IB TM doped PtSe2 layers are half-metals and finally, groups VIB, VIIB and IIB TM doped PtSe2 layers are spin polarized semiconductors. The presence of half-metallic and magnetic semiconducting characteristics suggest that TM doped PtSe2 layers can be considered as a new kind of dilute magnetic semiconductor and thus have the promise to be used in spintronics. By studying the magnetic interactions between two TM dopants in PtSe2 monolayers for dopant concentration of 12.5% and dopant distance of 12.85 [Formula: see text], we have found that in particular, Fe and Ru doped PtSe2 systems are ferromagnetic half-metal having above-room-temperature Curie point of 422 and 379.9 K, respectively. By varying the dopant distance and concentration we have shown that the magnetic interaction is strongly dependent on dopant distance and concentration. Interestingly, the Curie temperature of TM doped PtSe2 layers is affected by the correlation effects on the TM d states and also spin-orbit coupling. We have also studied the magnetic properties of defect complex composed of one TM dopant and one Pt vacancy (TMPt + VPt) which shows novel magnetism.",3
"Electronic structure of CuWO4: dielectric-dependent, self-consistent hybrid functional study of a Mott-Hubbard type insulator.","CuWO4 is a semiconducting oxide with interesting applications in photocatalysis. In this paper we present an accurate study of the electronic properties of stoichiometric and oxygen deficient CuWO4 based on a dielectric dependent hybrid density functional. In CuWO4 the Cu ions (Cu(2+)) are in a 3d(9) configuration, so that the material must be classified as a magnetic insulator. Various magnetic configurations of CuWO4 have been considered, the most stable configuration being anti-ferromagnetic. The band structure, described in terms of density of states (DOS), exhibit the presence of a wide band dominated by W 5d states, separated by about 5 eV from the top of the valence band (VB), consisting of O 2p states partly mixed with Cu 3d states. The empty component of the Cu 3d orbitals forms a narrow band 3.6 eV above the VB maximum. The electronic structure emerging from the DOS curves and the Kohn-Sham energies is hard to reconcile with an experimental band gap of 2.1-2.3 eV. This gap can be rationalized within the Mott-Hubbard model of magnetic insulators, and has been computed from the total energies of the system with one electron removed from the O 2p band and one electron added to the Cu 3d states. Computing the charge transition levels for CuWO4, we come to a theoretical band gap of 2.1 eV, in excellent agreement with the experimental observations. We also studied the nature of the oxygen vacancy in CuWO4 with particular attention to the electron redistribution following the oxygen removal. The excess electrons, in fact, can occupy the localized 3d states of Cu or the localized 5d states of W. The resulting solution depends on various factors, including the concentration of oxygen vacancies.",3
Strong chemisorption of CO2 on B10-B13 planar-type clusters.,"An ab initio density functional study was performed investigating the adsorption of CO2 on neutral boron B n (n = 10-13) clusters that are characterized by planar and quasiplanar ground-state atomic structures. For all four clusters, we found large chemisorption binding energies, reaching 1.6 eV between CO2 and B12, with the adsorbed molecule oriented in the plane of the cluster and adsorbed along the cluster edge. A configuration with chemisorbed dissociated CO2 molecule also exists for B11 and B13 clusters. The strong adsorption is due to the bending of the CO2 molecule, which provides energetically accessible fully in-plane frontier molecular orbitals matching the edge states of the clusters. At the same time, the intrinsic dipole moment of a bent CO2 molecule facilitates the transfer of excess electronic charge from the cluster edges to the molecule.",3
Highly anisotropic thermoelectric properties of carbon sulfide monolayers.,"Strain engineering applied to carbon monosulphide monolayers allows to control the bandgap, controlling electronic and thermoelectric responses. Herein, we study the semiconductor-metal phase transition of this layered material driven by strain control on the basis of first-principles calculations. We consider uniaxial and biaxial tensile strain and we find a highly anisotropic electronic and thermoelectonic responses depending on the direction of the applied strain. Our results indicate that strain-induced response could be an effective method to control the electronic response and the thermoelectric performance.",3
Strain-induced rich magnetic phase transitions and enhancement of magnetic stability for O-terminated h-BN nanoribbons.,"Mono-layered h-BN and its derivatives are very important low-dimensional materials, which have been widely investigated so far. Here, we theoretically study the structural stability and magneto-electronic properties of oxygen (O) terminated zigzag-edged h-BN nanoribbons, especially focusing on strain tuning effects. The O dimerization at the B edge of the ribbon enhances the system stability greatly. A Poisson ratio of 0.2 and bearing a strain more than 20% can be reached. In the absence of strain, the O-terminated ribbon is a magnetic metal. However, the rich magnetic phase transitions among the non-magnetic metal, a spin gapless semiconductor, and a wide-gap half-metal can be realized continuously by applying strain in the ferromagnetic state. Thus, based on such a material feature, we can design a magnetic switch device which can work between the magnetic and non-magnetic states by strain modification. Also shown is that the magnetism stability can be enhanced to the level at room temperature upon strain, and the massless Dirac-fermion behavior for the beta-spin state can be clearly detected in the spin gapless semiconductor phase under appropriate strains.",3
Charge-transfer processes and carrier dynamics at the pentacene-C60 interface.,"Heterostructures of pentacene (PEN) and buckminsterfullerene (C60) are frequently attracting scientific interest as a well-defined small-molecule model system for the study of internal interfaces between two organic semiconductors. They are prototypical representatives forming a donor-acceptor combination for studies of fundamental optoelectronic processes in organic photovoltaics. Despite their importance in exciton dissociation, the energetics of their interfacial charge-transfer (CT) states and their microscopic excitation dynamics are not yet clarified and still being discussed. Here, we present steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements on stacked heterostructures composed of these two materials. All experiments are performed in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions as CT states are expected at energies below the fundamental electronic transitions of the respective bulk materials. A characteristic, interface-specific emission at around 1.13-1.17 eV is found, which we attribute to an interfacial CT state. Its excitation energy dependence reveals the intricate relaxation dynamics of excitons formed in both constituent materials. Moreover, the analysis of the dynamics of the C60 excitons shows that the lifetime of this state is reduced in the presence of an interface with PEN. This quenching is attributed to a long-range interaction, i.e. the relaxation of excitations into the interfacial CT state.",3
The role of defects in the physical properties of mechanically activated PbTiO3 ferroelectrics.,"In this work a multi-technique characterization was performed for the first time to trace the influence of structural defects on the physical properties of PbTiO3 ferroelectrics. The structural defects were generated by the mechanical activation in the pressure range of 40-320 MPa, by combining a uniaxial strain with a shear deformation in the Bridgman anvils. The induced defectivity of PbTiO3 was assessed via calculation of unit cell parameters, estimation of the regions of coherent scattering and analysis of micro-deformations. The Debye characteristic temperature, the static mean-square displacement, the Debye-Waller isotropic factor, the vibrational spectra and dielectric properties of the activated PbTiO3 ceramics are presented. The high-quality PbTiO3 ceramics was prepared without modifiers, hence, changing the concentration of structural defects via mechanical activation constitutes a chemically clean method for fine tuning of the dielectric properties of PbTiO3.",3
Critical phenomenon and phase diagram of Mn-intercalated layered MnNb3S6.,"The magnetization of Mn-intercalated layered MnNb3S6 single crystal has been systematically investigated. The angle-dependent magnetization ([Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text]) displays that the magnetization of MnNb3S6 with [Formula: see text] is much stronger than that with H//c, but no magnetic anisotropy within the ab-plane. In addition, a field-induced magnetic phase transition is found when [Formula: see text]. The investigation of the critical behavior gives the critical exponents [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text] with [Formula: see text] K, which belong to the universality class of three-dimensional Heisenberg model. The critical behavior and exponents indicate that the magnetic coupling in MnNb3S6 is of an isotropic short-range type. Based on universality scaling, the H - T phase diagram with [Formula: see text] is constructed. The magnetic behaviors and phase diagram of MnNb3S6 are analogous to those of CrNb3S6 which exhibits a chiral magnetic soliton lattice.",3
Isoelectronic analogues of graphene: the BCN monolayers with visible-light absorption and high carrier mobility.,"By employing particle-swarm optimization (PSO) and first-principles computations, we theoretically predicted five stable phases of graphene-like borocarbonitrides (g-BCN) with the stoichiometric ratio of 1:1:1 and uniformly distributed B, C, N atoms, which are the isoelectronic analogues of graphene. These g-BCN monolayers are effectively stabilized by their relatively high proportion of robust C-C or B-N bonds and strong partial ionic-covalent B-C and C-N bonds within them, leading to pronounced thermal and kinetic stability. The visible-light absorption and high carrier mobility of the investigated g-BCN monolayers indicate their possible applications in high-efficiency photochemical processes and electronic devices. Our computations could provide some guidance for designing the graphene-like materials with earth-abundant elements, as well as some clues for the experimental synthesis and practical applications of ternary BCN nanosheets.",3
A novel cage for actinides: A 6W4Al43 (A = U and Pu).,"We report on synthesis and characterization of the compounds A 6W4Al43 (A = U and Pu), that form in the hexagonal Ho6Mo4Al43 caged-structure family. The A ions reside within W/Al cages where the A-A nearest neighbors form dimers between adjacent W/Al cages, with U-U and Pu-Pu distances of 3.3892 [Formula: see text] and 3.4080 [Formula: see text], respectively. While the W/Al networks provide environments similar to those of other cage-like materials (e.g. filled skutterudites), the atomic displacement parameters from single crystal x-ray diffraction measurements show that the A-ions do not exhibit rattling behavior. We find that there is site interchange disorder on one of the W/Al sites. Magnetic susceptibility measurements show that U6W4Al43 displays anisotropic Curie-Weiss behavior where it fits to the data yield an effective magnetic moment near 2.0 [Formula: see text]/U. At low temperatures the magnetic susceptibility deviates from the Curie-Weiss temperature dependence and eventually saturates to a constant value. In contrast, Pu6W4Al43 displays nearly temperature independent Pauli paramagnetism for all temperatures, as would be expected if the 5f -electrons are delocalized. The electrical resistivity for U6W4Al43 increases slightly with the decreasing temperature, suggesting that it is dominated by f -electronic hybridization effects and disorder scattering that originates from the W/Al site interchange. Specific heat measurements for U6W4Al43 further reveal an enhanced electronic Sommerfeld coefficient that is consistent with a moderately enhanced charge carrier effective mass. Together these measurements expose these materials as hosts for unstable f -electron magnetism, where the novel cage-like structures control the phenomena through the spacing between the A ions. Through this combination of mild magnetism, the low cost elements of the Al-W cages, and chemical tunability that has been shown for related materials in the same structure, the A 6W4Al43 compounds emerge as promising nuclear waste-forms for transuranics, while the wider family of materials makes an appealing environment for studying f -electron physics in a novel structure.",3
Sinusoidally modulated magnetic structure of Kramers local moments in CePd5Al2.,"The crystalline electric field (CEF) level scheme and magnetic structure of a tetragonal antiferromagnet CePd5Al2 with [Formula: see text] K and [Formula: see text] K were studied by neutron scattering, magnetization and magnetoresistance measurements. Inelastic neutron scattering measurements on the powder sample revealed CEF excitations at 21.3 and 22.4 meV. The derived wave functions of the CEF ground state for the Ce(3+) ion consist primarily of [Formula: see text] under the tetragonal symmetry. By means of single-crystal neutron diffraction, magnetic Bragg peaks characterized by a propagation vector [Formula: see text] were observed at [Formula: see text]. Our analysis indicates a sinusoidally modulated magnetic structure with amplitude of 2.0(1) [Formula: see text]/Ce, where the magnetic moments point to the [Formula: see text]-axis. The intensity of the third-order harmonic at 0.8 K is 1/30 as small as that expected for an antiphase structure, suggesting that the modulated structure remains at least down to 0.8 K. Both the magnetization and magnetoresistance show several anomalies in the magnetically ordered phase, indicating field-induced successive changes of the magnetic structure.",3
Investigation of the buried planar interfaces in multi-layered inverted organic solar cells using x-ray reflectivity and impedance spectroscopy.,"The hole and electron extracting interlayers in the organic solar cells (OSCs) play an important role in high performing devices. The present work focuses on an investigation of Zinc oxide/bulk heterojunction (ZnO/BHJ) and BHJ/MoO x (Molybdenum oxide) buried planar interfaces in inverted OSC devices using the optical contrast in various layers along with the electrical measurements. The x-ray reflectivity (XRR) analysis demonstrates the formation of additional intermixing layers at the interfaces of ZnO/BHJ and BHJ/MoO x . Our results indicate infusion of PC71BM into ZnO layer up to ~4 nm which smoothen the ZnO/BHJ interface. In contrast, thermally evaporated MoO x molecules diffuse into PTB7-Th dominant upper layers of BHJ active layer resulting in an intermixed layer at the interface of MoO x /BHJ. The high recombination resistance (~5 kOmega cm(2)) and electron lifetime (~70 mus), obtained from the impedance spectroscopy (IS), support such vertical segregation of PTB7-Th and PC71BM in the active layer. The OSC devices, processed in ambient condition, exhibit high power conversion efficiency of 6.4%. We consider our results have great significance to understand the structure of buried planar interfaces at interlayers and their correlation with the electrical parameters representing various interfacial mechanisms of OSCs.",3
Spin echoes: full numerical solution and breakdown of approximative solutions.,"The spin echo signal from vessels in Krogh's capillary model as well in the random distribution vessel model are studied by numerically solving the Bloch-Torrey equation. A comparison is made with the Gaussian local phase approximation, the Gaussian phase approximation and the strong-collision approximation. Differences between the Gaussian local phase approximation and the Gaussian phase approximation are explained. In the intermediate diffusion regime, the full numerical solution shows oscillations which are absent in any of the approximate solutions. In the limit of large diffusion coefficients, where the approximations become exact, the signal shows a linear-exponential decay governed by a single parameter. The features of the exact numerical solution can be explained by an analytically solvable discrete two-level model. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the different diffusion regimes and the three cases of the damped harmonic oscillator.",3
"Ferroelasticity, anelasticity and magnetoelastic relaxation in Co-doped iron pnictide: Ba(Fe0.957Co0.043)2As2.","The hypothesis that strain has a permeating influence on ferroelastic, magnetic and superconducting transitions in 122 iron pnictides has been tested by investigating variations of the elastic and anelastic properties of a single crystal of Ba(Fe0.957Co0.043)2As2 by resonant ultrasound spectroscopy as a function of temperature and externally applied magnetic field. Non-linear softening and stiffening of C 66 in the stability fields of both the tetragonal and orthorhombic structures has been found to conform quantitatively to the Landau expansion for a pseudoproper ferroelastic transition which is second order in character. The only exception is that the transition occurs at a temperature (T S approximately 69 K) ~10 K above the temperature at which C 66 would extrapolate to zero ([Formula: see text] approximately 59 K). An absence of anomalies associated with antiferromagnetic ordering below T N approximately 60 K implies that coupling of the magnetic order parameter with shear strain is weak. It is concluded that linear-quadratic coupling between the structural/electronic and antiferromagnetic order parameters is suppressed due to the effects of local heterogeneous strain fields arising from the substitution of Fe by Co. An acoustic loss peak at ~50-55 K is attributed to the influence of mobile ferroelastic twin walls that become pinned by a thermally activated process involving polaronic defects. Softening of C 66 by up to ~6% below the normal-superconducting transition at T c approximately 13 K demonstrates an effective coupling of the shear strain with the order parameter for the superconducting transition which arises indirectly as a consequence of unfavourable coupling of the superconducting order parameter with the ferroelastic order parameter. Ba(Fe0.957Co0.043)2As2 is representative of 122 pnictides as forming a class of multiferroic superconductors in which elastic strain relaxations underpin almost all aspects of coupling between the structural, magnetic and superconducting order parameters and of dynamic properties of the transformation microstructures they contain.",3
Charge-state analysis of small barium-oxide clusters by x-ray absorption spectroscopy.,"Small barium-oxide clusters [Formula: see text] are studied by mass spectrometry and x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to discuss stability of the clusters and oxidation state of constituent atoms. It is found that clusters with bulk composition, n = m, are stable, which can accommodate one or two excess oxygen atoms additionally as manifested by n = m + 1 and m + 2 species in the mass spectrum. XAS spectra of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] reveal that the oxidation state of barium atoms stays at +2 (the bulk BaO value) even after binding excess oxygen, whereas spectral features originating from oxygen exhibit composition dependence. The present finding suggests that stoichiometric small barium-oxide clusters bind less-negatively-charged oxygen atoms without change in the charge state of barium.",3
"BEEF-vdW+U method applied to perovskites: thermodynamic, structural, electronic, and magnetic properties.","The recently developed BEEF-vdW exchange-correlation method provides a reasonably reliable description of both long-range van der Waals interactions and short-range covalent bonding between molecules and surfaces. However, this method still suffers from the excessive electron delocalization that is connected with the self-interaction error and, consequently, the calculated chemical and physical properties such as formation energy and band gap deviate markedly from the experimental values, especially when strongly correlated systems are under investigation. In this contribution, BEEF-vdW+U calculations have been performed to study the thermodynamic, structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of La-based perovskites. An effective interaction parameter [Formula: see text] and an energy adjustment [Formula: see text] are determined simultaneously by a mixing GGA and GGA+U method, where the enthalpy or Gibbs free energy of formation of oxides containing a transition metal in different oxidation states are fitted to available experimental data. The [Formula: see text] is found to have its origin in the fact that the GGA+U method gives rise to the offsets in the total energy that include not only the desired physical correction but also an arbitrary contribution. Calculated results indicate that the BEEF-vdW method provides a more accurate description of the bonding in the O2 molecule than the PBE method and has generally smaller [Formula: see text] values for the 3d-block transition metals, thereby giving rise to band gaps and magnetic moments that are in better agreement with the experimentally measured values.",3
Landau level spectroscopy of valence bands in HgTe quantum wells: effects of symmetry lowering.,"The Landau level spectroscopy technique has been used to explore the electronic structure of the valence band in a series of p-type HgTe/HgCdTe quantum wells with both normal and inverted ordering of bands. We find that the standard axial-symmetric 4-band Kane model, which is nowadays widely applied in physics of HgTe-based topological materials, does not fully account for the complex magneto-optical response observed in our experiments-notably, for the unexpected avoided crossings of excitations and for the appearance of transitions that are electric-dipole forbidden within this model. Nevertheless, reasonable agreement with experiments is achieved when the standard model is expanded to include effects of bulk and interface inversion asymmetries. These remove the axial symmetry, and among other, profoundly modify the shape of valence bands.",3
Nonlinear optical response of a two-dimensional semi-Dirac system in the terahertz regime.,"We demonstrate a strong nonlinear optical response in a two-dimensional semi-Dirac system in the terahertz regime. By applying the Boltzmann transport theory for the intra-band process and a quantum mechanics method for the inter band process, we obtained the three-photon current response. It is found that both the intra- and inter-band excitations make significant contributions to the nonlinear response. The third order conductivities (TOCs) [Formula: see text] are about two magnitudes higher than that of [Formula: see text]. Interestingly, for the inter-band TOCs, there is a sign change when the chemical potential varies across the saddle point in the conduction band in [Formula: see text] direction (that is parabolic), due to the competition between the two opposite nonlinear current contributed by the electrons at states [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], respectively. Finally, we show that the nonlinear response in the terahertz regime is significant at experimentally accessible field strengths. Our results suggest that this system could be of potential applications in photonic device for frequency up-conversion.",3
"On the mechanisms of tip-force induced switching in ferroelectric thin films: the crossover of depolarization, shear strain and flexoelectricity.","The recent observation of mechanical switching of ferroelectric polarization has placed the mechanical manipulation of ferroelectrics on an equal footing with the conventional electrical manipulation. However, discussions on the exact switching mechanisms due to mechanical loads are ongoing for the complexity in experimental situations. In this work, based on continuum mechanical and thermodynamic modeling and simulation, we analyze the mechanisms of tip-force induced switching in ferroelectric thin films. The roles of depolarization, shear strain and flexoelectricity in mechanical switching, both in normal and sliding loading modes, are separated out and the switching characteristics are analyzed. The depolarization field in the film is demonstrated to enable bidirectional switching. The coupling between shear strain and polarization components is shown to be important in the sliding loading mode. A great influence of flexoelectricity-modified polarization boundary condition on the switching process is revealed. The previous speculation that the switching process experiences an intermediate paraelectric phase is proved. The regulation of loading force, misfit strain, temperature and film thickness on the switching are further given for each mechanism. Taking all of the three mechanisms into account, we present the phase diagrams of mechanical switching for films in an initial upward or downward polarization state. The revealed characteristics of various switching mechanisms should provide useful guidelines for their verification in experiments, and the tunability of the switching by various influencing factors is instructive for the design and optimization of ferroelectric devices via mechanical engineering.",3
"Tuneable thermal expansion of poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate.","Linear coefficient of thermal expansion is calculated for a mixture of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) and polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) using density functional theory and the Debye-Gruneisen model. The linear coefficient of thermal expansion is a key factor in thermal management (thermal conductivity, thermal stress and thermal fatigue) of microelectronic and energy devices, being common applications of the conjugated polymeric PEDOT:PSS system. The obtained value of 53 x 10(-6) K(-1) at room temperature can be rationalised based on the electronic structure analysis. The PEDOT and PSS units are bonded by a dipole-dipole interaction between S in PEDOT and H in PSS. A C-C bond in a benzene ring (PSS) or thiophene (PEDOT) is up to 13 times stronger than the S-H bond. By adjusting the population of the S-H bonds by deprotonating PSS, the linear coefficient of thermal expansion can be enhanced by 57%. This allows for tuning the thermal properties of PEDOT:PSS in cutting-edge devices.",3
Effects of correlations and temperature on the electronic structures and related physical properties of FeSi and CoSi: a comprehensive study.,"Here, we report detailed investigations of the temperature dependent (100-800 K) electronic structures of FeSi and CoSi by using a DFT+DMFT method where self-consistently calculated values of U and J are used. The calculated spectral functions are found to provide fairly good representation for the experimentally observed photoemission spectra for both the compounds. For FeSi, the density of states (DOS) closer to the Fermi level are found to increase with the increase in temperature up to 450 K and then they decrease, whereas, for CoSi DOS continuously decrease with an increase in temperature. The electronic states of FeSi are greatly influenced by electronic correlations while they are moderately influenced in CoSi. From momentum resolved spectral functions, the excitations have shown enhanced broadening with temperature rise in FeSi whereas an opposite behavior is observed in CoSi. In FeSi, the maximum effect of temperature on the lifetime of [Formula: see text] quasiparticles states is observed where it first decreases to 400 K and then increases, and finally becomes almost infinite at 800 K. The temperature dependent behavior of DOS and quasiparticle lifetime help us in understanding the experimentally observed electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient for these compounds. The calculated effective magnetic moment [Formula: see text] for Fe ( approximately 2.5 [Formula: see text], which is closer to the experimental value) is temperature independent. The electronic structures of these compounds are showing the existence of mixed configurations with [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] for FeSi and CoSi, respectively. Average electrons in the d orbitals are found as approximately 6.5 and approximately 7.7 for FeSi and CoSi, respectively, with charge fluctuations [Formula: see text] 0.9 are obtained for both materials. This suggests that both the compounds are lying in the intermediate coupling regime of electronic correlations.",3
Evolution of crystallinity at a well-defined molecular interface of epitaxial C60 on the single crystal rubrene.,"Uniform and well-defined interfaces are required for clarification of fundamental processes at internal interfaces between donor and acceptor molecules constituting organic optoelectronic devices. In this study, evolution of a well-ordered molecular interface, epitaxially grown C60 on the single crystal rubrene (C42H28) surface, was accurately investigated by grazing incidence x-ray diffraction (GIXD) techniques. Contrasting to the case of C60 on the single crystal pentacene forming uniquely aligned epitaxial interfaces, coexistence of two inequivalent crystalline domains of C60 was identified on the single crystal rubrene. Nevertheless, crystallinity of C60/rubrene exhibited even more remarkable improvement to extend its in-plane average crystallite size up to 250 nm as the growth temperature was raised. Probable leading factors determining the structures and crystallinity of the well-defined molecular interfaces are discussed based on close comparison of the present results with the C60/pentacene interfaces. The techniques presented herein for enhancement of the crystallinity in epitaxial molecular interfaces are potentially applicable to development in the photoelectric power conversion efficiency of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) via improved charge carrier mobility in donor-acceptor interfaces.",3
Ferromagnetic effects on helium-vacancy complex formation in BCC Fe.,"The substitution of helium atom inside BCC Fe results in (1) lattice distortion, (2) the resonance phonon modes, and (3) the scattering center, enhancing the anharmonicity of phonon and magnon. The ferromagnetic effects are analyzed by comparing results in the ferromagnetic and non-magnetic systems using spin-lattice dynamics simulations based on quantum fluctuation dissipation relation. The ferromagnetic effects are subtracted into static and dynamic contributions, where the former is found to be dominant. Neglecting ferromagnetic effects would bring with unexpected large error in the description of kinetics of helium in metals.",3
Phase field model of uranium carbide solidification through a combined KKS and orientation field approach.,"A Phase Field model is developed combining the Orientation Field approach to modeling solidification with the Kim, Kim, Suzuki method of modeling binary alloys. These combined methods produce a model capable of simulating randomly oriented second phase dendrites with discrete control of the solid-liquid interface energy and thickness. The example system of carbon in a liquid uranium (U) melt is used as a test for the model. The formation of uranium carbide within a liquid U melt is simulated for isothermal conditions and compares well with experiments.",3
Strain-mediated effects of oxygen deficiency and variation in non-Fermi liquid behavior of epitaxial PrNiO3-delta thin films.,"To understand the effects of oxygen variation in combination with different strains in perovskite nickelates, three sets of PrNiO3-delta thin films S 1, S 2 and S 3 were deposited on (0 0 1) oriented single-crystal wafers of SrTiO3, LSAT [(LaAlO3)0.3(Sr2TaAlO6)0.7] and LaAlO3, respectively. Two sets of films, S 1 and S 2, have tensile strain whereas the films of S 3 show compressive strain. For each set, two thin films of fixed thickness (5 nm) were deposited; one film was annealed in situ in oxygen partial pressure just after deposition, the other film was not annealed. The difference in oxygen stoichiometry caused a different state of epitaxial strain in the films. So, the strain was induced in the films due to lattice mismatch with substrate, which modified due to oxygen deficiency. These films show non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behavior in the metallic state. The fitting parameters to power-law equation show a systematic tuning of NFL fitting parameters because of variations in strain. Our results show that not only lattice mismatch induced strain, but also oxygen stoichiometry are crucial parameters in changing the state of strain and hence the NFL behavior and electronic properties of perovskite nickelates.",3
Doping dependence of the phase diagram in one-dimensional extended Hubbard model: a functional renormalization group study.,"Using functional renormalization group method, we studied the phase diagram of the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model at different dopings. At half filling, variety of states strongly compete with each other. These states include spin-density wave, charge-density wave, s-wave and p -wave superconductivity, phase separation, and an exotic bond-order wave. By doping, system favours superconductivity more than density waves. At 1/8 doping, a new area of extended s-wave superconductivity emerges between charge density wave and bond-order wave regions. If the system is doped to 1/4-doping, a new area of p -wave superconductivity emerges between charge-density wave and spin-density wave regions.",3
The Anderson-Josephson quantum dot-a theory perspective.,"Recent progress in nanoscale manufacturing has allowed to experimentally investigate quantum dots coupled to two superconducting leads in controlled and tunable setups. The equilibrium Josephson current was measured in on-chip superconducting quantum interference devices, and subgap states were investigated using weakly coupled metallic leads for spectroscopy. This has reinstated two 'classic' problems on the agenda of theoretical condensed matter physics: (1) the Josephson effect and (2) quantum spins in superconductors. The relevance of the former is obvious as the barrier, which separates the two superconductors in a standard Josephson junction, is merely replaced by the quantum dot with well separated energy levels. For odd filling of the dot it acts as a quantum mechanical spin-1/2 and thereby the relevance of the latter becomes apparent also. For normal conducting leads and at odd dot filling the Kondo effect strongly modifies the transport properties as can, e.g. be studied within the Anderson model. One can expect the same for superconducting leads, and in certain parameter regimes remnants of Kondo physics, i.e. strong electronic correlations, will affect the Josephson current. In this topical review, we discuss the status of the theoretical understanding of the Anderson-Josephson quantum dot in equilibrium, mainly focusing on the Josephson current. We introduce a minimal model consisting of a dot which can only host a single spin-up and a single spin-down electron repelling each other by a local Coulomb interaction. The dot is tunnel-coupled to two superconducting leads as described by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer Hamiltonian. This model was investigated using a variety of methods, some capturing aspects of Kondo physics, while others failing in this respect. We briefly review this. The model shows a first order level-crossing quantum phase transition when varying any parameter, provided that the others are within appropriate ranges. At vanishing temperature it leads to a jump of the Josephson current. To study the qualitative behavior of the phase diagram, or the Josephson current, several of the methods can be used. However, for a quantitative description, elaborate quantum many-body methods must be employed. We show that a quantitative agreement between accurate results obtained for the simple model and measurements of the current can be reached. This confirms that the experiments reveal the finite temperature signatures of the zero temperature transition. In addition, we consider two examples of more complex dot geometries, which might be experimentally realized in the near future. The first is characterized by the interplay of the above level-crossing physics and the Fano effect, and the second by the interplay of superconductivity and almost degenerate singlet and triplet two-body states.",3
Born effective charge removed anomalous temperature dependence of lattice thermal conductivity in monolayer GeC.,"Due to potential applications in nano- and opto-electronics, two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted tremendous interest. Their thermal transport properties are closely related to the performance of 2D materials-based devices. Here, the phonon transports of monolayer GeC with a perfect planar hexagonal honeycomb structure are investigated by solving the linearized phonon Boltzmann equation within the single-mode relaxation time approximation (RTA). Without inclusion of Born effective charges (Z (*)) and dielectric constants ([Formula: see text]), the lattice thermal conductivity ([Formula: see text]) decreases almost linearly above 350 K, deviating from the usual [Formula: see text] law. The underlying mechanism is because the contribution to [Formula: see text] from high-frequency optical phonon modes increases with increasing temperature, and the contribution exceeds one from acoustic branches at high temperature. These can be understood by huge phonon band gap caused by large difference in atom mass between Ge and C atoms, which produces important effects on scattering process involving high-frequency optical phonon. When considering Z (*) and [Formula: see text], the phonon group velocities and phonon lifetimes of high-frequency optical phonon modes are obviously reduced with respect to ones without Z (*) and [Formula: see text]. The reduced group velocities and phonon lifetimes give rise to small contribution to [Formula: see text] from high-frequency optical phonon modes, which produces the the traditional [Formula: see text] relation in monolayer GeC. Our works highlight the importance of Z (*) and [Formula: see text] to investigate phonon transports of monolayer GeC, and motivate further theoretical or experimental efforts to investigate thermal transports of other 2D materials.",3
Topological valley pumping in Weyl semimetals.,"We investigate the topological pumping effect in Weyl semimetals, subject to the modulation of two ac electric fields along y and z directions, respectively. We show that the pumping effect originates from the anomalous velocity related to the Berry curvature. The direction of the pumping current is dependent on the chirality of the Weyl fermions. While the total particle current is vanishing because the Weyl points of opposite chirality always come in pairs in Weyl semimetals, the pump gives rise to a net chirality current or valley current. The noiseless valley current generated can be useful in valleytronic applications.",3
Hydrogen interaction with graphene on Ir(1 1 1): a combined intercalation and functionalization study.,"We demonstrate a procedure for obtaining a H-intercalated graphene layer that is found to be chemically decoupled from the underlying metal substrate. Using high-resolution x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy techniques, we reveal that the hydrogen intercalated graphene is p-doped by about 0.28 eV, but also identify structures of interfacial hydrogen. Furthermore, we investigate the reactivity of the decoupled layer towards atomic hydrogen and vibrationally excited molecular hydrogen and compare these results to the case of non-intercalated graphene. We find distinct differences between the two. Finally, we discuss the possibility to form graphane clusters on an iridium substrate by combined intercalation and H atom exposure experiments.",3
Time resolved FORC analysis and magnetic anisotropy in K0.4[Cr(CN)6][Mn(S)-pn] (S)-pnH0.6 chiral molecular magnets.,"Effect of the delay between stabilization of magnetic field and recording of the reversal curve on the first order reversal curves (FORC) has been found and analyzed in K0.4[Cr(CN)6][Mn(R/S)-pn](R/S)-pnH0.6 chiral magnet. The difference between the 'delayed' and 'on time' FORC diagrams manifests the effect of magnetic relaxation on switching field of the nonlinear spin configurations presented in crystals (spin solitons, domain walls, etc). The domain walls and spin solitons with different relaxation rates contribute to reversal magnetization. The temperature dependence of magnetic anisotropy governing nonlinear spin excitations is discussed in the frames of the Callen-Callen formalism.",3
Role of electron-magnon interaction in non-Fermi liquid behavior of SrRuO3.,"SrRuO3 is a popular material extensively used as a bottom electrode in various applications, however, a few problems which will certainly change the interface band structure and greatly alter the device's property are still not fully understood, such as the change of carrier types at a certain temperature and the quasiparticle scattering for non-Fermi liquid behavior below ferromagnetic transition temperature. In this study, magnetic, transport (electrical and thermal) properties and x-ray photoemission spectra have been used to understand the role of quasiparticle interactions in the SrRuO3 bulk system. At the Fermi level, the hybridization of Ru4dt 2g downward arrow and O2p bands form a typical two band system. In order to explain the problems as mentioned, our present work reveals that there must be an impurity band that couples with the bands around Fermi level and serves as a charge reservoir. In the present case, the impurity is attributed to the Ru vacancies. As a result, the conduction electrons scatter strongly with the Ru vacancies and couple with the Ru magnons to give rise to a dominant electron-magnon coupling that overwhelms the electron-phonon coupling in the temperature range of 90-150 K.",3
The effect of interface atomic structure on the deformation mechanisms of Ti2AlN/TiAl composite under nanoindentation using MD simulations.,"In this study, we conduct molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the effect of interface atomic structure on the deformation mechanisms of Ti2AlN/TiAl composite under nanoindentation. It is found that the interface atomic structure has a remarkable effect on the deformation behavior of Ti2AlN/TiAl composite due to significantly different interface-dislocation interactive mechanisms. For the Ti2AlN(0 0 0 1)/TiAl(1 1 1) coherent interface system, although plenty of dislocations nucleate and propagate through the TiAl layer during the indentation process, there are no dislocations transmitting across the coherent interface. The formation of stair-rod dislocation and dislocation tangle is the major mechanism for blocking the slip motion of dislocations by the coherent interface. Thus, the Ti2AlN(0 0 0 1)/TiAl(1 1 1) coherent interface is beneficial for the strengthening effect of Ti2AlN/TiAl composite. For the Ti2AlN(1 0 [Formula: see text] 3)/TiAl(1 1 1) incoherent interface system, the incoherent interface has some ability to annihilate the dislocations nucleated from the TiAl during the indentation process, but it cannot simultaneously annihilate plenty of dislocations. These dislocations accumulate in the incoherent interface and cause the stress concentration, providing the driving force for dislocation nucleation in Ti2AlN from the poor matching regions in the Al atomic arrays at the incoherent interface. Therefore, the incoherent interface can provide the access of dislocation transmission from TiAl to Ti2AlN, which benefits the ductility of Ti2AlN/TiAl composite.",3
Conductance quantisation in patterned gate In0.75Ga0.25As structures up to 6 x (2e (2)/h).,"We present electrical measurements from In0.75Ga0.25As 1D channel devices with Rashba-type, spin-orbit coupling present in the 2D contact regions. Suppressed backscattering as a result of the time-reversal asymmetry at the 1D channel entrance results in enhanced ballistic transport characteristics with clear quantised conductance plateaus up to 6 x (2e (2)/h). Applying DC voltages between the source and drain ohmic contacts and an in-plane magnetic field confirms a ballistic transport picture. For asymmetric patterned gate biasing, a lateral spin-orbit coupling effect is weak. However, the Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling leads to a g-factor in the 1D channel that is reduced in magnitude from the 2D value of 9 to ~6.5 in the lowest subband when the effective Rashba field and the applied magnetic field are perpendicular.",3
Probing interlayer excitons in a vertical van der Waals p-n junction using a scanning probe microscopy technique.,"Two dimensional (2D) semiconductors feature exceptional optoelectronic properties controlled by strong confinement in one dimension. In this contribution, we studied interlayer excitons in a vertical p-n junction made of bilayer n-type MoS2 and few layers of p-type GaSe using current sensing atomic force microscopy (CSAFM). The p-n interface is prepared by mechanical exfoliation onto highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). Thus the heterostructure creates an ideal layered system with HOPG serving as the bottom contact for the electrical characterization. Home-built Au tips are used as the top contact in CSAFM mode. During the basic diode characterization, the p-n interface shows strong rectification behavior with a rectification ratio of 10(4) at +/-1 V. The I-V characteristics reveal pronounced photovoltaic effects with a fill factor of 0.55 by an excitation below the band gap. This phenomenon can be explained by the dissociation of interlayer excitons at the interface. The possibility of the interlayer exciton formation is indicated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations on this heterostructure: the valence band of GaSe and the conduction band of MoS2 contribute to an interface-specific state at an energy of about 1.5 eV. The proof of excitonic transitions to that state is provided by photoluminescence measurements at the p-n interface. Finally, photocurrent mapping at the interface under an excitation wavelength of 785 nm provides evidence of efficient extraction of such excitons. Our results demonstrate a pathway towards a 2D device for future optoelectronics and light harvesting assisted by interlayer excitons in a van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure.",3
Scaling of magnetotransport in the Ba(Fe1-x Co x )2As2 series.,"We present magnetotransport studies of the parent, an underdoped and an optimally doped composition of the Ba(Fe1-x Co x )2As2 series. We observe that both the Kohler's and modified Kohler's scaling is typically violated in these systems. A notable exception is the magnetically ordered state of the underdoped composition where the modified Kohler's scaling is observed to be valid, indicating its relative similarity to the cuprates and some heavy fermion systems. This composition also exhibits a feature in the Hall angle, which could signify the opening of a pseudogap before the onset of long range magnetic order. The implications of our observations are discussed in the context of magnetotransport of metals with incipient magnetic fluctuations.",3
"Nontrivial topology of bulk HgSe from the study of cyclotron effective mass, electron mobility and phase shift of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations.","In this paper, the authors report the results of an experimental study of effective mass, electron mobility and phase shift of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations of transverse magnetoresistance in an extended electron concentration region from 8.8 x 10(15) cm(-3) to 4.3 x 10(18) cm(-3) in single crystals of mercury selenide. The revealed features indicate that Weyl semimetal phase may exist in HgSe at low electron density. The most significant result is the discovery of an abrupt change of Berry phase [Formula: see text] at electron concentration [Formula: see text] 2 x 10(18) cm(-3), which we explain in terms of a manifestation of topological Lifshitz transition in HgSe that occurs by tuning Fermi energy via doping.",3
Impurity induced cross luminescence in KMgCl3: an ab initio study.,"Density functional theory calculations have been carried out to calculate the electronic structure and optical properties of host and Cs doped KMgCl3. All the calculations were performed by using the Tran and Blaha modified Becke-Johnson potential (TB-mBJ) in order to accurately predict the band gap and the optical spectra. The investigated compound is found to be an insulator with direct band gap of 4.7, 6.9 eV using generalized gradient approximation (GGA), and TB-mBJ functionals respectively. The calculated refractive index shows the optical isotropy of this compound in the low energy region, though the structure is anisotropic. From our theoretical calculations we predict KMgCl3 doped with Cs to be a better cross luminescence material compared to host compound, where additional Cs states are present below the valence band of the compound. Detailed discussion is presented in the manuscript.",3
Ultrafast dynamics of solvated electrons at anatase TiO2/H2O interface.,"Solvated electrons are known to be the lowest energy charge transfer pathways at oxide/aqueous interface and the understanding of the electron transfer dynamics at the interface is fundamental for photochemical and photocatalytic processes. Taking anatase TiO2/H2O interface as a prototypical system, we perform time-dependent ab initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics calculations to study the charge transfer dynamics of solvated electrons. For the static electronic properties, we find that the dangling H atoms can stabilize solvated electrons. A solvated electron band can be formed with one monolayer H2O adsorption. The energies of the solvated electron band minimum (SEBM) decrease when H2O adsorbs dissociatively. Moreover, the surface oxygen vacancies are also helpful for stabilizing the solvated electron band. For the dynamics behaviour, we find that the ultrafast charge transfer from SEBM to anatase TiO2 (1 0 1) surface at 100 K is mainly contributed by nonadiabatic mechanism. Comparing with rutile TiO2 (1 1 0) surface, the lifetime of solvated electron on anatase TiO2 (1 0 1) surface is longer, suggesting a better photocatalytic properties. Our results provide essential insights into the understanding of the charge transfer dynamics and the possible photocatalytic mechanism at oxide/aqueous interface.",3
Pseudogap in the c-axis (along the ladder) optical conductivity of t - J ladders and its quasiparticle interpretation.,"Motivated by similarities between cuprate superconductors and two-leg ladder copper-oxide compounds and in order to obtain a better understanding of optical properties of cuprate superconductors we have studied the c-axis (along the ladder) optical conductivity [Formula: see text] of a doped [Formula: see text] two-leg ladder. Using exact diagonalization, we have calculated the conductivity and related quantities for cyclic ladders of up to 13 rungs. In agreement with results of an early study by Hayward and coworkers (Hayward et al 1996 Phys. Rev. B 53 8863) we find that [Formula: see text] consists of a Drude peak at zero frequency and an absorption band in the infrared region that is separated from the former by a pseudogap. The width of the pseudogap [Formula: see text] increases with increasing J/t, in parallel with an increase of the magnitude [Formula: see text] of the gap in the quasiparticle excitation spectra. Our central finding is that [Formula: see text], where [Formula: see text] is the magnitude of the gap in the spin excitation spectra. We demonstrate that this approximate relation can be understood in terms of a phenomenological model involving a superconducting ladder and a coupling between charged quasiparticles and spin excitations. The relation is remarkably similar to the one between experimental values of the energy scale of a dip in the in-plane optical conductivity, the superconducting gap [Formula: see text] and the energy of the spin-resonance in cuprate superconductors (for a recent discussion of the optical data, see Sopik et al 2015 New J. Phys. 17 053022). Our findings support the point of view that low energy infrared active excited states of cuprate superconductors can be viewed as consisting of two charged quasiparticles connected with pair-breaking and a spin excitation.",3
Circular current and induced force in a molecular ring junction.,"We consider bias-induced circular current in a molecular ring junction. It is natural to define circular current as a component of ring current that acts as a sole source of magnetic flux induced in the ring. Alternatively, the bias-induced circular current can also be determined from the magnetic response of the ring junction to an external flux in the zero-flux limit. This leads to determination of bias-induced circular current without actually calculating the bond currents. We also explore the possibility of circular current-induced force rupturing the covalent bonds in the ring leading to ultimate breakdown of the ring junction. Our calculations underscore the reliability problem posed by the current magnification effect in the molecular ring structures.",3
Evidence for hidden order in a nonlinear model elastic system.,"Hidden order may arise in strongly correlated systems even if there is an apparent lack of long-range order as measured by local order parameters. This phenomenon has been essentially associated with topological order in quantum systems. Here, we demonstrate the emergence of hidden order in a 1D non-linear classical mechanical system that supports rotational degrees of freedom. The potential energy of the model system creates a bistable system for which hidden order emerges with the introduction of a biquadratic term. To our surprise, we discover that varying the strength of the biquadratic term leads to four distinct phases quantified by the behaviors of the Neel and string order parameters. Three of these phases are locally disordered. Hidden order is identified by a string order parameter that shows correlations with significantly longer range than the Neel order parameter. The hidden order correlation length diverges as the kinetic energy of the system is lowered with a critical exponent ~0.5. The observation of hidden order in a mechanical system reveals that instability and non-linearity may play critical roles in the generation of nonlocal long-range correlations in apparently locally disordered systems.",3
Three-dimensional structure of antiphase domains in GaP on Si(0 0 1).,"Antiphase domains are three-dimensional crystal defects commonly arising at the interface of III-V semiconductors and Si. While control over their formation has been achieved, the geometry of the antiphase domain itself that is separated from the mainphase of the crystal by the so-called antiphase boundary, has not yet been fully understood. In this work, we first investigate the interface between GaP and Si itself by cross-sectional scanning tunneling microscopy (XSTM) to reveal possible intermixing within an 8 monolayers wide region. Furthermore, we present an extensive analysis combining transmission electron microscopy and XSTM to elucidate the shape of antiphase domains in GaP. To create a true-to-scale, three-dimensional model of an antiphase domain, firstly, plan-view transmission electron microscopy images are drawn on. Subsequently, the progression of many antiphase boundaries through the GaP crystal as viewed from the (1 1 0) and (1 [Formula: see text] 0) cleavage planes is analyzed all the way down to the atomic level by means of XSTM. This enables a detailed analysis of the shape and physical dimensions of the antiphase domains. A typical measured extension in growth directions is found to be a maximum of 60 nm and the maximum measured extension of the base plane in [[Formula: see text] 1 0] and [1 1 0] directions is about 160 nm and 50 nm, respectively. They appear as pyramids with anisotropic base planes whose side facets kink many times.",3
Photo-isomerization of azobenzene containing surfactants induced by near-infrared light using upconversion nanoparticles as mediator.,"Here we report on photo-isomerization of azobenzene containing surfactants induced during irradiation with near-infrared (NIR) light in the presence of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) acting as mediator. The surfactant molecule consists of charged head group and hydrophobic tail with azobenzene group incorporated in alkyl chain. The azobenzene group can be reversible photo-isomerized between two states: trans- and cis- by irradiation with light of an appropriate wavelength. The trans-cis photo-isomerization is induced by UV light, while cis-trans isomerization proceeds either thermally in darkness, or can be accelerated by exposure to illumination with a longer wavelength typically in a blue/green range. We present the application of lanthanide doped UCNPs to successfully switch azobenzene containing surfactants from cis to trans conformation in bulk solution using NIR light. Using Tm(3+) or Er(3+) as activator ions, the UCNPs provide emissions in the spectral range of 450 nm < lambda em < 480 nm (for Tm(3+), three and four photon induced emission) or 525 nm < lambda em < 545 nm (for Er(3+), two photon induced emission), respectively. Especially for UCNPs containing Tm(3+) a good overlap of the emissions with the absorption bands of the azobenzene is present. Under illumination of the surfactant solution with NIR light (lambda ex = 976 nm) in the presence of the Tm(3+)-doped UCNPs, the relaxation time of cis-trans photo-isomerization was increased by almost 13 times compared to thermally induced isomerization. The influence of thermal heating due to the irradiation using NIR light was shown to be minor for solvents not absorbing in NIR spectral range (e.g. CHCl3) in contrast to water, which shows a distinct absorption in the NIR.",3
Magneto-optical properties of Au upon the injection of hot spin-polarized electrons across Fe/Au(0 0 1) interfaces.,"We demonstrate a novel method for the excitation of sizable magneto-optical effects in Au by means of the laser-induced injection of hot spin-polarized electrons in Au/Fe/MgO(0 0 1) heterostructures. It is based on the energy- and spin-dependent electron transmittance of Fe/Au interface which acts as a spin filter for non-thermalized electrons optically excited in Fe. We show that after crossing the interface, majority electrons propagate through the Au layer with the velocity on the order of 1 nm fs(-1) (close to the Fermi velocity) and the decay length on the order of 100 nm. Featuring ultrafast functionality and requiring no strong external magnetic fields, spin injection results in a distinct magneto-optical response of Au. We develop a formalism based on the phase of the transient complex MOKE response and demonstrate its robustness in a plethora of experimental and theoretical MOKE studies on Au, including our ab initio calculations. Our work introduces a flexible tool to manipulate magneto-optical properties of metals on the femtosecond timescale that holds high potential for active magneto-photonics, plasmonics, and spintronics.",3
Effects of Si solute on the glass formation and atomic structure of Pd liquid.,"Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to study the effects of Si solute on the glass formation and crystallization of Pd liquid. Pure Pd samples prepared by a quenching process with a cooling rate of 10(13) K s(-1) can be in an amorphous state but the structural analysis indicates there is nearly no glass-forming motif in the sample. However, doping a small amount of Si (Si concentration ~4%) the sample can be vitrified at a cooling rate of 10(12) K s(-1). The glass-forming motifs such as Pd-centered Z13, Si-centered Z9-like and mixed-ICO-cube clusters with five-fold local symmetry are found to be the dominant short-range orders in the glassy samples. With the increasing of the Si-doping concentration, these glass-forming motifs tend to aggregate and connect with each other forming a network structure. Our calculated results revealed that Si solutes in liquid Pd can significantly enhance the glass-forming ability.",3
Thermal stability and interlayer exchange processes in heterolayers of TiOPc and PTCDA on Ag(1 1 1).,"Organic-organic interfaces, in particular donor-acceptor type heterointerfaces, represent central elements of organic electronic devices. Understanding and controlling their physical properties is key to improve and modify their performance. For this purpose we have investigated the structural properties and thermal evolution of molecular heterointerface model systems. Specifically, various stacked titanyl-phthalocyanine (TiOPc)-3,4,9,10-perylene-tetracarboxylic-dianhydride (PTCDA) heterolayers grown on Ag(1 1 1) have been examined using Fourier transform infrared absorption spectroscopy and spot-profile analysis low-energy electron diffraction. An accurate description of the thermal evolution and prevalence of the various phases of TiOPc and PTCDA is derived from the spectral signatures of the two molecular species explored in previous studies. Exceptionally high thermal stability is found for stacked heterolayers comprising TiOPc double layers with characteristic up-down arrangement of its axial Ti-O unit and single layers of PTCDA. Thereby, interlayer exchange is negligible in a wide temperature range ([Formula: see text] K). This is ascribed to attractive intermolecular interaction (dipole-dipole interaction, hydrogen bonding) among the TiOPc molecules oriented face-to-face within the TiOPc bilayer sheet. Stacked layers of comprising single layers of TiOPc and of PTCDA turn out to be thermally much less stable and more heterogeneous. In the course of their thermal evolution, a number of processes such as interlayer exchange, TiOPc double-layer formation and dewetting are encountered.",3
Modification of Pb quantum well states by the adsorption of organic molecules.,"The successful implementation of nanoscale materials in next generation optoelectronic devices crucially depends on our ability to functionalize and design low dimensional materials according to the desired field of application. Recently, organic adsorbates have revealed an enormous potential to alter the occupied surface band structure of tunable materials by the formation of tailored molecule-surface bonds. Here, we extend this concept of adsorption-induced surface band structure engineering to the unoccupied part of the surface band structure. This is achieved by our comprehensive investigation of the unoccupied band structure of a lead (Pb) monolayer film on the Ag(1 1 1) surface prior and after the adsorption of one monolayer of the aromatic molecule 3,4,9,10-perylene-tetracarboxylic-dianhydride (PTCDA). Using two-photon momentum microscopy, we show that the unoccupied states of the Pb/Ag(1 1 1) bilayer system are dominated by a parabolic quantum well state (QWS) in the center of the surface Brillouin zone with Pb p[Formula: see text] orbital character and a side band with almost linear dispersion showing Pb p[Formula: see text] orbital character. After the adsorption of PTCDA, the Pb side band remains completely unaffected while the signal of the Pb QWS is fully suppressed. This adsorption induced change in the unoccupied Pb band structure coincides with an interfacial charge transfer from the Pb layer into the PTCDA molecule. We propose that this charge transfer and the correspondingly vertical (partially chemical) interaction across the PTCDA/Pb interface suppresses the existence of the QWS in the Pb layer. Our results hence unveil a new possibility to orbital selectively tune and control the entire surface band structure of low dimensional systems by the adsorption of organic molecules.",3
Performance of van der Waals DFT approaches for helium diffraction on metal surfaces.,"The ability of the different approaches proposed to date to include the effects of van der Waals (vdW) dispersion forces in density functional theory (DFT) is currently under debate. Here, we used the diffraction of He on a Ru(0 0 0 1) surface as a challenging benchmark system to analyze the suitability of several representative approaches, from the ones correcting the exchange-correlation generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functional, to the ones correcting the DFT energies through pairwise-based methods. To perform our analysis, we have built seven continuous potential energy surfaces (PESs) and carried out quantum dynamics simulations using a multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree method. Our analysis reveals that standard DFT within the PBE-GGA framework, although it overestimates diffraction probabilities, yields the best results in comparison with available experimental measurements. On the other hand, although several of the existing vdW DFT approaches yield physisorption wells in very good agreement with experiment, they all seem to overestimate the long-distance corrugation of the PES, the region probed by He scattering, resulting in a large overestimation of diffraction probabilities.",3
Defect driven spin state transition and the existence of half-metallicity in CoO.,"We unveil the native defect induced high spin to low spin state transition in [Formula: see text] and half-metallicity in CoO. First principles calculations unravel that, defect density holds a key role in dictating the spin-state transition in [Formula: see text] ion in CoO, and introducing the half-metallicity. Charge transfer in the vicinity of vacancy plane favors the stabilization and coexistence of bivalent [Formula: see text] and trivalent [Formula: see text] ion in CoO. We propose that defect engineering could serve as a route to design the half metallicity in transition metal mono-oxides.",3
Effects of site asymmetry and valley mixing on Hofstadter-type spectra of bilayer graphene in a square-scatter array potential.,"Under a magnetic field perpendicular to an monolayer graphene, the existence of a two-dimensional periodic scatter array can not only mix Landau levels of the same valley for displaying split electron-hole Hofstadter-type energy spectra, but also couple two sets of Landau subbands from different valleys in a bilayer graphene. Such a valley mixing effect with a strong scattering strength has been found observable and studied thoroughly in this paper by using a Bloch-wave expansion approach and a projected [Formula: see text] effective Hamiltonian including interlayer effective mass, interlayer coupling and asymmetrical on-site energies due to a vertically-applied electric field. For bilayer graphene, we find two important characteristics, i.e. mixing and interference of intervalley scatterings in the presence of a scatter array, as well as a perpendicular-field induced site-energy asymmetry which deforms severely or even destroys completely the Hofstadter-type band structures due to the dependence of Bloch-wave expansion coefficients on the applied electric field.",3
"Using first principles calculations to interpret XANES experiments: extracting the size-dependence of the (p , T) phase diagram of sub-nanometer Cu clusters in an O2 environment.","We have used ab initio density functional theory together with ab initio atomistic thermodynamics, and in situ x-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) experiments, to study the oxidation of sub-nanometer clusters of Cu n O x supported on a hydroxylated amorphous alumina substrate in an O2-rich environment. We obtain (p , T) phase diagrams: these differ notably for the nanoclusters compared to the bulk. Both the theory and experiment suggest that in the presence of oxygen, the cluster will oxidize from its elemental state to the oxidized state as the temperature decreases. We obtain a clear trend for the transition of Cu n --> Cu n O n/2: we see that the smaller the cluster, the greater is the tendency toward oxidation. However, we do not see a monotonic size-dependent trend for the transition of Cu n O n/2 --> Cu n O n . We suggest that theoretically computed Bader charges constitute a simple yet quantitative way to align experimental measures of XANES edges with theoretical calculations, so as to yield oxidation states for nanoclusters. Our results have important implications for the use of small clusters in fields such as nanocatalysis and nanomedicine.",3
Revelation of spin glass behavior in Ru doped MnNiGe: experiment and theory.,"We report on the nature of the magnetism in Ru substituted MnNiGe using the combined results of x-ray diffraction, dc-magnetization, ac-susceptibility and ab initio calculations. Mn0.7Ru0.3NiGe crystallizes in Ni2In-type hexagonal structure (P63/mmc) at room temperature with lattice parameters a = b = 4.099 [Formula: see text] and c = 5.367 [Formula: see text]. From the dc-magnetization; a broad peak around 46.55 K, separation between zero-field cooled and field-cooled warming state and non-saturating isothermal magnetization with typical S-type hysteresis indicate glassy behavior. A cusp in [Formula: see text] is observed to shift toward high temperatures with increasing frequency. Mydosh parameter ([Formula: see text]), single-relaxation time ([Formula: see text] s) obtained through critical slowing-down analysis, [Formula: see text] from the Vogel-Fulcher law and Tholence criterion [Formula: see text], confirm that Mn0.7Ru0.3NiGe belongs to the short-range interaction spin-glass systems with strong coupling between the magnetic clusters. LSDA+U calculations confirmed the competing exchange interactions between large magnetic moments of the Mn ions in Mn0.7Ru0.3NiGe compound resulting in the formation of spin-glassy characteristics.",3
Ultrafast electron-lattice thermalization in copper and other noble metal nanoparticles.,"Using time-resolved ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy we investigated the electron-lattice energy transfer in small copper nanospheres with diameters ranging from 3.2 to 23 nm, either embedded in a glass or dispersed in a solvent. Electron-lattice scattering rate is shown to increase with size reduction, in agreement with our previous results obtained on gold and silver nanoparticles in the low excitation regime. We attribute this effect to the reduction of the screening efficiency of electron-phonon interactions close to the nanoparticle surface. To understand the discrepancy between the results on the electron-lattice scattering in different metals reported in the literature (reduction, no dependence or increase with nanoparticle size), we discuss the experimental conditions required for the accurate determination of electron-lattice energy transfer time from time-resolved investigations in the weak and strong excitation regimes and present power-dependent experiments on gold nanospheres in solution. Our findings are derived from a theoretical analysis based on the two-temperature model predictions and on a complete modeling of the nanoparticle transient extinction cross-section through the resolution of Boltzmann equation in the presence of hot electrons.",3
Momentum microscopy on the micrometer scale: photoemission micro-tomography applied to single molecular domains.,"Photoemission tomography (PT) is a newly developed method for analyzing angular resolved photoemission data. In combination with momentum microscopy it allows for a comprehensive investigation of the electronic structure of (in particular) metal-organic interfaces as they occur in organic electronic devices. The most interesting aspect in this context is the band alignment, the control of which is indispensable for designing devices. Since PT is based on characteristic photoemission patterns that are used as fingerprints, the method works well as long as these patterns are uniquely representing the specific molecular orbital they are originating from. But this limiting factor is often not fulfilled for systems exhibiting many differently oriented molecules, as they may occur on highly symmetric substrate surfaces. Here we show that this limitation can be lifted by recording the photoemission data in a momentum microscope and limiting the probed surface area to only a few micrometers squared, since this corresponds to a typical domain size for many systems. We demonstrate this by recording data from a single domain of the archetypal adsorbate system 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride on Cu(0 0 1). This proof of principle experiment paves the way for establishing the photoemission [Formula: see text]-tomography method as an ideal tool for investigating the electronic structure of metal-organic interfaces with so far unraveled clarity and unambiguity.",3
Low-temperature anomaly in disordered superconductors near B c2 as a vortex-glass property.,"Strongly disordered superconductors in a magnetic field display many characteristic properties of type-II superconductivity-except at low temperatures, where an anomalous linear temperature dependence of the resistive critical field B c2 is routinely observed. This behavior violates the conventional theory of superconductivity, and its origin has posed a long-standing puzzle. Here we report systematic measurements of the critical magnetic field and current on amorphous indium oxide films with various levels of disorder. Surprisingly, our measurements show that the B c2 anomaly is accompanied by mean-field-like scaling of the critical current. Based on a comprehensive theoretical study we argue that these observations are a consequence of the vortex-glass ground state and its thermal fluctuations. Our theory further predicts that the linear-temperature anomaly occurs more generally in both films and disordered bulk superconductors, with a slope that depends on the normal-state sheet resistance, which we confirm experimentally.",3
Phonons on Cu(001) surface covered by submonolayer alkali metals.,"We present a theoretical investigation of the structural and vibrational properties of ordered 2D phases formed by the Li, Na and K atoms on the Cu[Formula: see text] surface. The lattice relaxation, phonon dispersions and polarization of vibrational modes as well as the local density of states are calculated using the embedded-atom method. The obtained structural parameters and vibrational frequencies are in close agreement with available experimental results.",3
Electronic structure and magnetic behaviors of exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets.,"The correlation of electronic structure and magnetic behaviors of layered molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets, mechanically exfoliated from pristine hexagonal crystal (2H-MoS2) have been studied. Raman spectra show the energy difference (DeltaE) between two Raman peaks A 1g and [Formula: see text] was about 20.2 cm(-1), indicating the formation of mono-/bi-layered MoS 2 nanosheets as obtained after mechanical exfoliation from pristine 2H-MoS 2 . The absence of the reflection peak (0 0 2) in x-ray diffraction patterns confirms the formation of few-layered and mono-/bi-layered MoS 2 nanosheets with reduced thickness. Mo 3d and S 2p XPS core level peaks shifted to higher energy with the reduction of the number of layers in exfoliated MoS2. As the number of layers decreased, valence band maximum position increased from 1.11 eV (pristine MoS2) to 1.57 eV (mono-/bi-layered MoS 2 nanosheets), whereas the surface work function (capital EF, Cyrillic) reduced from 4.85 eV (pristine MoS2) to 4.47 eV (mono-/bi-layered MoS2 nanosheets), as observed from UPS (He-I) measurements. UPS (He-II) spectra, as well as VB-PES spectra of mono-/bi-layered MoS 2 nanosheets, exhibits an enhanced valence band density of states (DOS) of S 3p -derived states near Fermi level (E f). Mo L II-edge and S K-edge x-ray absorption near edge structure spectra of mono-/bi-layered MoS 2 nanosheets show the splitting of different peaks that cause a noticeable change in their band structure. Magnetic M-H hysteresis loops measurement clearly demonstrates the increase of room temperature ferromagnetism from pristine to mono-/bi-layer MoS2, due to the existence of defects ('S'-vacancies or defects at the grain boundaries region) and the increase of DOS.",3
Strain relaxation behaviour of vortices in a multiferroic superconductor.,"The elastic and anelastic properties of a single crystal of Co-doped pnictide Ba(Fe0.957Co0.043)2As2 have been determined by resonant ultrasound spectroscopy in the frequency range 10-500 kHz, both as a function of temperature through the normal-superconducting transition (T c approximately 12.5 K) and as a function of applied magnetic field up to 12.5 T. Correlation with thermal expansion, electrical resistivity, heat capacity, DC and AC magnetic data from crystals taken from the same synthetic batch has revealed the permeating influence of strain on coupling between order parameters for the ferroelastic (Q E) and superconducting (Q SC) transitions and on the freezing/relaxation behaviour of vortices. Elastic softening through T c in zero field can be understood in terms of classical coupling of the order parameter with the shear strain e 6, lambdae 6 [Formula: see text], which means that there must be a common strain mechanism for coupling of the form lambda [Formula: see text] Q E. At fields of ~5 T and above, this softening is masked by Debye-like stiffening and acoustic loss processes due to vortex freezing. The first loss peak may be associated with the establishment of superconductivity on ferroelastic twin walls ahead of the matrix and the second is due to the vortex liquid-vortex glass transition. Strain contrast between vortex cores and the superconducting matrix will contribute significantly to interactions of vortices both with each other and with the underlying crystal structure. These interactions imply that iron-pnictides represent a class of multiferroic superconductors in which strain-mediated coupling occurs between the multiferroic properties (ferroelasticity, antiferromagnetism) and superconductivity.",3
The half magnetization plateau in Ni3V2O8 studied by electron spin resonance.,"Ni3V2O8, regarded as an S = 1 kagome staircase lattice antiferromagnet, possesses a novel magnetic field-temperature phase diagram. Specifically, a half plateau region is observed in the high field magnetization curve for magnetic fields in the range of 11-19 T. This experimental observation is theoretically unexpected for a standard kagome lattice antiferromagnet, and consequently, the underlying magnetic structure is still unclear. Multi-frequency electron spin resonance results in this study strongly support a collinear magnetic arrangement at the half plateau region. The resonant modes can be well fit by only considering the antiferromagnetic interactions on a four-spin sublattice of the spine sites.",3
Magnetic excitations in frustrated fcc type-III antiferromagnet MnS2.,"Spin wave dispersion in the frustrated fcc type-III antiferromagnet MnS2 has been determined by inelastic neutron scattering using a triple-axis spectrometer. Existence of multiple spin wave branches, with significant separation between high-energy and low-energy modes highlighting the intrinsic magnetic frustration effect on the fcc lattice, is explained in terms of a spin wave analysis carried out for the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model for this S = 5/2 system with nearest and next-nearest-neighbor exchange interactions. Comparison of the calculated dispersion with spin wave measurement also reveals small suppression of magnetic frustration resulting from reduced exchange interaction between frustrated spins, possibly arising from anisotropic deformation of the cubic structure.",3
Interaction of surface plasmon-phonon polaritons with terahertz radiation in heavily doped GaAs epilayers.,"We report on experimental studies of the surface plasmon-phonon polariton excitations in heavily doped GaAs epitaxial layers. Reflection and emission of radiation in the frequency range of 2-19 THz were investigated for samples with surface-relief grating, as well as for samples with planar surface. The reflectivity spectrum for p-polarized radiation measured for the sample with the surface-relief grating demonstrates a set of resonances attributed to excitations of different surface plasmon-phonon polariton modes. The observed resonances lie beyond the limits of the Reststrahlen band. Terahertz radiation emission from the samples was studied in nonequilibrium conditions under the pulsed electric field excitation. Two contributions to the spectral density of the terahertz radiation have been revealed, the first being due to bulk plasmon-phonon polaritons (PPhPs), while the second originating from the surface PPhPs. A field dependence of the effective temperature of the bulk PPhPs has been established. Polarization dependence of the terahertz radiation related to surface PPhPs has been experimentally examined for the first time.",3
Pressure-induced structural and electronic transitions of thiospinel Fe3S4.,"We report the investigations on the structural and electronic properties of an inverse spinel Fe3S4 at high pressures using synchrotron x-ray diffraction (XRD) and electrical transport measurements. Our XRD measurements at high pressures reveal an irreversible structural phase transformation on compression above approximately 3 GPa from a cubic spinel (Fd-3m space group) into a monoclinic Cr3S4-type structure (I2/m space group). Electrical transport measurements suggest that the high pressure monoclinic phase has a semiconducting behavior. This semiconducting behavior is found to persist up to the highest pressure of measurement of approximately 23 GPa. These results show that while Fe3S4 possesses similar high pressure structural properties with other thiospinels, the electronic properties under pressure show a rather strong similarity to its oxide counterpart, Fe3O4, at high pressures.",3
Reactive metal-organic interfaces studied with hard x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy: controlled formation of metalloporphyrin interphase layers during metal vapor deposition onto porphyrin films.,"Interfaces between organic semiconductors and metallic layers are ubiquitous in organic (opto-) electronic devices and can significantly influence their functionality. Here, we studied in situ prepared metal-organic interfaces, which were obtained by vapor deposition of metals (Co, Fe) onto organic semiconductor films (2H-tetraphenylporphyrin), with hard x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. In these systems, the interphase zones, which are formed by diffusion and reaction of the metal in the organic material, can be clearly distinguished spectroscopically from the unreacted organic bulk, since they comprise the corresponding metalloporphyrins, CoTPP and FeTPP. In order to gain control over the thickness of the interphase layers, we varied process parameters such as sample temperature and metal-atom flux during interface preparation. We found that the temperature of the organic film during metal deposition was the only parameter that significantly influenced the formation of the interphase layers: their thicknesses were typically ~0.5 nm for deposition at 90 K, compared to ~1 nm at 300 K, irrespective of metal atom flux and chemical nature of the metal atom (Fe versus Co). Notably, these values are significantly smaller than the thicknesses of other metal/organics interphase regions reported in the literature.",3
Probing charge transfer states at organic and hybrid internal interfaces by photothermal deflection spectroscopy.,"In organic and hybrid photovoltaic devices, the asymmetry required for charge separation necessitates the use of a donor and an acceptor material, resulting in the formation of internal interfaces in the device active layer. While the core objective of these interfaces is to facilitate charge separation, bound states between electrons and holes may form across them, resulting in a loss mechanism that diminishes the performance of the solar cells. These interfacial transitions appear in organic systems as charge transfer (CT) states and as bound charge pairs (BCP) in hybrid systems. Despite being similar, the latter are far less investigated. Herein, we employ photothermal deflection spectroscopy and pump-push-probe experiments in order to determine the characteristics and dynamics of interfacial states in two model systems: an organic P3HT:PCBM and hybrid P3HT:ZnO photovoltaic layer. By controlling the area of the internal interface, we identify CT states between 1.4 eV and 1.8 eV in the organic bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) and BCP between 1.1 eV and 1.4 eV in the hybrid BHJ. The energetic distribution of these states suggests that they not only contribute to losses in photocurrent, but also significantly limit the possible maximum open circuit voltage obtainable from these devices.",3
Why it is so hard to detect Luttinger liquids in angle resolved photo-emission spectroscopy?,"The problem of photoemission from a quasi-1D material is studied. We identify two issues that play a key role in the detection of gapless Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) phase. Firstly, we show how a disorder-backward scattering as well as forward scattering component-is able to significantly obscure the TLL states, hence the initial state of angle resolved photo-emission spectroscopy (ARPES). Secondly, we investigate the photo-electron propagation towards a sample's surface. We focus on the scattering path operator contribution to the final state of ARPES. We show that, in the particular conditions set by the 1D states, one can derive an exact analytical solution for this intermediate stage of ARPES. The solution shows that for particular energies of incoming photons the intensity of photo-current may be substantially reduced. Finally, we put together the two aspects (the disorder and the scattering path operator) to show the full, disruptive force of any inhomogeneities on the ARPES amplitude.",3
Effects of scarring on quantum chaos in disordered quantum wells.,"The suppression of chaos in quantum reality is evident in quantum scars, i.e. in enhanced probability densities along classical periodic orbits. They provide opportunities in controlling quantum transport in nanoscale quantum systems. Here, we study energy level statistics of perturbed two-dimensional quantum systems exhibiting recently discovered, strong perturbation-induced quantum scarring. In particular, we focus on the effect of local perturbations and an external magnetic field on both the eigenvalue statistics and scarring. Energy spectra are analyzed to investigate the chaoticity of the quantum system in the context of the Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmidt conjecture. We find that in systems where strong perturbation-induced scars are present, the eigenvalue statistics are mostly mixed, i.e. between Wigner-Dyson and Poisson pictures in random matrix theory. However, we report interesting sensitivity of both the eigenvalue statistics to the perturbation strength, and analyze the physical mechanisms behind this effect.",3
Investigation of structural models for O-Y and O-Y-Ti clusters in bcc Fe: a density functional theory study.,"Six different structural models for atomic clusters in bcc Fe are investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Results for clusters with identical numbers of constituents (O, Y, Ti, and vacancies) are compared. It is found that the data on the stability or energetics of the relaxed clusters are comparable although their atomic configurations are often different. This contradicts the prevailing opinion in the related theoretical literature that favors the so-called structure matching model. In all studied cases, the absolute value of the total binding energy per cluster constituent becomes lower if Y is partially replaced by Ti. Therefore the driving force for the growth of O-Y clusters should be higher than that of O-Y-Ti clusters. This may be correlated with the experimental observation that the presence of Ti leads to a reduction of the size of the oxide clusters in nanostructured ferritic alloys and to a higher dispersion. Not only cage-like clusters but also clusters with oxygen in the center (cage) are investigated. In the absence of Ti, clusters with oxygen in the center attain more stability that cage-like clusters and the opposite holds for clusters with Ti. It is also shown that adding O atoms to cage-like clusters leads to structures with O in the center. In the present comprehensive DFT study only clusters with dimensions below 1 nm could be treated. This is still below or close to the limit of the experimental resolution of methods allowing for a simultaneous determination of atomic structure and composition of the clusters. These small clusters may be considered as nuclei for further structural evolution and growth during which a selection of the most favored cluster structures could occur.",3
Observation of the nesting and defect-driven 1D incommensurate charge density waves phase in the 2D system.,"We report on the low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) study of the (Bi, Na)/Si(1 1 1)[Formula: see text] reconstruction that is known to possess Fermi surface with apparently good nesting. We found that defects on this surface produce a one-dimensional-like pattern with the periodicity of 8.2 [Formula: see text] 0.4 [Formula: see text] that is incommensurate with the [Formula: see text] lattice period. The [Formula: see text] mapping analysis reveals an occurrence of the k-dependent branch associated with quasi-particle interference and the k-independent branch associated with the nesting vector connecting the parallel segments of the (Bi,Na)/Si(1 1 1)[Formula: see text] Fermi surface, the fingerprint of the charge-density-wave (CDW) phase. The STS data demonstrates that development of the CDW phase leads to reducing electron density of states at the Fermi level.",3
Pressure induced transformation and subsequent amorphization of monoclinic Nb2O5 and its effect on optical properties.,"Pressure-induced phase transitions of monoclinic H-Nb2O5 have been studied by in situ synchrotron x-ray diffraction, pair distribution function (PDF) analysis, and Raman and optical transmission spectroscopy. The initial monoclinic phase is found to transform into an orthorhombic phase at ~9 GPa and then change to an amorphous form above 21.4 GPa. The PDF data reveal that the amorphization is associated with disruptions of the long-range order of the NbO6 octahedra and the NbO7 pentagonal bipyramids, whereas the local edge-shares of octahedra and the local linkages of pentagonal bipyramids are largely preserved in their nearest neighbors. Upon compression, the transmittance of the sample in a region from visible to near infrared (450-1000 nm) starts to increase above 8.0 GPa and displays a dramatic enhancement above 22.2 GPa, indicating that the amorphous form has a high transmittance. The pressure-induced amorphous form is found to be recoverable under pressure release, and maintain high optical transmittance property at ambient conditions. The recoverable pressure induced amorphous material promises for applications in multifunctional materials.",3
"Quantum fluctuation in thermopower at the topological phase transition in CaSrX (X: Si, Ge, Sn, Pb) studied from first principles theory.","The present density functional calculations propose the compounds CaSrX (X: Si, Ge, Sn, Pb) as strong topological insulators, with appreciable thermoelectric properties. Emergence of Dirac semi-metallic states has been observed in CaSrX (X: Si, Ge, Sn, Pb), which is induced by uni-axial strain along 'b' axis. CaSrSi and CaSrGe evolved as normal semiconductors with uni-axial strain. The trivial and non-trivial topological phases are evaluated by band inversion and Z 2 topological invariants. A comprehensive analysis of thermopower, electrical conductivity scaled by relaxation time at these Dirac semi-metallic states exposes the highly oscillating behaviour, which gives insight to quantum oscillations driven by uni-axial strain. Further the thermoelectric properties at strong topological insulating states and normal insulating states have been summarized, which reveals the potential thermoelectric properties of these materials.",3
Mapping multi-valley Lifshitz transitions induced by field-effect doping in strained MoS2 nanolayers.,"Gate-induced superconductivity at the surface of nanolayers of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has attracted a lot of attention in recent years, thanks to the sizeable transition temperature, robustness against in-plane magnetic fields beyond the Pauli limit, and hints to a non-conventional nature of the pairing. A key information necessary to unveil its microscopic origin is the geometry of the Fermi surface hosting the Cooper pairs as a function of field-effect doping, which is dictated by the filling of the inequivalent valleys at the K/K[Formula: see text] and Q/Q[Formula: see text] points of the Brillouin zone. Here, we achieve this by combining density functional theory calculations of the bandstructure with transport measurements on ion-gated 2H-MoS2 nanolayers. We show that, when the number of layers and the amount of strain are set to their experimental values, the Fermi level crosses the bottom of the high-energy valleys at Q/Q[Formula: see text] at doping levels where characteristic kinks in the transconductance are experimentally detected. We also develop a simple 2D model which is able to quantitatively describe the broadening of the kinks observed upon increasing temperature. We demonstrate that this combined approach can be employed to map the dependence of the Fermi surface of TMD nanolayers on field-effect doping, detect Lifshitz transitions, and provide a method to determine the amount of strain and spin-orbit splitting between sub-bands from electric transport measurements in real devices.",3
Uncovering the (un-)occupied electronic structure of a buried hybrid interface.,"The energy level alignment at organic/inorganic (o/i) semiconductor interfaces is crucial for any light-emitting or -harvesting functionality. Essential is the access to both occupied and unoccupied electronic states directly at the interface, which is often deeply buried underneath thick organic films and challenging to characterize. We use several complementary experimental techniques to determine the electronic structure of p -quinquephenyl pyridine (5P-Py) adsorbed on ZnO(1 0 -1 0). The parent anchoring group, pyridine, significantly lowers the work function by up to 2.9 eV and causes an occupied in-gap state (IGS) directly below the Fermi level E F. Adsorption of upright-standing 5P-Py also leads to a strong work function reduction of up to 2.1 eV and to a similar IGS. The latter is then used as an initial state for the transient population of three normally unoccupied molecular levels through optical excitation and, due to its localization right at the o/i interface, provides interfacial sensitivity, even for thick 5P-Py films. We observe two final states above the vacuum level and one bound state at around 2 eV above E F, which we attribute to the 5P-Py LUMO. By the separate study of anchoring group and organic dye combined with the exploitation of the occupied IGS for selective interfacial photoexcitation, this work provides a new pathway for characterizing the electronic structure at buried o/i interfaces.",3
Structural properties of sub-nanometer metallic clusters.,"At the nanoscale, the investigation of structural features becomes fundamental as we can establish relationships between cluster geometries and their physicochemical properties. The peculiarity lies in the variety of shapes often unusual and far from any geometrical and crystallographic intuition clusters can assume. In this respect, we should treat and consider nanoparticles as a new form of matter. Nanoparticle structures depend on their size, chemical composition, ordering, as well as external conditions e.g. synthesis method, pressure, temperature, support. On top of that, at finite temperatures nanoparticles can fluctuate among different structures, opening new and exciting horizons for the design of optimal nanoparticles for advanced applications. This article aims to overview geometrical features of transition metal clusters and of their various rearrangements.",3
"Influence of edge magnetization and electric fields on zigzag silicene, germanene and stanene nanoribbons.","Using a multi-orbital tight-binding model, we have studied the edge states of zigzag silicene, germanene, and stanene nanoribbons (ZSiNRs, ZGeNRs and ZSnNRs, respectively) in the presence of the Coulomb interaction and a vertical electric field. The resulting edge states have non-linear energy dispersions due to multi-orbital effects, and the nanoribbons show induced magnetization at the edges. Owing to this non-linear dispersion, ZSiNRs, ZGeNRs and ZSnNRs may not provide superior performance in field effect transistors, as has been proposed from single-orbital tight-binding model calculations. We propose an effective low-energy model that describes the edge states of ZSiNRs, ZGeNRs, and ZSnNRs. We demonstrate that the edge states of ZGeNR and ZSnNR show anti-crossing of bands with opposite spins, even if only out-of-plane edge magnetization is present. The ability to tune the spin polarizations of the edge states by applying an electric field points to future opportunities to fabricate silicene, germanene and stanene nanoribbons as spintronics devices.",3
Absence of strong skew scattering in crystals with multi-sheeted Fermi surfaces.,"We consider an extrinsic contribution to the anomalous and spin Hall effect in dilute alloys based on Fe, Co, Ni, and Pt hosts with different substitutional impurities. It is shown that a strong skew-scattering mechanism is absent in such crystals with multi-sheeted Fermi surfaces. Based on this finding, we conclude on the mutual exclusion of strong intrinsic and skew-scattering contributions to the considered transport phenomena. It also allows us to draw general conclusions in which materials with a giant anomalous Hall effect caused by the skew scattering can be achieved.",3
Topological description of the solidification of undercooled fluids and the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity of crystalline and glassy solids above approximately 50 K.,"Topological origins of the thermal transport properties of crystalline and non-crystalline solid states are considered herein, by the adoption of a quaternion orientational order parameter to describe solidification. Global orientational order, achieved by spontaneous symmetry breaking, is prevented at finite temperatures for systems that exist in restricted dimensions (Mermin-Wagner theorem). Just as complex ordered systems exist in restricted dimensions in 2D and 1D, owing to the dimensionality of the order parameter, quaternion ordered systems in 4D and 3D exist in restricted dimensions. Just below the melting temperature, misorientational fluctuations in the form of spontaneously generated topological defects prevent the development of the solid state. Such solidifying systems are well-described using O(4) quantum rotor models, and a defect-driven Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition is anticipated to separate an undercooled fluid from a crystalline solid state. In restricted dimensions, in addition to orientationally-ordered ground states, orientationally-disordered ground states may be realized by tuning a non-thermal parameter in the relevant O(n) quantum rotor model Hamiltonian. Thus, glassy solid states are anticipated to exist as distinct ground states of O(4) quantum rotor models. Within this topological framework for solidification, the finite Kauzmann temperature marks a first-order transition between crystalline and glassy solid states at a 'self-dual' critical point that belongs to O(4) quantum rotor models. This transition is a higher-dimensional analogue to the quantum phase transition that belongs to O(2) Josephson junction arrays (JJAs). The thermal transport properties of crystalline and glassy solid states, above approximately 50 K, are considered alongside the electrical transport properties of JJAs across the superconductor-to-superinsulator transition.",3
Angular dependent strong coupling between localized waveguide resonance and surface plasmon resonance in complementary metamaterials.,"We give direct evidence of both surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and localized waveguide resonance (LWR) contribution to the extraordinary optical transmission in complementary metamaterials. Strong coupling between SPR and LWR are also observed with clear evidence of Rabi splitting and anti-crossing phenomena. The splitting introduces sharp phase shift, which in turn enhances group velocity delay by the incident angle without geometric parameter change. The results not only clarify SPR and LWR effects in the extraordinary optical transmission, but also provide a novel route to control light-metamaterial interaction by angular modulation for on-chip slow light devices.",3
Control of electromagnetically induced grating by surface plasmon and tunneling in a hybrid quantum dot-metal nanoparticle system.,"We investigate the electromagnetically induced grating (EIG) in a quantum dot-metal nanoparticle (QD-MNP) hybrid system. The EIG can be controlled and improved by the surface plasmon effect and the interdot tunneling effect between quantum dots. By manipulating the tunneling effect and the QD-MNP distance, not only the first-order diffraction intensity of the grating can be efficiently enhanced, but also the EIG can be switched from the absorption grating to the gain grating. Almost two times the first-order diffraction efficiencies can be achieved in the gain gratings compared with the absorption gratings.",3
In situ soft x-ray absorption spectroscopic study of polycrystalline Fe/MgO interfaces.,"Interfacial interactions between a layer of iron and MgO hold the key to various phenomena like tunnel magnetoresistance, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, interlayer exchange coupling, observed in the system. Interface structure has been studied in situ during deposition of iron on MgO surface, using soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy (SXAS). Sub-monolayer sensitivity of SXAS, combined with in situ measurements as a function of iron layer thickness, allowed one to study the evolution of interface with film thickness. Two different substrates namely MgO (0 0 1) single crystal, and a polycrystalline MgO film on Si substrate have been used in order to elucidate the role of the state of MgO surface in controlling the interface structure. It is found that at the interface of iron and MgO film, about two monolayers of Fe3O4 are formed. Fe3O4 being the oxide of iron with the highest heat of formation, the reaction appears to be controlled thermodynamically. On the other hand, on the interface with MgO (0 0 1) surface, FeO is formed, suggesting that the reaction is limited by the availability of oxygen atoms. Magnetic behavior of the FeO layer gets modified significantly due to proximity effect of the bulk ferromagnetic iron layer.",3
Exploration of high-pressure structural transition and electronic properties of BaFe2S3.,"The iron-based compound BaFe2S3 has received considerable attention in recent years due to its unique electronic properties with important applications. But, there has been relatively little attention devoted to the structure evolution of BaFe2S3 under high pressure. Here, we report a detailed theoretical study of the structural, electronic and sound velocity properties of BaFe2S3 under high pressure by CALYPSO structure search method in combination with the first-principles calculations. We have uncovered three novel structures of BaFe2S3 under high pressure with space group P2221, Imm2, and C2/m symmetries. Theoretical calculations reveal that the structures of BaFe2S3 under high pressure satisfy the phase transition sequence of Cmcm --> P2221 --> Imm2 --> C2/m, and the corresponding transition pressures are 31.6, 47.4 and 57.0 GPa, respectively. Our results enrich the high pressure phases of BaFe2S3 and will stimulate future experiments to synthesize these new phases.",3
Imaging quantum fluctuations near criticality.,"A quantum phase transition (QPT) occurs between two competing phases of matter at zero temperature, driven by quantum fluctuations. Though the presence of these fluctuations is well established, they have not been locally imaged in space and their local dynamics has not been studied so far. We use a scanning superconducting quantum interference device to image quantum fluctuations in the vicinity of the QPT from a superconductor to an insulator. We find fluctuations of the diamagnetic response in both space and time that survive well below the transition temperature, demonstrating their quantum nature. The fluctuations appear as telegraph-like noise with a range of characteristic times and a non-monotonic temperature dependence, revealing unexpected quantum granularity. The lateral dimension of these fluctuations grows towards criticality, offering a new measurable length scale. Our results provide physical insight about the reorganization of phases across a QPT, with implications for any theoretical description. This paves a new route for future quantum information applications.",3
Effect of impurities on the long-distance and Zhang-Rice dimers in the quantum magnet Sr14Cu24O41.,"We study the effect of impurities on the two types of spin-dimers in the hybrid chain-ladder spin 1/2 quantum magnet Sr[Formula: see text]Cu[Formula: see text]O[Formula: see text]. Four different impurities were used, namely, the non-magnetic Zn (0.0025 and 0.01 per Cu) and Al (0.0025 and 0.01 per Cu), and magnetic Ni (0.0025 and 0.01 per Cu) and Co (0.01, 0.03, 0.05 and 0.1 per Cu). These impurities were doped in high-quality single-crystals synthesized by the floating-zone method. The magnetic susceptibility of pristine Sr[Formula: see text]Cu[Formula: see text]O[Formula: see text] is analyzed rigorously to confirm that at low temperatures ([Formula: see text] K), the 'free' spins in the chains undergo a long-distance dimerization as proposed in a recent study (Sahling et al 2015 Nat. Phys. 11 255). The effect of impurity on these dimers is analyzed by measuring the specific heat down to [Formula: see text] K. We found that even at the lower impurity concentration, the long-distance dimers are significantly severed but the quantum entangled spin dimerized state of the chains persists. On the other hand, the other type of spin dimers that form at relatively higher temperatures via an intervening Zhang-Rice singlet are found to be practically unaffected at the lower impurity concentration; but at 1% doping these dimers are considerably severed. The effect of Co impurity turned out to be most unusual displaying a strongly anisotropic response, and with a dimerization gap that suppresses faster along the chain/ladder direction than perpendicular to it as a function of increasing Co concentration.",3
Unraveling the physical properties and superparamagnetism in anti-site disorder controlled Fe2TiSn.,"With an aim to control the anti-site disorder between Fe and Ti atoms in the full Heusler alloy, Fe[Formula: see text]TiSn, we substitute a small percentage of Ti at Fe site to form the Fe[Formula: see text]Ti[Formula: see text]Sn ([Formula: see text]) series. Using the incident x-rays tuned to the Fe K-edge absorption energy, we record the high resolution synchrotron x-ray diffraction profiles and unambiguously show the reduction in anti-site disorder. In particular, the Fe-Ti anti-site disorder decreases up to an excess Ti content of 0.07; further increase of Ti content leads to disorder between Ti-Sn sites. Detailed characterization vis-a-vis the excess Ti content has been carried out in terms of its thermal and electrical transport, and magnetic properties. Signatures of strong spin fluctuation are seen in all the physical properties reported here. The much disputed high value of the Sommerfeld constant has been shown to be a resultant of such strong spin fluctuations, thus ruling out the long standing controversy of heavy fermionic nature of Fe[Formula: see text]TiSn. Magnetization and the Seebeck coefficient show clear dependence on the disorder. Both dc and ac magnetic measurements reveal the low temperature superparamagnetic nature of this system, comprising of large magnetic clusters [Formula: see text]3 nm in size.",3
Topological boundaries and bulk wavefunctions in the Su-Schreiffer-Heeger model.,"Working in the context of the Su-Schreiffer-Heeger model, the effect of topological boundaries on the structure and properties of bulk position-space wavefunctions is studied for a particle undergoing a quantum walk in a one-dimensional lattice. In particular, we consider what happens when the wavefunction reaches a boundary at which the Hamiltonian changes suddenly from one topological phase to another and construct an exact solution for the wavefunction on both sides of the boundary. The reflection and transmission coefficients at the boundary are calculated as a function of the system's hopping parameters, and it is shown that for some parameter ranges the transmission coefficient can be made very small. Therefore, it is possible to arrange a high degree of bulk wavefunction localization within each topological region, a fact that has information processing applications. This 'topologically-assisted' suppression of transitions, although not of direct topological origin itself, exists because of the presence of an abrupt change in the properties of the Hamiltonian at the topological boundary. We give a quantitative examination of the reflection and transmission coefficients of incident waves at the boundary between regions of different winding number.",3
Effect of pressure on the self-hole-doped superconductor RbGd2Fe4As4O2.,"RbGd2Fe4As4O2 is a newly discovered self-hole-doped stoichiometric superconductor, which has a hybrid structure with separated double FeAs layers and exhibits a high superconducting transition temperature T c = 35 K. Here, we report the effect of pressure (P) on its T c and normal-state transport properties by measuring the temperature dependence of resistivity rho(T) under various pressures up to 14 GPa with a cubic anvil cell apparatus. We found that the T c is suppressed monotonically to ca. 12.5 K upon increasing pressure to 14 GPa with a slope change of T c(P) at around 4 GPa. In addition, the low-temperature normal-state rho(T), which is proportional to T (n) , also evolves gradually from a non-Fermi-liquid with n = 1 at ambient pressure to a Fermi liquid with n = 2 at P 4 GPa. Accompanying with the non-Fermi-liquid to Fermi-liquid crossover, the quadratic temperature coefficient of resistivity, which reflects the effective mass of charge carriers, also experiences a significant reduction as commonly observed in the vicinity of a magnetic quantum critical point (QCP). Our results indicate that the stoichiometric RbGd2Fe4As4O2 at ambient pressure might be located near a QCP such that the enhanced critical spin fluctuations lead to high-T c superconductivity. The application of pressure should broaden the electronic bandwidth and weaken the spin fluctuations, and then restore a Fermi-liquid ground state with lower T c.",3
Theory of thermoelectricity in Mg3Sb2 with an energy- and temperature-dependent relaxation time.,"We study the electronic transport coefficients and the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT in [Formula: see text]-doped Mg3Sb2 based on density-functional electronic structure and Bloch-Boltzmann transport theory with an energy- and temperature-dependent relaxation time. Both the lattice and electronic thermal conductivities affect the final ZT significantly, hence we include the lattice thermal conductivity calculated ab initio. Where applicable, our results are in good agreement with existing experiments, thanks to the treatment of lattice thermal conductivity and the improved description of electronic scattering. ZT increases monotonically in our [Formula: see text] range (300-700 K), reaching a value of 1.6 at 700 K; it peaks as a function of doping at about [Formula: see text] cm(-3). At this doping, ZT [Formula: see text] 1 for [Formula: see text] K.",3
Charge transport in GaAs nanowires: interplay between conductivity through the interior and surface conductivity.,"The charge transport through GaAs nanowires, partially p-doped and partially intrinsic, is analyzed by four-point resistance profiling along freestanding nanowires using a multip-STM. The charge transport channel in the undoped segment is assigned to the surface conductivity, while the interior of the nanowire is the conductance channel in the p-doped segment. The convoluted interplay between conduction through the interior of the nanowire and surface state conduction is studied in detail. Measurements of the I-V curves along the nanowires provide the experimental basis for the proposed charge transport model for the transition of the conduction from the interior to the surface of the nanowire. A voltage drop along the surface state conduction channel leads to an upward shift of the band edges at the surface. This results, for higher applied voltages, in the removal of the depletion layer and an opening of a conductance channel between the interior of the nanowire and the surface states.",3
"Atomic ordering, magnetic properties, and electronic structure of Mn2CoGa Heusler alloy.","The magnetic properties and atomic arrangement of Mn2CoGa Heusler alloy were investigated experimentally and by theoretical calculations. The magnetic moment derived from spontaneous magnetization at 5 K was 2.06 mu B/f.u. and was close to the integer number of the expected value from theoretical calculation and the Slater-Pauling rule predicted by Galanakis et al. The Curie temperature and L21-B2 order-disorder phase transition temperature were 741 and 1047 K, respectively. Powder neutron diffraction experiment results suggested that the atomic arrangement prefers an L21b-type structure rather than that of Hg2CuTi, being consistent with our previous results of high-angle annular dark-field-scanning transmission electron microscopic observations. The magnetic moments obtained were in good agreement with the theoretical values in the model of the L21b-type structure. The density of states obtained by the first-principles calculation combined with the coherent potential approximation in Mn2CoGa with the L21b-type crystal structure maintained the half-metallic character, even though disordering by Mn and Co atoms was introduced.",3
Observation of dynamic charge stripes in Tm0.19Yb0.81B12 at the metal-insulator transition.,Accurate low temperature charge transport measurements in combination with high-precision x-ray diffraction experiments have allowed detection of the symmetry lowering in the single domain Tm0.19Yb0.81B12 crystals that belong to the family of dodecaborides with metal-insulator transition. Based on the fine structure analysis we discover the formation of dynamic charge stripes within the semiconducting matrix of Tm0.19Yb0.81B12. The charge dynamics in these conducting nano-size channels is characterized by broad-band optical spectroscopy that allowed estimating the frequency (~2.4 x 10(11) Hz) of quantum motion of the charge carriers. It is suggested that cooperative Jahn-Teller effect in the boron sublattice is a cause of the large-amplitude rattling modes of the Tm and Yb ions responsible for the 'modulation' of the conduction band along one of the [Formula: see text] directions through the variation of 5d-2p hybridization of electron states.,3
"Optical properties of helical edge channels in zinc-blende-type topological insulators: selection rules, circular and linear dichroism, circular and linear photocurrents.","We develop a theory of electron-photon interaction for helical edge channels in two-dimensional topological insulators based on zinc-blende-type quantum wells. It is shown that the lack of space inversion symmetry in such structures enables the electro-dipole optical transitions between the spin branches of the topological edge states. Further, we demonstrate the linear and circular dichroism associated with the edge states and the generation of edge photocurrents controlled by radiation polarization.",3
Probing hole-doping of the weak antiferromagnet TiAu with first principles methods.,"We investigate hole-doping by Sc substitution for Ti in the weak antiferromagnet (wAFM) system Ti[Formula: see text]Sc[Formula: see text]Au. Behavior reported so far fits a weak itinerant AFM picture, and experimentally leads to a quantum critical point at [Formula: see text]. Here we study supercells with several rational fractions [Formula: see text] of Ti replaced by Sc. We find, unexpectedly, definite local moment-like behavior, e.g. magnetic moments of the Ti atom comparable to or even larger than in the bulk persist even into the Ti-poor regime of this alloy system. Itinerant signatures persist, however, as the Ti [Formula: see text] projected density of states displays van Hove singularity peaks near the Fermi level in most cases, revealing a striking similarity to nonmagnetic bulk TiAu. The current picture of this system, midway between itinerant and local moment, will be provided and discussed in light of experimental observations.",3
Measuring the nonlocality of different types of Majorana bound states in a topological superconducting wire.,"According to the degree of topological protection, Majorana bound states (MBSs) can be divided into three types: ideal zero-energy MBSs (IZMs), finite-energy MBSs (FEMs) and zero-energy MBSs at parity crossing points (PZMs). Herein, we investigate the nonlocality of these three types of MBSs by comparing the conductance spectra of a normal lead-topological superconducting wire-normal lead (NSN) junction and an NS junction. We find that for the FEM-related tunnelling process, the decrease in the nonlocal processes is trivially accompanied by an increase in the local processes, whereas for the IZM-related tunnelling process, the left and right tunnelling processes are completely independent. Remarkably, PZMs induce a nonlocal electron-blocking effect in which incoming electrons from the left lead cannot participate in local Andreev reflection unless the right lead is present, even though no nonlocal tunnelling processes occur in the right lead of an NSN junction. We show that this PZM-mediated nonlocal electron-blocking effect is due to the nonlocal coupling of the left lead to the more distant PZM and that the phase difference between the two end PZMs is [Formula: see text]. Our findings provide an experimentally accessible method for characterizing MBSs by probing their different nonlocal signatures.",3
Universal understanding of nematicity and magnetism in Fe-pnictides and FeSe.,"By employing the mean field and variational Monte Carlo methods, we investigate the iron-based superconductors (FeSCs) based on a realistic five-orbital Hubbard model in which an off-site Coulomb interaction [Formula: see text] is explicitly included. Our results demonstrate that [Formula: see text] plays an important role in stabilizing the nematic state in both Fe-pnictides and FeSe. Below a critical [Formula: see text], the model is shown to lie in the striped antiferromagnetic ground state, and an increasing of [Formula: see text] leads to an energy degeneracy between different magnetic configurations. This finding provides a natural explanation for the magnetism in Fe-pnictides with relatively small [Formula: see text], and more importantly, unveils the microscopic mechanism behind the absence of magnetic order in FeSe with larger [Formula: see text]. Simultaneously, the common anisotropy of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] orbital occupations in different magnetic configurations accounts for the similar orbital ordering observed in Fe-pnictides and FeSe. In addition, the unusual smallness of the Fermi surfaces in FeSe can be obtained when the renormalization effect of [Formula: see text] on the band structure is taken into account.",3
Negative differential conductance effect and electrical anisotropy of 2D ZrB2 monolayers.,"Two-dimensional (2D) metal-diboride ZrB2 monolayers was predicted theoretically as a stable new electronic material (Lopez-Bezanilla 2018 Phys. Rev. Mater. 2 011002). Here, we investigate its electronic transport properties along the zigzag (z-ZrB2) and armchair (a-ZrB2) directions, using the density functional theory and non-equilibrium Green's function methods. Under low biases, the 2D ZrB2 shows a similar electrical transport along zigzag and armchair directions as electric current propagates mostly via the metallic Zr-Zr bonds. However, it shows an electrical anistropy under high biases, and its I-V curves along zigzag and armchair directions diverge as the bias voltage is higher than 1.4 V, as more directional B-B transmission channels are opened. Importantly, both z-ZrB2 and a-ZrB2 show a pronounced negative differential conductance (NDC) effect and hence they can be promising for the use in NDC-based nanodevices.",3
Thermal creep and the skyrmion Hall angle in driven skyrmion crystals.,"We numerically examine thermal effects on the skyrmion Hall angle for driven skyrmions interacting with quenched disorder. We identify a creep regime in which motion occurs via intermittent jumps between pinned and flowing states. Here the skyrmion Hall angle is zero since the skyrmions have time to relax into equilibrium positions in the pinning sites, eliminating the side-jump motion induced by the Magnus force. At higher drives we find a crossover to a viscous flow regime where the skyrmion Hall angle is finite and increases with increasing drive or temperature. Our results are in agreement with recent experiments which also show a regime of finite skyrmion velocity with zero skyrmion Hall angle crossing over to a viscous flow regime with a skyrmion Hall angle that increases with drive.",3
Imaging of soft materials using in situ liquid-cell transmission electron microscopy.,"This review summarizes the breakthroughs in the field of soft material characterization by in situ liquid-cell transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The focus of this review is mostly on soft biological species such as cells, bacteria, viruses, proteins and polymers. The comparison between the two main liquid-cell systems (silicon nitride membranes liquid cell and graphene liquid cell) is also discussed in terms of their spatial resolution and imaging/analytical capabilities. We have showcased how liquid-cell TEM can reveal the structural details of whole cells, enable the chemical probing of proteins, detect the structural conformation of viruses, and monitor the dynamics of polymerization. In addition, the challenges faced by decoupling electron beam effect on beam-sensitive soft materials are discussed. At the end, future perspectives of in situ liquid-cell TEM studies of soft materials are outlined.",3
Raman scattering studies on very thin layers of gallium sulfide (GaS) as a function of sample thickness and temperature.,"Gallium sulfide is a semiconducting material with a layered structure and a characteristic low interlayer interaction. Because of weak van der Waals forces, GaS crystals are relatively easy to exfoliate to very thin layers. In this work nanometric-GaS layers were obtained by a micro-mechanical exfoliation process and were transferred to Si/SiO2 substrate. The thickness of these layers was estimated from AFM measurements. Raman spectra were collected for different layer thicknesses ranging from one layer to bulk crystal. An analytical function fitted to experimental data is proposed to determine layer thickness from Raman measurements. For the first time, the Raman position and the FWHM of the main Raman peaks were measured on very thin GaS layers as a function of temperature in the range from 80 to 470 K. The first order temperature coefficients of the A 1g Raman peaks were determined. Phonon decay due to anharmonic processes at temperatures above 300 K in layers of thickness below 4 nm was observed. Contribution of optical phonon scattering processes to thermal properties of very thin GaS layers is discussed.",3
Critical behavior of the order parameter at the nonequilibrium phase transition of the Ising model.,"After a quench of transverse field, the asymptotic long-time state of the Ising model displays a transition from a ferromagnetic phase to a paramagnetic phase as the post-quench field strength increases, which is revealed by the vanishing of the order parameter defined as the averaged magnetization over time. We estimate the critical behavior of the magnetization at this nonequilibrium phase transition by using the mean-field approximation. In the vicinity of the critical field, the magnetization vanishes as the inverse of a logarithmic function, which is significantly distinguished from the critical behavior of order parameter at the corresponding equilibrium phase transition, i.e. a power-law function.",3
Mixed type I and type II superconductivity due to intrinsic electronic inhomogeneities in the type II Dirac semimetal PdTe2.,"The type II Dirac semimetal PdTe[Formula: see text] is unique in the family of topological parent materials because it displays a superconducting ground state below 1.7 K. Despite wide speculation on the possibility of an unconventional topological superconducting phase, tunneling and heat capacity measurements revealed that the superconducting phase of PdTe[Formula: see text] follows predictions of the microscopic theory of Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer for conventional superconductors. The superconducting phase in PdTe[Formula: see text] is further interesting because it also displays properties that are characteristic of type-I superconductors and are generally unexpected for binary compounds. Here, from scanning tunneling spectroscopic measurements we show that the surface of PdTe[Formula: see text] displays intrinsic electronic inhomogeneities in the normal state which leads to a mixed type I and type II superconducting behaviour along with a spatial distribution of critical fields in the superconducting state. Understanding of the origin of such inhomogeneities may be important for understanding the topological properties of PdTe[Formula: see text] in the normal state.",3
Beyond Koopmans' theorem: electron binding energies in disordered materials.,"The topical review focuses on calculating ionization energies (IE), or electronic polarons in quasi-particle terminology, in large disordered systems, e.g. for a solute dissolved in a molecular solvent. The simplest estimate of the ionization energy is provided by one-electron energies in the Hartree-Fock theory, but the calculated quantities are not accurate. Density functional theory as many-body theory provides a principal opportunity for calculating one-electron energies including correlation and relaxation effects, i.e. the true energies of electronic polarons. We argue that such a principal possibility materializes within the concept of optimally tuned range-separated hybrid functionals (OT-RSH). We describe various schemes for optimal tuning. Importantly, the OT-RSH scheme is investigated for systems capped with dielectric continuum, providing a consistent picture on the QM/dielectric boundary. Finally, some limitations and open issues of the OT-RSH approach are addressed.",3
Measurement of entropic force from polymers attached to a pyramidal tip.,"The measurement of the boundary shape dependence of the entropic force from long polymers was attempted. The pyramidal cone-plate geometry was chosen. The polymer molecules were covalently bound to a well-defined Au patch at the apex of a pyramidal cantilever tip of the atomic force microscope (AFM). A smooth hydrophobic plate was used as the second boundary to confine the polymer molecules. The use of the hydrophobic plate allows neglect of polymer adhesion forces. The measurements were made in salt water solution to decrease the effect of electrostatic forces from any uncompensated charges on the boundary. As the functionalized AFM tip approaches the flat hydrophobic surface, the induced entropic forces were measured as a function of the separation distance. The measured force-distance curves are compared with a model of polymer-mediated entropic force between scale-free objects and the Alexander-de Gennes (AdG) theory for a polymer brush.",3
Localized magnetic moments in metallic SrB6 single crystals.,"The specific heat [Formula: see text] of metallic SrB6 single crystals shows an anomalous behavior for [Formula: see text] K which varies strongly with an applied magnetic field. This is consistent with a two-level Schottky system. We ascribe the excess of [Formula: see text] in this temperature range to localized magnetic moments. In addition, features that are attributable to a partial ferromagnetic polarization of a conduction electron gas are observed. These results are supported by magnetization measurements and are compatible with the transport properties reported previously (Stankiewicz 2016 Phys. Rev. B 94 125141).",3
Energy conversion from environmental fluctuations to coherent fields by Cooper-pair box quantum meta-materials.,"Electromagnetic waves propagating in open Cooper-pair boxes (CPBs) system is studied by using Maxwell-Bloch equations and Lindblad master equation. The results demonstrate an ensemble of CPBs as highly non-linear meta-material for electromagnetic waves. Incorporating the CPBs in a ring resonator or a Fabry-Perot cavity, one finds that: (1) With weak environmental couplings and CPBs in superconducting phase dominant regime, the non-linearity is enhanced and the system exhibits regular optical hysteresis. (2) With finite environmental couplings and CPBs in charge dominant regime, the Josephson effect and environmental effect can constructively interplay to produce a gain. In the later case, the electromagnetic field would be amplified by the CPB medium, indicating energy conversion from the environment to coherent fields mediated by CPBs.",3
Effect of impurities on the long-distance & Zhang-Rice dimers in quantum magnet Sr<sub>14</sub>Cu<sub>24</sub>O<sub>41</sub>.,"We study the effect of impurities on the two types of spin-dimers in the hybrid chain/ladder spin 1/2 quantum magnet Sr$_{14}$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$. Four different impurities were used, namely, the non-magnetic Zn (0.0025 and 0.01 per Cu) and Al (0.0025 and 0.01 per Cu), and magnetic Ni (0.0025 and 0.01 per Cu) and Co (0.01, 0.03, 0.05 and 0.1 per Cu). These impurities were doped in high-quality single-crystals synthesized by the floating zone method. The magnetic susceptibility of pristine Sr$_{14}$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$ is analyzed rigorously to confirm that at low temperatures (T $&lt;$ 5 K), the ""free"" spins in the chains undergo a long-distance dimerization as proposed in a recent study [Sahling et al. Nature Phys., \textbf{11}, 255 (2015)]. The effect of impurity on these dimers is analyzed by measuring the specific heat down to T = 0.06 K. We found that even at the lower impurity concentration, the long-distance dimers are significantly severed, but the quantum entangled spin dimerized state of the chains persists. On the other hand, the other type of spin dimers that forms at relatively higher temperatures via an intervening Zhang-Rice singlet are found to be practically unaffected at the lower impurity concentration; but at 1\% doping, even these are found to be considerably severed. The effect of Co impurity turned out to be most unusual displaying a strongly anisotropic response, and with a dimerization gap that suppresses faster along the chain/ladder direction than perpendicular to it as a function of increasing Co concentration.",3
Diels-Alder adduct formation at solid interfaces between fullerenes and acenes.,"Understanding organic-organic interfaces is rather challenging due to their large complexity regarding morphology, molecular orientation at the interface, interdiffusion, and energetics. One additional important but often neglected aspect are chemical reactions occuring at such interfaces. For solid interfaces between pentacene and Buckminster-Fullerene (C60) recently very efficient Diels-Alder (D-A) adduct formation has been reported. Considering the importance of pentacene/C60 as prototypical donor-acceptor combination to study fundamental processes in organic photovoltaics, understanding this effect is essential. In this work, we provide detailed NEXAFS-based investigations with respect to the temperature-dependence and reaction zone depth of this effect. Moreover, we widely vary the interface morphology and observe that the D-A adduct formation is most efficient for bulk heterojunctions of pentacene and C60. By also investigating further material combinations such as PEN/C60-PCBM and interfaces between C60 and functionalized acenes, we observe trends for the occurrence of the D-A adduct formation correlated with the different chemical properties of the involved compounds.",3
Improved Hubbard-I approximation impurity solver for quantum impurity models.,"We develop a fast impurity solver which is based on the combination of Hubbard-I approximation and hybridization expansion continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. This solver inherits the advantages of both algorithms. In order to demonstrate the power and usefulness of this solver, we use it to study the magnetic phase transitions of single-band and two-band Hubbard models in the framework of single-site dynamical mean-field theory. The calculated results agree well with those obtained by hybridization expansion quantum impurity solver. It is suggested that this solver is very suitable to solve the multi-orbital quantum impurity models efficiently and can be used to study more realistic systems with magnetic long-range order in the future.",3
Generalized stacking fault energy of carbon-alloyed paramagnetic [Formula: see text]-Fe.,"Generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE) is an important parameter for understanding the underlying physics governing the deformation mechanisms in face-centred cubic (fcc) materials. In the present work, we study the long-standing question regarding the influence of C on the GSFE in austenitic steels at paramagnetic state. We calculate the GSFE in both [Formula: see text]-Fe and Fe-C alloys using the exact muffin-tin orbitals method and the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package. Our results show that the GSFE is increased by the presence of interstitial C, and the universal scaling law is used to verify the accuracy of the obtained stacking fault energies. The C-driven change of the GSFE is discussed considering the magnetic contributions. The effective energy barriers for stacking fault, twinning and slip formation are employed to disclose the C effect on the deformation modes, and we also demonstrate that the magnetic structures as a function of volume explain the effect of paramagnetism on the C-driven changes of the stacking fault energies as compared to the hypothetical non-magnetic case.",3
"Stability, spontaneous and induced polarization in monolayer MoC, WC, WS, and WSe.","Ferroelectricity in the ultra-low thin films of the ferroelectric materials is a rare phenomenon due to the depolarization electric field established by the uncompensated surface charge. Using density functional theory based calculations, we design buckled honeycomb binary monolayer MoC, WC, WS, and WSe. The feasibility of their experimental synthesis is evident from their low formation energies, stable lattice vibrations, and high elastic stiffnesses. The difference in electronegativity of the building atoms and lack of inversion symmetry results in high spontaneous out-of-plane polarization whereas all the in-plane components cancel out. The existence of the mirror plane along the armchair direction vanishes the in-plane piezoelectric stress effects for a strain applied along the zigzag direction. However, a strain along the armchair direction on MoC and WC results in a high piezoelectric coefficient up to 10 [Formula: see text] 10[Formula: see text] C m[Formula: see text], about three times larger than that reported for monolayer MoS[Formula: see text]. The polarization switching barriers for the out-of-plane components range from 0.55 to 2.70 eV per formula unit.",3
Half-metallic surfaces in thin-film Ti2MnAl0.5Sn0.5.,"Materials exhibiting a high degree of spin polarization in electron transport are in demand for applications in spintronics-an emerging technology utilizing a spin degree of freedom in electronic devices. Room-temperature half-metals are considered ideal candidates, as they behave as an insulator for one spin channel and as a conductor for the other spin channel. In addition, for nano-size devices, one has to take into account possible modification of electronic structure in thin-film geometry, due to the potential presence of surface/interface states. It has been shown that typically these states have a detrimental impact on half-metallicity, i.e. their presence results in reduced spin-polarization. Here, we employ density functional calculations to explore an inverse Heusler compound, Ti2MnAl0.5Sn0.5, which exhibits half-metallic electronic structure in bulk geometry. In particular, this material behaves as a regular metal for majority-spin, and as a semiconductor for minority-spin states. We show that in thin-film geometry, the type of termination surface has a decisive effect on half-metallicity of this material. In particular, we analyze six possible termination configurations, and show that for four of them, energy states emerge in the minority-spin band gap, significantly reducing the spin polarization of Ti2MnAl0.5Sn0.5. At the same time, our calculations indicate that two termination surfaces preserve half-metallic properties of this material. This result is somewhat unexpected, as most of the available literature reports reduction of the spin-polarization due to the presence of surface states. Thus, our results show that a judicious choice of the termination surface may be a crucial factor in nano-device applications, where highly spin-polarized current is needed.",3
Topological 'Luttinger' invariants for filling-enforced non-symmorphic semimetals.,"Luttinger's theorem is a fundamental result in the theory of interacting Fermi systems: it states that the volume inside the Fermi surface is left invariant by interactions, if the number of particles is held fixed. Although this is traditionally justified in terms of analytic properties of Green's functions, it can be viewed as arising from a momentum balance argument that examines the response of the ground state to the insertion of a single flux quantum (Oshikawa 2000 Phys. Rev. Lett. 84 3370). This reveals that the Fermi volume is a topologically protected quantity, whose change requires a phase transition. However, this sheds no light on the stability or lack thereof of interacting semimetals, that either lack a Fermi surface, or have perfectly compensated electron and hole pockets and hence vanishing net Fermi volume. Here, I show that semimetallic phases in non-symmorphic crystals possess additional topological 'Luttinger invariants' that can be nonzero even though the Fermi volume vanishes. The existence of these invariants is linked to the inability of non-symmorphic crystals to host band insulating ground states except at special fillings. I exemplify the use of these new invariants by showing that they distinguish various classes of two- and three-dimensional semimetals.",3
The role of self-trapped excitons in polaronic recombination processes in lithium niobate.,"Transient absorption and photoluminescence are experimentally investigated in the polaronic reference system lithium niobate, LiNbO[Formula: see text] (LN), with the aim to refine the microscopic model of small polaron dynamics in materials with strong electron-phonon coupling. As a unique feature, our study is performed by using two different spectroscopic methods, in crystals with dopants enhancing photorefraction or damage resistance, and over a broad temperature range from 15-400 K. Although being self-consistent for particular experimental conditions, the hitherto used microscopic polaronic models reveal inconsistencies when applied to this larger data set. We show that comprehensive modeling is unlocked by the inclusion of an additional type of polaronic state with the following characteristics: (i) strongly temperature- and dopant-dependent relaxation times, (ii) an absorption feature in the blue-green spectral range, and (iii) a Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts decay shape with a temperature-dependent stretching factor [Formula: see text] showing a behavior contrary to that of small, strong-coupling polarons. The hypothesis of self-trapped excitons (STEs, i.e. bound electron-hole pairs strongly coupled to Nb[Formula: see text] and O[Formula: see text] within a niobium-oxygen octahedron) and their pinning on defects as the microscopic origin of these characteristics is supported by a spectroscopic linkage of photoluminescence at low (15 K) and elevated (300 K) temperatures and explains the long-lifetime components in transient absorption as due to pinned STEs.",3
Topological boundaries and bulk wavefunctions in the SSH model.,"Working in the context of the Su-Schreiffer-Heeger (SSH) model, the&#13; effect of topological boundaries on the structure and properties of bulk position-space&#13; wavefunctions is studied for a particle undergoing a quantum walk in a one-dimensional&#13; lattice. In particular, we consider what happens when the wavefunction reaches a&#13; boundary at which the Hamiltonian changes suddenly from one topological phase to&#13; another and construct an exact solution for the wavefunction on both sides of the&#13; boundary. The reflection and transmission coefficients at the boundary are calculated&#13; as a function of the system's hopping parameters, and it is shown that for some&#13; parameter ranges the transmission coefficient can be made very small. Therefore,&#13; it is possible to arrange a high degree of bulk wavefunction localization within in&#13; each topological region, a fact that has information processing applications. This&#13; ""topologically-assisted"" suppression of transitions, although not of direct topological&#13; origin itself, exists because of the presence of an abrupt change in the properties of&#13; the Hamiltonian at the topological boundary. We give a quantitative examination of&#13; the reflection and transmission coefficients of incident waves at the boundary between&#13; regions of different winding number.",3
Quantized dislocations.,"A dislocation, just like a phonon, is a type of atomic lattice displacement but subject to an extra topological constraint. However, unlike the phonon which has been quantized for decades, the dislocation has long remained classical. This article is a comprehensive review of the recent progress on quantized dislocations, aka the 'dislon' theory. Since the dislon utilizes quantum field theory to solve materials defects problems, we adopt a pedagogical approach to facilitate understanding for both materials science and condensed matter communities. After introducing a few preliminary concepts of dislocations, we focus on the necessity and pathways of dislocation's quantization in great detail, followed by the interaction mechanism between the dislon and materials electronic and phononic degrees of freedom. We emphasize the formality, the new phenomena, and the predictive power. Imagine the leap from classical lattice wave to quantized phonon; the dislon theory may open up vast opportunities to compute dislocated materials at a full quantum many-body level.",3
Realizing both giant magnetic anisotropy and quantum anomalous Hall effect in graphene with adsorbed Te-Co dimer.,"To realize quantum anomalous Hall state at higher temperature, it needs to search for the magnetic topological insulators with giant magnetic anisotropy. We have studied the structural, magnetic and topological properties of graphene with adsorbed Te-A (A [Formula: see text] Co, Rh, Ir) dimers by first-principles calculations and Wannier technique. Our results reveal that the system of Te-Co@G is an excellent magnetic topological insulator with both perpendicular magnetic anisotropy of 61.7 meV and large topological band-gap of 35.8 meV. Both the magnetic anisotropy and the band-gap can be effectively tuned by the applied electric field. The dimers are stably adsorbed onto the graphene and the systems are robust against thermal fluctuation. Topological analysis reveals that the adsorption system is the Chern insulator with [Formula: see text].",3
Asymmetrically optimized structure in a high-T c single unit-cell FeSe superconductor.,"We report asymmetric Se heights in a single unit-cell (UC) FeSe on SrTiO3(0 0 1) substrate with the highest superconducting transition temperature (T c) among the Fe-based superconductors revealed by total-reflection high-energy positron diffraction measurements. Among various iron-based superconductors, this single UC FeSe on the SrTiO3(0 0 1) has been the best material to achieve the highest-T c above 50 K. We found the asymmetric Se heights of 1.44 +/- 0.03 and 1.33 +/- 0.03 A from the single Fe layer by the intensity analysis based on dynamical diffraction theory. The average Se height results in 1.39 +/- 0.04 A, corresponding to the optimum value for Fe-based superconductors. In addition, the average of bond angles of Se-Fe-Se, 107.2 +/- 1.1 and 111.5 +/- 1.2 degrees becomes 109.3 +/- 1.6 degrees , which is close to the optimum value of 109.5 degrees for a regular tetrahedron. Thus, this single UC FeSe is found to have asymmetrically optimized structure. Based on our first-principles calculations, the asymmetry does not change the bandwidth whereas it splits the electron bands at the M point only at the bottom. These calculations suggest that at low electron doping, the structural asymmetry is expected to lead to exotic properties of non-centrosymmetric superconductivity, whereas after a certain amount of electron doping, average anion height plays an important role for high-T c.",3
Modeling of high-fluence irradiation of amorphous Si and crystalline Al by linearly focused Ar ions.,"Long time ion irradiation of surfaces under tilted incidence causes formation of regular nanostructures known as surface ripples. The nature of mechanisms leading to ripples is still not clear, this is why computational methods can shed the light on such a complex phenomenon and help to understand which surface processes are mainly responsible for it. In this work, we analyse the surface response of two materials, a semiconductor (silicon) and a metal (aluminium) under irradiation with the 250 eV and 1000 eV Ar ions focused at 70 degrees from the normal to the surface. We simulate consecutive ion impacts by the means of molecular dynamics to investigate the effect on ripple formation. We find that the redistribution mechanism seems to be the main creator of ripples in amorphous materials, while the erosion mechanism is the leading origin for the pattern formation in crystalline metals.",3

Fabry-Perot interferometry in Weyl semi-metals.,We show that the electrical transport across a minimal model for a time-reversal symmetry breaking Weyl semi-metal (WSM) involving two Weyl nodes can be interpreted as an interferometer in momentum space. The interference phase depends on the distance between the Weyl nodes ([Formula: see text]) and is anisotropic. It is further shown that a minimal inversion symmetry broken model for a WSM with four Weyl nodes effectively mimics a situation corresponding to having two copies of the interferometer due to the presence of an orbital pseudo-spin domain wall in momentum space. We point out that the value of the [Formula: see text] and consequently the interference phase can be tuned by driving the WSMs resulting in oscillations in the two terminal conductance measured in the direction of splitting of the Weyl nodes.,3
Role of tetrahedrally coordinated dopants in palladium hydrides on their superconductivity and inverse isotope effect.,"Absorption of hydrogen by palladium causes PdH to become superconducting below [Formula: see text]. Due to the presence of one octapore and two tetrapores per each Pd atom, it is believed that [Formula: see text] of PdH[Formula: see text] should increase further. Here, using ab initio calculation we show that (i) H placed in tetrapores of PdH[Formula: see text] induces a wide optical gap in the phonon density of states, which significantly reduces the electron-phonon coupling, and that (ii) the energetically preferable octapores filled by H enable the 9 K superconductivity only. This scenario may close a long-standing problem of the high-[Formula: see text] palladium hydrides. Moreover, simulating the pore population by H and D, within ab initio molecular dynamics, we are able to explain the inverse isotope effect in the framework of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory.",3
Secondary electron emission and yield spectra of metals from Monte Carlo simulations and experiments.,"In this work, we present a computational method, based on the Monte Carlo statistical approach, for calculating electron energy emission and yield spectra of metals, such as copper, silver and gold. The calculation of these observables proceeds via the Mott theory with a Dirac-Hartree-Fock spherical potential to deal with the elastic scattering processes, and by using the Ritchie dielectric approach to model the electron inelastic scattering events. In the latter case, the dielectric function, which represents the starting point for the evaluation of the energy loss, is obtained from experimental reflection electron energy loss spectra. The generation of secondary electrons upon ionization of the samples is also implemented in the calculation. A remarkable agreement is obtained between both theoretical and experimental electron emission spectra and yield curves.",3
Oxide thin films as bioactive coatings.,"Growth and survival of biological cells (eukaryotes and prokaryotes) on artificial environments often depend on their interactions with the specific surface. Various organic materials can be coated on substrates to assist cells' adhesion and other subsequent cellular processes. However, these coatings are expensive, degrade over short time period, and may even interfere with the cells' signaling processes. Therefore, the use of inorganic surfaces in order to control cellular interactions is of scientific importance from fundamental and application perspectives. Among inorganic materials, oxide thin films have received considerable attention. Thin films of oxides have the advantage of tailoring the surfaces for cellular interactions while using a negligible amount of the oxide material. Here, we review the lesser known application of inorganic oxide coatings as biocompatible and implantable platforms for different purposes, such as biofilm inhibition, cell culture and implant enhancements.",3
Novel pressure-induced topological phase transitions of supercooled liquid and amorphous silicene.,"This molecular dynamics (MD) simulation carries a detailed analysis of a pressure-induced structural transition supercooled liquid and amorphous silicene (a-silicene). Low-density models of supercooled liquid and a-silicene containing 10 000 atoms are obtained by rapid cooling processes from the melts. Then, an a-silicene model at T = 1000 K, a supercooled liquid model at T = 1500 K and a liquid silicon model at T = 2000 K have been isothermally compressed step by step up to a high density in order to observe the pressure-induced structural changes. Specifically 'Cairo tiling' pentagonal and square lattices of silicene are discovered in our calculations. Structural properties of those penta-silicene and tetra-silicene models have been carefully analyzed through the radial distribution functions, interatomic distances, bond-angle distributions under high-pressure condition. The dependence of pressure on formation behaviors is calculated via pressure-volume and energy-density relationships. The first order transition from low-density supercooled liquid/amorphous silicene to high-density penta-silicene and continuous transition from low-density liquid to high-density tetra-silicene are discussed. Atomic mechanism and sp(3)/sp(2) hybridization evolution are inspected whereas the role of low-membered ring defects/boundary promises remarkable application and advanced research in future.",3
"The huge effect of Mn substitution on the structural and magnetic properties of LaFeAsO: the La(Fe,Mn)AsO system.","The substitution of Mn for Fe on the sub-lattice in LaFeAsO has a remarkable impact on both structural and magnetic properties; for example, the structural and magnetic transition temperatures decrease of ~20 K in samples with a Mn-content as low as x = 0.01. Such a dramatic effect results from the high stability of the substituting Mn(2+) ion (3d (5)) in its high-spin state, which opposes any variation to its electronic state (configuration), perturbing thereby interactions within the Fe sub-lattice between the Fe ions surrounding the substituent. Several investigations ascertained that the structural transformation in LnFeAsO compounds (Ln: lanthanide) cannot be ascribed to lattice degrees of freedom, but rather to electronic or spin ones. In this context, even an extremely low concentration of Mn(2+) ions diluted in the Fe sub-lattice produces a reduction of the electronic degree of freedom of the system, thus hindering the structural transformation and the magnetic transition.",3
Exciting vibrons in both frontier orbitals of a single hydrocarbon molecule on graphene.,"Vibronic excitations in molecules are key to the fundamental understanding of the interaction between vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom. In order to probe the genuine vibronic properties of a molecule even after its adsorption on a surface appropriate buffer layers are of paramount importance. Here, vibrational progression in both molecular frontier orbitals is observed with submolecular resolution on a graphene-covered metal surface using scanning tunnelling spectroscopy. Accompanying calculations demonstrate that the vibrational modes that cause the orbital replica in the progression share the same symmetry as the electronic states they couple to. In addition, the vibrational progression is more pronounced for separated molecules than for molecules embedded in molecular assemblies. The entire vibronic spectra of these molecular species are moreover rigidly shifted with respect to each other. This work unravels intramolecular changes in the vibronic and electronic structure owing to the efficient reduction of the molecule-metal hybridization by graphene.",3
Structural transformations and physical properties of (1 - x) Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3 - x BaTiO3 solid solutions near a morphotropic phase boundary.,"Piezoelectric and other physical properties are significantly enhanced at (or near) a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) in ferroelectrics. MPB materials have attracted significant attention owing to both fundamental physics as well as the possibility of well-regulated energy and information storage devices which are dominated by lead (Pb)-based materials. Here, we report the crystal structure, Raman spectra, dielectric constant and polarization near the MPB of lead free (1 - x) Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3 - x BaTiO3 (0.00 x 0.10) solid-solution, prepared by sol-gel auto combustion technique and sintered by microwave sintering technique. With the addition of BaTiO3 into Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3, it induces a structural phase transition from R3c (a single phase) to R3c + P4mm (a dual phase) close to x = 0.06 and 0.07 and transform to a high symmetry tetragonal phase P4mm at higher compositions (x = 0.08 to 0.10) as evident from our x-ray Rietveld refinement and Raman spectroscopic results. We perform first-principles calculations based on density functional theory that confirm a structural transition from a rhombohedral to a tetragonal phase under increasing x. In the prepared solid solution, an anomalous enhancement of remnant polarization ([Formula: see text]) was observed for x = 0.06 and 0.07, which has been explained based on the existence of the MPB. On the other hand, the value of coercive field [Formula: see text] was found to be decreased linearly from x = 0.00 to 0.06; it is constant for higher compositions. Further details of the ferroelectric properties on the electric field poled samples have been studied and compared with the as-grown (unpoled) samples.",3
Spontaneous assembly of colloidal vesicles driven by active swimmers.,"We explore the self-assembly process of colloidal structures immersed in active baths. By considering low-valence particles we numerically investigate the irreversible aggregation dynamics originated by the presence of run-and-tumble swimmers. We observe the formation of long closed chains-vesicles-densely filled by active swimmers. On the one hand the active bath drives the self-assembly of closed colloidal structures, and on the other hand the vesicles formation fosters the self-trapping of swimmers, suggesting new ways both to build structured nanomaterials and to trap microorganisms.",3
Monoclinic SrIrO3-a Dirac semimetal produced by non-symmorphic symmetry and spin-orbit coupling.,"SrIrO3 crystallizes in a monoclinic structure of distorted hexagonal perovskite at ambient pressure. The transport measurements show that the monoclinic SrIrO3 is a low-carrier density semimetal, as in the orthorhombic perovskite polymorph. The electronic structure calculation indicates a semimetallic band structure with Dirac bands at two high-symmetry points of Brillouin zone only when spin-orbit coupling is incorporated, suggesting that the semimetallic state is produced by the strong spin-orbit coupling. We argue that the Dirac bands are protected by the non-symmorphic symmetry of lattice.",3
Thermal conductivity of TiO2 nanotube: a molecular dynamics study.,"The thermal conductivity of anatase TiO2 nanotubes was investigated using equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations based on Green-Kubo formalism. The calculated thermal conductivity of [Formula: see text] for anatase crystal at room temperature agrees well with experimental value of ~8.5 W K(-1) . m(-1), demonstrating that the method used in our calculation can provide a good description for the thermal transport of TiO2. The dependence of the thermal conductivity of TiO2 nanotubes with temperature, tube size and chirality were studied in detail. The relationship between the thermal conductivity and the vibrational density-of-states of the nanotubes was also investigated.",3
Chemistry in confined space through the eyes of surface science-2D porous materials.,"There are a rapidly growing number of studies showing exciting new opportunities in the way confinement effects on surfaces affect the properties of materials and their chemistry. These effects have been observed recently under two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals materials such as a graphene and boron nitride and for the case of supported 2D-porous oxides, including silicates, aluminosilicates and zeolite nanosheets. This review summarizes the current state of the art in this area of research and how confinement effects in 2D systems relate to those found in 3D porous and layered materials. The focus of this review is put in 2D-materials with inherent porosity, such as 2D-porous oxides. An outlook is also given for the future of this exciting emerging area.",3
"Mode confinement, interface mass-smudging, and sample length effects on phonon transport in thin nanocomposite superlattices.","We employ a semi-ab initio theoretical method to investigate mode confinement, interface mass-smudging, and sample length effects on phonon transport in thin nanocomposite superlattices. We present a detailed comparative study of numerical results showing the reduction in thermal conductivity due to each of these three effects for Si/Ge nanocomposite structures with planar superlattice (SL), embedded nanowire superlattice (NWSL), and embedded nanodot superlattice (NDSL) geometries. Importantly, it is found that any of these three types of thin period systems, with small amounts of interface mass smudging, can exhibit a room-temperature conductivity significantly lower than the SiGe alloy conductivity, providing strong evidence that they could be used as efficient thermoelectric materials. It is also found that the room-temperature conductivity of each of the nanocomposite superlattices shows a weaker sample size dependence than do the component bulk conductivities.",3
Probing the magnetoelectric effect in noncentrosymmetric superconductors by equal-spin Andreev tunneling.,"In noncentrosymmetric superconductors (NCSs), the conversion of a charge current into spin magnetization-the so called magnetoelectric effect-is the direct indicator of the unconventional, mixed-parity order parameter. This paper proposes a scheme to detect the magnetoelectric effect by anomalous, equal-spin Andreev tunneling in NCS/ferromagnet contacts. The proposal relies on the ability to generate spin-polarized triplet pairing by passing an electric current through an NCS. Such an induced triplet pairing bears a similarity to the paradigmatic nonunitary pairing in triplet superfluids with a complex vector order parameter [Formula: see text]. The qualitative difference is that the induced nonunitary state can be realised in NCSs with a purely real [Formula: see text] by breaking the time-reversal symmetry in current-biased setups. This offers a possibility to access the unconventional superconductivity in NCSs through electrical transport measurements.",3
Computational design of metal-supported molecular switches: transient ion formation during light- and electron-induced isomerisation of azobenzene.,"In molecular nanotechnology, a single molecule is envisioned to act as the basic building block of electronic devices. Such devices may be of special interest for organic photovoltaics, data storage, and smart materials. However, more often than not the molecular function is quenched upon contact with a conducting support. Trial-and-error-based decoupling strategies via molecular functionalisation and change of substrate have in many instances proven to yield unpredictable results. The adsorbate-substrate interactions that govern the function can be understood with the help of first-principles simulation. Employing dispersion-corrected density-functional theory (DFT) and linear expansion delta-self-consistent-field DFT, the electronic structure of a prototypical surface-adsorbed functional molecule, namely azobenzene adsorbed to (1 1 1) single crystal facets of copper, silver and gold, is investigated and the main reasons for the loss or survival of the switching function upon adsorption are identified. The light-induced switching ability of a functionalised derivative of azobenzene on Au(1 1 1) and azobenzene on Ag(1 1 1) and Au(1 1 1) is assessed based on the excited-state potential energy landscapes of their transient molecular ions, which are believed to be the main intermediates of the experimentally observed isomerisation reaction. We provide a rationalisation of the experimentally observed function or lack thereof that connects to the underlying chemistry of the metal-surface interaction and provides insights into general design strategies for complex light-driven reactions at metal surfaces.",3
Li 1s core exciton in LiH studied by x-ray Raman scattering spectroscopy.,"The Li 1s core excitation spectra in LiH was studied by means of x-ray Raman scattering (XRS) spectroscopy in a wide range of momentum transfers q. The analysis of the near-edge region of the measured spectra in combination with q-dependent ab initio calculations of XRS spectra based on the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) reveals that the prominent peak at the excitation onset arises from two main contributions, namely a pre-edge peak associated to a p-type core exciton and strong transitions to empty states near the bottom of the conduction band, which is in contrast to previous experimental studies that attributed that feature to a single excitonic peak. The p-like angular symmetry of the core exciton is supported by BSE calculations of the relative contributions to the XRS spectra from monopole and dipole transitions and by the observed decrease of its normalised intensity for increasing momentum transfers. Higher energy spectral features in the measured XRS spectra are well reproduced by BSE, as well as by real-space multiple-scattering calculations.",3
"Density functional theory study of structural and thermodynamical stabilities of ferromagnetic MnX (X = P, As, Sb, Bi) compounds.","Density functional theory (DFT) calculations for deriving enthalpies of formation [Formula: see text] H for ferromagnetic MnX (X [Formula: see text] P, As, Sb, Bi) compounds were made for the two competing structures, hexagonal [Formula: see text] and orthorhombic [Formula: see text]. Standard calculations were performed by using pseudopotentials with the generalized-gradient-approximation (PBE) as exchange-correlation functional. Enhanced exchange-correlation interactions were included by making use of a so-called DFT[Formula: see text]U approach which requires [Formula: see text] as a parameter. Application of PBE potentials for all compounds and elementary phases (all-PBE) resulted in negative values of [Formula: see text] H for MnP and MnAs in both structures whereby the result for MnP [Formula: see text] agrees very well with experiment. For MnSb and MnBi the all-PBE calculation gives a positive nonbonding [Formula: see text] H disagreeing with experiment. To overcome this discrepancy for MnSb and MnBi a DFT[Formula: see text]U ansatz was employed for all compounds and elemental Mn. The values for [Formula: see text] ranging between 0.7 for MnBi and 1.4 eV for MnAs were determined by fitting the DFT results to measured data of [Formula: see text] H. As a reference for pure Mn the [Formula: see text]-Mn phase was taken with [Formula: see text] eV by which choice the experimental volume is fitted. Atomic volumes and ionicities were derived applying Bader's concept resulting in ionicities of Mn less than [Formula: see text].",3
"Vibrational properties of germanane and fluorinated germanene in the chair, boat, and zigzag-line configurations.","The electronic and vibrational properties of germanane and fluorinated germanene are studied within density functional theory (DFT) and density functional perturbation theory frameworks. Different structural configurations of germanane and fluorinated germanene are investigated. The energy difference between the different configurations are consistently smaller than the energy of thermal fluctuations for all the analyzed DFT functionals LDA, GGA, and hybrid functionals, which implies that, in principle, it is possible to find these different configurations in different regions of the sample as minority phases or local defects. We calculate the Raman and infrared spectra for these configurations by using ab initio calculations and compare it with available experimental spectra for germanane. Our results show the presence of minority phases compatible with the configurations analyzed in this work. As these low energy configurations are metastable the present work shows that the synthesis of these energy competing phases is feasible by selectively changing the synthesis conditions, which is an opportunity to expand in this way the availability of new two-dimensional compounds.",3
Electronic properties of hybrid organic/inorganic semiconductor pn-junctions.,"Hybrid inorganic/organic semiconductor heterojunctions are candidates to expand the scope of purely organic or inorganic junctions in electronic and optoelectronic devices. Comprehensive understanding of bulk and interface doping on the junction's electronic properties is therefore desirable. In this work, we elucidate the energy level alignment and its mechanisms at a prototypical hybrid pn-junction comprising ZnO (n-type) and p-doped N,N'-di(1-naphthyl)-N,N'-diphenyl-(1,1'-biphenyl)-4,4'-diamine (alpha-NPD) as semiconductors, using photoelectron spectroscopy. The level alignment can be quantitatively described by the interplay of contact-induced band and energy level bending in the inorganic and organic component away from the interface, and an interface dipole due to the push-back effect. By adjusting the dopant concentration in alpha-NPD, the position of the frontier energy levels of ZnO can be varied by over 0.5 eV and that of alpha-NPD by over 1 eV. The tunability of this pn-junction's energy levels evidences the substantial potential of the hybrid approach for enhancing device functionality.",3
Critical diffusivity in the reversibility-irreversibility transition of amorphous solids under oscillatory shear.,"Recently it was shown that under oscillatory shear at zero temperature an amorphous solid transitions from asymptotically periodic to asymptotically diffusive steady-state at a critical maximal strain amplitude. Current understanding of the physics behind this transition is lacking. Here we show, using computer simulations, evidence that the diffusivity of the vector of coordinates of the particles comprising an amorphous solid, when subject to oscillatory shear, undergoes a second order phase transition at the reversibility-irreversibility transition point. We explain how such a transition is consistent with dissipative forced dynamics on a complex energy landscape, such as is known to exist in amorphous solids. We demonstrate that as the forcing increases, more and more state-space volume becomes accessible to the system, making it less probable for the state-space trajectory of the system to self-intersect and form a limit-cycle, which explains the slowing-down observed at the transition.",3
Effect of pressure on the self-hole-doped superconductor RbGd<sub>2</sub>Fe<sub>4</sub>As<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.,"RbGd2Fe4As4O2 is a newly discovered self-hole-doped stoichiometric superconductor, which has a hybrid structure with separated double FeAs layers and exhibits a high superconducting transition temperature Tc = 35 K. Here, we report the effect of pressure (P) on its Tc and normal-state transport properties by measuring the temperature dependence of resistivity Res(T) under various quasi-hydrostatic pressures up to 14 GPa with a cubic anvil cell apparatus. We found that the Tc is suppressed monotonically to ca. 12.5 K upon increasing pressure to 14 GPa with a slope change of Tc(P) at around 4 GPa. In addition, the low-temperature normal-state Res(T), which is proportional to Tn, also evolves gradually from a non-Fermi-liquid with n = 1 at ambient pressure to a Fermi liquid with n = 2 at P ~ 4 GPa. Accompanying with the non-Fermi-liquid to Fermi-liquid crossover, the quadratic temperature coefficient of resistivity, which reflects the effective mass of charge carriers, also experiences a significant reduction as commonly observed in the vicinity of a magnetic quantum critical point (QCP). Our results indicate that the stoichiometric RbGd2Fe4As4O2 at ambient pressure might be located near a QCP such that the enhanced critical spin fluctuations lead to the high-Tc superconductivity. The application of pressure should broaden the electronic bandwidth and weaken the spin fluctuations, and then restore a Fermi-liquid ground state with lower Tc.",3
Formation of Si/organic interfaces using alkyne-functionalized cyclooctynes-precursor-mediated adsorption of linear alkynes versus direct adsorption of cyclooctyne on Si(0 0 1).,"Adsorption of ethynyl-cyclopropyl-cyclooctyne (ECCO), an alkyne-functionalized cyclooctyne, on Si(0 0 1) was studied by means of x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Together, XPS and STM results clearly indicate chemoselective adsorption of ECCO on Si(0 0 1) via a [2+2] cycloaddition of the strained triple bond of cyclooctyne without reaction of the ethynyl group. The results are compared to the adsorption of acetylene on Si(0 0 1): C2H2 adsorbs on Si(0 0 1) via a precursor-mediated reaction channel as it was shown by means of temperature dependent measurements of the sticking probability as well as by means of STM experiments at variable temperature. On the other hand, cyclooctyne adsorbs on Si(0 0 1) via a direct reaction channel. This qualitative difference in the reaction pathways of the two functionalities leads to the observed chemoselective adsorption of ECCO via the strained triple bond of cyclooctyne. As the ethynyl group stays intact, monolayers of ECCO on Si(0 0 1) form a well defined interface between the silicon substrate and further organic molecular layers which can be attached to the ethynyl functionality.",3
Thermodynamic limits to energy conversion in solar thermal fuels.,"Solar thermal fuels (STFs) are an unconventional paradigm for solar energy conversion and storage which is attracting renewed attention. In this concept, a material absorbs sunlight and stores the energy chemically via an induced structural change, which can later be reversed to release the energy as heat. An example is the azobenzene molecule which has a cis-trans photoisomerization with these properties, and can be tuned by chemical substitution and attachment to templates such as carbon nanotubes, small molecules, or polymers. By analogy to the Shockley-Queisser limit for photovoltaics, we analyze the maximum attainable efficiency for STFs from fundamental thermodynamic considerations. Microscopic reversibility provides a bound on the quantum yield of photoisomerization due to fluorescence, regardless of details of photochemistry. We emphasize the importance of analyzing the free energy, not just enthalpy, of the metastable molecules, and find an efficiency limit for conversion to stored chemical energy equal to the Shockley-Queisser limit. STF candidates from a recent high-throughput search are analyzed in light of the efficiency limit.",3
Magnetic properties of oxygen doped samarium clusters.,"Here we present the results of experimental study of magnetic properties of samarium clusters doped with a single oxygen atom. In a recent theoretical study it was observed that for pure Sm clusters a transition from fully non-magnetic to weakly magnetic occurs due to a valence change occurring at a size of eight atoms. Here we found, first, that pure Sm clusters could not be synthesized due to the strong oxidation tendency of Sm and the inability to sufficiently remove oxygen from the setup. Therefore, we studied Sm[Formula: see text]O clusters. Since the oxygen contributes to the binding, the valence transition for Sm[Formula: see text]O clusters may be expected to occur for a smaller cluster size than for pure Sm clusters. Indeed from our experiments the valence transition is indicated to occur for [Formula: see text] Sm atoms instead of [Formula: see text]. Furthermore, the observed magnetic moment as function of cluster size for Sm[Formula: see text]O clusters shows a strong dependency of the magnetic moment on the cluster size. A large total magnetic moment is observed for Sm[Formula: see text]O, Sm[Formula: see text]O, Sm[Formula: see text]O and Sm[Formula: see text]O compared to the smaller moment for Sm[Formula: see text]O to Sm[Formula: see text]O and Sm[Formula: see text]O to Sm[Formula: see text]O.",3
Component manipulated magnetic anisotropy and damping in Heusler-like compound Co2+x Fe1-x Al.,"The component dependence of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy and the damping has been investigated in epitaxial Heusler-like compound Co2+x Fe1-x Al films grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) with x = -0.4, -0.2, 0, 0.2, and 0.4. All the films show a component tunable four-fold magnetocrystalline anisotropy with the easy axis along [1 1 0] orientation. The time resolved magneto-optic Kerr effect measurements reveal that the damping constant can be tuned in a range of 0.0065-0.0156 with a minimum value of 0.0065 at x = -0.2. This work provides a new approach to manipulate the magnetic dynamic properties of Heusler alloy Co2FeAl by adjusting the proportion of Co and Fe.",3
Thermal echo in a finite one-dimensional harmonic crystal.,"An instant homogeneous thermal perturbation in the finite harmonic one-dimensional crystal is studied. Previously it was shown that for the same problem in the infinite crystal the kinetic temperature oscillates with decreasing amplitude described by the Bessel function of the first kind. In the present paper it is shown that in the finite crystal this behavior is observed only until a certain period of time when a sharp increase of the oscillation amplitude is realized. This phenomenon, further referred to as the thermal echo, occurs periodically, with the period proportional to the crystal length. The amplitude for each subsequent echo is lower than for the previous one. It is obtained analytically that the time-dependence of the kinetic temperature can be described by an infinite sum of the Bessel functions with multiple indices. It is also shown that the thermal echo in the thermodynamic limit is described by the Airy function.",3
Shape deformation of a vesicle under an axisymmetric non-uniform alternating electric field.,"We suggest that non-uniform electric fields that are commonly used to study vesicle dielectrophoresis can be employed in hitherto relatively unexplored areas of vesicle deformation (for electromechanical characterization) and electroporation. Conventionally, the tension generated in vesicles is commonly modeled to be entropic or enthalpic in origin. A comparison of the configuration of a vesicle in the enthalpic and entropic regimes as well as the cross over between the two regimes during vesicle deformation has eluded understanding. A lucid demonstration of this concept is provided by the study of vesicle deformation under axisymmetric quadrupole electric field and the shapes of the vesicles obtained using the entropic and the enthalpic approaches, show significant differences. A strong dependence of the final vesicle shapes on the ratio of electrical conductivities of the fluids inside and outside the vesicle as well as on the frequency of the applied quadrupole electric field is observed. A comparison with experimental data from the literature is also made. Moreover, an excess area dependent transition between the entropic and enthalpic regimes is observed. The method could be used to estimate electromechanical properties of the vesicle.",3
Local insight into the La-induced structural phase transition in multiferroic BiFeO3 ceramics by x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy.,"Substitution of bismuth by rare earth (RE) ions is of great technological importance to develop room-temperature BiFeO3-based multiferroic materials. Despite this interest, many fundamental properties and the structure-property correlations of RE-doped BiFeO3 remain poorly understood. Here we report a systematical experimental and theoretical exploration on the structural phase transition in Bi1-x La x FeO3 (0 x 0.2) ceramics. By using x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, we for the first time show that the La(3+) dopants in fact substitute the Bi site of secondary nanosized particles with orthorhombic Pbam symmetry instead of the long-believed parental rhombohedral R3c phase at all La(3+) doping concentrations (0.001 x 0.2). This homogeneously mixed two-phase compound cannot be detected by the x-ray diffraction until La content approaching x = 0.1. The finding is further supported by complementary studies of transmission electron microscopy and thermodynamic preference, and it casts serious challenges on the prevailing assumption of La(3+) substitution on the Bi(3+) site in R3c structure when x 0.1 as well as the previously proposed origin of enhanced functional properties based on morphotropic phase boundary. This new insight may ignite a revival on exploring the underlying multiferroic mechanisms in BiFeO3-based materials and facilitate the bottom-up design of novel multifunctional devices.",3
Unraveling the physical properties and superparamagnetism in anti-site disorder controlled Fe<sub>2</sub>TiSn.,"With an aim to control the anti-site disorder between Fe and Ti atoms in the full Heusler alloy, Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TiSn, we substitute small percentage of Ti at Fe site to form the Fe&lt;sub&gt;2-x&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;1+x&lt;/sub&gt;Sn (0 </= x </= 0.1) series. Using the incident X-rays tuned to the Fe K-edge absorption energy, we record the high resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction profiles and unambiguously show the reduction in anti-site disorder. In particular, the Fe - Ti anti-site disorder decreases up to an excess Ti - content of 0.07; further increase of Ti - content leads to disorder between Ti{Sn sites. Detailed characterization vis-a-vis the excess Ti content has been carried out in terms of its thermal and electrical transport, and magnetic properties. Signatures of strong spin fluctuation are seen in all the physical properties reported here. The much disputed high value of Sommerfeld constant has been shown to be a resultant of such strong spin fluctuations, thus ruling&#13; out the long standing controversy of heavy fermionic nature of Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TiSn. Magnetization and Seebeck coefficient show clear dependence on the disorder. Both, dc and ac magnetic measurements reveal the low temperature superparamagnetic nature of this&#13; system, comprising of large magnetic clusters ~ 3 nm in size.",3
Orbiton-phonon coupling in Ir(5+)(5d (4)) double perovskite Ba2YIrO6.,"Ba2YIrO6, a Mott insulator, with four valence electrons in Ir(5+) d-shell (5d (4)) is supposed to be non-magnetic, with J eff = 0, within the atomic physics picture. However, recent suggestions of non-zero magnetism have raised some fundamental questions about its origin. We focus on the phonon dynamics, probed via Raman scattering, as a function of temperature and different incident photon energies, as an external perturbation. Our studies reveal strong renormalization of the phonon self-energy parameters and integrated intensity for first-order modes, especially redshift of the few first-order modes with decreasing temperature and anomalous softening of modes associated with IrO6 octahedra, as well as high energy Raman bands attributed to the strong anharmonic phonons and coupling with orbital excitations. The distinct renormalization of second-order Raman bands with respect to their first-order counterpart suggest that higher energy Raman bands have significant contribution from orbital excitations. Our observation indicates that strong anharmonic phonons coupled with electronic/orbital degrees of freedom provides a knob for tuning the conventional electronic levels for 5d-orbitals, and this may give rise to non-zero magnetism as postulated in recent theoretical calculations with rich magnetic phases.",3
Effect of pressure on the physical properties of the superconductor NiBi<sub>3</sub>.,"We present an experimental study of the superconducting properties of NiBi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as a function of pressure by means of resistivity and magnetization measurements and combine our results with DFT calculations of the band structure under pressure. We find a moderate suppression of the critical temperature &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; from approximately 4.1 K to approximately 3 K by pressures up to 2 GPa. By taking into account the change of the band structure as a function of pressure, we argue that the decrease in &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is consistent with conventional, electron-phonon-mediated BCS-type superconductivity.",3
"Structural, elastic and vibrational properties of celestite, SrSO4, from synchrotron x-ray diffraction, thermal diffuse scattering and Raman scattering.","In order to resolve inconsistencies encountered in published data for SrSO[Formula: see text], the elasticity and the phase stability of celestite has been studied using thermal diffuse scattering, high pressure powder synchrotron x-ray diffraction, Raman scattering and DFT calculations. The structure of SrSO[Formula: see text] is found to be stable up to 62 GPa at ambient temperature. The preferred values for the components of the elastic stiffness tensor have been determined using x-ray thermal diffuse scattering and are (in GPa): [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]. The preferred value for the bulk modulus is [Formula: see text] GPa. This work shows that thermal diffuse scattering collected at two temperatures allows the determination of the full elastic tensor of crystals with low space group symmetry.",3
Emergence of topological phases by stacking of two-dimensional lattices with nonsymmorphic symmetry.,"Topological semimetals have a variety of phases, whose Fermi surfaces can be nodal points, nodal lines and nodal loops. Here we construct four classes of 3D minimal models via vertically stacking a 2D nonsymmorphic lattice with and without breaking crystalline symmetries. As a result, four distinct topological phases can be generated in our minimal model, such as Dirac nodal line semimetals, Weyl nodal line semimetals, unconventional Weyl semimetals with topological charge [Formula: see text], and weak topological insulators. Unexpectedly, Weyl nodal loops are generated without mirror symmetry protection, where nontrivial 'drumhead' surface states emerge within the loops.",3
Transport characteristics and dwell time in a bilayer phosphorene barrier.,"In this paper, transport properties, dwell time and electron conductance were theoretically investigated through a rectangular electrostatic potential barrier in bilayer phosphorene and compared the results with monolayer phosphorene and graphene. It has been shown that in bilayer phosphorene, in the presence of an interlayer induced bias, a four-band approximation describes transport process in the system. The results show that interlayer bias parameter drastically affect transport properties. These effects include: (1) appearance of eight transmission and reflection coefficients from a band within the same band and between the two bands; (2) appearance of the anti-Klein tunnelling phenomenon and tuning the bias of system in such a way which is observed in specified biases and removed in other biases; (3) tuning conductance of the system. Results of dwell time in bilayer phosphorene show that this parameter in terms of barrier thickness does not have a strictly ascending behaviour and in limited range of incident energies (incident angles), the dwell time in the barrier reduces significantly which can be exploited in designing switching devices in nano-electronics. We found that increasing the interlayer bias decreases the intrinsic gap of the bilayer phosphorene which enables us to control the electron transmission rate in the system. In addition, our findings also demonstrate that by tuning the interlayer bias, a large electrical conductance can be achieved which can be used in semiconductor technology. Our study could serve as a basis for investigations of the basic physics of tunnelling mechanisms and using bilayer phosphorene as a proper candidate in low dimensional semiconductor industry.",3
Hybridization of an unoccupied molecular orbital with an image potential state at a lead phthalocyanine/graphite interface.,"The interaction of a molecular orbital with a surface state is important to understand the spatial distribution of the wave function at the molecule/substrate interface. In this study, we focus on hybridization of an unoccupied state of lead phthalocyanine (PbPc) with the image potential state (IPS) on a graphite surface. The hybridization modifies the energy-momentum dispersions of the IPS on PbPc films as observed by angle-resolved two-photon photoemission. On the PbPc 1 monolayer film, the IPS band forms a band gap and back-folding appears at the first Brillouin zone boundary due to the periodic potential by the adsorbate lattice. The modification of the dispersion is accompanied by the intensity enhancement of the IPS. We attributed the origin of the modified dispersion and intensity enhancement to a hybridization of the IPS with a molecule-derived unoccupied level. From the photon energy-dependent measurement on multilayer films, we have found the diffuse unoccupied molecular level in the vicinity of the IPS. The tail part of the IPS wave function in the substrate is enhanced by the hybridization with the unoccupied state, and thus strengthens the transition from the occupied substrate band to the hybridized IPS.",3
Magnetic impurity resonance states for different pairing symmetries in twisted bilayer graphene.,"In this work, we study the magnetic impurity resonance states in the superconducting phase of 'magic' angle twisted bilayer graphene for different pairing symmetries. Using a two-orbital model on the emergent honeycomb lattice, we find that the resonance states are dramatically different for [Formula: see text]-wave pairing and topological nontrivial pairings. When the magnetic impurity is located at one site of the emergent honeycomb lattice, i.e. the center of the AB spot of the moire pattern, the spacial distributions of the resonance states will break both the threefold and twofold rotation symmetries of [Formula: see text] point group for pairing symmetries which belong to the irreducible representations of this point group. When the magnetic impurity is located at the center of the emergent honeycomb lattice i.e. the center of the AA spot of the moire pattern, the appearance of resonance peak at the position close to the impurity can be considered as a strong evidence of non-[Formula: see text]-wave pairing.",3
Flexibility defines structure in crystals of amphiphilic DNA nanostars.,"DNA nanostructures with programmable shape and interactions can be used as building blocks for the self-assembly of crystalline materials with prescribed nanoscale features, holding a vast technological potential. Structural rigidity and bond directionality have been recognised as key design features for DNA motifs to sustain long-range order in 3D, but the practical challenges associated with prescribing building-block geometry with sufficient accuracy have limited the variety of available designs. We have recently introduced a novel platform for the one-pot preparation of crystalline DNA frameworks supported by a combination of Watson-Crick base pairing and hydrophobic forces (Brady et al 2017 Nano Lett. 17 3276-81). Here we use small angle x-ray scattering and coarse-grained molecular simulations to demonstrate that, as opposed to available all-DNA approaches, amphiphilic motifs do not rely on structural rigidity to support long-range order. Instead, the flexibility of amphiphilic DNA building-blocks is a crucial feature for successful crystallisation.",3
"First-principles study of thermal expansion and thermomechanics of group-V monolayers: blue phosphorene, arsenene, and antimonene.","Using first-principles calculations based on quasiharmonic approximation (QHA), we systematically investigate the vibrational properties, thermal expansion and thermomechanics properties of three monoatomic group-V monolayers with honeycomb structure: blue phosphorene, arsenene and antimonene. It is found antimonene shows negative thermal expansion in the temperature range studied, while blue phosphorene and arsenene display small positive thermal expansion at high temperature. The physical mechanisms of their different thermal properties are explored. The results of Gruneisen theory are also exhibited for comparison, and the similarities and differences are studied. It is concluded the discrepancies arise from the high order anharmonicity of phonons.",3
Inter-node superconductivity in strained Weyl semimetals.,"The effects of a strain-induced pseudomagnetic field on inter-node spin-triplet superconducting states in Weyl semimetals are studied by using the quasiclassical Eilenberger formalism. It is found that the Cooper pairing with spins parallel to the pseudomagnetic field has the lowest energy among the spin-triplet states and its gap does not depend on the strength of the field. In such a state, both electric and chiral superconducting currents are absent. This is in contrast to the superconducting states with the spins of Cooper pairs normal to the field, which support a nonzero chiral current and are inhibited by the strain-induced pseudomagnetic field. The corresponding critical value of the field, which separates the normal and superconducting phases, is estimated.",3
Size and shape dependent melting temperature of metallic nanomaterials.,"This study aims to characterize the size and shape dependent melting temperature of nanomaterials. Considering that surface atoms and interior atoms affect the melting of materials in different manners, we thus define an equivalent relationship between the contribution of surface atoms and interior atoms. Based on this definition, a criterion of melting is proposed through introducing a critical energy storage density of melting, the sum of the contribution of surface atoms and the interior atoms. According to the proposed criterion, a new theoretical model without any adjustable parameters is developed to characterize the size effect of melting temperatures of nanomaterials. The model predictions are in good agreement with the available experimental data or molecular dynamics simulations. This model uncovers the quantitative relationship between the melting temperature, size, atomic diameter and shape of nanomaterials. In addition, this model is extended to predict the size dependent glass transition temperatures of polymers. This study can help to better understand and characterize the size dependent melting temperatures of nanomaterials, as well as the size dependent glass transition temperatures of polymers.",3
First-principles investigation of the interface magnetic anisotropy of Fe/SrTiO3.,"Interface effects in magnetic nanostructures play a critical role in the magnetic properties. By using first-principles density functional theory calculations, we investigate the electronic and magnetic properties of Fe/SrTiO3 interfaces, in which both the nonpolar surface SrTiO3(0 0 1) and the polar surface SrTiO3(1 1 0) are considered. A particular emphasis is placed on the magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE). Comparing MAE of the Fe/SrTiO3 interfaces and the corresponding Fe monolayers, we find the Fe/SrTiO3(0 0 1) interface decreases MAE, while the Fe/SrTiO3(1 1 0) interface increases MAE. The interface orbital hybridization and orbital magnetic moments are analyzed in detail to understand the different interface magnetic anisotropy. Our investigation indicates that interface engineering can be an effective way to modulate the magnetic properties.",3
Electronic structure of an iron porphyrin derivative on Au(1 1 1).,"Surface-bound porphyrins are promising candidates for molecular switches, electronics and spintronics. Here, we studied the structural and the electronic properties of Fe-tetra-pyridil-porphyrin adsorbed on Au(1 1 1) in the monolayer regime. We combined scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoemission, and two-photon photoemission to determine the energy levels of the frontier molecular orbitals. We also resolved an excitonic state with a binding energy of 420 meV, which allowed us to compare the electronic transport gap with the optical gap.",3
Distortions in the cubic primitive high-pressure phases of calcium.,"The superconductivity in highly compressed calcium involves the occurrence of closely related low-symmetry structural patterns with an exceptionally low coordination number. Earlier theoretical and experimental results are controversial and some findings are inconsistent with our later observations in the pressure range up to 60 GPa. This situation motivated the present concerted computational and experimental re-investigation of the structural arrangement of calcium slightly above the high-pressure limit of the bcc arrangement at low-temperatures. We report here reproducible experimental evidence for a monoclinic distortion (mC4, space group C2/c) of the calcium polymorph previously assigned to the tetragonal beta-Sn structure type. In accordance, the enthalpies calculated by electronic band structure calculations show the mC4 phase to be more stable than the undistorted beta-Sn type by about 100 meV in the entire phase space. The other low-temperature phase of calcium adopts space group Cmcm (oC4) rather than the earlier assigned Cmmm symmetry. These structural alterations substantially effect the density of states at the Fermi level and, thus, the electronic properties.",3
Scattering characteristics of an exciton-plasmon nanohybrid made by coupling a monolayer graphene nanoflake to a carbon nanotube.,"A hybrid nanostructure where a graphene nanoflake (GNF) is optically coupled to a carbon nanotube (CNT) could potentially possess enhanced sensing capabilities compared to the individual constituents whilst inheriting their high biocompatibility, favourable electrical, mechanical and spectroscopic properties. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the scattering characteristics of an all-carbon exciton-plasmon nanohybrid which was made by coupling an elliptical GNF resonator to a semiconducting CNT gain element. We analytically model the nanohybrid as an open quantum system using cavity quantum electrodynamics. We derive analytical expressions for the dipole moment operator and the dipole response field of the GNF and characterize the Rayleigh scattering spectrum of the nanohybrid. These analytical expressions are valid for any arbitrary ellipsoidal nanoresonator coupled to a quantum emitter. Furthermore, we perform a detailed numerical analysis, the results of which indicate that the GNF-CNT nanohybrid exhibits enhanced and versatile scattering capabilities compared to the individual constituents. We show that the spectral signatures of the nanohybrid are highly tunable using a multitude of system parameters such as Fermi energy of the GNF, component dimensions, GNF-CNT separation distance and the permittivity of the submerging medium. We finally demonstrate the prospect of using the proposed nanohybrid to reconstruct the permittivity profile of a tumour. The high biocompatibility and high sensitivity to the dielectric properties of the environment make the proposed GNF-CNT nanohybrid an ideal candidate for such biosensing applications.",3
Coherent optical and acoustic phonons generated at lattice-matched GaP/Si(0 0 1) heterointerfaces.,"Thin GaP films can be grown on an exact Si(0 0 1) substrate with nearly perfect lattice match. We perform all-optical pump-probe measurements to investigate the ultrafast electron-phonon coupling at the buried interface of GaP/Si. Above-bandgap excitation with a femtosecond laser pulse can induce coherent longitudinal optical (LO) phonons both in the GaP overlayer and in the Si substrate. The coupling of the GaP LO phonons with photoexcited plasma is reduced significantly with decreasing GaP layer thickness from 56 to 16 nm due to the quasi-two-dimensional confinement of the plasma. The same laser pulse can also generate coherent longitudinal acoustic phonons in the form of a strain pulse. The strain pulse induces not only a periodic modulation in the optical reflectivity as it propagates in the semiconductor, but also a sharp spike when it arrives at the GaP layer boundary. The acoustic pulse induced at the GaP/Si interface is remarkably stronger than that at the Si surface, suggesting a possible application of the GaP/Si heterostructure as an opto-acoustic transducer. The amplitude and the phase of the reflectivity modulation varies with the GaP layer thickness, which can be understood in terms of the interference caused by the multiple acoustic pulses generated at the top surface and at the buried interface.",3
Effect of the anchoring strength on the phase behaviour of discotic liquid crystals under face-on confinement.,"In this study we have performed molecular dynamics simulations to study a Gay-Berne discotic fluid confined in a slab geometry for a fixed confinement length. Four different anchoring strengths with a homeotropic (face-on) configuration were studied. We found that changing the anchoring strength changes the normal component of the stress tensor, which in turn changes the density of the system's bulk. This phenomenon leads to a shift in the isotropic-nematic transition temperature. We observe that the temperature regions where the nematic phase is present diminishes as the anchoring strength increases. The anchoring strength also affects the nematic-columnar coexistence temperature-region: it spans over more temperatures at higher anchoring strengths.",3
Optimal phase space sampling for Monte Carlo simulations of Heisenberg spin systems.,"We present an adaptive algorithm for the optimal phase space sampling in Monte Carlo simulations of 3D Heisenberg spin systems. Based on a golden rule of the Metropolis algorithm which states that an acceptance rate of [Formula: see text] is ideal to efficiently sample the phase space, the algorithm adaptively modifies a cone-based spin update method keeping the acceptance rate close to [Formula: see text]. We have assessed the efficiency of the adaptive algorithm through four different tests and contrasted its performance with that of other common spin update methods. In systems at low and high temperatures and anisotropies, the adaptive algorithm proved to be the most efficient for magnetization reversal and for the convergence to equilibrium of the thermal averages and the coercivity in hysteresis calculations. Thus, the adaptive algorithm can be used to significantly reduce the computational cost in Monte Carlo simulations of 3D Heisenberg spin systems.",3
Effect of pressure on the physical properties of the superconductor NiBi3.,"We present an experimental study of the superconducting properties of NiBi3 as a function of pressure by means of resistivity and magnetization measurements and combine our results with density functional theory calculations of the band structure under pressure. We find a moderate suppression of the critical temperature [Formula: see text] from [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] K to [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] K by pressures up to 2 GPa. By taking into account the change of the band structure as a function of pressure, we argue that the decrease in [Formula: see text] is consistent with conventional, electron-phonon-mediated BCS-type superconductivity.",3
Melting of bcc crystal Ta without the Lindemann criterion.,"Understanding of melting is deeply rooted in the Lindemann criterion which predicts that the transition occurs when the mean vibrational atomic displacement reaches a universal value. The criterion also finds its way in atomic description of kinetics of various structural phase transitions involving liquid and amorphous phases. Here we show using atomistic modeling in bcc crystal tantalum that neither the universal displacement exists nor melting occurs at the anticipated value from the Lindemann criterion. Instead, before and at melting a series of strongly correlated atomic diffusional motions are set in with the atomic displacement far more complicated than that predicted by Lindemann based on independent atomic vibrations. The displacement leads to formation of new extended atomic configurations composed of lattice chains and loops of Ta atoms still residing on the crystal lattice. It is the proliferation of these lattice chains that leads to melting.",3
"Failure mode in first-principles computational tensile tests of grain boundaries: effects of a bulk-region size, dominant factors, and local-energy and local-stress analysis.","A first-principles computational tensile test (FPCTT) is a powerful tool to investigate intrinsic strength and failure processes of grain boundaries (GBs), according to atomic and electronic behaviors based on density-functional theory, while careful interpretation is required in comparison with experiments, because of ideal conditions used in FPCTTs. We observed serious effects of a bulk-region size in FPCTTs of the {0 0 1} [Formula: see text]5 GB in Al. For a GB supercell with enough thick bulk regions, the energy-strain curve shows spontaneous failure with catastrophic energy release just after the maximum stress point, which we name Type-A failure. For a GB supercell with thin bulk regions, the energy increases gradually even after the maximum stress and continuously becomes that of relaxed fracture surfaces, which we name Type-B failure, although the stress-strain curves are almost common until the maximum stress point in both the supercells. The peculiar failure of Type B occurs by the lack of accumulated strain energies for creating fracture surfaces even after the maximum stress point, because the accumulated strain energy is nearly proportional to the bulk-region size. We clarified that the failure mode in a FPCTT depends on the relationship among the three factors; the accumulated strain energy depending on the bulk-region size, the work of separation (the formation energy of fractured surfaces into a GB), and the maximum stress of the GB (the GB strength). We showed that the failure mode of previous FPCTTs of Al tilt GBs with segregated impurities can be reinterpreted from this viewpoint, by considering the changes of the work of separation and the GB strength by impurities. We should be aware of the distinction of the failure mode in FPCTTs, because experimentally Type-B failure does not occur except for special cases. Finally, we applied ab initio local-energy and local-stress analysis to the FPCTT of the {0 0 1} [Formula: see text]5 GB in Al, and discussed how to extract local energy-strain or energy-separation relations independent of the bulk-region size to be combined with meso- or macroscopic simulations.",3
"Disclosing odd symmetry, strain driven magnetic response of Co on Pt/PMN-PT (0 1 1).","An odd-symmetry magnetic response of multiferroic composites comprising ultrathin Co layers on Pt electrodes on [Pb(Mg0.33Nb0.67)O3](1-x)[PbTiO3] x (PMN-PT) (0 1 1) piezoelectric substrates is observed upon electrical poling of the PMN-PT substrates: the magnetic easy axis of the Co rotates by 90 degrees in-plane between oppositely poled ferroelectric states, mimicking the signature of a surface polarization charge driven effect, which however can be excluded from the presence of the thick Pt interlayer. The origin for this unexpected behavior is as an odd symmetry piezoelectric response of the PMN-PT substrate, as indicated by x-ray diffraction with applied poling, in combination with conventional magnetoelastic coupling. Ferroelectric characterization reveals corresponding features, possibly related to an unswitchable polarization component.",3
Comparing two high correlation models to test the mechanical stability of americium-II.,"In this work two high density functional theory (DFT) correlation methodologies, the so called DFT+U (or GGA+U) implementation and the exact exchange of correlated electrons (EECE), hybrid DFT functional (or one case of hybrid DFT), are tested to determine the mechanical properties of americium-II. For each case, the numeric value of their principal parameter is chosen ([Formula: see text] for the first case and [Formula: see text] for the second one) once the crystalline structure meets all the mechanical stability conditions. The results show that there is a range of values of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] in which both methodologies generate a stable (experimentally correct) non-magnetic ground state, reaching approximately the same numeric value of the set of elastic constants of the cubic structure. However, only for the case of the hybrid functional results it is possible to show how the non-magnetic configuration is energetically favored, as compared to the ferromagnetic configuration. This happens around [Formula: see text], a value in agreement with a previous analysis made under the same methodology for the metal case Am-I. Following a detailed and deep analysis, it is possible to find a close interrelation between the electronic properties of the metal: its distribution of states around the Fermi level, the energy difference between the two possible spin configurations, and the mechanical response of the crystal. Also, it is possible to conclude that the effect of alpha parameter on the [Formula: see text] electrons can be used as a parameter to simulate the presence of an external pressure over the structure. For the comparison, the calculations were performed within the LAPW approximation in DFT as implemented in the WIEN2k code, with a finite deformation method.",3
Ferromagnetism in graphene traced to antisymmetric orbital combination of involved electronic states.,"Based on first principles calculations, we reveal that the origin of ferromagnetism caused by [Formula: see text] electrons in graphene with vacancies can be traced to electrons partially filling [Formula: see text]-antibonding and [Formula: see text]-nonbonding states, which are induced by the vacancies and appear near the Fermi level. Because the spatial wavefunctions of both states are composed of atomic orbitals in an antisymmetric configuration, their spin wavefunctions should be symmetric according to the electron exchange antisymmetric principle, leading to electrons partially filling these states in spin polarization. Since this [Formula: see text] state originates not from interactions between the atoms but from the unpaired [Formula: see text] orbitals due to the removal of [Formula: see text] orbitals on the minority sublattice, the [Formula: see text] state is constrained, distributed on the atoms of the majority sublattice, and decays gradually from the vacancy as approximately [Formula: see text]. According to these characteristics, we concluded that the [Formula: see text] state plays a critical role in magnetic ordering in graphene with vacancies. If the vacancy concentration in graphene is large enough to cause the decay-length regions to overlap, constraining the [Formula: see text] orbital components as little as possible on the minority sublattice atoms in the overlap regions results in the vacancy-induced [Formula: see text] states being coherent. The coherent process in the overlap region leads to the wavefunctions in all the involved regions antisymmetrized, consequently causing ferromagnetism according to the electron exchange antisymmetric principle. This unusual mechanism concerned with the origin of [Formula: see text]-electron magnetism and magnetic ordering has never before been reported and is distinctly different from conventional mechanisms. Consequently, we can explain how such a weak magnetization with such a high critical temperature can be experimentally observed in proton-irradiated graphene.",3
"Superconducting transition temperatures in the electronic and magnetic phase diagrams of Sr2VFeAsO3-delta , a superconductor.","We elucidate the magnetic phases and superconducting (SC) transition temperatures (T c) in Sr2VFeAsO3-delta (21113V), an iron-based superconductor with a thick-blocking layer fabricated from a perovskite-related transition metal oxide. At low temperatures (T < 37.1 K), 21113V exhibited a SC phase in the range 0.031 delta 0.145 and an antiferromagnetic (AFM) iron sublattice in the range 0.267 delta 0.664. Mixed-valent vanadium exhibited a dominant AFM phase in 0.031 delta 0.088, and a partial ferrimagnetic (Ferri.) phase in the range 0.124 delta 0.664. The Ferri. phase was the most dominant at a delta value of 0.267, showing an AFM phase of Fe at T < 20 K. Increasing the spontaneous magnetic moments reduced the magnetic shielding volume fraction due to the SC phase. This result was attributed to the magnetic phase of vanadium, which dominates the superconductivity of Fe in 21113V. The T c-delta curve showed two maxima. The smaller and larger of T c maxima occurred at delta = 0.073 and delta = 0.145, respectively; the latter resides on the phase boundary between AFM and the partial Ferri. phases of vanadium. 21113V is a useful platform for verifing new mechanisms of T c enhancement in iron-based superconductors.",3
High-pressure polymorphism of BaFe2Se3.,"BaFe2Se3 is a potential superconductor material exhibiting transition at 11 K and ambient pressure. Here we extended the structural and performed electrical resistivity measurements on this compound up to 51 GPa and 20 GPa, respectively, in order to distinguish if the superconductivity in this sample is intrinsic to the BaFe2Se3 phase or if it is originating from minor FeSe impurities that show a similar superconductive transition temperature. The electrical resistance measurements as a function of pressure show that at 5 GPa the superconducting transition is observed at around 10 K, similar to the one previously observed for this sample at ambient pressure. This indicates that the superconductivity in this sample is most likely intrinsic to the BaFe2Se3 phase and not to FeSe with T c > 20 K at these pressures. Further increase in pressure suppressed the superconductive signal and the sample remained in an insulating state up to the maximum achieved pressure of 20 GPa. Single-crystal and powder x-ray diffraction measurements revealed two structural transformations in BaFe2Se3: a second order transition above 3.5 GPa from Pnma (CsAg2I3-type structure) to Cmcm (CsCu2Cl3-type structure) and a first order transformation at 16.6 GPa. Here, gamma-BaFe2Se3 transforms into delta-BaFe2Se3 (Cmcm, CsCu2Cl3-type average structure) via a first order phase transition mechanism. This transition is characterized by a significant shortening of the b lattice parameter of gamma-BaFe2Se3 (17%) and accompanied by an anisotropic expansion in the orthogonal ac plane at the transition point.",3
First-principles prediction of two atomic-thin phosphorene allotropes with potentials for sun-light-driven water splitting.,"Based on first-principles, the structures, stabilities, electronic and optical properties of two new atomic-thin phosphorene allotropes, named as stair-P and zipper-P, are systematically investigated. Stair-P and zipper-P are constructed based on the previously proposed stair-graphane and zipper-graphane, respectively. They are confirmed to be dynamically stable phosphorene allotropes with energetic stabilities comparable to the experimentally synthesized black-P and blue-P. Stair-P and zipper-P are all semiconductors with indirect band gaps of 2.32 eV and 2.00 eV, respectively. These band gaps can be effectively modulated by in-layer compressive and stretching strains. The band edges of stair-P and zipper-P are proper for water splitting at both acidic (PH = 0) and neutral (PH = 7) environments and their sun-light adsorbing abilities are better than black-P and blue-P in the visible range.",3
Effect of wavefunction delocalization on shift current generation.,"We derive upper bounds on the magnitude of shift photocurrent generation of materials in two limiting cases: the flat-band limit of almost-isolated systems such as molecular crystals, and the wide-band limit of one-dimensional or quasi-one-dimensional materials such as ferroelectric polymers or other materials with chain-like motifs. These bounds relate the magnitudes of the shift current bulk photovoltaic effect to materials parameters. In both cases, we find that ratio of electron hopping amplitudes to the band gap plays a vital role in maximizing the amount of nonlinear response. Furthermore, by using the Wannier function formalism, we quantify the effect of long-range hopping amplitudes, showing how delocalization of electronic states gives rise to larger photocurrents. These results inform the design and selection of new materials for large shift current generation.",3
Topological magnon insulator with a Kekule bond modulation.,"We examine the combined effects of a Kekule coupling texture (KC) and a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in a two-dimensional ferromagnetic honeycomb lattice. By analyzing the gap closing conditions and the inversions of the bulk bands, we identify the parameter range in which the system behaves as a trivial or a nontrivial topological magnon insulator. We find four topological phases in terms of the KC parameter and the DMI strength. We present the bulk-edge correspondence for the magnons in a honeycomb lattice with an armchair or a zigzag boundary. Furthermore, we find Tamm-like edge states due to the intrinsic on-site interactions along the boundary sites. Our results may have significant implications to magnon transport properties in the 2D magnets at low temperatures.",3
A new constraint DFT technique for self-consistent determination of U values.,"A new constraint density functional (DFT) technique workable in combination with the projector augmented wave (PAW) and pseudoptential (PP) methods was developed. This technique calculates the effective on-site-interaction parameter, U eff, of correlated electrons of materials, self-consistently, by using the DFT + U method. The U eff determined by this technique has a clear physical meaning in that it determines the electronic structures of strongly correlated electronic systems (SCESs) and vice versa. The technique was used to determine the U eff of correlated electrons of neodymium sesquioxide (Nd2O3) and iron oxide (FeO), and it was shown to be effective for this purpose. It enables first principles DFT + U PAW and PP calculations of SCESs free from any empirical parameters.",3
Direct coupling of first-principles calculations with replica exchange Monte Carlo sampling of ion disorder in solids.,"We demonstrate the feasibility of performing sufficient configurational sampling of disordered oxides directly from first-principles without resorting to the use of fitted models such as cluster expansion. This is achieved by harnessing the power of modern-day cluster supercomputers using the replica exchange Monte Carlo method coupled directly with structural relaxation and energy calculation performed by density functional codes. The idea is applied successfully to the calculation of the temperature-dependence of the degree of inversion in the cation sublattice of MgAl2O4 spinel oxide. The possibility of bypassing fitting models will lead to investigation of disordered systems where cluster expansion is known to perform badly, for example, systems with large lattice deformation due to defects, or systems where long-range interactions dominate such as electrochemical interfaces.",3
Experimental and theoretical evidences for the ice regime in planar artificial spin ices.,"In this work, we explore a kind of geometrical effect in the thermodynamics of artificial spin ices (ASI). In general, such artificial materials are athermal. Here, We demonstrate that geometrically driven dynamics in ASI can open up the panorama of exploring distinct ground states and thermally magnetic monopole excitations. It is shown that a particular ASI lattice will provide a richer thermodynamics with nanomagnet spins experiencing less restriction to flip precisely in a kind of rhombic lattice. This can be observed by analysis of only three types of rectangular artificial spin ices (RASI). Denoting the horizontal and vertical lattice spacings by [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], respectively, then, a RASI material can be described by its aspect ratio [Formula: see text]. The rhombic lattice emerges when [Formula: see text]. So, by comparing the impact of thermal effects on the spin flips in these three appropriate different RASI arrays, it is possible to find a system very close to the ice regime.",3
Quasi-degenerate magnetic states in alpha-RuCl3.,"Exploring quantum spin liquid (QSL) state has both fundamental scientific value and realistic application potential. Recently, alpha-RuCl3 was experimentally observed to hold in-plane zigzag antiferromagnetic (AFM) order at low temperature, which was further proposed to be proximate to a Kitaev QSL ground state. We have studied the magnetic properties of alpha-RuCl3 in the framework of electronic structure calculation based on density functional theory (DFT) with Hubbard U correction (DFT+U) and spin-orbit coupling. When the intra-orbital Hubbard interaction U and the inter-orbital Hund's coupling J adopt the commonly accepted values of U = 2.0 eV and J = 0.4 eV, the zigzag AFM order indeed owns the minimum energy, consistent with the experimental observation. More importantly, we find that compared with the ferromagnetic order in the previous theoretical studies, there exist a series of magnetic configurations energetically even closer to the zigzag AFM ground state. The further calculations and analysis indicate that these low-energy magnetic states are closely related to the electronic correlation effect of Ru 4d orbitals. By decreasing U and increasing J with just about 0.2 eV, they become energetically degenerate with the zigzag AFM order, inducing strong magnetic frustration and then yielding a state without long-range magnetic order but with nonzero local moments. Considering the facts that theoretically the pressure usually reduces the intra-orbital Hubbard interaction and meanwhile enhances the inter-orbital Hund's coupling, while experimentally the pressure drives alpha-RuCl3 into a quantum disordered phase, our results provide a perspective to understand the exotic magnetic behaviors of alpha-RuCl3.",3
3D surface condensation of large atomic shear strain in nanoscale metallic glasses under low uniaxial stress.,"Nanoscale metallic glasses (MGs) are frequently used in experimental and computational studies to probe the deformation mechanisms in amorphous metals. Potential consequences of the significant surface to volume ratio in these extremely small materials, nevertheless, are not well understood. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations and novel selective 3D visualization, we show that significant irreversible atomic shear strain condenses on the 3D surface of these materials under low uniaxial stress, while the interior atoms are bearing much lower, mostly reversible shear strain. This is observed for various sample geometries, dimensions, strain rates and temperatures, and attributable to the correlations of atomic shear strain with atomic potential energy and coordination number. The results reveal the profound influence of the surface on the strain partitioning in nanoscale MGs across the 3D volume, critical to the initiation and continuation of plasticity.",3
"On the role of magnesium in a LiF:Mg,Ti thermoluminescent dosimeter.","LiF doped with Mg and Ti is the most widely used thermoluminescent (TL) dosimeter for a large variety of applications. It has been argued that the Mg dopant is the most important defect in the TL process. Besides the common F-centre defects in LiF, optical absorption measurements have suggested the presence of Mg-related absorption bands at 380 nm (3.26 eV), and 310 nm (4.0 eV) when LiF:Mg is exposed to ionizing radiation, whose origin is not yet well understood. This work presents an investigation of the role of defects induced by Mg interstitials in LiF through electronic structure calculations. The calculations show that Mg interstitials induce a local lattice distortion characterized by the displacement of two opposite fluorine atoms, adjacent to the magnesium, away from their original sites by an average distance of 0.6 A each, while the closest Li atoms are displaced by 0.1 A. This defect introduces electronic states in the band-gap that can trap excess electrons produced during irradiation, thus enhancing the efficiency of the detector. Holes, on the other hand, are created and trapped in orbitals of mainly Mg-3s character. Additionally, the results suggest that irradiation can simultaneously remove a Li atom nearby a Mg interstitial; substitute a Li by a Mg atom or create a Li vacancy plus a Mg substitutional, giving rise to defects within the LiF gap that are more stable thermodynamically than the Mg interstitial itself. Interestingly, under irradiation the energy levels obtained for LiF:Mg-Lisub + e (-) (3.486 eV) and LiF:Mg + e (-) (4.224 eV) defects are very close to the experimental absorption bands.",3
Ginzburg-Landau theory for the magnetic and structural transitions in La1-y (Ca1-x Sr x ) y MnO3.,"We present a phenomenological theory for the ferromagnetic transition temperature, the magnetic susceptibility at high temperatures, and the structural distortion in the La[Formula: see text](Ca[Formula: see text]Sr[Formula: see text])[Formula: see text]MnO[Formula: see text] system. We construct a Ginzburg-Landau free energy that describes the magnetic and the structural transitions, and a competition between them. The parameters of the magnetic part of the free energy are derived from a mean-field solution of the magnetic interaction for arbitrary angular momentum. The theory provides a qualitative description of the observed magnetic and structural phase transitions as functions of Sr-doping level ([Formula: see text]) for [Formula: see text].",3
Transverse and longitudinal spin-fluctuations in INVAR Fe0.65Ni0.35.,The presence of spin-fluctuations deep within the ordered state of ferromagnetic [Formula: see text] alloy [Formula: see text] has long been suspected but seldom directly observed. Inhomogeneities of one type or another have been cited as important in stabilizing [Formula: see text] behaviour-either longitudinal spin-fluctuations associated with the [Formula: see text]-state (local environment) model or transverse magnetisation arising from non-collinear spin structures. In this study we employ small-angle neutron scattering with neutron polarization analysis to distinguish between the two possibilities. Surprisingly we in fact find evidence of dominant but uncorrelated longitudinal spin-fluctuations coexisting with transverse magnetisation which exists in short-range clusters of size ~[Formula: see text]. This finding supports recent first principles calculations of [Formula: see text] in which both longitudinal spin-fluctuations and magnetic short-range order are identified as important ingredients in reproducing the equilibrium [Formula: see text] lattice.,3
Non-linear soft x-ray methods on solids with MUSIX-the multi-dimensional spectroscopy and inelastic x-ray scattering endstation.,"With the intense and coherent x-ray pulses available from free-electron lasers, the possibility to transfer non-linear spectroscopic methods from the laser lab to the x-ray world arises. Advantages especially regarding selectivity and thus information content as well as an improvement of signal levels are expected. The use of coherences is especially fruitful and the example of coherent x-ray/optical sum-frequency generation is discussed. However, many non-linear x-ray methods still await discovery, partially due to the necessity for extremely adaptable and versatile instrumentation that can be brought to free-electron lasers for the analysis of the spectral content emitted from the sample into a continuous range of emission angles. Such an instrument (called MUSIX) is being developed and employed at FLASH, the free-electron laser in Hamburg and is described in this contribution together with first results.",3
Half-metallicity in uranium intermetallics: crystal structure prediction of a high-pressure phase of UCo.,Evolutionary crystal structure prediction methods combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a high-pressure (hp) phase of the intermetallic compound UCo crystalizing in the NaTl structure type ([Formula: see text]). We predict this compound to be formed at pressures below 9 GPa. Hp-UCo shows the same structural trends as the two experimentally known pseudo-binary compounds UCo0.2Rh0.8 and UNi0.8Pt0.2. We classify them as ordered solid solutions of a bcc lattice following Vegard's law. We predict hp-UCo and its adjacent phases UFe and UNi to be itinerant magnets. In the limit of vanishing spin-orbit interactions UFe and hp-UCo are half-metallic ferrimagnets. Spin-orbit coupling generally reduces the spin-polarization at the Fermi level. In case of hp-UCo the decrease depends on the applied DFT functional making the prediction of actual occurrence of half-metallicity problematic. In case of UFe the results are less dependent on the DFT functional. We demonstrate with these calulations that against 'common sense' also materials with heavy elements can be interesting candidates for half-metallicity. We highlight that the NaTl structure type should be an interesting candidate for further investigations of half-metallicity.,3
Hyperfine interaction in cobalt by high-resolution neutron spectroscopy.,We have investigated the ferromagnetic phase transition of elemental Co by high-resolution neutron backscattering spectroscopy. We monitored the splitting of the nuclear levels by the hyperfine field at the Co nucleus. The energy of this hyperfine splitting is identified as the order parameter of the ferromagnetic phase transition. By measuring the temperature dependence of the energy we determined the critical exponent [Formula: see text] and the ferromagnetic Curie temperature of [Formula: see text] K. The present result of the critical exponent agrees better with the predicted value (0.367) of the three-dimensional Heisenberg model than that determined previously by nuclear magnetic resonance.,3
Proximity two bands Eliashberg theory of electrostatic field-effect doping in a superconducting film of MgB2.,"A key aspect of field effect experiments is the possibility to induce charges on the first layers of a sample as a function of an applied gate voltage. It is therefore possible to study correlated phases of matter as a function of the induced charge density and the applied electric field. Moreover, resulting charge modulation along the direction of the applied electric field gives rise to junctions between perturbed and uneffected regions of the sample. In the framework of proximity effect Eliashberg theory, we investigate the consequence of an applied static electric field on the transition temperature of a two-band s-wave superconductor magnesium diboride. In most cases the only free parameter in the theory is the penetration depth of the applied electric field, whereas there is no freedom when the static perturbation is sufficiently weak. We come to the conclusion that the optimal way to enhance the critical temperature is to have a very thin film of magnesium diboride, otherwise the external electric field would not have substantial effect on superconductivity in this material.",3
Theoretical study of photonic bands of one-dimensional photonic crystals containing epsilon-near-zero metamaterials.,The photonic bands of a one-dimensional photonic crystal containing epsilon-near-zero metamaterials are investigated both theoretically and numerically. A theoretical expression of the edge frequencies of the photonic bands derived from the dispersion relation of the photonic crystal is in excellent agreement with the edge frequencies of the photonic bands calculated using the plane wave expansion method. These results are also confirmed using the transmittance obtained from the transfer matrix method. The theoretical expression of the band edge frequencies indicates that the magnitude of the bandgap increases as the frequency increases in the lower bands and becomes saturated in the higher bands. This is because the bands become flat in the higher frequency range.,3
"First-principles many-body study of the electronic and optical properties of CsK2Sb, a semiconducting material for ultra-bright electron sources.","We present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of the electronic and optical properties of CsK2Sb, a semiconducting material for ultra-bright electron sources for particle accelerators. Our study, based on density-functional theory and many-body perturbation theory, provides all the ingredients to model the emission of this material as a photocathode, including band gap, band dispersion, and optical absorption. An accurate description of these properties beyond the mean-field picture is relevant to take into account many-body effects. We discuss our results in the context of state-of-the-art electron sources for particle accelerators to set the stage towards improved modeling of quantum efficiency, intrinsic emittance, and other relevant quantities determining the macroscopic characteristics of photocathodes for ultra-bright beams.",3
Slave rotor approach to exciton condensation in a two-band system.,"We have studied exciton formation and condensation in an extended Falicov-Kimball model, going beyond the weak coupling approach, employing a semi-analytical technique: the slave-rotor mean-field theory (SRMF). In this essentially strong coupling theory, charge and spin (or orbital/pseudospin) degrees are treated as independent degrees of freedom, coupled by a local constraint. Using a two-site-extension of SRMF, we capture the effective many body scale beyond conventional mean-field theory. While the formation of excitons is favoured by the interband hybridization [Formula: see text], it is strongly influenced by the on-site Coulomb interaction [Formula: see text]. Beyond a critical hybridization, there is condensation of excitons, leading to a transition from a metal to an excitonic insulator phase. Moreover, the behaviour of excitonic averages differs from the usual Hartree-Fock mean-field theory. Low-[Formula: see text] results show that excitonic order parameter (Delta) is continuous across the transition both for single as well as two-site approximation, changing to weakly first order one at intermediate [Formula: see text] for the later. The large-[Formula: see text] limit shows a continuous transition for two-site analysis but remains first order in the single-site approximation. The slave rotor theory gives a mixed state of excitons and metal in both the analyses. We have also checked the effect of intersite correlation and localized band hopping on the exciton condensation.",3
Correlation of optical properties and interface morphology in type-II semiconductor heterostructures.,"(Ga,In)As/GaAs/Ga(As,Sb) and (Ga,In)As/GaAs/Ga(N,As) type-II double quantum well heterostructures have been grown by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy. A growth interruption procedure was used to intentionally modify the morphology of the internal interfaces. The heterostructures were investigated using continuous wave and time-resolved photoluminescence as well as optical pump-optical probe spectroscopy. We find a correlation between the interface morphology and optical and kinetic properties. A growth interruption of about 120 s yielded substantially smoother interfaces both on vertical as well as lateral length scales. On the other hand a considerably enhanced type-II recombination time as well as a longer electron tunneling time are observed. We attribute this to a reduced interface localization in case of smoother interfaces.",3
Electron paramagnetic resonance enhanced crystal field analysis for low point-group symmetry systems: C2v sites in Sm(3+):CaF2/SrF2.,"We present a comprehensive spectroscopic study of C[Formula: see text] point-group symmetry sites in Sm[Formula: see text]:CaF[Formula: see text]/SrF[Formula: see text] codoped with either NaF or LiF. Data includes electron paramagnetic resonance measurements of Zeeman and hyperfine interactions for the ground state, as well as site-selective excitation and fluorescence spectroscopy up to the [Formula: see text]G[Formula: see text] multiplet. Inclusion of the EPR data allowed us to determine unique crystal-field parameters. The parameters provide information about the geometry of the sites and the nature of the interactions between the Sm[Formula: see text] dopant and the alkaline earth co-dopant.",3
Magneto-elastic coupling behavior of the double perovskite Ba2FeMoO6.,"Ba2FeMoO6 has been reported to exhibit a ferromagnetic to a paramagnetic transition with a Curie temperature above room temperature, and thus it is a potential material for spintronics. These exciting properties are related, at least in part, to combined structural and magnetic instabilities. A conventional analysis of lattice parameter data from the present study and literature in terms of spontaneous strain shows that the magnetic ordering is accompanied by a significant volume strain, which implies a strong coupling behavior of magneto-elastic properties in Ba2FeMoO6. In addition, to address the correlation between anti-site defects (ASD) and magnetic properties, we have carried out a comparative study of six cubic Ba2FeMoO6 polycrystals with different degrees of ASD. The correlations among the Curie temperature, low-temperature saturation magnetism, and ASD are discussed in detail using a combination of diffraction and magnetic measurements. This systematic study, especially the strain analysis, of Ba2FeMoO6 will facilitate its potential applications in the field of spin electronics and thin film engineering.",3
Sub nanometer clusters in catalysis.,"Sub nanometer transition metal clusters composed of a small number of atoms exhibit unexpected electronic, optical, magnetic and catalytic properties that often change substantially as a function of cluster atomicity. Several factors influence their unique catalytic behavior, including their discrete electronic structure of molecular-like orbitals and the accessibility of their low-coordinated atoms. In addition, these factors are strongly correlated so that changes in their morphology may provoke large modifications to their electronic structure and vice versa. The thermodynamic instability of clusters makes it necessary to stabilize them with protective ligands in solution or to support them on solid matrices for practical applications, which introduces non-negligible modifications into their properties. Understanding their cause and extent is the key point to potentially achieve a fine tuning of their catalytic behavior. Selected examples are discussed illustrating important points on this matter, such as the influence of cluster morphology on reactivity, the need of anchoring clusters to avoid sintering and deactivation, and the possible formation of clusters in solution or under reaction conditions, with the associated difficulty to identify them as the true active species.",3
A.C. susceptibility as a probe of low-frequency magnetic dynamics.,"The experimental technique of a.c. susceptibility can be used as a probe of magnetic dynamics in a wide variety of systems. Its use is restricted to the low-frequency regime and thus is sensitive to relatively slow processes. Rather than measuring the dynamics of single spins, a.c. susceptibility can be used to probe the dynamics of collective objects, such as domain walls in ferromagnets or vortex matter in superconductors. In some frustrated systems, such as spin glasses, the complex interactions lead to substantial spectral weight of fluctuations in the low-frequency regime, and thus a.c. susceptibility can play a unique role. We review the theory underlying the technique and magnetic dynamics more generally and give applications of a.c. susceptibility to a wide variety of experimental situations.",3
Spin dependence of crossed Andreev reflection and electron tunneling induced by Majorana fermions.,"We investigate spin dependence of the nonlocal transport induced by Majorana fermions in a one-dimensional ferromagnet-ferromagnetic-insulator-superconductor-ferromagnetic-insulator-ferrom agnet junction on the edge of a two-dimensional topological insulator. The results show that coupled Majorana fermions lead to the nonlocal transport processes including electron tunneling and crossed Andreev reflection, which can be tuned by adjusting the spin polarizations of the Majorana fermions. By manipulating the bands in the two ferromagnets, the nonlocal transport can be selected as either pure electron tunneling or pure crossed Andreev reflection, the transmission probability of which could be 100%. Furthermore, the pure electron tunneling and the pure crossed Andreev reflection are well controlled by the spin directions of the electron states in the two ferromagnets.",3
How pump-probe differential reflectivity at negative delay yields the perturbed-free-induction-decay: theory of the experiment and its verification.,"We present a simple but mathematically complete first-principles theory for the pump-probe differential reflectivity experiment at negative delay (probe preceding the pump) to show how it gives information about the perturbed-free-induction-decay of coherent polarization. The calculation, involving the optical Bloch equations to describe the induced polarization and the Ewald-Oseen idea to calculate the reflected signal as a consequence of the free oscillations of perturbed dipoles, also explicitly includes the process of lock-in detection of a double-chopped signal after it has passed through a monochromator. The theory giving a closed form expression for the measured signal in both time and spectal domains is compared with experiments on high quality GaAs quantum well sample. The dephasing time inferred experimentally at 4 K compares remarkably well with the inverse of the absorption linewidth of the continuous-wave photoluminescence excitation spectrum. Spectrally-resolved signal at negative delay calculated from our theoretical expression nicely reproduces the coherent spectral oscillations observed in our experiments, although exact fitting of the experimental spectra with the theoretical expression is difficult on account of multiple resonances.",3
Penetration depth study of the type-I superconductor PdTe2.,"Superconductivity in the topological non-trivial Dirac semimetal PdTe2 was recently shown to be type-I. We hereby report measurements of the relative magnetic penetration depth, [Formula: see text], on several single crystals using a high precision tunnel diode oscillator technique. The temperature variation [Formula: see text] follows an exponential function for [Formula: see text], consistent with a fully-gapped superconducting state and weak or moderately coupling superconductivity. By fitting the data we extract a [Formula: see text]-value of approximately 500 nm. The normalized superfluid density is in good agreement with the computed curve for a type-I superconductor with nonlocal electrodynamics. Small steps are observed in [Formula: see text], which possibly relates to a locally lower [Formula: see text] due to defects in the single crystalline sample.",3
High-accuracy large-scale DFT calculations using localized orbitals in complex electronic systems: the case of graphene-metal interfaces.,"Over many years, computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) have been used extensively to study many different materials at the atomic scale. However, its application is restricted by system size, leaving a number of interesting systems without a high-accuracy quantum description. In this work, we calculate the electronic and structural properties of a graphene-metal system significantly larger than in previous plane-wave calculations with the same accuracy. For this task we use a localised basis set with the Conquest code, both in their primitive, pseudo-atomic orbital form, and using a recent multi-site approach. This multi-site scheme allows us to maintain accuracy while saving computational time and memory requirements, even in our exemplar complex system of graphene grown on Rh(1 1 1) with and without intercalated atomic oxygen. This system offers a rich scenario that will serve as a benchmark, demonstrating that highly accurate simulations in cells with over 3000 atoms are feasible with modest computational resources.",3
Peculiar covalent bonding of C60/6H-SiC(0 0 0 1)-(3 x 3) probed by photoelectron spectroscopy.,"High resolution photoemission with synchrotron radiation was used to study the interface formation of a thin layer of C60 on 6H-SiC(0 0 0 1)-(3 x 3), characterized by protruding Si-tetramers. The results show that C60 is chemisorbed by orbital hybridization between the highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the p z orbital of Si adatom at the apex of the tetramers. The covalent nature of the bonding was inferred from core level as well as valence band spectra. The Si 2p spectra reveal that a large fraction (at least 45%) of the Si adatoms remain unbound despite the reactive character of the associated dangling bonds. This is consistent with a model in which each C60 is attached to the substrate through a single covalent C60-Si bond. A binding energy shift of the core levels associated with sub-surface Si or C atoms indicates a decrease of the SiC band bending caused by a charge transfer from the C60 molecules to the substrate via the formation of donor-like interface states.",3
ARPES studies on new types of electron-doped cuprate superconductors.,"For more than thirty years since the discovery of superconductivity in cuprates, it has been widely agreed that the superconductivity is realized by doping a charge-transfer insulator with charge carriers through chemical substitution. For electron-doped cuprates, however, the recent development of reduction annealing methods has enabled superconductivity for a very small amount of or even without chemical substitution. In this article, we review recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy studies on the new types of electron-doped cuprates with particular emphasis on the effect of reduction annealing. The presented results provide us with renewed insight into the phase diagram and the nature of the pseudogap not only on the electron-doped side but also in the entire doping range including hole doping.",3
Theory for the negative longitudinal magnetoresistance in the quantum limit of Kramers Weyl semimetals.,"Negative magnetoresistance is rare in non-magnetic materials. Recently, negative magnetoresistance has been observed in the quantum limit of beta-Ag2Se, where only one band of Landau levels is occupied in a strong magnetic field parallel to the applied current. beta-Ag2Se is a material that hosts a Kramers Weyl cone with band degeneracy near the Fermi energy. Kramers Weyl cones exist at time-reversal invariant momenta in all symmorphic chiral crystals, and at a subset of these momenta, including the Gamma point, in non-symmorphic chiral crystals. Here, we present a theory for the negative magnetoresistance in the quantum limit of Kramers Weyl semimetals. We show that, although there is a band touching similar to those in Weyl semimetals, negative magnetoresistance can exist without a chiral anomaly. We find that it requires screened Coulomb scattering potentials between electrons and impurities, which is naturally the case in beta-Ag2Se.",3
The interaction of ethylene with free gold cluster cations: infrared photodissociation spectroscopy combined with electronic and vibrational structure calculations.,"The interaction of ethylene with free gold clusters of different sizes and charge states has been previously shown theoretically to involve two different adsorption modes of the C2H4 molecule, namely: the di-sigma- and pi-bonded ethylene adsorption configurations. Here, we present the first experimental investigation of the structure of a series of gas-phase gold-ethylene complexes, [Formula: see text]. By employing infrared multiple-photon dissociation spectroscopy in conjunction with first-principles calculations it is revealed that up to three C2H4 molecules preferably bind to gold cations in a pi-bonded configuration. The binding of all ethylene molecules is found to be dominated by partial electron donation from the ethylene molecules to the gold clusters leading to an activation of the C-C bond. The cooperative action of multiple coadsorbed C2H4 on [Formula: see text] is shown to enable additional charge back-donation and an enhanced C-C bond activation. In contrast, the strong C-H bond is not weakened and the experimental spectra do not give any indication for C-H bond dissociation. The possible correlations of the C-C bond stretch vibration with the C-C bond length and the net charge transfer are discussed.",3
Phase transition and electrical properties of aggregations of ethoxylated phytosterol surfactants by dielectric spectroscopy.,"The aggregation behaviors of the bio-friendly nonionic phytosterol ethoxylated (BPS-n) surfactants, in water were investigated by dielectric spectroscopy over a frequency range from 40 Hz to 110 MHz. Only the BPS-5 solution system observes dielectric relaxation and we judge this is because due to the difference in the chain length of BPS-n surfactants. Then we further analyze the BPS-5 solution system. Interestingly, we found that BPS-5 lamellar aggregations exist two phases before and after 6%-8% BPS-5 concentration by using the dielectric parameters and the phase parameters obtained by fitting dielectric spectrum and the theoretical model respectively. In addition, we concluded that the change of the electrical parameters such as surface conductivity and zeta potential are related to the lamellar phase structure. Besides, lamellar phases formed at a lower concentration are more stable than those at higher concentration by the thermodynamic analysis.",3
Controlling disorder in two-dimensional networks.,"Two-dimensional networks are constructed by reference to a distribution of ring sizes and a parameter (alpha) which controls the preferred nearest-neighbour spatial correlations, and allows network topologies to be varied in a systematic manner. Our method efficiently utilizes the dual lattice and allows the range of physically-realisable configurations to be established and compared to networks observed for a wide range of real and model systems. Three different ring distributions are considered; a system containing five-, six- and seven-membered rings only (a proxy for amorphous graphene), the configuration proposed by Zachariasen in 1932, and a configuration observed experimentally for thin (near-2D) films of SiO2. The system energies are investigated as a function of the network topologies and the range of physically-realisable structures established and compared to known experimental results. The limits on the parameter alpha are discussed and compared to previous results. The evolution of the network structure as a function of topology is discussed in terms of the ring-ring pair distribution functions.",3
On the work function of the surface Mo(0 0 1) and its temperature dependence: an ab initio molecular dynamics study.,"Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations in NVT ensemble have been performed to investigate the finite temperature structure of the Mo(0 0 1) surface and its effect on work function (varphi). In accord with previous experimental and theoretical work, our simulations predict that a termination with a stable reconstruction pattern is formed at T = 123 K. This pattern vanishes when temperature is increased to 423 K or 623 K and a disordered surface phase is formed whose time average corresponds to a bulk-like termination. Our results demonstrate that the surface relaxation is an important factor contributing to thermal variation of varphi. At the lowest temperature, at which a stable reconstruction pattern is formed, the work function is found to increase by approximately 0.23 eV compared to relaxed unreconstructed surface. The disappearance of stable reconstruction pattern at elevated temperatures leads to a decrease of varphi by approximately 0.07 eV. In contrast, the values computed for a non-reconstructing surface Mo(1 1 0) at T = 123 K, 423 K and 623 K are found to be nearly identical to the zero temperature value, which is a consequence of restricted atomic motion due to high packing density in this surface.",3
Magnetotransport studies of optimally doped Sr(Fe1-x Co x )2As2.,"We report magnetotransport measurements and their scaling analysis for the optimally electron-doped Sr(Fe0.88Co[Formula: see text]As2 system. We observe that both the Kohler's and modified Kohler's scalings are violated. Interestingly, the Hall angle displays a quadratic temperature dependence (cot[Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] T (2)) similar to many cuprates and heavy fermion systems. The fact that this T (2) dependence is seen in spite of the violation of modified Kohler's scaling suggests that the Hall angle and magnetoresistance are not governed by the same scattering mechanism. We also observe a linear magnetoresistance in this system, which does not harbor a spin density wave ground state. Implications of our observations are discussed in the context of existing models for the magnetotransport of these strongly correlated electron systems.",3
NMR diagnosis of pseudo-scalar superconductivity in 3D Dirac materials.,Recently observed 4pi periodic Andreev bound states in 3D Dirac materials are attributed to conventional superconducting pairing. Our alternative explanation in terms of a novel form of parity breaking pseudo-scalar superconducting order can be sharply diagnosed by nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation rate. The left-right symmetry breaking of the pseudo-scalar superconductivity can be directly probed as an anti-peak structure below T C in sharp contrast to the conventional Hebel-Slichter peak.,3
Effect of dynamically changing the substrate's easy axis on the response time of nematic samples.,"Recent discoveries of advanced photocontrolled materials have kindled a great deal of interest on their use as command surfaces that switch easy axis under light radiation. One noticeable point when using switchable surfaces on any application is how the dynamical process propagates to the bulk directors. In this paper, we theoretically study the effect of a relaxing easy axis over time on a nematic sample when finite anchoring energy and surface viscosity are included. We first consider the case where just one of the substrates decay over time in an initially distorted director organization. Next, we assume that both substrates can be switched simultaneously. From the calculated director we obtained the optical profile and finally the molecular response time of the material. The response time depends on both the materials and the surfaces properties including its decay time. Our results might be used for understanding and engineering liquid crystal displays and other electro-optical devices with photocontrolled alignment layers.",3
Nodal-line semimetal superlattices.,"Spatial modulations, such as superlattices, to realize topological materials have recently been studied in theoretical and experimental works. In this paper, we investigate properties of the superlattices of the nodal-line semimetal and the normal insulator. We consider two types of superlattices, with the stacking direction being perpendicular or parallel to the plane where the nodal line lies. In particular, we show that when the stacking direction is parallel to the plane, the nodal lines remain but they change their shapes because of the folding of the Brillouin zone. We also study the superlattices with magnetization. One can expect that the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) phase emerges in some cases, depending on the direction of the magnetization. If the magnetization is along the C 2-invariant axis, the superlattice becomes the Weyl semimetal phase if the C 2-invariant axis intersects the nodal lines, and otherwise it becomes the QAH phase.",3
Radiative recombination in narrow gap HgTe/CdHgTe quantum well heterostructures for laser applications.,Radiative recombination is studied in CdHgTe/HgTe QWs with bandgap in the 40-140 meV range using four-band Kane model. Calculated radiative lifetimes agree well with the photoconductivity kinetics measurements. We show that the side maxima in the valence band hinder the radiative recombination at high carrier concentrations and discuss how to overcome this effect for the development of long-wavelength lasers.,3
Mirror twin grain boundaries in molybdenum dichalcogenides.,"Mirror twin grain boundaries (MTBs) exist at the interface between two grains of 60 degrees rotated hexagonal transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC). These grain boundaries form a regular atomic structure that extends in one dimension and thus may be described as a one-dimensional (1D) lattice embedded in the 2D TMDC. In this review, the different atomic structures and compositions of these MTBs are discussed. The obvious formation of MTBs is by coalescence of two twinned grains. In addition, however, in MoSe2 and MoTe2 a different formation mechanism has been revealed for the formation of Mo-rich MTBs. It has been shown that excess Mo can be incorporated into the TMDC lattices. These excess Mo atoms can then reorganize into closed, triangular MTB-loops that can grow in size by adding more Mo atoms to them. This mechanism allows the formation of dense MTB networks in MoSe2 and MoTe2. Such MTB networks have been observed in samples grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and consequently their presence needs to be considered in understanding the properties of MBE grown MoSe2 and MoTe2. Density functional theory as well as photoemission spectroscopy of MTB networks have shown that MTBs exhibit dispersing 1D-bands that intersect the Fermi-level, thus suggesting that these are 1D electron systems. Consequently, experimental data have been interpreted to reveal a charge density wave (or Peierls) instability, as well as a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid behavior for electrons confined in 1D. We discuss these observations and the controversies that remain in the interpretation of some data. The metallic properties of the MTBs and their formation in dense networks also sparked the potential use of such crystal modifications for making metallic contacts to MoTe2 or MoSe2. Moreover, these crystal modifications may also boost the catalytic properties of these materials.",3
"Structural determination of neutral Co n clusters (n = 4-10,13) through IR-UV two-color vibrational spectroscopy and DFT calculations.","We recorded IR spectra for neutral cobalt clusters via two-color IR-UV ionization, using the Free Electron Laser for intracavity experiments (FELICE). Well-resolved IR spectra are presented for [Formula: see text] (n = 4-10, 13) and analyzed with the help of Density Functional Theory calculations using two different correlation exchange functionals: the revisited Tao-Perdew-Staroverov-Scuseria (revTPSS) and the frequently used Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) approaches. Although we have not performed an extensive structure search, we tentatively assign the spectra for all cluster sizes except for n = 7, and n = 10. We find that neither of the two functionals chosen clearly outperforms the other in predicting IR spectra, and that relatively low scaling factors of 0.82 (PBE) and 0.8 (revTPSS) are required. In contrast to the magnetic moments, the calculated electric dipole moments fluctuate strongly as a function of cluster size and could therefore be used as an indirect probe to the cluster structure.",3
Coexistence of pressure-induced structural phases in bulk black phosphorus: a combined x-ray diffraction and Raman study up to 18 GPa.,"We report a study of the structural phase transitions induced by pressure in bulk black phosphorus by using both synchrotron x-ray diffraction for pressures up to 12.2 GPa and Raman spectroscopy up to 18.2 GPa. Very recently black phosphorus attracted large attention because of the unique properties of few-layers samples (phosphorene), but some basic questions are still open in the case of the bulk system. As concerning the presence of a Raman spectrum above 10 GPa, which should not be observed in an elemental simple cubic system, we propose a new explanation by attributing a key role to the non-hydrostatic conditions occurring in Raman experiments. Finally, a combined analysis of Raman and XRD data allowed us to obtain quantitative information on presence and extent of coexistences between different structural phases from ~5 up to ~15 GPa. This information can have an important role in theoretical studies on pressure-induced structural and electronic phase transitions in black phosphorus.",3
The stability of binary Al12X nanoclusters (X = Sc and Ti): superatom or Wade's polyhedron.,"Binary nanoclusters (NCs) exhibit strong potential as building blocks for tailor-made scientific materials based on the precise tuning of their electron countings and spin states along with the synergistic effects that originate from the constituent elements. Herein, we studied the electronic and geometric structures of transition metal (TM) doped aluminum (Al) Al12X NCs (X = Sc and Ti), which are binary systems that extend from representative superatom [Formula: see text] anions. On the basis of the photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, Al12X anion and neutral structures are characterized as vertex-replaced icosahedron. The highly stable exohedral Al12X icosahedron is described based on an electron counting rule derived from the coupling of Wade-Mingos' rule and the jellium model.",3
The driving mechanism of the d-wave orbital order in the iron-based superconductors.,"We study the driving mechanism and the form of the orbital order in the electronic nematic phase of the iron-based superconductors (IBSs) within the random phase approximation of a 5-band model. We find the magnetic correlation energy of the system can be significantly improved when an orbital order of the d-wave form is spontaneously generated. On the other hand, the magnetic correlation energy increases as one introduce either an on-site or an extended s-wave orbital order. More specifically, we find that the on-site orbital order is disfavored by the Hund's rule coupling and the extended s-wave orbital order is disfavored by the stripy magnetic correlation pattern in the IBSs. Our work indicates that the orbital order and the spin nematic order in the IBSs develop in a cooperative fashion in the electronic nematic phase of the IBSs and should be both understood as a component of a composite order.",3
Two-photon photoemission spectroscopy of unoccupied electronic states at CuPc/PTCDA/Ag(1 1 1) interfaces.,"The unoccupied electronic structure of stacked layers of copper(II)phthalocyanine (CuPc) and perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) on Ag(1 1 1) has been investigated by means of two-photon photoemission (2PPE). We find a rich electronic structure comprising at least five unoccupied electronic states which we identify based on their energetic position and their dispersion in momentum space. More specifically, we observe the first and the second image-potential states of the modified Ag(1 1 1) surface, as well as the metal-organic interface state (IS) inherent to the PTCDA/Ag(1 1 1) interface. Moreover, two additional molecular features are observed for the CuPc/PTCDA/Ag(1 1 1) system which we attribute to an unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO + 2) of CuPc. The 2PPE intensity of the IS exhibits a pronounced dependence on the pump photon energy, which closely follows the optical absorption of the outer molecular layer. This strongly points to charge transfer from the optically excited molecules to the interface state.",3
Dynamics on next-neighbour distances in liquid and undercooled gallium.,"Density fluctuations of liquid and 20 K undercooled gallium have been studied by neutron spectroscopy. The decay of density fluctuations has been recorded at the structure factor maximum over a wide temperature range up to twice the melting temperature. The amplitude of the scattering function falls off with rising temperature in a nonlinear way with a changing slope around [Formula: see text]. The derived generalized longitudinal viscosity shows an upturn with decreasing temperature in the same temperature range. This increase in viscosity can be understood that liquid gallium transforms from a more fluid liquid metal to a more viscous liquid metal in that temperature range upon cooling. The change in the amplitude shows a remarkable agreement with results from liquid aluminium, lead and rubidium. This study suggests a universal crossover in dynamics of liquid monatomic metals, despite the many peculiar properties of gallium.",3
Low energy excitations in NiO based on a direct Delta-SCF approach.,"This paper reports calculated energies and electronic structures of nineteen excited states in NiO based on a Delta-SCF approach reported previously for the [Formula: see text] transitions in NiO and Sr2CuO2Cl2. They are the spin-flip: [Formula: see text]; eight [Formula: see text]: (one electron) (3)A2g --> (3) T 2g , (two electron) (3)A2g --> (3) T 1g , (3)A2g --> a (1) E g , (3)A2g --> (1) T 2g , (3)A2g --> (1) T 1g , (3)A2g --> b(1) E g , (3)A2g --> b(1) T 2g ; two O(2p) --> Ni(3d); seven Ni(3d) --> O(2p) (including two spin-flip) and the O(2s) --> Ni(3d) charge transfer excitations, which span an energy range from 0.25 eV to 17.53 eV, and include the fundamental band gap associated with an excitonic O(2p) --> Ni(3d) transition at 4.23 eV. These are compared to absorption and emission spectra, and previous calculations. In the case of the O(2p) --> Ni(3d) excitations, comparisons are given for gap and Gamma-point energies derived from HF, PBE0, HSE06, B3LYP, B1WC, GGA and LDA one-electron approximations. Finally, the directly calculated Stokes shifts and associated luminescence energies for the two O(2p) --> Ni(3d) transitions are reported, where the excitonic value is found to be in good agreement with the recently reported experimental value.",3
Crystal structure and physical properties of the two stannides EuPdSn2 and YbPdSn2.,"We report on synthesis, crystal structure and physical properties of the isotypic compounds YbPdSn2 and EuPdSn2 crystallizing in the MgCuAl2-type structure. In both stannides a divalent state of respective rare earth element was found from analysis of the magnetic susceptibilities. Whereas in YbPdSn2 only weak paramagnetic behaviour is observed, in EuPdSn2 a long-range magnetic phase transition occurs at 12.5 K with complex magnetic behaviour evidenced by magnetic susceptibity and specific heat measurements. Under the influence of magnetic field, the magnetic behaviour was found to evolve from an antiferromagnetic to a ferromagnetic state as a consequence of a re-arrangement of magnetic moments.",3
Heat transfer in rough nanofilms and nanowires using full band ab initio Monte Carlo simulation.,"The Boltzmann transport equation is one of the most relevant frameworks to study the heat transport at the nanoscale, beyond the diffusive regime and up to the micrometer-scale. In the general case of 3D devices, the particle Monte Carlo approach of phonon transport is particularly powerful and convenient, and requires reasonable computational resources. In this work, we propose an original and versatile particle Monte Carlo approach parametrized by using ab initio data. Both the phonon dispersion and the phonon-phonon scattering rates have been computed by DFT calculation in the entire 3D Brillouin zone. To treat the phonon transport at rough interfaces, a combination of specular and diffuse reflections has been implemented in phase space. Thermal transport has been investigated in nanowires and thin films made of cubic and hexagonal Silicon, including edge roughness, in terms of effective thermal conductivity, phonon band contributions and heat flux orientation. It is shown that the effective thermal conductivity in quasi-ballistic regime obtained from our Monte Carlo simulation cannot be accurately fitted by simple semi-analytical Matthiessen-like models and that spectral approaches are mandatory to get good results. Our full band approach shows that some phonon branches exhibiting a negative group velocity in some parts of the Brillouin zone may contribute negatively to the total thermal flux. Besides, the thermal flux clearly appears to be oriented along directions of high density of states. The resulting anisotropy of the heat flux is discussed together with the influence of rough interfaces.",3
Giant magnetoresistance control and nontrivial metallic state manipulation in a transition-metal dichalcogenide spin-valve using a gate voltage.,"Here, we have theoretically studied the valley- and spin-resolved transport in a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides based spin valve device, where both the Rashba spin orbit interaction and a gate voltage coexist in the central lead. In contrast to conventional semiconductor, nontrivial metallic states, such as, normal Rashba metal state (NRMS), anomalous Rashba metal state (ARMS), and Rashba ring metal state (RRMS), can be generated and manipulated by Rashba spin orbit interaction without the magnetic effect. For a nonferromagnetic double junction, it was found that the valley- and spin-resolved tunneling conductance can be effectively tuned by the incident energy, the junction length, the Rashba spin orbit interaction strength, and the gate voltage. Due to the spin texture and the Fermi wavevectors in the central lead, both the tunneling coefficient and the tunneling conductance all exhibit the remarkable characteristic features which enable us to diagnose the special states. For a ferromagnetic spin valve device, the resulting nontrivial metallic groundstates in the central lead also demonstrate directly in the giant magnetoresistance with notable unique features. We have further revealed that a perfect valley and spin giant magnetoresistance stems from the spin splitting and the spin-valley coupling. These valley- and spin-resolved phenomena are interesting for both fundamental research and applications.",3
Ultrafast formation and dynamics of interlayer exciton in a large-area CVD-grown WS2/WSe2 heterostructure.,"A WS2/WSe2 heterostructure is constructed by stacking a WS2 monolayer on the top of WSe2 monolayer fabricated with chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. Ultrafast transient spectroscopy is used to demonstrate the ultrafast charge transfer and interlayer exciton dynamics in the heterostructure. When the WS2/WSe2 heterostructure was photoexcitated at 617 nm (2.01 eV) to excite the A-exciton transition of WS2, an ultrafast photobleaching was observed around the WSe2 A-exciton transition at 749 nm. The bleaching signal lasts several nanoseconds, which is much longer than the A-exciton lifetime in both the WS2 and WSe2 monolayer film. Moreover, by selectively photoexciting the A-exciton of WSe2 at 749 nm in the heterostructure, an ultrafast photobleaching occurs around the WS2 A-exciton transition, the recovery of the bleaching shows a single exponential relaxation with typical time constant of ~1.8 ps. The very fast relaxation in the heterostructure probing around 620 nm is indicative that rich defect states exist below the conduction band in WS2, which can efficiently trap these electrons transferred from the WSe2 upon photoexcitation. Our spectroscopic results reveal that our CVD-grown WS2/WSe2 bilayer film has a type II heterostructure in nature at room temperature. With photoexcitation, electrons and holes can be separately confined in the WS2 and WSe2 layer, respectively; as a result, interlayer excitons are formed.",3
Simulation study on the translocation of polyelectrolyte through conical nanopores.,"Experiments have suggested that the conical nanopore may be a reasonable sensor for the biopolymer analysis as it can provide high-resolution current signal. In this paper, we use Langevin dynamics simulation to study the translocation of charged polymer (polyelectrolyte) through three different conical nanopores, a single-conical nanopore with large entry and small exit (pore I), a single-conical nanopore with small entry and large exit (pore II), and a double-conical nanopore with the tip (narrowest place) at the middle (pore III). Simulation shows that the detailed translocation behaviors are of pore structure dependence. Pore I might be the most reasonable one for the polyelectrolyte analysis, especially at strong monomer-pore attraction, since it can efficiently reduce the polyelectrolyte speed at the tip. The simulation results are interpreted by the free energy profiles of the polyelectrolyte translocation through different pores and the time of individual monomer passing through the tips.",3
Concentration dependent morphology and composition of n-alcohol modified cetyltrimethylammonium bromide micelles.,"Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) is one of the most commonly used surfactants in nanoparticle synthesis and stabilization. Usually, CTAB is used in high concentrations besides co-surfactants leading to well defined products but the complex mesoscopic CTAB structures stay mostly unknown. N-alcohols for instance are widely used co-surfactants which modify the properties of native CTAB dispersions. In this paper we report about a detailed structure analysis of n-alcohol modified CTAB micelles. In particular, n-pentanol and n-hexanol exhibit a significantly different influence on the size, shape and composition of CTAB micelles. Using a combination of small-angle x-ray spectroscopy (SAXS) and neutron scattering spectroscopy (SANS), we applied a method for a complete structural characterization of such micelles. The incorporation of n-pentanol into CTAB micelles generally does not influence the morphology but enhances the number of micelles due to the volume of the added alcohol. N-hexanol, however, leads to an elongation of the micelles as a function of its concentration. It was found by extended contrast variation measurements that this difference is caused by a different distribution of the alcohols between the micellar core and shell. N-pentanol molecules are generally located at the core-shell interface of the CTAB micelles with not only the head group but also two additional methylene bridging groups located in the micellar shell. This leads to an increase of its effective head group volume. In comparison, in n-hexanol modified micelles the whole alkyl chain is located within the micellar core. The detailed structure for n-alcohol modified CTAB micelles is described herein for the first time. The knowledge of the structural details found is indispensable for an in-depth understanding of CTAB-n-alcohol-water interfaces in general which is relevant for the synthesis of many functional nanostructures like mesoporous silica and gold or silver nanoparticles.",3
Magnetic anisotropy manipulation of the femtosecond laser-excited spin wave modes in full-Heusler Co2Fe1-x Mn x Al films.,"Spin-wave dynamics in full-Heusler Co2Fe1-x Mn x Al films have been investigated using all-optical pump-probe magneto-optical polar Kerr spectroscopy. We find magnetic damping and anisotropy can be modulated by composition x. Damon-Eshbach (DE) spin wave occurs only in the samples which present intrinsic magnetic damping and have huge uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, implying that intrinsic magnetic damping and huge uniaxial magnetic anisotropy is the necessary conditions to excite coherent DE spin wave. Kittel spin wave appears in low uniaxial magnetic anisotropic samples and presents extrinsic magnetic damping. Therefore, laser-excited spin-wave modes can be manipulated by magnetic anisotropy, whose physical picture is discussed phenomenologically.",3
Quantum theory of spin waves for helical ground states in a hollandite lattice.,"We perform spin-wave analysis of classical ground states of a model Hamiltonian proposed earlier (Mandal et al 2014 Phys. Rev. B 90 104420) for [Formula: see text] compounds. It is known that the phase diagram of the hollandite lattice (lattice of [Formula: see text] compounds) consists of four different helical phases (FH, A2H, C2H, CH phase) in the space of model parameters [Formula: see text]. The spin wave dispersion shows presence of gapless mode which interpolates between quadratic to linear depending on phases and values of J i . In most cases, the second lowest mode shows the existence of a roton-like minima mainly from [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text] path and it appears at the value of [Formula: see text] for constant [Formula: see text]. Few higher modes also show similar minima. Each helical phase has its characteristic traits which can be used to determine the phases itself. The analytical expressions of eigenmodes at high symmetry points are obtained which can be utilized to extract the values of J i . Density of states, specific heat and susceptibilities at low temperature have been studied within spin-wave approximation. The specific heat shows departure from T (1.5(3)) dependence found in three-dimensional unfrustrated ferromagnetic(anti-ferromagnetic) system which seems to be the signature of incommensurate helical phase. The parallel susceptibility is maximum for FH phase and minimum for CH phase at low temperature. The perpendicular susceptibility is found to be independent of temperature at very low temperature. Our study can be used to compare experiments on magnon spectrum, elastic neutron scattering, and finite temperature properties mentioned above for clean [Formula: see text] system as well as determining the values of J i .",3
The electronic transport efficiency of a graphene charge carrier guider and an Aharanov-Bohm interferometer.,"The electrostatic gating defined channel in graphene forms a charge carrier guider. We theoretically investigated electronic transport properties of a single channel and an Aharanov-Bohm (AB) interferometer, based on a charge carrier guider in a graphene nanoribbon. Quantized conductance is found in a single channel, and the guider shows high efficiency in the optical fiber regime, in good agreement with the experiment results. For an AB interferometer without a magnetic field, quantized conductance occurs when there are a few modes inside the channel. The local density of states (LDOS) inside the AB interferometer shows quantum scars when the scattering is strong. At low magnetic field, a periodical conductance oscillation appears. The conductance has a maximum value at zero magnetic field in the absence of intravalley scattering. The mechanism was investigated by LDOS calculations and a toy model.",3
"Electron single flexural phonon relaxation, energy loss and thermopower in single and bilayer graphene in the Bloch-Gruneisen regime.","The flexural phonons serve as one of the important modes of interaction in graphene that can inhibit carrier mobility. For the estimation of scattering due to flexural phonons a two-phonon scattering process had been in place, as due to symmetry constraints out-of-plane deformations modulate electron hopping only in the second order. But recently it has been shown that electrostatic gating can break the planar mirror symmetry and activate single flexural phonon scattering processes (Gunst et al 2017 Phys. Rev. Lett. 118 046601). Motivated by this we perform single flexural phonon mechanism based analytical and numerical calculations of the electron phonon relaxation rate, energy loss rate and thermopower in single and bilayer graphene and obtain the power exponents of these quantities in the Bloch Gruneisen regime using the non-equilibrium Boltzmann transport equation. We find that the scattering by flexural phonons substantially changes the temperature dependencies from that observed due to in-plane phonons but the carrier concentration dependencies remain the same as of the in-plane phonons for all the three investigated quantities.",3
Free-carrier dynamics in Au2Pb probed by optical conductivity measurements.,"We measured the optical reflectivity of the Dirac material Au2Pb in a broad frequency range (30-48 000 cm(-1)) for temperatures between 9 and 300 K. The optical conductivity, computed from the reflectivity, is dominated by free-carrier contributions from topologically trivial bulk bands at all temperatures. The temperature-independent total plasma frequency of these carriers is [Formula: see text] eV. Overall, optical response of Au2Pb is typically metallic with no signs of localization and bad-metal behavior.",3
Modeling the depletion effect caused by an addition of polymer to monoclonal antibody solutions.,"We present a theoretical study of colloidal stability of the model mixtures of monoclonal antibody molecules and non-adsorbing (no polymer-protein attraction) polymers. The antibodies are pictured as an assembly of seven hard spheres assuming a Y-like shape. Polymers present in the mixture are modeled as chain-like molecules having from 32 up to 128 monomers represented as hard spheres. We use Wertheim's thermodynamic perturbation theory to construct the two molecular species and to calculate measurable properties. The calculations are performed in the osmotic ensemble. In view that no direct attractive interaction is present in the model Hamiltonian, we only account for the entropic contribution to the phase equilibrium. We calculate chemical potentials and the equation of state for the model mixture to determine the liquid-liquid part of the phase diagram. We investigate how the critical antibody number density depends on the degree of polymerization and the bead size ratio of the polymer and protein components. The model mixture qualitatively correctly predicts some basic features of real systems. The effects of the model 'protein' geometry, that is the difference in results for the flexible Y-shaped protein versus the rigid spherical one, are also examined.",3
"Numerical analysis of surface and edge states in slabs, stripes, rods and surface steps of topological insulators.","By numerically solving the effective continuous model of a topological insulator with parameters corresponding to the band structure of the topological insulator Bi2Se3, we analyze possible appearance of one-dimensional states in various geometries. Massless Dirac fermions are found at the edges of thin ribbons with surface oriented not only along the van der Waals gap but also in the perpendicular direction. Thick rods and slabs with surface steps host massive modes localized on surface faces. We argue that the the origin of the massive modes is due to the difference in the Dirac point energy of adjacent faces. The absence of one-dimensional states near edges of a large rectangular rod and surface steps is demonstrated.",3
Sign reversal of magnetoresistance and inverse spin Hall effect in doped conducting polymers.,"Conducting polymers, where pristine polymers are doped by active dopants, have been used in a variety of flexible optoelectronic device applications due to their tunable conductivity values. Charge transport in these materials has been intensively studied for over three decades. However, spin transport properties in these compounds have remained elusive. Here, we studied two polaron-dominated and trap-dominated spin transport processes in two types of PEDOT:PSS polymers that are lightly and heavily doped, respectively. Using pulsed spin-pumping and spin-injection techniques, we found the sign of inverse spin Hall effect and magnetoresistance obtained from the lightly doped PEDOT:PSS film can reverse its polarity as a function of temperature and applied bias, in contrast to that in the heavily doped PEDOT:PSS film. Our work provides an alternative approach for studying the spin transport in conducting polymer films.",3
Quantum contributions to the magnetoconductivity of critically disordered superconducting TiN films.,"The onset of superconductivity in the presence of disorder is a fundamental problem of condensed matter physics. Here we investigate the magnetoconductance of disordered ([Formula: see text]) superconducting TiN films above the critical temperature T c. We show that the magnetoconductivity of moderately disordered films with [Formula: see text] is in full agreement with the perturbative theory of quantum contributions to conductivity. We demonstrate that the magnetoconductivity of films with [Formula: see text] is also in agreement with the perturbative theory down to temperatures [Formula: see text]. The quantitative discrepancy between experiment and theory develops only below temperatures [Formula: see text] for films with [Formula: see text]. This discrepancy can be eliminated if we assume steeper temperature dependence of the Larkin's electron-electron attraction strength, [Formula: see text]. The obtained temperature dependence of electron phase breaking time [Formula: see text] is in agreement with theoretical predictions for all samples.",3
Giant anomalous Hall effect in a ferromagnetic Kagome-lattice semimetal.,"Magnetic Weyl semimetals with broken time-reversal symmetry are expected to generate strong intrinsic anomalous Hall effects, due to their large Berry curvature. Here, we report a magnetic Weyl semimetal candidate, Co3Sn2S2, with a quasi-two-dimensional crystal structure consisting of stacked Kagome lattices. This lattice provides an excellent platform for hosting exotic topological quantum states. We observe a negative magnetoresistance that is consistent with the chiral anomaly expected from the presence of Weyl nodes close to the Fermi level. The anomalous Hall conductivity is robust against both increased temperature and charge conductivity, which corroborates the intrinsic Berry-curvature mechanism in momentum space. Owing to the low carrier density in this material and the significantly enhanced Berry curvature from its band structure, the anomalous Hall conductivity and the anomalous Hall angle simultaneously reach 1130 Omega(-1) cm(-1) and 20%, respectively, an order of magnitude larger than typical magnetic systems. Combining the Kagome-lattice structure and the out-of-plane ferromagnetic order of Co3Sn2S2, we expect that this material is an excellent candidate for observation of the quantum anomalous Hall state in the two-dimensional limit.",3
Non-adiabatic molecular dynamics with DeltaSCF excited states.,"Accurate modelling of nonadiabatic transitions and electron-phonon interactions in extended systems is essential for understanding the charge and energy transfer in photovoltaic and photocatalytic materials. The extensive computational costs of the advanced excited state methods have stimulated the development of many approximations to study the nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NA-MD) in solid-state and molecular materials. In this work, we present a novel triangle upSCF-NA-MD methodology that aims to account for electron-hole interactions and electron-phonon back-reaction critical in modelling photoinduced nuclear dynamics. The excited states dynamics is described using the delta self-consistent field (triangle upSCF) technique within the density functional formalism and the trajectory surface hopping. The technique is implemented in the open-source Libra-X package freely available on the Internet (https://github.com/Quantum-Dynamics-Hub/Libra-X). This work illustrates the general utility of the developed triangle upSCF-NA-MD methodology by characterizing the excited state energies and lifetimes, reorganization energies, photoisomerization quantum yields, and by providing the mechanistic details of reactive processes in a number of organic molecules.",3
Optimizing special quasirandom structure (SQS) models for accurate functional property prediction in disordered 2D alloys.,"2D materials such as MXenes have garnered attention in a wide field of applications ranging from energy to environment to medical. Properties of 2D materials can be tailored via alloying and in some cases, solid-solutions (disordered alloys) are formed. To predict the disordered alloy properties via first-principles, the model structure needs to imitate the random arrangements of alloyants and yet remains computationally tractable. Using density functional theory and the cluster expansion method, we investigate the accuracy of using of special quasirandom structures (SQSs) for predicting disordered 2D alloy properties, evaluating the effect of SQS supercell size on the prediction quality of formation energies, elastic properties, and structural parameters. We illustrate the findings with 5 different disordered binary [Formula: see text] MXene alloy systems (where M = Ti and M' = Zr, Hf, V, Nb, or Ta), demonstrating that SQSs around 6-8 times the primitive cell (N = 6-8) are sufficient to attain convergence in the property predictions versus supercell size. For formation energies, SQSs with N > 4 are found to reproduce the formation energies of the fully disordered phase within ~2.5 meV. For the simulation of the experimentally-synthesized TiNbCO2, we find convergence in structural parameters and elastic tensors at N ~ 6. We traced the convergence of the predictions to the convergence in the band structure-related properties via analysis of the electronic densities-of-states and the projected crystal overlap Hamilton population. Our findings suggest that modest sized SQSs would reproduce the properties of disordered MXene alloys. The results should help guide the investigations of structure-property relationships in other disordered 2D materials as well.",3
Exact equations for averaged electromagnetic field and its fluctuations at wave multiple scattering by plane periodic array of magnetic microelements.,"Electromagnetic wave (EM) multiple scattering by a plane periodic array of magnetic microelements in free space is considered analytically by natural subdividing of the EM wave into the averaged and fluctuation components. Each magnetic element is characterized by magnetic susceptibility tensor and shape. An exact Dyson integral equation is derived for the magnetic field Floquet-Bloch amplitude in-plane averaged over an array unit cell. The mass operator of the Dyson equation is expressed via the T-scattering operator of the array unit cell that satisfies a type of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. We showed that magnetic field fluctuations are generated by the Bragg-Laue diffraction of an averaged magnetic field on the periodic array and are described inside the array as waves propagating with the Laue wave vectors equal to the difference between the in-plane wave vector of the incident magnetic field and the reciprocal lattice wave vector. We derived, for the first time, an exact quadrature to calculate magnetic field fluctuations from their averaged value. These general results are illustrated by a simple Born approximation. In particular, we revealed a mechanism of discrete waveguide excitation by an incident plane EM wave via the averaged EM wave Brag-Laue diffraction on the magnetic microelement array in the quasi-static approach when the wavelength of incident EM is much larger than the sizes of magnetic elements and periods of the array. The mode energy excitation coefficient at normal incidence of the plane EM wave on the array is evaluated.",3
Second-harmonic generation as a probe for structural and electronic properties of buried GaP/Si(0 0 1) interfaces.,Optical second-harmonic generation is demonstrated to be a sensitive probe of the buried interface between the lattice-matched semiconductors gallium phosphide and silicon with (0 0 1) orientation. Ex situ rotational anisotropy measurements on GaP/Si heterostructures show a strong isotropic component of the second-harmonic response not present for pure Si(0 0 1) or GaP(0 0 1). The strength of the overlaying anisotropic response directly correlates with the quality of the interface as determined by atomically resolved scanning transmission electron microscopy. Systematic comparison of samples fabricated under different growth conditions in metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy reveals that the anisotropy for different polarization combinations can be used as a selective fingerprint for the occurrence of anti-phase domains and twins. This all-optical technique can be applied as an in situ and non-invasive monitor even during growth.,3
Edge-insensitive magnetism and half metallicity in graphene nanoribbons.,"Realizing magnetism in graphene nanostructures is a decade-long challenge. The magnetic edge state and half metallicity in zigzag graphene nanoribbons are particularly promising (Son et al 2006 Nature 444 347). However, its experimental realization has been hindered by the stringent requirement of the mono-hydrogenated zigzag edge. Using first-principle calculations, we predict that free-carrier doping can overcome this challenge and realize ferromagnetism and half-metallicity in narrow graphene nanoribbons of general types of edge structures. This magnetism exists within the density range of gate-doping experiments (~10(13) cm(-2)) and has large spin polarization energy up to 17 meV per carrier, which induces a Zeeman splitting equivalent to an external magnetic field of a few hundred Tesla. Moreover, we trace the formation of this edge-insensitive magnetism to the quantum confinement of the electronic state near the band edge and reveal the scaling law of magnetism versus the ribbon width. Our findings suggest that combining doping with quantum confinement could be a general tool to realize transition-metal-free magnetism in light-element nanostructures.",3
Structures and magnetic properties of small [Formula: see text] and Co n-1Cr(+) (n = 3-5) clusters.,"Small cobalt clusters [Formula: see text] and their single chromium atom doped counterparts Co n-1Cr(+) (n = 3-5) were studied mass spectrometrically by measuring the infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectra of the corresponding argon tagged complexes. The geometric and electronic structures of the [Formula: see text] and Co n-1Cr(+) (n = 3-5) clusters as well as their Ar complexes were optimized by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The obtained lowest energy structures were confirmed by comparing the IRMPD spectra of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] (n = 3-5, m = 3 and 4) with the corresponding calculated IR spectra. The calculations reveal that the doped Co n-1Cr(+) clusters retain the geometric structures of the most stable [Formula: see text] clusters. However, the coupling of the local magnetic moments within the clusters is altered in a size-dependent way: the Cr atom is ferromagnetically coupled in Co2Cr(+) and Co3Cr(+), while it is antiferromagnetically coupled in Co4Cr(+).",3
First-principles calculations and Raman scattering evidence for local symmetry lowering in rhombohedral ilmenite: temperature- and pressure-dependent studies.,"ATiO3-type materials may exist in two different crystalline forms: the perovskite and ilmenite. While many papers have devoted their attention to evaluating the structural properties of the perovskite phase, the structural stability of the ilmenite one still remains unsolved. Here, we present our results based on the lattice dynamics and first-principles calculations (density functional theory) of the CdTiO3 ilmenite phase, which are confronted with experimental data obtained through micro Raman spectroscopy that is a very good tool to probe the local crystal structure. Additional Raman bands, which are not foreseen from group-theory for the ilmenite rhombohedral structure, appeared in both low temperature (under vacuum condition) and high-pressure (at room temperature) spectra. The behavior can be explained by considering the local loss of inversion symmetry operation which reduces the overall space group from [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]) to [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]). Our results can also be extended to other ilmenite-type compositions.",3
Crystallographic orientation errors in mechanical exfoliation.,"We evaluate the effect of mechanical exfoliation of van der Waals materials on crystallographic orientations of the resulting flakes. Flakes originating from a single crystal of graphite, whose orientation is confirmed using STM, are studied using facet orientations and electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD). While facets exhibit a wide distribution of angles after a single round of exfoliation ([Formula: see text]), EBSD shows that the true crystallographic orientations are more narrowly distributed ([Formula: see text]), and facets have an approximately [Formula: see text] error from the true orientation. Furthermore, we find that the majority of graphite fractures are along armchair lines, and that the cleavage process results in an increase of the zigzag lines portion. Our results place values on the rotation caused by a single round of the exfoliation process, and suggest that when a 1-2 degree precision is necessary, the orientation of a flake can be gauged by the orientation of the macroscopic single crystal from which it was exfoliated.",3
Raman spectra and structural peculiarities of TeO2-TeO3 mixed oxides.,"Raman spectra of the mixed crystalline oxides of the (1 - x)TeO2 + xTeO3 (x = 0, (1/4), (1/2), 1) series were recorded and simulated by using the DFT calculations. Good agreement between observed and calculated Raman spectra makes it possible to establish unambiguous assignment for all prominent Raman lines. This result gives an insight into relations between structural peculiarities and observed spectral features for the crystals promising as nonlinear optical materials. Highlights * Several mixed TeO2-TeO3 crystals were synthesized by solid-state chemistry * DFT calculations well describe structures and phonon spectra of TeO2-TeO3 oxides * Raman lines can be assigned to internal vibrations of TeO4 and TeO6 polyhedrons * Observed Raman bands can be used as fingerprints of different structural units.",3
Sub-gap optical response in the Kitaev spin-liquid candidate alpha-RuCl3.,"We report detailed optical experiments on the layered compound alpha-RuCl3 focusing on the THz and sub-gap optical response across the structural phase transition from the monoclinic high-temperature to the rhombohedral low-temperature structure, where the stacking sequence of the molecular layers is changed. This type of phase transition is characteristic for a variety of tri-halides crystallizing in a layered honeycomb-type structure and so far is unique, as the low-temperature phase exhibits the higher symmetry. One motivation is to unravel the microscopic nature of THz and spin-orbital excitations via a study of temperature and symmetry-induced changes. The optical studies are complemented by thermal expansion experiments. We document a number of highly unusual findings: A characteristic two-step hysteresis of the structural phase transition, accompanied by a dramatic change of the reflectivity. A complex dielectric loss spectrum in the THz regime, which could indicate remnants of Kitaev physics. Orbital excitations, which cannot be explained based on recent models, and an electronic excitation, which appears in a narrow temperature range just across the structural phase transition. Despite significant symmetry changes across the monoclinic to rhombohedral phase transition and a change of the stacking sequence, phonon eigenfrequencies and the majority of spin-orbital excitations are not strongly influenced. Obviously, the symmetry of a single molecular layer determines the eigenfrequencies of most of these excitations. Only one mode at THz frequencies, which becomes suppressed in the high-temperature monoclinic phase and one phonon mode experience changes in symmetry and stacking. Finally, from this combined terahertz, far- and mid-infrared study we try to shed some light on the so far unsolved low energy (<1 eV) electronic structure of the ruthenium 4d (5) electrons in alpha-RuCl3.",3
Charge self-consistent many-body corrections using optimized projected localized orbitals.,"In order for methods combining ab initio density-functional theory and many-body techniques to become routinely used, a flexible, fast, and easy-to-use implementation is crucial. We present an implementation of a general charge self-consistent scheme based on projected localized orbitals in the projector augmented wave framework in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package. We give a detailed description on how the projectors are optimally chosen and how the total energy is calculated. We benchmark our implementation in combination with dynamical mean-field theory: first we study the charge-transfer insulator NiO using a Hartree-Fock approach to solve the many-body Hamiltonian. We address the advantages of the optimized against non-optimized projectors and furthermore find that charge self-consistency decreases the dependence of the spectral function-especially the gap-on the double counting. Second, using continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo we study a monolayer of SrVO3, where strong orbital polarization occurs due to the reduced dimensionality. Using total-energy calculation for structure determination, we find that electronic correlations have a non-negligible influence on the position of the apical oxygens, and therefore on the thickness of the single SrVO3 layer.",3
Strong metal-support interactions impart activity in the oxygen reduction reaction: Au monolayer on Mo2C (MXene).,"The rational design of low-cost, high-efficiency, corrosion-resistant and persistent-activity oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts is a common goal for the large-scale application of fuel cells. Inspired by the excellent characteristics of MXenes when used as substrate materials and recent experiments of depositing metal nanoparticles on MXenes, we systematically investigated monolayer metal thin films decorated by Mo2C (MXene) (MML/Mo2C, M = Cu, Pd, Pt, Ag and Au) as ORR catalysts using density functional theory. According to the stability and adsorption properties, we speculate that AuML/Mo2C possesses outstanding ORR performance and enhanced durability in comparison with Pt/C catalysts. The ORR on AuML/Mo2C proceeds through a four-electron reduction pathway with comparable or even better activity than Pt(1 0 0), Pt(1 1 1) and commercial Pt/C catalysts both kinetically and thermodynamically. Strong metal-support interactions give rise to larger electronic perturbations in the supported Au monolayer in contact with Mo2C, which strengthen the adsorption of oxygen-containing species and enhance the catalytic activity. Our current results indicate that AuML/Mo2C is a promising ORR catalyst candidate to replace precious Pt/C catalysts due to its good stability, enhanced durability, low cost and high activity. We hope our results will inspire more experimental and theoretical research to further design, explore and apply advanced metal monolayer-supported MXene composites.",3
Origin of the Fermi arcs in cuprates: a dual role of quasiparticle and pair excitations.,"Angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) mesurements in cuprates have given key information on the temperature and angle dependence of the gap (d-wave order parameter, Fermi arcs and pseudogap). We show that these features can be understood in terms of a Bose condensation of interacting pairons (preformed hole pairs which form in their local antiferromagnetic environment). Starting from the basic properties of the pairon wavefunction, we derive the corresponding k-space spectral function. The latter explains the variation of the ARPES spectra as a function of temperature and angle up to T (*), the onset temperature of pairon formation. While Bose excitations dominate at the antinode, the fermion excitations dominate around the nodal direction, giving rise to the Fermi arcs at finite temperature. This dual role is the key feature distinguishing cuprate from conventional superconductivity.",3
Superconducting-state properties and electronic band structure calculations of a noncentrosymmetric Th7Ni3 compound.,"Superconducting-state properties of a noncentrosymmetric Th7Ni3 compound have been investigated using magnetic, electrical resistivity and specific heat measurements as well as by electronic band structure calculations. The study reveals that the studied compound is a dirty type-II superconductor with [Formula: see text] K and a weak electron-phonon coupling [Formula: see text]. Moreover, in contrast to an exotic superconductivity observed previously in Th7Fe3 and Th7Co3, data reported in this paper give clear evidence that Th7Ni3 is a conventional single-gap superconductor. The experimental results are supported by DFT calculations of the electronic band structure, density of states, electron localization functions and Fermi surfaces which were performed using the full-potential linear muffin-tin-orbital and full-potential linearized augmented plane wave methods. Theoretical data show that asymmetric spin-orbit coupling in Th7Ni3 is quite small; hence the electronic band structure of this compound is weakly affected by the spin-orbit effects. We have determined fundamental parameters of Th7Ni3 and compared the superconducting properties with other Th7T3 (T = Fe, Co and Ru) compounds.",3
Thermal transport studies on charge density wave materials LaPt2Si2 and PrPt2Si2.,"We measured the thermal properties of polycrystalline samples of LaPt2Si2 and PrPt2Si2 using thermopower (S) along with thermal conductivity (kappa) in the temperature range 10 K-300 K. Significant anomalies related to charge density waves (CDW) around 112 K and 88 K respectively have been observed in [Formula: see text] in both systems. Analysis of thermopower by a two band model suggests that the observations are consistent with a reduction of electron charge density. A change in slope accompanied by a drop in the value of thermal conductivity has been observed around T CDW in case of LaPt2Si2. Analysis of thermal conductivity of this material suggests that the CDW mainly affects electronic contribution to thermal transport. Only a slight change of slope has been detected in temperature dependent thermal conductivity in the case of PrPt2Si2 around T CDW, while its resistivity shows a clear anomaly which shows that electronic part of thermal conductivity is mainly influenced by the CDW in this case also. It is interesting to note that the lattice contribution to thermal conductivity remains unaffected by the CDWs in both materials.",3
"Unusual optical isotropy in anisotropic alkali metal perchlorates MClO 4 (M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs).","We report a detailed study on structural, vibrational, born effective charge (BEC), electronic and optical properties of the alkali metal perchlorates, MClO 4(M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) based on Density functional theory. The ground state calculations are done using plane wave pseudopotential method by including dispersion corrected method for more accurate prediction of structural and vibrational frequencies. The calculated lattice parameters and bond lengths are consistent with the experimental values. Further, detailed interpretation of the zone centered vibrational modes yields good concurrence between the experimental and calculated values. There is a decrease in wavelength with an increase in frequency (blue shift) from Li --> Na --> K --> Rb --> Cs. The obtained BEC shows the mixed covalent-ionic character of the compounds. The electronic and optical properties are calculated using the full potential linearized augmented plane wave method by TB-mBJ potential. The TB-mBJ band structure shows indirect band gap with O-2p states dominating in the valence band. In spite of anisotropic structure, alkali metal perchlorates are found to possess optical isotropy.",3
Realistic estimates of superconducting properties for the cuprates: reciprocal-space diagrammatic expansion combined with variational approach.,"We propose a systematic approach to the systems of correlated electrons, the so-called [Formula: see text]-DE-GWF method, based on reciprocal-space ([Formula: see text]-resolved) diagrammatic expansion of the variational Gutzwiller-type wave function for parametrized models of correlated fermions. The present approach, in contrast to either variational Monte-Carlo (VMC), or the recently developed real-space diagrammatic expansion of the Gutzwiller-type wave function (direct-space DE-GWF technique), is applicable directly in the thermodynamic limit and thus is suitable for describing selected singular features of the wave-vector-dependent quantities. We employ the [Formula: see text]-DE-GWF method to extract the non-analytic part of the two leading moments of the fermion spectral-density function across the (two-dimensional) Brillouin zone for the Hubbard model and away from the half-filling. Those moments are used to evaluate the nodal quasiparticle velocities and their spectral weights in the correlated superconducting state. The two velocities determined in that manner exhibit scaling with the electron concentration qualitatively different from that obtained earlier for the excited states of the high-T c cuprates within the projected quasi-particle ansatz, and the results are in a very good quantitative agreement with experimental data if interpreted as those characterizing the spectrum below and above the observed kink. We provide a detailed discussion of the two gaps and two excitation branches (two velocities) appearing naturally within our DE-GWF approach. The two separate sets of characteristics distinguish the renormalized quasiparticle states very close to the Fermi surface from the deeper correlated-state properties. Also, an enhancement of the [Formula: see text]-dependent magnetic susceptibility is shown to contain a spin-fluctuation contribution within our language. Finally, the [Formula: see text]-DE-GWF approach is compared to both the VMC and real-space DE-GWF results for the cases of Hubbard and t-J-U models.",3
The effect of energy-dependent electron scattering on thermoelectric transport in novel topological semimetal CoSi.,"Cobalt monosilicide and its solid solutions with Fe or Ni crystallize in B20 cubic noncentrosymmetric structure. These compounds have long been known as promising thermoelectric materials. Recently it was revealed, that they also have unconventional electronic topology. This renewed interest to the investigation of their transport properties. In order to improve theoretical description of thermoelectric transport in these compounds, we take into account electron scattering beyond commonly used constant relaxation time approximation. Using first principle calculations, we investigate the scattering of charge carriers by phonons and point defects. The dependence of the scattering rate on the energy correlates with that for the total density of states. This implies that in this material not only the intraband, but also the interband scattering is important, especially for bands with low density of states. The Seebeck coefficient and the electrical resistivity of CoSi and of dilute solid solutions Co1-x M x Si (M = Fe or Ni, x < 0.1) are calculated as a function of temperature and the alloy composition. We show that the account of strong energy dependence of relaxation time is important for the description of experimentally observed rapid increase of the resistivity and qualitative change of its temperature dependence with the substitution of cobalt for iron, as well as for the description of the magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient, its temperature and composition dependence.",3
Structural and magnetic properties of bulk Mn2PtSn.,"Interplay between structural and magnetic order parameters is one of the key mechanisms of tuning properties of materials intended for device applications in spintronics. Here, using density functional calculations, we study combined effects of tetragonal distortion and non-collinear magnetic order in Mn2PtSn. We show that this material has two energetically close energy minimums corresponding to tetragonal lattice. In one of these phases, Mn2PtSn exhibits ferrimagnetic order with nearly fully compensated total magnetic moment, while in the other phase that corresponds to the lowest energy, a non-collinear magnetic arrangement emerges, with very large canting angle of the Mn local magnetic moments. The non-collinear alignment is explained through the interplay of exchange couplings between nearest and next nearest neighbor Mn atoms. Results are compared with those reported in recent literature, both experimental and theoretical.",3
Multifunctional two-dimensional semiconductors SnP3: universal mechanism of layer-dependent electronic phase transition.,"Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors SnP3 are predicted, from first-principles calculations, to host moderate band gaps (0.72 eV for monolayer and 1.07 eV for bilayer), ultrahigh carrier mobility ( approximately 10(4) cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) for bilayer), strong absorption coefficients ( approximately 10(5) cm(-1)) and good stability. Moreover, the band gap can be modulated from an indirect character into a direct one via strain engineering. For experimental accessibility, the calculated exfoliation energies of monolayer and bilayer SnP3 are smaller than those of the common arsenic-type honeycomb structures GeP3 and InP3. More importantly, a semiconductor-to-metal transition is discovered with the layer number N > 2. We demonstrate, in remarkable contrast to the previous understandings, that such phase transition is largely driven by the correlation between lone-pair electrons of interlayer Sn and P atoms. This mechanism is universal for analogues phase transitions in arsenic-type honeycomb structures (GeP3, InP3 and SnP3).",3
Inconsistency between linearized Thomas-Fermi approximation and electron-ionized impurity scattering rate in the first Born approximation.,"We show that by computing the electron-impurity scattering rate at the first order via Fermi's golden rule, and assuming that the localized impurity potential is of Yukawa form, one obtains a wave vector transfer distribution which is inconsistent with the finite temperature linearized Thomas-Fermi approximation for n-type semiconductors. Our previous findings show that this is not the case for the carrier nondegenerate dynamics, because the average wave vector transferred being in general negligible in this regime. Moreover, we examine the behavior of the electron-impurity differential cross-sections in the first Born approximation for relevant values of the wave vector transfer. We find that in the majority of collisions, the scattering probabilities differ at the most by 1% from the estimates computed by means of the impurity potential at random phase approximation level.",3
Phase transitions of the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model with a long-range hopping.,"The interacting Kane-Mele model with a long-range hopping is studied using analytical method. The original Kane-Mele model is defined on a honeycomb lattice. In the work, we introduce a four-lattice-constant range hopping and the on-site Hubbard interaction into the model and keep its lattice structure unchanged. From the single-particle energy spectrum, we obtain the critical strength of the long-range hopping t L at which the topological transition occurs in the non-interacting limit of the model and our results show that it is independent of the spin-orbit coupling. After introducing the Hubbard interaction, we investigate the Mott transition and the magnetic transition of the generalized strongly correlated Kane-Mele model using the slave-rotor mean field theory and Hartree-Fock mean field theory respectively. In the small long-range hopping region, it is a correlated quantum spin Hall state below the Mott transition, while a topological Mott insulator above the Mott transition. By comparing the energy band of spin degree of freedom with the one of electrons in non-interacting limit, we find a condition for the t L-driven topological transition. Under the condition, critical values of t L at which the topological transition occurs are obtained numerically from seven self-consistency equations in both regions below and above the Mott transition. Influences of the interaction and the spin-orbit coupling on the topological transition are discussed in this work. Finally, we show complete phase diagrams of the generalized interacting topological model at some strength of spin-orbital coupling.",3
Electronic structure of the Ge/Si(1 0 5) hetero-interface: an ARPES and DFT study.,"We present a joint experimental and theoretical study of the electronic properties of the rebonded-step reconstructed Ge/Si(1 0 5) surface which is the main strained face found on Ge/Si(0 0 1) quantum dots and is considered a prototypical model system for surface strain relaxation in heteroepitaxial growth. Using a vicinal surface as a model system for obtaining a stable single-domain film structure with large terraces and rebonded-step surface termination, we realized an extended and ordered Ge/Si planar hetero-junction suitable for direct study with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. At the coverage of four Ge monolayers photoemission spectroscopy reveals the presence of 2D surface and film bands displaying energy-momentum dispersion compatible with the 5 x 4 periodicity of the system. The good agreement between experiment and first-principles electronic structure calculations confirms the validity of the rebonded-step structural model. The direct observation of surface features within 1 eV below the valence band maximum corroborates previously reported analysis of the electronic and optical behavior of the Ge/Si hetero-interface.",3
Inhomogeneous dynamical mean-field theory of the small polaron problem.,"We present an inhomogeneous dynamical mean field theory (I-DMFT) that is suitable to investigate electron-lattice interactions in non-translationally invariant and/or inhomogeneous systems. The presented approach, whose only assumption is that of a local, site-dependent self-energy, recovers both the exact solution of an electron for a generic random tight-binding Hamiltonian in the non-interacting limit and the DMFT solution for the small polaron problem in translationally invariant systems. To illustrate its full capabilities, we use I-DMFT to study the effects of defects embedded on a two-dimensional surface. The computed maps of the local density of states reveal Friedel oscillations, whose periodicity is determined by the polaron mass. This can be of direct relevance for the interpretation of scanning-tunneling microscopy experiments on systems with sizable electron-lattice interactions. Overall, the easy numerical implementation of the method, yet full self-consistency, allows one to study problems in real-space that were previously difficult to access.",3
CHEERS: a tool for correlated hole-electron evolution from real-time simulations.,"We put forward a practical nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) scheme to perform real-time evolutions of many-body interacting systems driven out of equilibrium by external fields. CHEERS is a computational tool to solve the NEGF equation of motion in the so called generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz and it can be used for model systems as well as first-principles Hamiltonians. Dynamical correlation (or memory) effects are added to the Hartree-Fock dynamics through a many-body self-energy. Applications to time-dependent quantum transport, time-resolved photoabsorption and other ultrafast phenomena are discussed.",3
Metal and ligand effects on the stability and electronic properties of crystalline two-dimensional metal-benzenehexathiolate coordination compounds.,"The cohesive energy, phonon spectrum and quantum molecular-dynamic simulation have been used successively to determine whether the crystalline two-dimensional (2D) metal-benzenehexathiolate (M-BHT) coordination compounds are stable or not. The electronic structures of stable M-BHTs and the corresponding inorganic semiconducting materials have been compared. From the point of view of satisfying stoichiometric ratios and saturation of chemical bonds, we designed possible planar molecular structures and demonstrated that there may be two different 2D M-BHTs, i.e. group II-[Formula: see text] and group IV-[Formula: see text]. However, the cohesive energy calculation indicates that the group IV-[Formula: see text] coordination compound cannot be obtained by thermodynamic equilibrium growth. In contrast, [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] from the group II-[Formula: see text] have not only thermodynamic stability, but also dynamic stability due to their phonon spectrum with no imaginary frequency. Moreover, they are still the two most stable ones when the bridge atom S of ligand BHT is replaced by the other chalcogens of O, Se and Te. Further studies indicated that [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] both have room temperature dynamic stability and exhibit semiconducting. The exceptional stability and relatively narrow band gap make them advantageous over their inorganic counterparts. Our findings open opportunities to search for new 2D planar conducting coordination compound for organic electronic applications.",3
Higher-Order Topology in Bismuth.,"The mathematical field of topology has become a framework to describe the low-energy electronic structure of crystalline solids. A typical feature of a bulk insulating three-dimensional topological crystal are conducting two-dimensional surface states. This constitutes the topological bulk-boundary correspondence. Here, we establish that the electronic structure of bismuth, an element consistently described as bulk topologically trivial, is in fact topological and follows a generalized bulk-boundary correspondence of higher-order: not the surfaces of the crystal, but its hinges host topologically protected conducting modes. These hinge modes are protected against localization by time-reversal symmetry locally, and globally by the three-fold rotational symmetry and inversion symmetry of the bismuth crystal. We support our claim theoretically and experimentally. Our theoretical analysis is based on symmetry arguments, topological indices, first-principle calculations, and the recently introduced framework of topological quantum chemistry. We provide supporting evidence from two complementary experimental techniques. With scanning-tunneling spectroscopy, we probe the unique signatures of the rotational symmetry of the one-dimensional states located at step edges of the crystal surface. With Josephson interferometry, we demonstrate their universal topological contribution to the electronic transport. Our work establishes bismuth as a higher-order topological insulator.",3
Structural properties of silicon-germanium and germanium-silicon core-shell nanowires.,"Core-shell nanowires made of Si and Ge can be grown experimentally with excellent control for different sizes of both core and shell. We have studied the structural properties of Si/Ge and Ge/Si core-shell nanowires aligned along the [Formula: see text] direction, with diameters up to 10.2 nm and varying core to shell ratios, using linear scaling density functional theory. We show that Vegard's law, which is often used to predict the axial lattice constant, can lead to an error of up to 1%, underlining the need for a detailed ab initio atomistic treatment of the nanowire structure. We analyse the character of the intrinsic strain distribution and show that, regardless of the composition or bond direction, the Si core or shell always expands. In contrast, the strain patterns in the Ge shell or core are highly sensitive to the location, composition and bond direction. The highest strains are found at heterojunction interfaces and the surfaces of the nanowires. This detailed understanding of the atomistic structure and strain paves the way for studies of the electronic properties of core-shell nanowires and investigations of doping and structure defects.",3
Giant negative electrocaloric effect induced by domain transition in the strained ferroelectric thin film.,"Electrocaloric effect (ECE) of ferroelectric materials is highly dependent on the domain transition with temperature. The effect of domain transition on the ECE of PbTiO3 (PTO) ferroelectric thin films subjected to different mismatch strains is investigated by a phase field model based on the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation. The simulation results demonstrate that there exists a multiple-to-single domain transition induced by temperature in the PTO thin film. The domain transition occurs at a temperature that is much lower than Curie temperature, resulting in a giant negative ECE in the strained ferroelectric thin film. Furthermore, the domain transition temperature and the corresponding negative ECE can be tuned by the magnitude of mismatch strain. The present study suggests an effective way to obtain a giant negative ECE by domain transitions in the strained ferroelectric thin film.",3
Torsion-induced vortex switching and skyrmion-like state in ferroelectric nanodisks.,"The controllability of vortex state in ferroelectric nanodisks under the effect of external torsion is investigated in this work based on phase-field simulation. We discover a novel Bloch skyrmion-like state in ferroelectric nanodisks due to the combining effect of the torsion and the depolarization field. Moreover, a new strategy is proposed to achieve deterministic switching of the vortex chirality in the ferroelectric nanodisks. On the one hand, if a fixed external electric field is applied to the nanodisk, the vortex chirality can be switched by the torsion force. On the other hand, if we apply a fixed torsion force to the nanodisk, the vortex chirality can be readily switched by an external electric field. The feasibility of both mechanical and electrical switching of the vortex in the ferroelectric nanodisks is based on the trilinear coupling between the toroidization, polarization and shear strain of the system. The influences of temperature, electric field, torsion, and size of the nanodisk on the control of the vortex state are further revealed. Our findings shed light on the practical control and application of ferroelectric dipole vortices.",3
Protein refractive index increment is determined by conformation as well as composition.,"The refractive index gradient of the eye lens is controlled by the concentration and distribution of its component crystallin proteins, which are highly enriched in polarizable amino acids. The current understanding of the refractive index increment ([Formula: see text]) of proteins is described using an additive model wherein the refractivity and specific volume of each amino acid type contributes according to abundance in the primary sequence. Here we present experimental measurements of [Formula: see text] for crystallins from the human lens and those of aquatic animals under uniform solvent conditions. In all cases, the measured values are much higher than those predicted from primary sequence alone, suggesting that structural factors also contribute to protein refractive index.",3
Surface states of gapped electron systems and semi-metals.,"With a generic lattice model for electrons occupying a semi-infinite crystal with a hard surface, we study the eigenstates of the system with a bulk band gap (or the gap with nodal points). The exact solution to the wave functions of scattering states is obtained. From the scattering states, we derive the criterion for the existence of surface states. The wave functions and the energy of the surface states are then determined. We obtain a connection between the wave functions of the bulk states and the surface states. For electrons in a system with time-reversal symmetry, with this connection, we rigorously prove the correspondence between the change of Kramers degeneracy of the surface states and the bulk time-reversal Z 2 invariant. The theory is applicable to systems of (topological) insulators, superconductors, and semi-metals. Examples for solving the edge states of electrons with/without the spin-orbit interactions in graphene with a hard zigzag edge and that in a two-dimensional d-wave superconductor with a ([Formula: see text]) edge are given in appendices.",3
Unconventional field-effect transistor composed of electrons floating on liquid helium.,"We report on an unconventional macroscopic field effect transistor composed of electrons floating above the surface of superfluid helium. With this device unique transport regimes are realized in which the charge density of the electron layer can be controlled in a manner not possible in other material systems. In particular, we are able to manipulate the collective behavior of the electrons to produce a highly non-uniform, but precisely controlled, charge density to reveal a negative source-drain current. This behavior can be understood by considering the propagation of damped charge oscillations along a transmission line formed by the inhomogeneous sheet of two-dimensional electrons above, and between, the source and drain electrodes of the transistor.",3
Importance of spin current generation and detection by spin injection and the spin Hall effect for lateral spin valve performance.,"Lateral spin valves are attractive device geometries where functional spin currents can be generated and detected by various mechanisms, such as spin injection and the direct and the inverse spin Hall effect. To understand the mechanisms behind these effects better, as well as their potential for application in devices, we combine multiple mechanisms in multi-terminal Pt-Py-Cu lateral spin valves: we generate pure spin currents in the copper spin conduit both via the spin Hall effect in platinum and electric spin injection from permalloy and detect signals both via conventional non-local detection and via the inverse spin Hall effect in the same device at variable temperatures. Differences are observed, which we explain by the different spin injection and detection mechanisms, revealing their importance for the temperature dependence, which is not just governed by the spin transport in the conduit as previously claimed. By determining a different sensitivity of the observed effects on the interfaces, we highlight the importance of the exact current path for the device operation.",3
In situ and ex situ NMR for battery research.,"A rechargeable battery stores readily convertible chemical energy to operate a variety of devices such as mobile phones, laptop computers, electric automobiles, etc. A battery generally consists of four components: a cathode, an anode, a separator and electrolytes. The properties of these components jointly determine the safety, the lifetime, and the electrochemical performance. They also include, but are not limited to, the power density and the charge as well as the recharge time/rate associated with a battery system. An extensive amount of research is dedicated to understanding the physical and chemical properties associated with each of the four components aimed at developing new generations of battery systems with greatly enhanced safety and electrochemical performance at a significantly reduced cost for large scale applications. Advanced characterization tools are a prerequisite to fundamentally understanding battery materials. Considering that some of the key electrochemical processes can only exist under in situ conditions, which can only be captured under working battery conditions when electric wires are attached and current and voltage are applied, make in situ detection critical. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), a non-invasive and atomic specific tool, is capable of detecting all phases, including crystalline, amorphous, liquid and gaseous phases simultaneously and is ideal for in situ detection on a working battery system. Ex situ NMR on the other hand can provide more detailed molecular or structural information on stable species with better spectral resolution and sensitivity. The combination of in situ and ex situ NMR, thus, offers a powerful tool for investigating the detailed electrochemistry in batteries.",3
Nanowire based bioprobes for electrical monitoring of electrogenic cells.,"The continuous miniaturization of electronic components and the emergence of nano-biotechnology has opened new perspectives to monitor electrical activities at the single cell level. Here, we describe the creation of very high surface-to-volume ratio passive devices (vertical nanowire probes) using large-scale fabrication process, allowing to follow the electrical activity of mammalian neurons. Based on conventional silicon processing, the silicon nanowires were silicided in platinum in order to improve their electrochemical performances and to guarantee their biocompatibility. Very high signal to noise ratio was achieved (up to 2000) when measuring spontaneous action potentials. Moreover, this bio-platform was used to record the impact of various bio-chemical and electrical stimulations on neuronal activity. To conclude, this study proposes a thorough comparison of the characteristics and performances of these new nanowire-based nanoprobes with the main alternative systems published up to now.",3
Laser-induced ultrafast transport and demagnetization at the earliest time: first-principles and real-time investigation.,"It is generally believed that there are at least two ways to use an ultrafast laser pulse to demagnetize a magnetic sample. One is to directly photo-demagnetize the system through spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and the other is to utilize ultrafast hot electron transport without SOC. The challenge is that these two processes are entangled on the same time scale. While the experimental results have been inconclusive, theoretical investigations are even scarcer, beyond those earlier studies based on spin superdiffusion. For instance, we do not even know how fast electrons move under laser excitation and how far they move. Here we carry out a first-principles time-dependent calculation to investigate how fast electrons actually move under laser excitation and how large the electron transport affects demagnetization on the shortest time scale. To take into account the transport effect, we implement the intraband transition in our theory. In the bulk fcc Ni, we find the effect of the spin transport on the demagnetization is extremely small, no more than 1%. The collective electron velocity in Ni is 0.4 A fs(-1), much smaller than the Fermi velocity, and the collective displacement is no more than 0.1 A. But this does not mean that electrons do not travel fast; instead we find that electron velocities at two opposite crystal momenta cancel each other. We follow the Gamma-X line and find a huge dispersion in the velocities in the crystal momentum space. In the Fe/W(1 1 0) thin film, the overall demagnetization is larger than Ni, and the Fermi velocity is higher than Ni. However, the effect of the spin transport is still small in the Fe/W(1 1 0) thin film. Based on our numerical results and existing experimental findings, we propose a different mechanism that can explain two latest experimental results. Our finding sheds new light on the effect of ballistic transport on demagnetization.",3
Manipulation of the magnetoresistance effect in a double-helix DNA.,"Magnetoresistance (R m) of a double-stranded (G:C) N DNA sandwiched between ferromagnetic electrodes has been studied using the transfer matrix method of the tight-binding model. A R m magnitude up to 72.5% for DNA in its natural structure is observed when the spin-orbit coupling with the helix spring geometry and a possible dephasing effect are taken into account. It can be greatly manipulated by stress or torque applied to the DNA with respect to its axis. In addition, the external voltage bias can also be used to efficiently control R m. The dependence of R m on the DNA length in a decaying oscillation form is observed.",3
"Large orbital magnetic moments of small, free cobalt cluster ions Co[Formula: see text] with n [Formula: see text].","The size dependent electronic structure and separate spin and orbital magnetic moments of free Co[Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]) cluster ions have been investigated by x-ray absorption and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy in a cryogenic ion trap. A very large orbital magnetic moment of [Formula: see text] per atom was determined for Co[Formula: see text], which is one order of magnitude larger than in the bulk metal. Large orbital magnetic moments per atom of approximately 1 [Formula: see text] were also found for Co[Formula: see text], Co[Formula: see text], and Co[Formula: see text]. The orbital contribution to the total magnetic moment shows a non-monotonic cluster size dependence: The orbital contribution increases from a local minimum at n = 2 to a local maximum at n = 5 and then decreases with increasing cluster size. The 3d spin magnetic moment per atom is nearly constant and is solely defined by the number of 3d holes which shows that the 3d majority spin states are fully occupied, that is, 3d hole spin polarization is 100%.",3
Asymmetric alloy formation at the Fe-on-Ti and Ti-on-Fe interfaces.,"The Fe-on-Ti and Ti-on-Fe interfaces were studied experimentally by Mossbauer spectroscopy (MS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and x-ray reflectometry (XRR) on Ti/Fe/Ti trilayers grown on Si(1 1 1) substrates by vacuum evaporation. The nanoscale structure and composition were explored in cross sections using TEM, the layer structure and the interface widths by specular x-ray reflectometry. MS was applied to identify the interface alloy phases and to determine the pure and alloyed Fe layer fractions. The experimental results were compared with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of layer growth on Fe or Ti underlayers of different orientations. The concentration distributions provided by MD simulations show an asymmetry at the interfaces in the layer growth direction. The transition is atomically sharp at the Ti-on-Fe interface for the (0 0 1) and (1 1 0) crystallographic orientations of the Fe underlayer, while it spreads over a few atomic layers for Fe(1 1 1) underlayer and for all studied Ti underlayer orientations at the Fe-on-Ti interface. MS and XRR data on Ti/Fe/Ti trilayers confirm the asymmetry between the bottom and top Fe interface, but the inferred interface widths considerable exceed those deduced from the MD simulations.",3
"The relationship between the coherent size, binding energy and dissociation dynamics of charge transfer excitons at organic interfaces.","At organic semiconductor interfaces, an electron and a hole can be bound Coulombically to form an interfacial charge transfer (CT) exciton. It is still under debate how a CT exciton can overcome its strong binding and dissociate into free carriers. Experimentally, capturing the evolution of the CT exciton on time (fs-ps) and length scales (nm) in which the dissociation process occurs is challenging. To overcome this challenge, time-resolved two photon photoemission spectroscopy is used to measure the binding energies and electronic coherent sizes of a series of CT states at organic interfaces, and capture the temporal dynamics of these CT excitons after their excitation. Using zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc)/fullerene (C60) interface as a model system, it is shown that the interfacial CT process first populates a hot CT state with a coherent size of ~4 nm. Hot and delocalized CT excitons subsequently relax into CT excitons with lower energies and smaller coherent sizes. To correlate the CT exciton properties with the dissociation efficiency, we develop a method that exploits graphene field effect transistors to probe the rate and yield of free carrier generation at the interface. Our results show that exciton dissociation can be more efficient if one can extract electrons from the hot and delocalized CT state. We propose a cascade structure that would serve this purpose.",3
"Crystalline thin films of silica: modelling, structure and energetics.","The static structural and energetic properties of thin crystalline films ( approximately two dimensional bilayers) of silica, SiO2, are modelled. Two potential models are considered in which the key interactions are described by purely harmonic terms and more complex electrostatic terms, respectively. The relative energetic stability of two potential crystalline forms, which represent alternative ways of tiling two dimensional space, is discussed. Coherent and incoherent distortions are introduced to the simulated crystals and their effects considered in terms of the ring structure formed by the Si atoms. The spatial relationship between distorted rings is analysed. An experimentally-observed single crystalline configuration is considered for comparison throughout.",3
Wave nature of conduction electrons in amorphous Co90Sc10 and Fe90Sc10 alloys.,"The resistivity of amorphous Fe90Sc10 and Co90Sc10 alloys can be described well in terms of a simple model based on the wave character of electrons and their associated tunnelling over the temperature ranges ~1.9 K to 135 K and ~1.9 K to 12 K respectively. The extended range of agreement between experiment and theory for amorphous Fe90Sc10 is linked with its relatively small mean free path of [Formula: see text] = 0.32 nm, thus allowing electron waves to tunnel between clusters. On the other hand the restricted region of tunnelling of electron waves for amorphous Co90Sc10 alloys is linked with its relatively large mean free path of [Formula: see text] = 0.48 nm which restricts the ability for tunnelling between clusters while enabling electron waves to tunnel between different regions with a cluster.",3
Enhanced indirect-to-direct inter-valley scattering in germanium under tensile strain for improving the population of electrons in direct valley.,"A theoretical model is proposed to analyze the inter-valley electron transferring between direct Gamma and indirect L valleys, which sheds light on the electron conduction dynamics in (0 0 1) tensile strained Ge. Inter-valley scattering is included to calculate average scattering time between Gamma and L valleys based on a time-dependent Hamiltonian describing the electron-phonon interaction. Numerical results indicate that enhanced indirect-to-direct inter-valley scattering and reduced direct-to-indirect inter-valley scattering are reliable by introducing tensile strain in Ge material. The population ratio of electrons in Gamma and L valleys in strained Ge will increase one to two orders of magnitude compared to the model without the inter-valley scattering. The results offer fundamental understanding of phonon engineering for further improvement of performance in strained germanium light sources.",3
Atomistic modeling of the infrared response of fullerenes under hydrostatic pressure.,"The anharmonic infrared spectrum of individual C60 and C70 fullerenes under hydrostatic pressure was theoretically computed by means of atomistic simulations. Using a tight-binding model for the fullerenes and a simple particle-based pressure-transmitting fluid, the structural and vibrational properties were determined at room temperature and up to 20 GPa. All properties generally exhibit relative variations that are linear with increasing pressure, but whose magnitude can be comparable to pure thermal effects. The bond length contraction usually agrees with existing results, and for C70 our approach manages to reproduce the occasionally negative pressure coefficient found for some low-frequency modes in experiments.",3
Suppression of structural instability in LaOBiS2-x Se x by Se substitution.,"Isovalent substitution of S by Se in LaOBiS2-x Se x has a substantial effect on its electronic structure and thermoelectric properties. To investigate the possible role of BiS2 structural instability, we have studied the local structure of LaOBiS2-x Se x ([Formula: see text]) using temperature dependent Bi L3-edge extended x-ray absorption fine structure measurements. The results reveal that the local structure of the two compounds is significantly different. The BiS2 sub-lattice is largely distorted in LaOBiS2 (x = 0.0), with two in-plane Bi-S1 distances separated by approximately 0.4 A instead LaOBiSSe (x = 1.0) showing much smaller local disorder with two in-plane Bi-Se distances in the plane being separated by approximately 0.2 A. Temperature dependent study shows that the two Bi-S1 distances are characterized by different bond strength in LaOBiS2 (x = 0.0) while it is similar for the Bi-Se distances in LaOBiSSe (x = 1.0). The out of plane Bi-S2 bond is harder in LaOBiSSe indicating that the structural instability of BiS2 layer has large effect on the out-of-plane atomic correlations. The results suggest that the local structure of LaOBiS2-x Se x is an important factor to describe differing electronic and thermal transport of the two compounds.",3
Correlation of Kondo effect and molecular conformation of the acceptor molecule in the TTF-TCNE charge transfer complex.,"A Kondo resonance has been observed on purely organic molecules in several combinations of charge transfer complexes on a metal surface. It has been regarded as a fingerprint of the transfer of one electron from the donor to the extended pi orbital of the acceptor's LUMO. Here, we investigate the stoichiometric checkerboard structure of tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) and tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) on a Au(1 1 1) surface using scanning tunneling and atomic force microscopy at 4.8 K. We find a bistable state of the TCNE molecules with distinct structural and electronic properties. The two states represent different conformations of the TCNE within the structure. One of them exhibits a Kondo resonance, whereas the other one does not, despite of both TCNE types being singly charged.",3
Spin qubits: spin relaxation in coupled quantum dots.,The spin-flip scattering mechanism in coupled self-assembled quantum dots made with InAs/GaAs with the use of realistic material parameters is theoretically and numerically investigated. The electron wave functions within the coupled system have been calculated by the 8-band strain dependent [Formula: see text] theory. The phonon coupling to electrons is described by deformation potential and piezoelectric acoustic phonons. First order perturbation theory has been employed to evaluate the spin relaxation rates and spin-flip time T1. The numerical results show that parameters like the interdot distance and the applied static magnetic field are of crucial importance in spin-flip mechanism. The spin relaxation time has been also studied by varying the lattice temperature and by showing the differences between the quantum computing operation temperature ([Formula: see text] K) and large temperatures.,3
"Water desorption from rapidly-heated metal oxide surfaces-first principles, molecular dynamics, and the Temkin isotherm.","Quantitative understanding and control of water and impurity desorption from steel surfaces are crucial for high-voltage, pulsed power, vacuum technology, catalysis, and environmental applications. We apply a suite of modeling techniques, ranging from electronic density functional theory, to classical molecular dynamics (MD) and grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) methods to study the thermodynamics and kinetics of fast water desorption from different surfaces of hematite Fe2O3 and Cr2O3. Water binding energies on chromium oxide are found to be higher than iron oxide at zero temperature. MD simulations are conducted on Fe2O3 surfaces using thermodynamically consistent initial water inventory deduced with GCMC. The resulting time- and temperature-dependent desorption profiles on the Fe2O3 [Formula: see text] surfaces show multi-water cooperative behavior which cannot be deduced from zero temperature predictions, but which are in reasonable agreement with simple Temkin isotherm model estimates if finite temperature effects are incorporated into the Temkin binding energy parameter. Qualitatively different desorption behaviors associated with the [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] facets are discussed.",3
Behavior of the breathing pyrochlore lattice Ba3Yb2Zn5O11 in applied magnetic field.,"The breathing pyrochlore lattice material Ba3Yb2Zn5O11 exists in the nearly decoupled limit, in contrast to most other well-studied breathing pyrochlore compounds. As a result, it constitutes a useful platform to benchmark theoretical calculations of exchange interactions in insulating Yb(3+) magnets. Here we study Ba3Yb2Zn5O11 at low temperatures in applied magnetic fields as a further probe of the physics of this model system. Experimentally, we consider the behavior of polycrystalline samples of Ba3Yb2Zn5O11 with a combination of inelastic neutron scattering and heat capacity measurements down to 75 mK and up to fields of 10 T. Consistent with previous work, inelastic neutron scattering finds a level crossing near 3 T, but no significant dispersion of the spin excitations is detected up to the highest applied fields. Refinement of the theoretical model previously determined at zero field can reproduce much of the inelastic neutron scattering spectra and specific heat data. A notable exception is a low temperature peak in the specific heat at approximately 0.1 K. This may indicate the scale of interactions between tetrahedra or may reflect undetected disorder in Ba3Yb2Zn5O11.",3
Architecture of nanoscale ferroelectric domains in GaMo4S8.,"Local-probe imaging of the ferroelectric domain structure and auxiliary bulk pyroelectric measurements were conducted at low temperatures with the aim to clarify the essential aspects of the orbitally driven phase transition in GaMo4S8, a lacunar spinel crystal that can be viewed as a spin-hole analogue of its GaV4S8 counterpart. We employed multiple scanning probe techniques combined with symmetry and mechanical compatibility analysis to uncover the hierarchical domain structures, developing on the 10-100 nm scale. The identified domain architecture involves a plethora of ferroelectric domain boundaries and junctions, including primary and secondary domain walls in both electrically neutral and charged configurations, and topological line defects transforming neutral secondary walls into two oppositely charged ones.",3
Enhanced superconductivity of Ba0.5K0.5Fe2As2 under surface potassium dosing.,"Surface potassium dosing has been proven to be an effective method in tuning the electron doping and enhancing the superconducting transition temperatures in both iron chalcogenides and electron doped iron pnictides. However, it is not clear how surface potassium dosing affects the hole doping and superconductivity in hole doped Fe-based superconductors. Here we performed K-dosing on Ba0.5K0.5Fe2As2, a prototypical hole-doped iron pnictide compound, and explored the electronic structure by in situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements. Starting from the slightly over-doped Ba0.5K0.5Fe2As2, surface K-dosing effectively reduces the hole concentration towards optimal doping and enhances the superconductivity. Intriguingly, the enhancement of superconductivity does not slow down at optimal doping, and the gap further increases with K dosing even when the carrier doping effect is saturated. Meanwhile, the quasiparticle coherence of the inner hole pockets is enhanced by higher K dosing. Our results uncover a novel scattering-reduction effect of K-dosing in Ba1-x K x Fe2As2, which collaborates with the carrier doping effect and enhances superconductivity.",3
Static and dynamic structures of liquid Ba8Ga16Sn30: a melt of the thermoelectric clathrate compounds.,"X-ray diffraction and inelastic x-ray scattering measurements of liquid Ba8Ga16Sn30 have been carried out to investigate local structure and atomic dynamics in the liquid. The pair distribution function shows shorter and longer interatomic distances in the first coordination shell. The dynamic structure factor exhibits the inelastic excitations on both sides of the quasielastic central peak. The inelastic excitations disperse with increasing the momentum transfer, suggesting the longitudinal acoustic mode. We found a low energy excitation in addition to the longitudinal acoustic excitation in the dynamic structure factor and it reminds us a strong relationship with a rattling motion of a guest (Ba) atom in the solid state. The temperature dependence of the pair distribution function and the longitudinal acoustic excitation energy is very weak in a range from 600 to 900 degrees C. The result suggests that Ba and other atoms in the melt are located around minimum positions of the effective pair potential approximated as a harmonic one.",3
Consequences of the inherent density dependence in one dimensional Dirac materials.,"Dirac materials are systems in which the dispersion is linear in the vicinity of the Dirac points. As a consequence of this linear dispersion, the Fermi velocity is independent of density and these systems exhibit unusual behavior and possess unique physical properties that are of considerable interest. In this work we study the ground state behavior of 1D Dirac materials in two ways. First, using the Virial theorem, we find agreement with a previous result in regards to the total average ground state energy. Namely, that the total average ground state energy, regardless of dimensionality, is found to be [Formula: see text] where r s is a dimensionless constant that's a measure of density and [Formula: see text] is a constant independent of r s . As a consequence, thermodynamic results as well as the characteristic exponents of 1D Fermi systems are density independent. Second, using conventional techniques, i.e. Tomanaga-Luttinger theory, we find several unique properties that are a direct consequence of the dispersion. Specifically, the collective modes of the system exhibit electron density independence predicted from the Virial theorem. Finally, possible experimental realization of our predictions of density independent exponents are briefly discussed.",3
1D tungsten oxide nanostructures on a Cu(1 1 0) surface.,"Thin epitaxial layers of tungsten oxide on metal substrates are suitable as model systems for investigation of chemical reactivity and catalytic properties. However, the ability to prepare epitaxial tungsten oxide model system in situ is quite rare. Here we present a method to prepare highly ordered tungsten oxide thin film on a Cu(1 1 0) single crystal substrate using physical vapor deposition in a reactive atmosphere of atomic oxygen. The oxygen induced reconstruction of the copper substrate gives rise to unique self-organized 1D structures of tungsten oxide parallel with the Cu[1 -1 0] crystallographic direction. Utilizing a combination of photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations we reveal emergent physicochemical properties related to the low-dimensionality of the system. Specifically, we observe a support mediated charge redistribution at the interface and a momentum dependent modulation of the valence-band electronic structure. The unusual character of the 1D oxide nanostructures on Cu(1 1 0) surface opens up a unique avenue for preparation of tungsten oxide-based functionalized nanostructures and provides options for further investigation of the fundamental properties of tungsten oxide.",3
Mechanical avalanches promoted by magnetoelastic coupling in magnetic metallic glasses.,"The effect of magnetoelastic coupling on the mechanical behavior of magnetic metallic glasses is studied by superposing a magnetic field to the mechanical load during deformation experiments. The mechanical response is studied from the point of view of the global behavior, characterized by the Young's modulus, and from the perspective of the avalanches, estimated from the intermittency of the deformation signal. The influence of several intensities and orientations of magnetic field is analyzed in two amorphous alloys with different magnetostriction. For the highly magnetostrictive alloy, the decrease of the macroscopic Young's modulus under certain magnetic fields is accompanied by the promotion of mechanical avalanches, a fact that suggests that in this case the magnetoelastic coupling involves some extent of non-linear addition of the magnetic and mechanical energies.",3
Universal scaling in first-order phase transitions mixed with nucleation and growth.,"Matter exhibits phases and their transitions. These transitions are classified as first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) and continuous ones. While the latter has a well-established theory of the renormalization group, the former is only qualitatively accounted for by classical theories of nucleation, since their predictions often disagree with experiments by orders of magnitude. A theory to integrate FOPTs into the framework of the renormalization-group theory has been proposed but seems to contradict with extant wisdom and lacks numerical evidence. Here we show that universal hysteresis scaling as predicted by the renormalization-group theory emerges unambiguously when the theory is combined intimately with the theory of nucleation and growth in the FOPTs of the paradigmatic two-dimensional Ising model driven by a linearly varying externally applied field below its critical point. This not only provides a new method to rectify nucleation theories, but also unifies the theories for both classes of transitions and FOPTs can be studied using universality and scaling similar to their continuous counterpart when nucleation and growth are properly taken into account.",3
Anisotropic conductivity in 2D massive Dirac Fermions: an effect of time reversal symmetry breaking in the surface states of a topological insulator.,"We calculate the conductivity tensor for massive Dirac Fermions within the semiclassical Boltzmann approach. We consider the effect of two different types of scattering mechanism, namely scalar and magnetic, that act incoherently and use the symmetries of the transition rate to exactly solve the Boltzmann equation. We prove that the conductivity can be anisotropic depending on the strength of the magnetic scatterers in each direction. In the particular situation of magnetic impurities polarised in the x-direction, the conductivity is three times larger in y-direction as compared with the conductivity in the x-direction, for white noise scattering correlation function. We compare the approach we apply with the most commonly used way of dealing with more than one source of scattering, namely with Matthiessen's rule, and show that the approach we applied is more general and suitable for anisotropic scattering.",3
The tunable bandgap effect of SnS films.,"Two-dimensional (2D) SnS has attracted much attention as a phosphorene analogue due to the promising applications in next-generation nanoelectronic and photovoltaic devices. It has a bandgap of 1.3 eV, which is matched very well with incident solar radiation. To improve the switching character of devices, it is significant to modulate the bandgap of 2D SnS. In this work, potassium ion (K(+)) or calcium ion (Ca(2+)) is absorbed on the top surface of SnS films to produce an electric field, by which the bandgap can be tuned effectively. By first-principles method we studied the electronic properties and the modulation mechanism of bandgap in detail. The calculated ionization energy and formation energy are 0.41 eV and 0.26 eV for K (1.33 eV and 1.07 eV for Ca). Such little values indicate that it is feasible for ion absorbed on the surface to be used to modulate the bandgap of SnS films. Our calculations also show that the carrier mobility in plane of SnS films has a character of strong anisotropy and the electron mobility is very high in y direction (25.22 x 10(3) cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) for SnS trilayer). Therefore 2D SnS has potential application in nanoelectronic and photovoltaic devices in the future. We hope our results will motivate experimental efforts of 2D SnS.",3
2D melting of confined colloids with a mixture of square and triangular order.,"We implement Brownian dynamics to investigate the melting processes of colloidal particles confined isotropically and interacting via a potential which can be tailored in a repulsive-attractive-respulsive fashion as the interparticle distance increases. The stable configurations of such a system is composed of a large diversity of structures, which includes quasicrystalline, triangular, square, and mixed orderings, as well as the presence of fringes and holes, which are located, respectively, at the border and interior of the clusters. Our simulations demonstrate that during the melting process particles are able to swing between different micro phases. This intermediary stage, present in a finite range of temperature, precedes the melting in all cases investigated and is different from the hexatic phase of the KTNHY framework. We also test the fringes stability and find it to be higher than the one found in compact clusters. Finally, we show that, at the high temperature regime, the system loses its angular ordering while still preserves its radial interparticle confinement, which, ultimately, causes the proliferation of small subclusters.",3
The effect of structural asymmetry on thermal rectification in nanostructures.,"Three SWCNT-graphene nanostructure-based models are designed to probe the thermal rectification caused by the structural asymmetry in the boundary thermal contacts, the device, and the whole system, respectively. We find that both the asymmetry of entire system and the asymmetry of the device are not necessary condition for the existence of thermal rectification, and the asymmetry in boundary thermal contacts is more important than the asymmetry in device toward determining both the magnitude and the direction of thermal rectification. Interestingly, notable thermal rectification can exist in the systems with overall structural symmetry when the boundary thermal contacts are structurally asymmetric. Moreover, nanostructures with a structurally symmetric device and structurally asymmetric boundary thermal contacts can still display significant thermal rectification. These findings could offer insight into the future design and performance improvement of nanostructured thermal rectifiers.",3
Unusual effects of Be doping in the iron-based superconductor FeSe.,"Recent superconducting transition temperatures (T c) over 100 K for monolayer FeSe on SrTiO3 have renewed interest in the bulk parent compound. In KCl:AlCl3 flux-transport-grown crystals of FeSe0.94Be0.06, FeSe0.97Be0.03 and, for comparison, FeSe, this work reports doping of FeSe using Be-among the smallest of possible dopants, corresponding to an effective 'chemical pressure'. According to lattice parameter measurements, 6% Be doping shrank the tetragonal FeSe lattice equivalent to a physical pressure of 0.75 GPa. Using this flux-transport method of sample preparation, 6% of Be was the maximum amount of dopant achievable. At this maximal composition of FeSe0.94Be0.06, the lattice unit cell shrinks by 2.4%, T c-measured in the bulk via specific heat-increases by almost 10%, the T c versus pressure behavior shifts its peak [Formula: see text] downwards by ~1 GPa, the high temperature structural transition around T S = 89 K increases by 1.9 K (in contrast to other dopants in FeSe which uniformly depress T S), and the low temperature specific heat gamma increases by 10% compared to pure FeSe. Also, upon doping by 6% Be the residual resistivity ratio, rho(300 K)/rho(T --> 0), increases by almost a factor of four, while rho(300 K)/rho([Formula: see text]) increases by 50%.",3
The effects of aerogen-bonding on the geometries and spectral properties of several small molecular clusters containing XeO3.,"Aerogen bonding, as a specific noncovalent interaction, has attracted wide attention recently. A number of theoretical studies have proposed this effect based on the analysis of electronic structures of aerogen-containing systems though, the spectral characteristics have not been identified, which becomes the obstacle for the experimental confirmation of this interaction. In this paper, we employed the density functional theory to explore the energetic and geometric properties, infrared, Raman spectra of five small molecular clusters XeO3.H2O, XeO3.NH3, XeO3 dimer, XeO3 trimer, and XeO3.2H2O. Our results show the binding energies of the most favorable conformations for the dimers are larger than -10.00 kcal mol(-1) and those for trimers are larger than -20.00 kcal mol(-1), which indicates the strong aerogen bonding is favorable for the stabilities of these clusters. More importantly, some new IR and Raman vibrations at fingerprint region (<1000 cm(-1)) are identified, which corresponds to the formation of aerogen bonds. This study provides a viable way for the experimentalists to characterize the aerogen bonding in future.",3
Multistep coupling of preexisting local ferroic distortions in PbTiO3 above the Curie temperature.,"Temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopic analyses were performed for the prominent ferroelectric PbTiO3 in the temperature range 130-1040 K, focusing particularly on its paraelectric state above the Curie temperature [Formula: see text] K. The temperature evolution of the anomalous Raman scattering reveals that not only local ferroic distortions persist at temperatures well above [Formula: see text], but also there is a sequence of different coupling processes preceding the appearance of long-range ferroelectric order at [Formula: see text]. Our results indicate that, similar to relaxor ferroelectrics, the paraelectric phase of PbTiO3 can be considered as an ergodic system of local ferroic distortions, which only on average appears to have cubic symmetry.",3
"Spin-polarized resonant surface state in (1 1 1) Sm1-x Gd x Al2, a zero-magnetization ferromagnet.","The electronic structure of (1 1 1) Sm1-x Gd x Al2, a zero-magnetization ferromagnet, is investigated by angle- and spin- resolved photoemission spectroscopy. An intense electron pocket strongly localized around [Formula: see text] and close to the Fermi level is observed and analyzed in detail. Its various characteristics, combined with electronic structure calculations, reveal a resonant surface state of 5d character and Lambda1 symmetry, likely built on bulk states developing around L points. It exhibits moreover a low temperature positive spin polarization at the Fermi level, of strong interest for spin-dependent transport properties in Sm1-x Gd x Al2-based spintronic devices.",3
Ab initio computer simulations of non-equilibrium radiation-induced cascades in amorphous Ge2Sb2Te5.,"Ion irradiation corresponds to a process that involves the production of non-equilibrium cascades in the host material, and the atomistic modelling of such events in glasses is challenging. Here, non-equilibrium cascades in amorphous Ge2Sb2Te5 phase-change memory material have been investigated by means of first-principles molecular-dynamics simulations. A stochastic boundary-conditions approach is employed to treat the thermal nature of the cascades and drive the modelled system back to equilibrium in a natural way, while four different initial thermal-spike energies are considered. A comprehensive analysis of the cascade evolution is presented with respect to the kinetic profile and the dynamics of the cascade inside the glass structure. The modelling results show that the instantaneous maximum kinetic energy decays rapidly with time, and that the time-scale of the ballistic phase of the cascade inside the glass model is very short. The quality of the implemented approach is validated through a comparison of the calculated structure factor for the modelled glasses with experimental data from the literature. Analysis of the bonding for all the species in the glass structure highlights particular structural modifications in the connectivity of the amorphous network due to the simulated cascade.",3
Probing non-locality of interactions in a Bose-Einstein condensate using solitons.,"We consider a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with non-local inter-particle interactions. The local Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation is valid for the gas parameter [Formula: see text], but for [Formula: see text], the BEC is described by a modified GP equation (MGPE). We study the exact solutions of the MGPE describing bright and dark solitons. It turns out that the width of these non-local solitons has qualitatively similar behaviour as the modified healing length due to the non-local interactions of the MGPE. We also study the effect of the non-locality and gas parameter (nu) on the stability of the solitons using the Vakhitov-Kolokolov (VK) stability criterion. We show that these soliton solutions are stable according to the VK criterion. Further, the stability of these soliton solutions gets enhanced due to the non-locality of interactions.",3
Compression mechanisms of ferroelectric PbTiO3 via high pressure neutron scattering.,"Switchable atomic displacements generate electric dipole moments in ferroelectric materials utilized in many contemporary devices. Lead titanate, a perovskite oxide with formula PbTiO3, has been referred to as a textbook example of a prototype displacive ferroelectric and is a testing platform of widely used models of piezoelectric response of complex solid-solutions. PbTiO3 has been addressed by experimental and computational studies, often with apparently conflicting conclusions. To date, hydrostatic pressure experiments have been interpreted in terms of a model in which the dipole moments gradually diminish with increasing pressure until a transition to a cubic phase, characterized by a zero average dipole moment, occurs. The model unrealistically assumes an even compression of the crystal. Here we show by high-pressure neutron powder diffraction measurements that a fast and slow shrinkage of 12-oxygen cages around Pb and octahedra around Ti, respectively, takes place. A phase diagram consolidating earlier and present results is given.",3
UV-induced formation of oxygen-derived dangling bonds on hydroxyl-terminated SiC.,"A combined theoretical and multi-technique experimental study was employed to comprehensively determine the electronic structure of 6H-SiC(0 0 0 1) surfaces upon hydroxyl and oxygen termination. We demonstrate the UV-induced formation of single-coordinated oxygen radicals in on-top sites above the atoms of the uppermost silicon layer of the substrate on initially hydroxyl-terminated SiC. Such a configuration of oxygen radicals represents an unprecedented adsorbate-derived system of unpaired electrons, bearing analogy to silicon and carbon dangling bonds on clean, unreconstructed SiC surfaces. We evidence the presence of adsorbate-derived surface states within the fundamental band gap for both hydroxyl- and oxygen-terminated SiC. For hydroxyl termination, a hydrogen-induced unoccupied surface state is revealed consistently by inverse photoemission spectroscopy and density-functional theory calculations employing self-interaction-corrected pseudopotentials (DFT-SIC). The formation of oxygen dangling bonds is accompanied by the occurrence of an occupied surface state derived from p x - and p y -orbitals associated with the unpaired electrons as proven by both ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy and DFT-SIC.",3
Magnetic structure and field-dependent magnetic phase diagram of Ni2In-type PrCuSi.,"The magnetic structure of the ternary equiatomic intermetallic compound PrCuSi is investigated using neutron powder diffraction experiments in 0 T as well as in external magnetic fields up to 2 T. The PrCuSi compound crystallizes in the hexagonal Ni2In-type structure, in the space group P63/mmc. In this structure, cationic ordering of Cu and Si takes place. The antiferromagnetic phase transition in the Pr sublattice takes place at [Formula: see text] K in 0 T. Under an external magnetic field of 2 T, a field-induced ferromagnetic phase is observed. Magnetoelastic coupling is evidenced by an increase in the unit cell volume. Clear signatures of a mixed antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic phase in weak, intermediate fields, 0.4-0.8 T, are obtained from the present study. Using the present set of experimental data, we construct the H - T phase diagram of PrCuSi.",3
One-particle Green's function of interacting two electrons using analytic solutions for a three-body problem: comparison with exact Kohn-Sham system.,"For a three-electron system with finite-strength interactions confined to a one-dimensional harmonic trap, we solve the Schrodinger equation analytically to obtain the exact solutions, from which we construct explicitly the simultaneous eigenstates of the energy and total spin for the first time. The solutions for the three-electron system allow us to derive analytic expressions for the exact one-particle Green's function (GF) for the corresponding two-electron system. We calculate the GF in frequency domain to examine systematically its behavior depending on the electronic interactions. We also compare the pole structure of non-interacting GF using the exact Kohn-Sham (KS) potential with that of the exact GF to find that the discrepancy of the energy gap between the KS system and the original system is larger for a stronger interaction. We perform numerical examination on the behavior of GFs in real space to demonstrate that the exact and KS GFs can have shapes quite different from each other. Our simple model will help to understand generic characteristics of interacting GFs.",3
Interplay between nematic fluctuation and superconductivity in a two-orbital Hubbard model: a quantum Monte Carlo study.,"To understand the interplay between nematic fluctuation and superconductivity in iron-based superconductors, we performed a systematic study of the realistic two-orbital Hubbard model at intermedium correlation regimes by using the constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo method. Our numerical results showed that the on-site nematic interaction induces a strong enhancement of nematic fluctuations at various momentums, especially at ([Formula: see text]). Simultaneously, it was found that the on-site nematic interaction suppresses the [Formula: see text] antiferromagnetic order and long-range electron pairing correlations for dominant pairing channels. Our findings suggest that on-site nematic fluctuation seems to compete with superconductivity in iron-based superconductors.",3
Controlling electron flow in anisotropic Dirac materials heterojunctions: a super-diverging lens.,"Ballistic heterojunctions of Dirac materials offer the opportunity of exploring optics-like phenomena in electronic systems. In this paper, a new perfect lens through special positive refraction is predicted with omnidirectional Klein tunneling of massless Dirac fermions. The novel optics component called a super-diverging lens (SDL) is the counterpart of a Veselago lens (VL). The use of SDL and VL creates a device that simulates the ocular vision. This atypical refraction is due to electrons obeying different Snell's laws of pseudo-spin and group velocity in heterojunctions with elliptical Dirac cones. These findings pave the way for an electron elliptical Dirac optics and open up new possibilities for the guiding of electrons.",3
Magnetic impurity in topological nodal loop semimetals.,"We investigate the Kondo effect of a spin-1/2 magnetic impurity in a topological nodal loop semimetal, in which band touchings form a nodal loop. The Fermi surface of a nodal loop semimetal is a torus or a drum-like structure, which is determined by chemical potential. When the chemical potential mu lies at the nodal loop ([Formula: see text]), the magnetic impurity and the conduction electrons form bound states only if their coupling exceeds a critical value. As the chemical potential is tuned away from the nodal loop, the Fermi surface becomes a torus or drum-like structure and the impurity and the host material always favor a bound state due to the finite density of state. Due to the anisotropic dispersion relationship in the energy band, the spatial spin-spin correlations [Formula: see text]([Formula: see text]) are of power-law decay with the decay rates proportional to [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] in different directions, respectively. The product [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] oscillates in coordinate space and the period is enhanced gradually as the Fermi surface evolves from a torus surface into a drum-like structure.",3
Geometric effect on quantum anomalous Hall states in magnetic topological insulators.,"An intriguing observation on the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) in magnetic topological insulators (MTIs) is the dissipative edge states, where quantized Hall resistance is accompanied by nonzero longitudinal resistance. We numerically investigate this dissipative behavior of QAHE in MTIs with a three-dimensional tight-binding model and non-equilibrium Green's function formalism. It is found that, in clean samples, the geometric mismatch between the detecting electrodes and the MTI sample leads to additional scattering in the central Hall bar, which is similar to the effect of splitting gates in the traditional Hall effect. As a result, while the Hall resistance remains quantized, the longitudinal resistance deviates from zero due to such additional scattering. It is also shown that external magnetic fields as well as disorder scattering can suppress the dissipation of the longitudinal resistance. These results are in good agreement with previous experimental observations and provide insight on the fabrication of QAHE devices.",3
Water entry and fall of hydrophobic and superhydrophobic Teflon spheres.,"Hydrophobic and superhydrophobic solid Teflon spheres have been observed while settling in water under the action of gravity, starting from different initial conditions, and have been followed until the steady-state is reached. The superhydrophobic sphere features a nano/microtextured surface and advancing and receding water contact angles equal to, respectively, [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]. When impacting water from air, both spheres can entrap a conspicuous amount of air deriving from the sealing of a macro-sized air cavity formed upon impact (air cavity trapping) and standing at the rear part of the settling sphere. It is shown that this air amount, like a spindle, reduces the force coefficient exerted on the sphere, basically acting on the pressure drag. However, the air cavity trapping occurs above a critical impact velocity which for the superhydrophobic spheres is significantly lower than that pertaining to the hydrophobic one; thus a certain range of impact velocities exists at which the superhydrophobic sphere experiences a lower pressure drag and a higher mean velocity. As soon as the air cavity vanishes, the dynamics of the superhydrophobic sphere becomes indistinguishable from that of the hydrophobic one, in spite of the persistence of air within the surface micro-texture.",3
Ineffectiveness of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in the dynamical quantum phase transition in the ITF model.,"Quantum phase transition occurs at a quantum critical value of a control parameter such as the magnetic field in the Ising model in a transverse magnetic field (ITF). Recently, it is shown that ramping across the quantum critical point generates non-analytic behaviors in the time evolution of a closed quantum system in the thermodynamic limit at zero temperature. The mentioned phenomenon is called the dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT). Here, we consider the one-dimensional ITF model with added the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). Using the fermionization technique, the Hamiltonian is exactly diagonalized. Although the DMI induces chiral phase in the ground state phase diagram of the model, the study of the rate function of the return probability has proven that the DMI does not affect the DQPT. We conclude accordingly that the ramping across the quantum critical point is not a necessary and sufficient condition for DQPT.",3
A phenomenological approach to the deposition pattern of evaporating droplets with contact line pinning.,"When an evaporating droplet of colloidal suspension dries on a solid surface with the contact line pinned, the solute particles are driven by the solvent flow toward the edge and form a ring-like deposition pattern. In this work, we take into account the contact angle hysteresis and incorporate it into the effective model of Man and Doi (2016 Phys. Rev. Lett. 116 066101) which is based on Onsager's variational principle. We show that single-ring pattern is formed when the contact line pinning and/or friction are sufficiently strong. We demonstrate that there exists an appropriate range for contact line pinning and friction in which two rings can be formed in the deposition pattern, one at the initially pinned contact line and the other a bit closer to the center of droplet.",3
Heisenberg Ising-Kondo necklace model with transverse field for the heavy fermion compound URu2Si2.,"In this work, we introduce the Heisenberg Ising-Kondo necklace with transverse field as a possible model to describe the heavy-fermion compound URu2Si2. The physics of this compound presents many open questions, like the transition to the hidden order (HO) phase at T 0 = 17.5 K. Our Hamiltonian includes elements that come from crystal field processes and Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction. The main idea is to allow the transverse field, that a priori acts only in the localized moments, to influence the conduction-electrons via the RKKY interaction. Our results, obtained using a spin-wave approach for a one-dimensional lattice system, reveal a re-entrance behavior on the zero temperature phase diagram. This is an interesting result since combined with the magnetization values of the canted AF phase allow to link this phase with the mixed hidden order/large moment antiferromagnetic (HO/LMAF) phase observed in URu2Si2.",3
[Formula: see text] classification for a novel antiferromagnetic topological insulating phase in three-dimensional topological Kondo insulator.,"Antiferromagnetic topological insulator (AFTI) is a topological matter that breaks time-reversal symmetry. Since its proposal, explorations of AFTI in strong-correlated systems are still lacking. In this paper, we show for the first time that a novel AFTI phase can be realized in three-dimensional topological Kondo insulator (TKI). In a wide parameter region, the ground states of TKI undergo a second-order transition to antiferromagnetic insulating phases which conserve a combined symmetry of time reversal and a lattice translation, allowing us to derive a [Formula: see text]-classification formula for these states. By calculating the [Formula: see text] index, the antiferromagnetic insulating states are classified into AFTI or non-topological antiferromagnetic insulator (nAFI) in different parameter regions. On the antiferromagnetic surfaces in AFTI, we find topologically protected gapless Dirac cones inside the bulk gap, leading to metallic Fermi rings exhibiting helical spin texture with weak spin-momentum locking. Depending on model parameters, the magnetic transitions take place either between AFTI and strong topological insulator, or between nAFI and weak topological insulator. By varying some model parameters, we find a topological transition between AFTI and nAFI, driving by closing of bulk gap. Our work may account for the pressure-induced magnetism in TKI compound SmB6, and helps to explore richer AFTI phases in heavy-fermion systems as well as in other strong-correlated systems.",3
Different regimes of the Purcell effect in disordered photonic crystals.,"We demonstrate that disorder in photonic crystals could lead to pronounced modification of spontaneous emission rate in the frequency region corresponding to the photonic band gap (PBG). Depending on the amount of disorder, two different regimes of the Purcell effect occurs. We provide statistical analysis of Purcell coefficient on the frequency of the emitter and its position within the sample. For the moderate disorder, an enhancement of spontaneous emission occurs at the edge of PBG due to the modification of properties of the edge state. This effect is responsible for recently observed mirrorless lasing in photonic crystals at the edge of PBG. When the level of disorder increases, the spontaneous emission rate enhances within the PBG due to the appearance of the high quality factor states. This effect is likely responsible for a superlinear dependence of emissions on pumping observed in synthetic opals.",3
Corrigendum to &quot;Effects of trigonal deformation on electronic structure and thermoelectric properties of bismuth&quot; [2018 J Phys Condens Matter 30 285504].,"In the mentioned paper [1], the cohesive energy E (eV/atom) as the function of the c/a in Table 3 should be corrected as follows.",3
"Electronic structure of Pr2MnNiO6 from x-ray photoemission, absorption and density functional theory.","The electronic structure of double perovskite Pr2MnNiO6 was studied using core x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and x-ray absorption spectroscopy. The 2p x-ray absorption spectra show that Mn and Ni are in 4+ and 2+ states respectively. Based on charge transfer multiplet analysis of the 2p XPS spectra of both ions, we find charge transfer energies [Formula: see text] of 3.5 and 2.5 eV for Ni and Mn respectively. The ground state of Ni(2+) and Mn(4+) ions reveal a higher d electron count of 8.21 and 3.38 respectively as compared to the ionic values. The partial density of states clearly show a charge transfer character of the system for U - J [Formula: see text] 2 eV. The O 1s edge absorption spectra reveal a band gap of 0.9 eV, which is close to the value estimated from analysis of Ni and Mn 2p photoemission and absorption spectra. The combined analysis of nature of spectroscopic data and first principles calculations reveal that the material is a p - d type charge transfer insulator with an intermediate covalent character according to the Zannen-Sawatzy-Allen phase diagram.",3
Robust Hund rule without Coulomb repulsion and exclusion principle in quantum antiferromagnetic chains of composite half spins.,"Quantum spin chains with composite spins have been used to approximate conventional chains with higher spins. For instance, a spin 1 (or [Formula: see text]) chain was sometimes approximated by a chain with two (or three) spin [Formula: see text]'s per site. However, little examination has been given as to whether this approximation, effectively assuming the first Hund rule per site, is valid and why. In this paper, the validity of this approximation is investigated numerically. We diagonalize the Hamiltonians of spin chains with a spin 1 and [Formula: see text] per site and with two and three spin [Formula: see text]'s per site. The low energy excitation spectrum for the spin chain with M spin [Formula: see text]'s per site is found to coincide with that of the corresponding conventional chain with one spin [Formula: see text] per site. In particular, we find that as the system size increases, an increasingly larger block of consecutive lowest energy states with maximal spin per site is observed, robustly supporting the first Hund rule even though the exclusion principle does not apply and the system does not possess Coulomb repulsion. As for why this approximation works, we show that this effective Hund rule emerges as a plausible consequence when applying to composite spin systems the Lieb-Mattis theorem, which is originally for the ground state of ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic spin systems.",3
Tracer diffusion in crowded narrow channels.,"We summarise different results on the diffusion of a tracer particle in lattice gases of hard-core particles with stochastic dynamics, which are confined to narrow channels-single-files, comb-like structures and quasi-one-dimensional channels with the width equal to several particle diameters. We show that in such geometries a surprisingly rich, sometimes even counter-intuitive, behaviour emerges, which is absent in unbounded systems. This is well-documented for the anomalous diffusion in single-files. Less known is the anomalous dynamics of a tracer particle in crowded branching single-files-comb-like structures, where several kinds of anomalous regimes take place. In narrow channels, which are broader than single-files, one encounters a wealth of anomalous behaviours in the case where the tracer particle is subject to a regular external bias: here, one observes an anomaly in the temporal evolution of the tracer particle velocity, super-diffusive at transient stages, and ultimately a giant diffusive broadening of fluctuations in the position of the tracer particle, as well as spectacular multi-tracer effects of self-clogging of narrow channels. Interactions between a biased tracer particle and a confined crowded environment also produce peculiar patterns in the out-of-equilibrium distribution of the environment particles, very different from the ones appearing in unbounded systems. For moderately dense systems, a surprising effect of a negative differential mobility takes place, such that the velocity of a biased tracer particle can be a non-monotonic function of the force. In some parameter ranges, both the velocity and the diffusion coefficient of a biased tracer particle can be non-monotonic functions of the density. We also survey different results obtained for a tracer particle diffusion in unbounded systems, which will permit a reader to have an exhaustively broad picture of the tracer diffusion in crowded environments.",3
Theoretical investigation of multiferroic metal-organic framework magnet [CH3NH3][Co(HCOO)3]: Green's function method.,"For the first presented magnetic ordering-induced multiferroics with a metal-organic framework (MOF) of formula [CH3NH3][Co(HCOO)3], we theoretically investigate its multiple ferroics. It is found that Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is a main cause that leads to non-zero magnetization, and electric polarization, and the induced electric polarization can be regulated by magnetic fields. As an assistant mechanism, magnon-magnon interaction and quantum fluctuation play an important role on ferroelectrics and magnetism. Our methods are based on the double-time Green's function and Holstein-Primakoff transformation. Theoretical results can be compared with experiments, though there are some discrepancies.",3
Anomalous heat flow in 8-Pmmn borophene with tilted Dirac cones.,"We analytically establish an anomalous transverse flow of heat in 8- Pmmn borophene, one of the several two-dimensional allotropes of Boron. The dispersion of this allotrope contains a pair of anisotropic and tilted Dirac cones which are gapped by placing the 2D B sheet under an intense circularly-polarized illumination. A gap in the Dirac dispersion leads to a finite Berry curvature and connected anomalous Hall effects. In the case of thermoelectrics, this manifests as a heat current perpendicular to the temperature gradient-the thermal Hall effect. A quantitative calculation of the attendant thermal Hall conductivity reveals dependence on the intrinsic anisotropy and tilt of the Dirac cone. Further, by estimating the longitudinal thermal conductivity using the Wiedemann-Franz law, we also outline steps to compute the thermal Hall angle that gauges the generation efficiency of such transverse heat processes. Finally, we touch upon the idea of thermal rectification wherein the direction of flow of the anomalous heat reverses through a simple switch of the polarization of incident light and is of interest in thermal logic circuits.",3
Peculiar magnetism in Eu substituted BiFeO3 and its correlation with local structure.,"We have systematically investigated the effects of Eu substitution on chemical pressure, bond lengths, microstrain, bond angles, octahedral tilting, vibrational modes and phase transformation, in BiFeO3. Correlation between concentration, phase, local structure and magnetism has been explained. Substitution of Eu ions with contrasting magnetic moment and dissimilar size, affects the local structure by changing bond angles and hence modifies spin structure through weakening of Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) interaction which lead to destruction of spiral spin configuration. Intriguing as well as anomalous magnetic response such as weak ferromagnetism with high coercivity, stair step like loops with significant drop in coercivity and systematic decrease in the magnetic coercivity at low temperatures has been observed as a function of Eu concentration (x). These results are explained on the basis of weakening of DM interaction, field induced melting of antiferromagnetic clusters and modification in effective magnetic anisotropy including contribution of magnetoelectric coupling, for various values of x. These results were used to generate the magnetic phase diagram.",3
Spin-orbital entangled liquid state in the copper oxide Ba3CuSb2O9.,"Structure with orbital degeneracy is unstable toward spontaneous distortion. Such orbital correlation usually has a much higher energy scale than spins, and therefore, magnetic transition takes place at a much lower temperature, almost independently from orbital ordering. However, when the energy scales of orbitals and spins meet, there is a possibility of spin-orbital entanglement that would stabilize novel ground state such as spin-orbital liquid and random singlet state. Here we review on such a novel spin-orbital magnetism found in the hexagonal perovskite oxide Ba3CuSb2O9, which hosts a self-organized honeycomblike short-range order of a strong Jahn-Teller ion Cu(2+). Comprehensive structural and magnetic measurements have revealed that the system has neither magnetic nor Jahn-Teller transition down to the lowest temperatures, and Cu spins and orbitals retain the hexagonal symmetry and paramagnetic state. Various macroscopic and microscopic measurements all indicate that spins and orbitals remain fluctuating down to low temperatures without freezing, forming a spin-orbital entangled liquid state.",3
"Variational study of the interacting, spinless Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model.","We study the phase diagram and the total polarization distribution of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with nearest neighbor interaction in one dimension at half-filling. To obtain the ground state wave-function, we extend the Baeriswyl variational wave function to account for alternating hopping parameters. The ground state energies of the variational wave functions compare well to exact diagonalization results. For the case of uniform hopping for all bonds, where it is known that an ideal conductor to insulator transition takes place at finite interaction, we also find a transition at an interaction strength somewhat lower than the known value. The ideal conductor phase is a Fermi sea. The phase diagram in the whole parameter range shows a resemblance to the phase diagram of the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model. We also calculate the gauge invariant cumulants corresponding to the polarization (Zak phase) and use these to reconstruct the distribution of the polarization. We calculate the reconstructed polarization distribution along a path in parameter space which connects two points with opposite polarization in two ways. In one case we cross the metallic phase line, in the other, we go through only insulating states. In the former case, the average polarization changes discontinuously after passing through the metallic phase line, while in the latter the distribution 'walks across' smoothly from one polarization to its opposite. This state of affairs suggests that the correlation acts to break the chiral symmetry of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, in the same way as it happens when a Rice-Mele onsite potential is turned on.",3
Coherent transport in Y-junction graphene waveguide.,"We performed a series of theoretical transport studies on Y-branch electron waveguides which are embedded in mid-size armchair graphene nanoribbons. Non-equilibrium Green's function with different approximations of tight-binding Hamiltonian has been employed. Using the first nearest hopping approximation, we observed very pronounced conductance quantization, the structure of which depends on geometrical design and shows a spacing of 4e (2)/h, indicating the existence of valley degree of freedom. Moreover, by incorporating the third nearest approximation, we observed seminal plateaus deviated from multiples of 4e (2)/h conductance, suggesting the lift of valley degeneracy. Finally, Quasi-one dimensional band structure calculations have been performed to study the availability of energy channels and the role of the major geometrical parameters on the transport.",3
Magnetism of Bi2Se3 thin films with Eu-rich flat inclusions.,"We report the results of experimental and theoretical studies of Eu-doped Bi2Se3 thin films with extremely inhomogeneous distribution of magnetic component. The obtained electron microscopy images suggest that Eu atoms are concentrated within platelet-like nanoinclusions. The number of inclusions grows with the increase in Eu content, x. Moreover, at relatively high x values, the stacks of platelets (inclusions located one under another) become rather frequent. A comparative analysis of magnetic properties of the films under study reveals no pronounced changes of their temperature dependence with the increase in x, which, however, leads to the decrease in the average magnetic moment [Formula: see text] per Eu atom. A theoretical analysis of different mechanisms contributing to a possible magnetic ordering in the Eu-doped films demonstrates that at small distances (i.e. within a platelet) a dominant contribution is related to the RKKY interaction via electrons in the bulk, while the ordering at inter-platelet distances is governed by magnetic dipole-dipole interaction. The latter implies the antiferromagnetic ordering within the stacks of platelets explaining a drop of [Formula: see text] per Eu atom. We employ the model of a metallic spin glass to estimate the transition temperature, characterising the interaction within the ensemble of randomly distributed magnetic platelets. This estimate gives satisfactory agreement with the experiment, even if we take into account a finite film thickness, thus, neglecting the interaction anisotropy and including only the antiferromagnetism related to the stacking. While the overall contribution of interface Dirac electrons is damped in the systems under study, we argue that the obtained results can be used for the investigation of ultrathin films with analogous impurity profile, where this contribution should be clearly pronounced.",3
Vibrational dynamics within the embedded-atom-method formalism and the relationship to Born-von-Karman force constants.,"We derive expressions for the dynamical matrix of a crystalline solid with total potential energy described by an embedded-atom-method (EAM) potential. We make no assumptions regarding the number of atoms per unit cell. These equations can be used for calculating both bulk phonon modes as well the modes of a slab of material, which is useful for the study of surface phonons. We further discuss simplifications that occur in cubic lattices with one atom per unit cell. The relationship of Born-von-Karman (BvK) force constants-which are readily extracted from experimental vibrational dispersion curves-to the EAM potential energy is discussed. In particular, we derive equations for BvK force constants for bcc and fcc lattices in terms of the functions that define an EAM model. The EAM-BvK relationship is useful for assessing the suitability of a particular EAM potential for describing vibrational spectra, which we illustrate using vibrational data from the bcc metals K and Fe and the fcc metal Au.",3
Electronic structure and migration of interstitial hydrogen in the rutile phase of TiO2.,"The formation and migration energies of interstitial hydrogen in rutile TiO2 are obtained from first principles calculations. The computational approach was based on density functional theory with a semilocal generalised-gradient approximation functional, supplemented with an on-site Hubbard term to account for correlation among the Ti 3d electrons. Charge-transition levels are calculated and compared to previous theoretical studies. The donor character of hydrogen is examined in depth, focusing in particular on the tendency to form polaron-like configurations with the unpaired electron trapped at nearby titanium ions. Distinct minimum-energy paths of hydrogen migration and associated energy barriers were determined by the nudged elastic-band method. The present findings show clearly the strong anisotropy in the energy barriers for migration within the open c channels as opposed to migration crossing adjacent channels of the rutile lattice. For the rate-limiting step which leads to macroscopic diffusion along the c axis the corresponding rate and diffusion coefficient were also determined from transition-state theory. The results are discussed in connection to existing measurements of hydrogen diffusion and recent findings from electron paramagnetic resonance, electron-nuclear double resonance and muonium spectroscopies that probed the spatial localization of the electron spin.",3
First-principles study of electronic properties of Cu doped Ag2S.,"Using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory, electronic properties of Ag2S and Cu doped Ag2S were investigated. The calculated results show that Ag2S crystal is semiconductor with a band gap of 0.92 eV which is consistent with previous PBE calculation. Three possible Cu doping configurations are investigated: Cu substitution of Ag_I, Cu substitution of Ag_II, and interstitial Cu. It is found that interstitial Cu doping reduces the band gap as the Cu concentration increases, while for Ag_I and Ag_II substitution doping the band gap is not sensitive to the impurity concentration. The band gap reduction can mainly be attributed to the downward shift of the bottom of conduction band upon Cu interstitial doping. The reduction of the band gap for Ag2S with interstitial Cu doping is consistent with experimental absorption and fluorescence spectra, where a significant red-shift after Cu doping in Ag2S crystal is observed.",3
Corrections to the magnetoresistance formula for semimetals with Dirac electrons: the Boltzmann equation approach validated by the Kubo formula.,"The magnetoresistance (MR) in semimetals with Dirac (or Weyl) electrons and free holes is investigated on the basis of the Boltzmann theory. The MR is modified from the conventional results with free electrons and holes in a very complex way due to the correction of the Dirac dispersion. The obtained formula explicitly includes the magnetic field dependence, which is very useful for the analysis of experimental results. In order to verify the validity of our results, the results obtained by the Boltzmann approach are compared with those by the Kubo theory. It is revealed that, by taking into account the field dependence of carrier density, the MR obtained by the Boltzmann theory almost perfectly agrees with that based on the Kubo theory even in the high-field region (in the quantum limit) except for the quantum oscillations. It is also shown that the MR in semimetals increases linearly with respect to the field in the quantum limit due to the drastic change of the carrier density, which is a significant characteristic of semimetals.",3
Nanometrology of field gradient using donor spins in silicon.,"We proposed a novel scheme for nanometrology of magnetic field gradient based on Kane's silicon quantum computer proposal. When the system is placed in an unknown magnetic field gradient, the inhomogeneous precession of the donor nuclear spins records the field gradient information to the phase pattern of donor nuclear spins. By adding AC voltage modulations on each A-gate to induce hyperfine-mediated electron-nuclear collective flip-flop process, we demonstrate that the gradient value can be obtained by tuning the modulation phases of the A-gates. Errors of the measurements of such scheme is discussed and estimated. It is also discussed that in presence of the external field with a known gradient, the same system is possible to be used to obtain the unknown displacement of donor locations.",3
Squeezing and time evolution of magnon states under perpendicular pumping.,"The coherent magnon state representation is employed to investigate the quantum-statistical behavior of the nonlinear excitation of magnons in ferromagnets. Both the long-range magnetic dipole-dipole and short-range exchange interactions are included, along with a static longitudinal applied field and a microwave pumping field in the perpendicular orientation. Within a microscopic (or Hamiltonian-based) approach the total Hamiltonian is transformed from spin operators to a normal-mode set of boson creation and annihilation operators. When the three-magnon interactions are included, it is found that the microwave pumping field may be used to control the nonlinear statistical properties of the system. From a study of the time evolution of the system we deduce the average number of magnons, the super-Poissonian statistical behavior, and the occurrence of magnon squeezing. We also compare the results with the case where the microwave pumping field is in the parallel orientation, and it is found that there are important differences in the time dependence.",3
Dielectric properties of ferroelectric nanocomposites: effects of thermal stresses and filler shape anisotropy.,"Ferroelectric nanocomposites are intriguing nonhomogeneous materials, which may have unusual phase states and specific physical properties useful for practical applications. Here we theoretically describe dielectric properties of nanocomposites comprising single-domain ferroelectric nanocrystals embedded into a linear dielectric medium. First, small-signal intrinsic permittivities of spheroidal PbTiO3 and BaTiO3 crystallites surrounded by an isotropic matrix with linear elastic properties are calculated with the aid of a nonlinear thermodynamic theory. It is shown that thermal stresses caused by differences in thermal expansion between the inclusions and the matrix may strongly influence the intrinsic permittivities of ferroelectric nanocrystals. Second, macroscopic dielectric responses of ferroelectric-dielectric composites are evaluated in the Maxwell Garnett approximation. For effective permittivities of such composites, generalized relations are derived, which allow for both the shape and dielectric anisotropies of ferroelectric nanocrystals. Numerical calculations of the effective permittivities are performed for composites comprising PbTiO3 and BaTiO3 nanocrystals embedded into representative dielectric matrices generating tensile (silica glass) or compressive (potassium silicate glass) thermal stresses inside ferroelectric inclusions. For nanocomposites involving randomly oriented and similarly aligned spheroidal inclusions, temperature dependences of the effective permittivities are determined with the account of phase transitions occurring in strained ferroelectric nanocrystals and suppression of their dielectric responses due to the depolarizing-field effect created by low-permittivity matrix. Our theoretical calculations show that effective permittivities of composites comprising needle-like or disc-shaped ferroelectric inclusions could strongly exceed the permittivity of the matrix. Most importantly, we predict that BaTiO3-K2O-SiO2 composites with such inclusions should exhibit a broad dielectric peak around the room temperature, which is associated with shifted structural transitions in strained BaTiO3 nanocrystals. The presented theory provides guidelines for the development of ferroelectric nanocomposites with enhanced dielectric responses, which could be suitable for applications in supercapacitors and other advanced electronic devices.",3
Estimation of the infinitesimal generator by square-root approximation.,"In recent years, for the analysis of molecular processes, the estimation of time-scales and transition rates has become fundamental. Estimating the transition rates between molecular conformations is-from a mathematical point of view-an invariant subspace projection problem. We present a method to project the infinitesimal generator acting on function space to a low-dimensional rate matrix. This projection can be performed in two steps. First, we discretize the conformational space in a Voronoi tessellation, then the transition rates between adjacent cells is approximated by the geometric average of the Boltzmann weights of the Voronoi cells. This method demonstrates that there is a direct relation between the potential energy surface of molecular structures and the transition rates of conformational changes. We will show also that this approximation is correct and converges to the generator of the Smoluchowski equation in the limit of infinitely small Voronoi cells. We present results for a two dimensional diffusion process and alanine dipeptide as a high-dimensional system.",3
The Kondo resonance line shape in scanning tunnelling spectroscopy: instrumental aspects.,"In the scanning tunnelling microscope, the many-body Kondo effect leads to a zero-bias feature of the differential conductance spectra of magnetic adsorbates on surfaces. The intrinsic line shape of this Kondo resonance and its temperature dependence in principle contain valuable information. We use measurements on a molecular Kondo system, all- trans retinoic acid on Au(1 1 1), and model calculations to discuss the role of instrumental broadening. The modulation voltage used for the lock-in detection, noise on the sample voltage, and the temperature of the microscope tip are considered. These sources of broadening affect the apparent line shapes and render difficult a determination of the intrinsic line width, in particular when variable temperatures are involved.",3
The relation between local structural distortion and the low-temperature magnetic anomaly in Fe7S8.,"Structural defects on an atomic level can crucially impact the magnetic properties of a material. We study this phenomenon by means of magnetometry and powder neutron diffraction on a stoichiometric, monoclinic pyrrhotite (Fe7S8), which is a classic omission structure with a magnetic anomaly at about 30 K. The initial structural distortion of the pyrrhotite at 300 K caused by the vacancy arrangement decreases upon cooling, and simultaneous to the magnetic anomaly the anisotropic contraction of the unit cell homogenizes the covalency of the Fe-Fe bonds with lengths less than 3.0 A and the Fe-S-Fe bond angles. These changes on the atomic level affect the spin-orbit coupling and the super-exchange interactions in Fe7S8, and trigger the low-temperature magnetic anomaly within a crystallographically stable system.",3
Formation and stability of water clusters at the molybdenum disulfide interface: a molecular dynamics simulation investigation.,"In this work structural properties and dynamic behavior of a water nano droplet on the molybdenum disulfide were considered. The simulation results show that water molecules form polygon clusters on the interface, and most of which are hexagonal. Structures of water clusters at the interface are seen in two forms of curved and flattened polygons, which result in the formation of hydrogen bonds between and in the adjacent layers, respectively. Most of the clusters have circular flattened structures. Calculations of the lifetime of hydrogen bonds of water molecules at the interface also show that hydrogen bonds between water molecules at the interface have a low stability. This leads to the permanent formation and breaking down of hydrogen bonds of water molecules which can cause movement of water molecules and, consequently, the displacement of the center of mass and droplet motion. Considering the changes in the center of mass of a water droplet at the MoS2 interface display, the water droplet has a significant spontaneous motion.",3
From Klein to anti-Klein tunneling in graphene tuning the Rashba spin-orbit interaction or the bilayer coupling.,"We calculate the transmission coefficient for a particle crossing a potential barrier in monolayer graphene with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and in bilayer graphene. We show that in both cases one can go from Klein tunneling regime, characterized by perfect normal transmission, to anti-Klein tunneling regime, with perfect normal reflection, by tuning the Rashba spin-orbit coupling for a monolayer or the interplane coupling for a bilayer graphene. We show that the intermediate regime is characterized by a non-monotonic behavior with oscillations and resonances in the normal transmission amplitude as a function of the coupling and of the potential parameters.",3
Isolated highly localized bands in YBi2 monolayer caused by 4f orbitals.,"The novel electronic structures can induce unique physical properties in two-dimensional (2D) materials. In this work, we report isolated highly localized bands (HLB) in [Formula: see text] monolayer by the first-principle calculations within generalized gradient approximation (GGA) plus spin-orbit coupling (SOC). It is found that [Formula: see text] monolayer is an indirect-gap semiconductor using both GGA and GGA+SOC. The calculations reveal that Yb-4f orbitals constitute isolated HLB below the Fermi level at the absence of SOC, and the bands are split into the j = 7/2 and j = 5/2 states with SOC. The isolated HLB can lead to a very large Seebeck coefficient and very low electrical conductivity in p-type doping by producing very large effective mass of the carrier. It is proved that isolated HLB have very strong stability against strain, which is very important for practical application. When the onsite Coulomb interaction is added to the Yb-4f orbitals, isolated HLB persist, and only their relative positions in the gap change. These findings open a new window to search for novel electronic structures in 2D materials.",3
Spin waves in disordered materials.,"We present an efficient methodology to study spin waves in disordered materials. The approach is based on a Heisenberg model and enables calculations of magnon properties in spin systems with disorder of an arbitrary kind and concentration of impurities. Disorder effects are taken into account within two complementary approaches. Magnons in systems with substitutional (uncorrelated) disorder can be efficiently calculated within a single-site coherent potential approximation for the Heisenberg model. From the computation point of view the method is inexpensive and directly applicable to systems like alloys and doped materials. It is shown that it performs exceedingly well across all concentrations and wave vectors. Another way is the direct numerical simulation of large supercells using a configurational average over possible samples. This approach is applicable to systems with an arbitrary kind of disorder. The effective interaction between magnetic moments entering the Heisenberg model can be obtained from first-principles using a self-consistent Green function method within the density functional theory. Thus, our method can be viewed as an ab initio approach and can be used for calculations of magnons in real materials.",3
Shifted Landau levels in curved graphene sheets.,"We study the Landau levels in curved graphene sheets by measuring the discrete energy spectrum in the presence of a magnetic field. We observe that in rippled graphene sheets, the Landau energy levels satisfy the same square root dependence on the energy quantum number as in flat sheets, [Formula: see text]. Though, we find that the Landau levels in curved sheets are shifted towards lower energies by an amount proportional to the average spatial deformation of the sheet. Our findings are relevant for the quantum Hall effect in curved graphene sheets, which is directly related to Landau quantization. For the purpose of this study, we develop a new numerical method, based on the quantum lattice Boltzmann method, to solve the Dirac equation on curved manifolds, describing the low-energetic states in strained graphene sheets.",3
"Electronic properties of the two-dimensional (Tl, Rb)/Si(1 1 1)[Formula: see text] compound having a honeycomb-like structure.","Heavy metal layers having a honeycomb structure on the Si(1 1 1) surface were theoretically predicted to show prospects for possessing properties of the quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulators. The (Tl, Rb)/Si(1 1 1)[Formula: see text] atomic-layer compound synthesized in the present work is the first real system of such type, where atoms of heavy metal Tl are arranged into the honeycomb structure stabilized by Rb atoms occupying the centers of the honeycomb units. Electronic properties of the (Tl, Rb)/Si(1 1 1)[Formula: see text] compound has been fully characterized experimentally and theoretically and compared with those of the hypothetical (Tl, H)/Si(1 1 1)[Formula: see text] prototype system. It is concluded that the QSH-insulator properties of the Tl-honeycomb layers on Si(1 1 1) surface are dictated by the stable adsorption sites occupied by Tl atoms which, in turn, are controlled by the atom species centering the Tl honeycombs. As a result, the real (Tl, Rb)/Si(1 1 1)[Formula: see text] compound where Tl atoms occupy the T4 sites does not possess QSH-insulator properties in contrast to the hypothetical (Tl, H)/Si(1 1 1)[Formula: see text] system where Tl atoms reside in the T1 (on-top) sites and it shows up as a QSH material.",3
Phonon fingerprints of CsPb2Br5.,"CsPb2Br5 is a stable, water-resistant, material derived from CsPbBr3 perovskite and featuring two-dimensional Pb-Br framework separated by Cs layers. Both compounds can coexist at nanolength scale, which often produces conflicting optical spectroscopy results. We present a complete set of polarized Raman spectra of nonluminescent CsPb2Br5 single crystals that reveals the symmetry and frequency of nondegenerate Raman active phonons accessible from the basal (0 0 1) plane. The experimental results are in good agreement with density functional perturbation theory simulations, which suggests that the calculated frequencies of yet unobserved double degenerate Raman and infrared phonons are also reliable. Unlike CsPbBr3, the lattice dynamics of CsPb2Br5 is stable as evidenced by the calculated phonon dispersion. The sharp Raman lines and lack of a dynamic-disorder-induced central peak in the spectra at room temperature indicate that the coupling of Cs anharmonic motion to Br atoms, known to cause the dynamic disorder in CsPbBr3, is absent in CsPb2Br5.",3
Boltzmann approach to spin-orbit-induced transport in effective quantum theories.,"In model studies of the spin/anomalous Hall effect, effective Hamiltonians often serve as the starting point. However, a complete effective quantum theory contains not only the effective Hamiltonian but also the relation linking the physical observables to the canonical ones. In this work we construct the semiclassical Boltzmann transport framework in the weak disorder-potential regime directly in the level of the effective quantum theory, and confirm this construction by formulating a generalized Kohn-Luttinger density matrix transport theory also in this level. The link and difference between the present theory and previous phenomenological Boltzmann, quantum kinetic and usual Kubo-Streda theories are clarified. In the application to a two-dimensional Rashba electron effective model, a nonzero spin Hall effect important in the case of strong Rashba coupling but neglected in previous theories is found.",3
Parity-breaking in single-element phases: ferroelectric-like elemental polar metals.,"Polar metals based on binary and ternary compounds have been demonstrated in literature. Here, we propose a design principle for ferroelectric-like elemental polar metals and relate it to real materials. The design principle is that, to be an elemental polar metal, atoms should occupy at least two inequivalent Wyckoff positions in a crystal with a polar space group, where inversion symmetry is spontaneously broken. According to this rule, we propose the first class of potential ferroelectric-like elemental polar metals in a distorted alpha-La-like structure with a polar space group P63 mc in which two inequivalent Wyckoff positions 2a (0, 0, z) and 2b (1/3, 2/3, z) are occupied by group-V elements (phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth). Analyses based on first-principles calculations indicate that the dynamically stable polar phase results from a lone pair driven polar distortion of the nonploar phase in P63/mmc symmetry where two inequivalent Wyckoff positions 2a (0, 0, 0) and 2c (1/3, 2/3, 1/4) are occupied. This ferroelectric-like transition involves a transition from a metallic state to a semimetallic state. These predicted polar phases are metastable with respect to their corresponding ground phases. Moreover, ionic bonding characters are found due to the inequivalence in Wyckoff positions between group-V atoms. Our work opens a route to single-element parity-breaking phases.",3
Evolution of the magnetic order of Fe and Eu sublattices in Eu1-x Ca x Fe2As2 (0 x 1) single crystals.,"Single crystals of Eu1-x Ca x Fe2As2 ([Formula: see text]) are grown using the high-temperature solution-growth method employing FeAs self-flux. Structural and chemical analysis indicates that these crystals are homogeneous and their lattice parameters exhibit a gradual monotonic decrease with increasing Ca concentration. Detailed magnetic, specific heat and resistivity data were used to construct a phase diagram which depicts the evolution of the structural/spin-density-wave transition at T 0, and of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering temperature of the Eu moments at T N. We found out that while T N decreases monotonically from 19.1 K (for x = 0) to below 2 K (for [Formula: see text]), T 0 remains almost constant up to x = x c and decreases steadily for higher values of x. Annealing at low temperatures for several days leads to enhancement of T N and T 0 by a few kelvin and sharpened the anomalies associated with these transitions. However, annealing did not change the variation of T N and T 0 across the series. The observation that T 0 is almost constant until the long-range AFM ordering of the Eu(2+) moments gets destroyed, suggests a subtle interrelationship between the Eu(2+) and Fe(2+) magnetic sublattices.",3
On the incorporation of iron into hexagonal barium titanate: I. electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) study.,"Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) investigations of BaTiO3 + 0.04 BaO + x/2 Fe2O3 (0.007 x 0.05) ceramics and BaTi0.98Fe0.02O3 single crystals were performed to study the incorporation of Fe ions in the hexagonal 6H-BaTiO3 lattice and their defect properties. The samples were characterized by x-ray diffraction and wavelength-dispersive x-ray electron probe microanalysis. EPR spectra were recorded both in X- and Q-bands at room temperature. Angle-dependent single crystal EPR investigations and simulations of the ceramic powder EPR spectra revealed three different centers, which can be attributed to Fe(3+) ions incorporated on crystallographically different Ti sites. Only one of them was already known before. Two spectra with axial symmetry belong to isolated Fe(3+) ions incorporated at Ti(1) sites (exclusively corner-sharing oxygen octahedra) and Ti(2) sites (face-sharing octahedra). The difference of their spectral parameters arises from the different trigonal distortions of the two types of octahedra. The third spectrum has orthorhombic symmetry and is caused by Fe(3+) centers associated with a nearest-neighbor charge-compensating oxygen vacancy. A model for the location of this associate is proposed.",3
Probing interface localization-delocalization transitions by colloids.,"Interface localization-delocalization transitions (ILDT) occur in two-phase fluids confined in a slit with competing preferences of the walls for the two fluid phases. At low temperatures the interface between the two phases is localized at one of the walls. Upon increasing temperature it unbinds. Although intensively studied theoretically and computationally, such transitions have not yet been observed experimentally due to severe challenges in resolving fine details of the fluid structure. Here, using mean field theory and Monte Carlo simulations of the Ising model, we propose to detect these ILDT by using colloids. We show that the finite-size and fluctuation induced force acting on a colloid confined in such a system experiences a vivid change if, upon lowering the temperature, the interface localizes at one of the walls. This change can serve as a more easily accessible experimental indicator of the transition.",3
Excitation energy transport with noise and disorder in a model of the selectivity filter of an ion channel.,"A selectivity filter is a gate in ion channels that is responsible for the selection and fast conduction of particular ions across the membrane (with high throughput rates of 10(8) ions s(-1) and a high 1:10(4) discrimination rate between ions). It is made of four strands as the backbone, and each strand is composed of sequences of five amino acids connected by peptide units H-N-C=O in which the main molecules in the backbone that interact with ions in the filter are carbonyl (C=O) groups that mimic the transient interactions of ion with binding sites during ion conduction. It has been suggested that quantum coherence and possible emergence of resonances in the backbone carbonyl groups may play a role in mediating ion conduction and selectivity in the filter. Here, we investigate the influence of noise and disorder on the efficiency of excitation energy transfer (EET) in a linear harmonic chain of N = 5 sites with dipole-dipole couplings as a simple model for one P-loop strand of the selectivity filter backbone in biological ion channels. We include noise and disorder inherent in real biological systems by including spatial disorder in the chain, and random noise within a weak coupling quantum master equation approach. Our results show that disorder in the backbone considerably reduces EET, but the addition of noise helps to recover high EET for a wide range of system parameters. Our analysis may help for better understanding of the coordination of ions in the filter as well as the fast and efficient functioning of the selectivity filters in ion channels.",3
Time-reversal symmetry-breaking in noncentrosymmetric superconductors.,"In this paper we examine the appearance of time-reversal symmetry-breaking (TRSB) states in the bulk and at the surface of a noncentrosymmetric superconductor. We utilize a Ginzburg-Landau theory, with coefficients derived from a microscopic model of the superconductor. We show that suppression of the triplet order parameter at the surface stabilizes a TRSB state by locally tuning the system into the bulk TRSB phase. We compare these results with those from centrosymmetric systems, and examine the appearance of a magnetization at the surface.",3
Spot-beam effect in grazing atom-surface collisions: from quantum to classical.,"Grazing incidence fast atom diffraction (GIFAD) is a sensitive tool for surface analysis, which strongly relies on the quantum coherence of the incident beam. In this article we study the spot-beam effect, due to contributions coming from different positions of the focus point of the incident particles, which affects the coherence of GIFAD spectra. We show that the influence of the spot-beam effect on GIFAD patterns depends on the width of the surface area that is coherently lighted by the atomic beam. While for extended illuminations the spot-beam contribution plays a minor role, when a narrow surface area is coherently lighted, the spot-beam effect allows projectiles to explore different zones of a single crystallographic channel, bringing to light intra-channel interference structures. In this last case the spot-beam effect gives also rise to a non-coherent background, which deteriorates the visibility of the interference structures. We found that by varying the impact energy, while keeping the same collimating setup, it is possible to switch gradually from quantum to classical projectile distributions. Present results are compared with available experimental data, making evident that the inclusion of focusing effects is necessary for the proper theoretical description of the experimental spectra.",3
Observation and interpretation of negative remanent magnetization and inverted hysteresis loops in a thin film of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3.,The observation of inverted magnetic hysteresis loops and negative magnetic remanence (NRM) in a 7.6 nm thin film of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 grown on SrTiO3 substrates is reported. The film was grown employing pulsed laser deposition and characterized by reflection high-energy electron diffraction during growth and using x-ray reflectivity measurements post-growth. Magnetic properties of the film were measured from 5 K to 400 K under both the field-cooled (FC) and zero-field-cooled (ZFC) conditions. The observed results of inverted magnetic hysteresis loops and NRM are interpreted in terms of the co-existence of a magnetically inhomogeneous region consisting of superparamagnetic spin clusters with a blocking temperature T B = 240 K and the ferromagnetic state with an ordering temperature T C = 290 K. Hysteresis loop inversion is observed in the temperature region of T B < T < T C whereas NRM appears in the mixed superparamagnetic and ferromagnetic states for T < T C down to 5 K. These observations of hysteresis loop inversion and NRM are related to the magneto-static interaction between the superparamagnetic and ferromagnetic phases leading to anti-alignment of spin of both magnetic phases with respect to each other.,3
Drude weight and superconducting weight.,"The Drude weight D (also called charge stiffness) measures the effective electron density contributing to dc conductivity; it vanishes in insulators. It is a general concept, which applies to any metal, including cases with disorder and electron-electron interaction. We provide a thorough analysis of D and of its meaning, both in the general case and in the special case of band metals, where we also show that D has a close relationship to orbital magnetization. The superconducting weight D s measures instead the superfluid density accounting for the Meissner effect. The two quantities D and D s are the main criteria to discriminate between insulators, metals, and superconductors.",3
A theoretical study of substitutional boron-nitrogen clusters in diamond.,"Substitutional clusters of multiple light element dopants are a promising route to the elusive shallow donor in diamond. To understand the behaviour of co-dopants, this report presents an extensive first principles study of possible clusters of boron and nitrogen. We use periodic hybrid density functional calculations to predict the geometry, stability and electronic excitation energies of a range of clusters containing up to five N and/or B atoms. Excitation energies from hybrid calculations are compared to those from the empirical marker method, and are in good agreement. When a boron-rich or nitrogen-rich cluster consists of three to five atoms, the minority dopant element-a nitrogen or boron atom respectively-can be in either a central or peripheral position. We find B-rich clusters are most stable when N sits centrally, whereas N-rich clusters are most stable with B in a peripheral position. In the former case, excitation energies mimic those of the single boron acceptor, while the latter produce deep levels in the band-gap. Implications for probable clusters that would arise in high-pressure high-temperature co-doped diamond and their properties are discussed.",3
Low lattice thermal conductivity and excellent thermoelectric behavior in Li3Sb and Li3Bi.,"Utilizing the first-principle calculations combined with Boltzmann transport equation and semiclassical analysis, we present a systematic investigation of the electron structure, lattice thermal conductivity [Formula: see text], Seebeck coefficient S, and the dimensionless figure of merit ZT of crystal Li3Sb and Li3Bi. The [Formula: see text] of 2.2 and 2.09 W m(-1) K(-1) are obtained at room temperature in Li3Sb and Li3Bi systems with the band gap of [Formula: see text] eV, respectively. The low [Formula: see text] can induce excellent thermoelectric properties. Thus the effect of doping on the transport properties has been judiciously researched and the maximum ZT of 2.42, 1.54 is obtained at 900 K in the p-type doped Li3Sb and p-type doped Li3Bi with the stable structures. Up to date, experimental finding of the maximum ZT is 2.6 at 850 K in the Cu2Se sample with 1 mol indium, our results are very close to this value. This letter provides insight into the thermal transport properties of Li3Sb and Li3Bi, meanwhile, supports that crystalline Li3Sb and Li3Bi may be promising materials for thermoelectric devices and application.",3
The low-temperature heat capacity of the Sb2Te3-x Se x solid solution from experiment and theory.,"The lattice dynamics of Sb2Te3-x Se x (x = 0, 0.6, 1.2, 1.8, 3) mixed crystals have been studied by a combination of low-temperature heat-capacity measurements between 2-300 K and first-principles calculations. The results from the experimental and theoretical investigations are in excellent agreement. While Sb2Se3 can be considered as a harmonic lattice oscillator in this temperature range, for the isostructural compounds Sb2Te3, Sb2Se0.6Te2.4, Sb2Se1.2Te1.8 and Sb2Se1.8Te1.2 (tetradymite structure type; R [Formula: see text] m) a small anharmonic contribution to the total heat capacity has to be taken into account at temperatures above 250 K. For the compounds which crystallize in the tetradymite structure type the experimental and theoretical data show unambiguously that the exchange of Te by Se leads to an increase of the bonding polarity and consequently to a hardening of the bonding which is reflected in an increase of the Debye temperatures with increasing Se contents. In addition, our studies clearly demonstrate that the mixed crystals in the stability field of the tetradymite structure type are characterized by a strong non-ideal mixing behavior.",3
"Antiferromagnetic spin-frustrated layers of corner-sharing Cu4 tetrahedra on the kagome lattice in volcanic minerals Cu5O2(VO4)2(CuCl), NaCu5O2(SeO3)2Cl3, and K2Cu5Cl8(OH)4.2H2O.","The objective of the present work was to analyze the possibility of realization of quantum spin liquids in three volcanic minerals-averievite (Cu5O2(VO4)2(CuCl)), ilinskite (NaCu5O2(SeO3)2Cl3), and avdononite (K2Cu5Cl8(OH)4.2H2O)-from the crystal chemistry point of view. Based on the structural data, the sign and strength of magnetic interactions have been calculated and the geometric frustrations serving as the main reason of the existence of spin liquids have been investigated. According to our calculations, the magnetic structures of averievite and ilinskite are composed of antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin-frustrated layers of corner-sharing Cu4 tetrahedra on the kagome lattice. However, the direction of nonshared corners of tetrahedra is different in them. The oxygen ions centering the OCu4 tetrahedra in averievite and ilinskite provide the main contribution to the formation of AFM interactions along the tetrahedra edges. The local electric polarization in averievite and the possibility of spin configuration fluctuations due to vibrations of tetrahedra-centering oxygen ions have been discussed. The existence of structural phase transitions accompanied with magnetic transitions was assumed in ilinskite because of the effect of a lone electron pair by Se(4+) ions. As was demonstrated through comparison of averievite and avdoninite, at the removal of centering oxygen ions from tetrahedra, the magnetic structure of the pyrochlore layer present in averievite transformed into an openwork curled net with large cells woven from corner-sharing open AFM spin-frustrated tetrahedra ('butterflies') in avdoninite.",3
Functionalization and passivation of ultrathin alumina films of defined sub-nanometer thickness with self-assembled monolayers.,"Instability of ultrathin surface oxides on alloys under environmental conditions can limit the opportunities for applications of these systems when the thickness control of the insulating oxide film is crucial for device performance. A procedure is developed to directly deposit self-assembled monolayers (SAM) from solvent onto substrates prepared under ultra-high vacuum conditions without exposure to air. As an example, rhenium photosensitizers functionalized with carboxyl linker groups are attached to ultrathin alumina grown on NiAl(1 1 0). The thickness change of the oxide layer during the SAM deposition is quantified by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and can be drastically reduced to one atomic layer. The SAM acts as a capping layer, stabilizing the oxide thin film under environmental conditions. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy elucidates the band alignment in the resulting heterostructure. The method for molecule attachment presented in this manuscript can be extended to a broad class of molecules vulnerable to pyrolysis upon evaporation and presents an elegant method for attaching molecular layers on solid substrates that are sensitive to air.",3
Metamagnetic transition and observation of spin-fluctuations in the antiferromagnetic Heusler compound Pd2MnIn.,"We report detailed investigations on the structural, magnetic, magneto-transport and calorimetric aspects of a partially ordered Heusler compound Pd2MnIn. The sample shows antiferomagnetic (AFM) state below around 120 K, though positive paramagnetic Curie temperature signifies a complex magnetic ground state with the presence of both ferromagnetic (FM) and AFM correlations. A clear spin-flop type metamagnetic transition is observed as evident from the magnetization and resistivity data. However, non-saturation of magnetization even at 145 kOe of applied field implies that the high field state may be a spin canted state, originating from the enhanced FM correlations by field induced conduction electron spin polarization. The sample shows a profound quadratic temperature dependence of resistivity below about 20-25 K indicating a spin-fluctuation dominated low temperature region. Previous electronic structure calculations show the existence of a subtle balance between superexchange mediated AFM state and an RKKY (Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yoshida) interaction mediated FM state in Pd2MnIn. Such competing AFM-FM correlations can be accounted for the observed spin fluctuations.",3
Analysis of optical data using extended Drude model and generalized Allen's formulas.,"Extended Drude model formalism has been successfully utilized for analyzing optical spectra of strongly correlated electron systems including heavy-fermion systems and high-T c superconducting iron pnictides and cuprates. Furthermore, generalized Allen's formulas have been developed and applied to extract the electron-boson spectral density function from measured optical data of high temperature superconductors including cuprates in various material phases. Here we used a reverse process to obtain various optical quantities starting from two typical electron-boson spectral density model functions for three intriguing (normal, pseudogap, and d-wave superconducting) material phases in cuprates. We also assigned the calculated optical results to designated regions in the phase diagram of hole-doped cuprates and compared them with the corresponding measured optical spectra of Bi2Sr2CaCu2 [Formula: see text] (Bi-2212). This comparison suggested that this way of optical data analysis can be a convincing method to study correlated electrons in the copper oxide superconductors and other superconducting systems as well.",3
Machine learning the many-body localization transition in random spin systems.,"The transition between thermal and many-body localized phases in isolated random spin systems are typically identified by the distribution of nearest level spacings. In this work, by employing machine learning methodology, we show this transition can be learnt through raw energy spectrum without any pre-processing. After achieving so in conventional random spin chain with differentiable level spacing distributions, we further construct novel models with misleading signatures of level spacing, and show machine can defeat the latter when training data is raw energy spectrum. Our work shows the low-level energy spectrum contains more information than level spacings, and can be captured by machine in a direct while efficient way, which makes it a promising new tool for studying a variety of isolated quantum systems.",3
Density functional theory for the crystallization of two-dimensional dipolar colloidal alloys.,"Two-dimensional mixtures of dipolar colloidal particles with different dipole moments exhibit extremely rich self-assembly behaviour and are relevant to a wide range of experimental systems, including charged and super-paramagnetic colloids at liquid interfaces. However, there is a gap in our understanding of the crystallization of these systems because existing theories such as integral equation theory and lattice sum methods can only be used to study the high temperature fluid phase and the zero-temperature crystal phase, respectively. In this paper we bridge this gap by developing a density functional theory (DFT), valid at intermediate temperatures, in order to study the crystallization of one and two-component dipolar colloidal monolayers. The theory employs a series expansion of the excess Helmholtz free energy functional, truncated at second order in the density, and taking as input highly accurate bulk fluid direct correlation functions from simulation. Although truncating the free energy at second order means that we cannot determine the freezing point accurately, our approach allows us to calculate ab initio both the density profiles of the different species and the symmetry of the final crystal structures. Our DFT predicts hexagonal crystal structures for one-component systems, and a variety of superlattice structures for two-component systems, including those with hexagonal and square symmetry, in excellent agreement with known results for these systems. The theory also provides new insights into the structure of two-component systems in the intermediate temperature regime where the small particles remain molten but the large particles are frozen on a regular lattice.",3
Generalization of Laughlin's theory for the fractional quantum Hall effect.,"Motivated by the structure of the quasiparticle wavefunction in the composite fermion (CF) theory for fractional quantum Hall filling factor [Formula: see text] (m odd), I consider a suitable quasiparticle operator in differential form, as a modified form of Laughlin's quasiparticle operator, that reproduces quasiparticle wave function as predicted in the CF theory, without a priori assumption of the presence of CFs. I further consider the conjugate of this operator as quasihole operator for obtaining a novel quasihole wave function for 1/m state. Each of these wave functions is interpreted as expelling an electron into a different Hilbert subspace from the original Hilbert space of the Laughlin condensate while still maintaining its correlation (although changed) with the electrons in the condensate such that the expelled electron behaves as a CF with respect to the electrons in the condensate. With this interpretation, I show that the ground state wavefunctions for general states at filling fractions [Formula: see text], respectively, can be constructed as coherent superposition of n coupled Laughlin condensates and their 'conjugates', formed at different Hilbert subspaces. The corresponding wave functions, specially surprising for [Formula: see text] sequence of states, are identical with those proposed in the theory of noninteracting CFs. The states which were considered as fractional quantum Hall effect of interacting CFs, can also be treated in the same footing as for the prominent sequences of states describing as the coupled condensates among which one is a non-Laughlin condensate in a different Hilbert subspace. Further, I predict that the half filling of the lowest Landau level is a quantum critical point for phase transition between two topologically distinct phases each corresponding to a family of states: one consists of large number of coupled Laughlin condensates of filling factor 1/3 and the other corresponds to large number of coupled conjugate Laughlin condensates of filling factor 1, which may be distinguished, respectively, by the absence and presence of upstream edge modes.",3
Time-dependent multiple barriers of the electric and exchange fields in silicene-like nanoribbons.,"We study the transport properties of the silicene nanoribbons subject to periodically driving electric and exchange fields. The multiple barriers made up of corresponding fields reshape the DC conductance by imposing pronounced both Fabry-Perot- and Fano-type resonances accompanied with high spin polarizations. In particular, a transport gap can be generated by the electric barriers with an appropriate strength, which is absent in the case of the barriers of the exchange field. The effects of the hybrid barriers including both electric and exchange fields, however, are not simply a mixture of two individual barriers, while depend on the relative phase of the time-varied barriers. In contrast to static barriers, the further studies of the driving frequency indicate that the in-gap states can survive in the transport gap for electric barriers as the frequency increases. This feature is particularly valuable for building spin-filter or spin-switcher devices.",3
Simple probability distributions on a Fock-space lattice.,"We consider some aspects of a standard model employed in studies of many-body localization: interacting spinless fermions with quenched disorder, for non-zero filling fraction, here on d-dimensional hypercubic lattices. The model may be recast as an equivalent tight-binding model on a 'Fock-space (FS) lattice' with an extensive local connectivity. In the thermodynamic limit exact results are obtained for the distributions of local FS coordination numbers, FS site-energies, and the density of many-body states. All such distributions are well captured by exact diagonalisation on the modest system sizes amenable to numerics. Care is however required in choosing the appropriate variance for the eigenvalue distribution, which has implications for reliable identification of mobility edges.",3
Interaction between in-gap states and carriers at the conductive interface between perovskite oxides.,"The 2D electron systems of SrTiO3/NdGaO3 (STO/NGO) and amorphous-LaAlO3/SrTiO3/NdGaO3 (a-LAO/STO/NGO) heterojunctions were explored. An obvious interaction between in-gap states (IGSs) and carriers was found. The IGSs can trap a large number of carriers and enhance carrier scattering. As a result of the high density of IGSs in STO, the conductivity of STO/NGO was severely weakened. However, for a-LAO/STO/NGO heterojunctions, the high carrier density can reduce the effect of IGSs through the electrostatic screening effect. The competition between IGSs and the screening effect of carriers results in an insulator-metal transition and a strange temperature dependence of carrier density. We also explored the interaction between IGSs and carriers theoretically. A mathematical description was proposed and the calculated results showed good agreement with experimental findings.",3
Strain-induced effects in zigzag-edged blue phosphorene nanoribbons with edge sulfur passivation.,"Motivated by the recent successful growth of quasi-free-standing single layer blue phosphorus (BlueP) on tellurium functionalized Au(1 1 1) by using black phosphorus as the precursor (Zhang et al 2016 Nano Lett. 16 4903; Gu et al 2017 ACS Nano 11 4943), here we study the strain performance for zigzag BlueP nanoribbons (zBluePNRs) with different edge chemical modifications. Based on the first-principles calculations, interestingly, we find that a narrow zBluePNR of width up to approximately 2 nm with edge sulfur (S) passivation under an uniaxial strain exhibits an important effect of negative Poisson's ratio because of the particularity of the P-S bonds at edges, and as the ribbon width further increases the Poisson's ratio varies from negative to positive. Meanwhile, the S-passivation also induces magnetism, and applying a strong enough strain can transfer this zBluePNR from magnetic metal state to half-metal one. All these physical properties are discussed in connection with the variation of microstructure of the ribbons. Our findings may paving the way for both a fundamental understanding of nanoscale physics and applied device engineering.",3
Geometric constraints during epithelial jamming.,"As an injury heals, an embryo develops, or a carcinoma spreads, epithelial cells systematically change their shape. In each of these processes cell shape is studied extensively whereas variability of shape from cell-to-cell is regarded most often as biological noise. But where do cell shape and its variability come from? Here we report that cell shape and shape variability are mutually constrained through a relationship that is purely geometrical. That relationship is shown to govern processes as diverse as maturation of the pseudostratified bronchial epithelial layer cultured from non-asthmatic or asthmatic donors, and formation of the ventral furrow in the Drosophila embryo. Across these and other epithelial systems, shape variability collapses to a family of distributions that is common to all. That distribution, in turn, is accounted for by a mechanistic theory of cell-cell interaction showing that cell shape becomes progressively less elongated and less variable as the layer becomes progressively more jammed. These findings suggest a connection between jamming and geometry that spans living organisms and inert jammed systems, and thus transcends system details. Although molecular events are needed for any complete theory of cell shape and cell packing, observations point to the hypothesis that jamming behavior at larger scales of organization sets overriding geometrical constraints.",3
Spin excitation spectrum of high-temperature cuprate superconductors from finite cluster simulations.,"A cluster of spins 1/2 of a finite size can be regarded as a basic building block of a spin texture in high-temperature cuprate superconductors. If this texture has the character of a network of weakly coupled spin clusters, then spin excitation spectra of finite clusters are expected to capture the principal features of the experimental spin response. We calculate spin excitation spectra of several clusters of spins 1/2 coupled by Heisenberg interaction. We find that the calculated spectra exhibit a high degree of variability representative of the actual phenomenology of cuprates, while, at the same time, reproducing a number of important features of the experimentally measured spin response. Among such features are the spin gap, the broad peak around [Formula: see text] approximately (40-70) meV and the sharp peak at zero frequency. The latter feature emerges due to transitions inside the ground-state multiplet of the so-called 'uncompensated' clusters with an odd number of spins.",3
Finsler geometry modeling and Monte Carlo study of liquid crystal elastomers under electric fields.,"The shape transformation of liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) under external electric fields is studied through Monte Carlo simulations of models constructed on the basis of Finsler geometry (FG). For polydomain side-chain-type LCEs, it is well known that the external-field-driven alignment of the director is accompanied by an anisotropic shape deformation. However, the mechanism of this deformation is quantitatively still unclear in some part and should be studied further from the microscopic perspective. In this paper, we evaluate whether this shape deformation is successfully simulated, or in other words, quantitatively understood, by the FG model. The FG assumed inside the material is closely connected to the directional degrees of freedom of LC molecules and plays an essential role in the anisotropic transformation. We find that the existing experimental data on the deformations of polydomain LCEs are in good agreement with the Monte Carlo results. It is also found that experimental diagrams of strain versus external voltage of a monodomain LCE in the nematic phase are well described by the FG model.",3
Detection and tracking of anisotropic core-shell colloids.,"Optical microscopy techniques with three dimensional (3D) resolution are powerful tools for the real-space imaging of the structure and dynamics of colloidal systems. While real-space imaging of spherical particles is well established, the observation of shape anisotropic particles has only recently met a lot of interest. Apart from translation, shape anisotropic particles also possess additional rotational degrees of freedom. In this manuscript, we introduce a novel technique to find the position and the orientation of anisotropic particles in 3D. It is based on an algorithm which is applicable to core-shell particles consisting of a spherical core and a shell with arbitrary shape. We demonstrate the performance of this algorithm using PMMA/PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate) core-shell ellipsoids. The algorithm is tested on artificial images and on experimental data. The correct identification of particle positions with subpixel accuracy and of their orientations with high angular precision in dilute and dense systems is shown. In addition, we developed an advanced particle tracking algorithm that takes both translational and rotational movements of the anisotropic particles into account. We show that our 3D detection and tracking technique is suitable for the accurate and reliable detection of large and dense colloidal systems containing several thousands of particles.",3
A spin dephasing mechanism mediated by the interplay between the spin-orbit coupling and the asymmetrical confining potential in a semiconductor quantum dot.,"Understanding the spin dephasing mechanism is of fundamental importance in all potential applications of the spin qubit. Here we demonstrate a spin dephasing mechanism in a semiconductor quantum dot due to the 1/f charge noise. The spin-charge interaction is mediated by the interplay between the spin-orbit coupling and the asymmetrical quantum dot confining potential. The dephasing rate is proportional to both the strength of the spin-orbit coupling and the degree of the asymmetry of the confining potential. For parameters typical of the InSb, InAs, and GaAs quantum dots with a moderate well-height [Formula: see text] meV, we find the spin dephasing times are [Formula: see text] mus, 275 mus, and 55 ms, respectively. In particular, the spin dephasing can be enhanced by lowering the well-height. When the well-height is as small as [Formula: see text] meV, the spin depahsing times in the InSb, InAs, and GaAs quantum dots are decreased to [Formula: see text] mus, 18 mus, and 9 ms, respectively.",3
Self-assembling structural colour in nature.,"The diversity and vividness of structural colour in the natural world have been recognised as far back as William Hooke in the 17th century. Whilst it is only recently that advances in the field have revealed the elegance and finesse of the physics used to create these effects. In this topical review we will highlight some of the structures and effects responsible for colour in butterfly scales, bird feathers, plants, insects and beetle elytra that have been studied to date. We will discuss the structures responsible and look at similarities and differences in these structures between species. This will be alongside our current understanding of how these are created biologically, how they develop structurally and what control mechanisms nature has at its disposal to control structure formation.",3
Topological phases in nodeless tetragonal superconductors.,"We compute the topological phase diagram of 2D tetragonal superconductors for the only possible nodeless pairing channels compatible with that crystal symmetry. Subject to a Zeeman field and spin-orbit coupling, we demonstrate that these superconductors show surprising topological features: non-trivial high Chern numbers, massive edge states, and zero-energy modes out of high symmetry points, even though the edge states remain topologically protected. Interestingly, one of these pairing symmetries, [Formula: see text], has been proposed to describe materials such as water-intercalated sodium cobaltates, bilayer silicene or highly doped monolayer graphene, which opens the way for further applications of our results.",3
A unified and efficient theory for the structural properties of actinides and phases of plutonium.,"We show that a calculation using density functional theory (DFT) in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) supplemented by an explicit Coulomb interaction term between correlated electrons (GGA+U), can accurately describe structural properties of (1) the room temperature phases of U, Np, Pu, Am and Cm, and (2) the alpha, beta, gamma, delta and phases of plutonium, as does the combination of GGA with dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). It thus changes the view on the role of electronic interaction in these systems and opens the way to fast calculations of structural properties in actinides metallic system. We use ab initio values of effective Coulomb interactions and underline that Hund's exchange and spin-orbit coupling are of utmost importance in these calculations. Secondly, we show that phonons properties in delta plutonium are impacted by strong interactions. The GGA+DMFT results exhibits a lattice instability for the transverse (1 1 1) phonon mode. Moreover the amplitude of this lattice instability is consistent with the experimental temperature of stability of this phase. Our calculation thus shows that when the delta phase is thermodynamically unstable (at 0 K), it is also dynamically unstable.",3
Electronic correlations in cerium's high-pressure phases.,"Under high pressure, cerium exhibits three distinct phases, namely [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and -cerium. It is unclear whether the 4f electronic correlations will play a vital role in these phases or not. By utilizing the combination of traditional density functional theory and single-site dynamical mean-field theory, we tried to calculate the electronic structures of cerium's high-pressure phases. Their momentum-resolved spectral functions, total and 4f partial density of states, local self-energy functions, and 4f electronic configurations were exhaustively studied. The calculated results show that the correlated 4f bands strongly hybridize with the conducting spd bands around the Fermi level. The Matsubara self-energy functions exhibit Fermi-liquid like characteristic in the low-frequency regime. In addition, the fluctuations among the 4f atomic eigenstates are somewhat prominent (especially for the phase), which lead to slight modification of the 4f occupancy. It is suggested that the 4f electrons in these phases tend to be itinerant.",3
Observation of intrinsic dark exciton in Janus-MoSSe heterosturcture induced by intrinsic electric field.,"The nature of exciton in heterostructure exhibits distinct properties, which makes heterostructure a promising candidate for valleytronic and optoelectronic applications. Therefore, understanding of exciton behaviour in heterostructure is the key approach to design novel devices. Here, we investigate the electronic properties including quasiparticle-energy calculations (on the level of the GW approximation) and optical properties (on the level of the Bethe-Salpeter equation) of Janus-MoSSe based heterostructure. Our results show that the build-in electric field caused by spontaneous polarization of Janus-MoSSe monolayer can significantly affect the interlayer interactions within the heterostructure, giving rise to a bright-to-dark exciton transition. To shed light on this phenomenon, a theoretical model is developed, which illustrates that the dark exciton can be ascribed to a coherence cancellation at the band edge positions induced by the strong interlayer coupling. Our findings may provide a new way for modulating and developing of van der Waals heterostructure that have applications in valleytronic and optoelectronic devices.",3
Phagraphene nanoribbons: half-metallicity and magnetic phase transition by functional groups and electric field.,"Magnetic nanomaterials with the desirable nature are the basis for developing future spintronic devices, and research for them is of fundamental interest. Here, we explore the realization of half-metallicity and magnetic phase transition for phagraphene nanoribbons in virtue of functional groups (OH and CN) with different coverage fractions and external electric fields. The first-principles calculations show that a single-edge CN functionalization only makes a intrinsic spin-degenerate semiconducting ribbon converted to a quasi-metal or metal, while a single-edge OH modification leads to an occurrence of the half-semiconducting nature regardless of the coverage fraction of groups. Interestingly, the half-metal behavior for the CN and OH double-edge modified ribbons can be achieved either in the zero-electric-field intrinsic state for most of functionalized systems or at a very low electric field, 0.1 V A(-1). More importantly, the observed critical electric field for the transition from ferromagnetic to nonmagnetic phase is lowered significantly almost for all systems, this benefits to design a low electric-field-controlling magnetic switch which can reversibly work between both magnetic and nonmagnetic states. The calculated Gibbs free energy confirms that the group-modified ribbons generally hold a more favorable energy stability in most of the cases, facilitating likely experimental realization.",3
Magnetocrystalline and magnetoelastic constants determined by magnetization dynamics under static strain.,"We consider here the magnetization dynamics induced in a ferromagnet by magnetoelastic coupling, after application of a step like strain. We derive the time evolution of the magnetization vector. We show that the material micromagnetic parameters (and specifically magnetic anisotropy and magnetoelastic coupling) can be derived from measurable quantities, i.e. the precession frequency, relaxation time and phase lag between the precession angles. Such measurements can be performed by state of the art time resolved Kerr experiments.",3
Zitterbewegung near new Dirac points in graphene superlattices.,"New Dirac points may appear when periodic potentials are applied to graphene, and there are many interesting effects near them. Here we investigate the Zitterbewegung effect of fermions described by a Gaussian wave packet in graphene superlattice near these points. The Zitterbewegung near different Dirac points has similar characteristics, while fermions near new ones have different group velocities in both x- and y-direction, which causes the different properties of the Zitterbewegung near them. We also investigate the Zitterbewegung effect influenced by multi Dirac points, and get the evolution with changing potential. Our results suggest that graphene superlattice may provide an appropriate system to study the Zitterbewegung effect near new Dirac points experimentally.",3
Newton's second law in spin-orbit torque.,"Spin-orbit torque (SOT) refers to the excitation of magnetization dynamics via spin-orbit coupling (SOC) under the application of a charged current. In this work, we introduce a simple and intuitive description of the SOT in terms of spin force. In Rashba SOC system, the damping-like SOT can be expressed as [Formula: see text], in analogy to the classical torque-force relation, where R c is the effective radius characterizing the Rashba splitting in the momentum space. As a consequence, the magnetic energy is transferred to the conduction electrons, which dissipates through Joule heating at a rate of [Formula: see text], with j e being the applied current. Finally, we propose an experimental verification of our findings via measurement of the anisotropic magnetoresistance effect.",3
Properties of homo- and hetero-Schottky junctions from first principle calculations.,"Electronic structure calculations for a homo-material semimetal (thick Sn)/semiconductor (thin Sn) heterodimensional junction and two conventional metal (Ag or Pt)/silicon hetero-material junctions are performed. Charge distributions and local density of states are examined to compare the physics of junctions formed by quantum confinement in a homo-material, heterodimensional semimetal junction with that of conventional Schottky hetero-material junctions. Relative contributions to the Schottky barrier heights are described in terms of the interface dipoles arising due to charge transfer at the interface and the effects of metal induced gap states extending into the semiconducting regions. Although the importance of these physical mechanisms vary for the three junctions, a single framework describing the junction energetics captures the behaviors of both the heterodimensional semimetal junction and the more conventional metal/semiconductor junctions.",3
Numerical analysis of the notional area in cold field electron emission from arrays.,"The notional area of field emission is an important parameter to correlate characteristic current density to the emission current, linking field emission theories to experimental observations. Recently, it has been reported that the notional area of emission contributes to the high brightness of large diameter emitters. Thus, it is necessary to understand how the notional area of emission depends on physical and geometrical parameters. In this work, we carried out numerical simulations to evaluate the notional area, A n, considering cold field electron emission from a hemisphere on a cylindrical post (HCP) emitter in an array. An HCP is suitable to model classically carbon nanotubes or carbon nanofibres-like emitters. We provide the dependence of A n on a wide range of physical and geometrical parameters, namely: the separation between the HCP emitters, the aspect ratio, radius, local work function and the macroscopic emission current. We explain the behavior of A n as a function of these parameters and show in which cases A n can be considered nearly constant. Our numerical results are within the framework of the standard Fowler-Nordheim (FN) theory and can simplify the modeling of the field emission phenomenon, because it directly relates simulation predictions to the currents observable experimentally. Also, this work provides information for experimentalists that can be useful to check the validity of the Schottky-Nordheim (SN) barrier upon the elementary FN theory.",3
Thermal neutron scattering cross sections of (238)U and (235)U in the gamma phase.,"The development of metallic, low-enrichment uranium fuels requires accurate prediction of their neutron transport properties and reactivity parameters, which in turn require thermal neutron scattering data. Accurate prediction of thermal neutron scattering data, including thermal cross sections, requires knowledge of the phonon scattering properties of the medium, but such matrix binding effects in next-generation fuels such as U-Mo, U-Zr, and U-Si are typically neglected because these effects are often difficult to measure or calculate. Using molecular dynamics simulations with previously published interatomic potentials, we calculate the phonon dispersion relations and phonon densities of states for (235)U and (238)U in the alpha and gamma phases. The performance of these potentials was evaluated using published ab initio simulation data and inelastic neutron scattering data. The phonon densities of states obtained by each potential were then utilized to calculate the thermal neutron scattering cross sections of (235)U and (238)U at 1113 K using the NJOY program. The resulting thermal neutron scattering cross sections are assessed by comparison to data obtained from available experimental densities of states. The cross sections generated show how the addition of binding effects decreases the cross section by up to a factor of six over the free-atom model. A definite effect on reactivity is also demonstrated by the use of these thermal libraries on a simple core model. As a consequence, the cross sections generated in this work provide a better description of the true cross section than the free-atom data currently available. We also discuss the sensitivity of the thermal scattering cross sections to the phonon density of states.",3
Screening mixing GW/Bethe-Salpeter approach for triplet states of organic molecules.,"We recently proposed a screening mixing many-body ansatz (Ziaei and Bredow 2017 Phys. Rev. B 96 195115) to decrease the typical overestimation of the Hartree-Fock based GW/Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) singlet-singlet excitation energies in molecular systems. Now we have evaluated the accuracy of the proposed scheme for triplet states of a set of 20 organic molecules known as the Thiel set. We show that by mixing different screenings into GW and BSE calculated within random phase approximation (in order to ensure best gap and an optimal exciton binding energy), the total mean absolute error of 0.59 eV in the standard Hartree-Fock based eigenvalue GW/BSE approach is reduced to 0.26 eV for 63 triplet states. We further demonstrate that the quasi-particle self-consistent GW/BSE approach in which orbitals and energies are updated in the Green's function and the dynamically screened interaction mostly and considerably underestimates the excitation energies as shown for a few molecules.",3
Heisenberg-Ising delta-chain with bond alternation.,The spin-[Formula: see text] delta-chain (sawtooth chain) with antiferromagnetic Heisenberg basal chain and Ising apical-basal interactions is studied. The basal-apical interactions involve the bond alternation. The limiting cases of the model include the symmetrical delta-chain and the antiferromagnetic chain in the staggered magnetic field. We study ground state properties of the model by the exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group methods. The ground state phase diagram as a function of the bond alternation consists of magnetic and various non-magnetic phases. All phases excluding the ferrimagnetic phase are gapped and an origin of the gaps is cleared.,3
Magneto-elastic switching of magnetostrictive nanomagnets with in-plane anisotropy: the effect of material defects.,"We theoretically study the effect of a material defect (material void) on switching errors associated with magneto-elastic switching of magnetization in elliptical magnetostrictive nanomagnets having in-plane magnetic anisotropy. We find that the error probability increases significantly in the presence of the defect, indicating that magneto-elastic switching is particularly vulnerable to material imperfections. Curiously, there is a critical stress value that gives the lowest error probability in both defect-free and defective nanomagnets. The critical stress is much higher in defective nanomagnets than in defect-free ones. Since it is more difficult to generate the critical stress in small nanomagnets than in large nanomagnets (having the same energy barrier for thermal stability), it would be a challenge to downscale magneto-elastically switched nanomagnets in memory and other applications where reliable switching is required. This is likely to be further exacerbated by the presence of defects.",3
Manifestation of topological transitions in a multi-terminal Josephson junction.,"We study nonequilibrium (NE) transport in four-terminal (three-terminal) topological superconductor (SC)-quantum dot (QD) topological superconductor junctions, where the QD is connected via tunneling barriers to the two TS leads and two (one) normal leads (N), respectively. For the four-terminal junction, we find that when increasing the Zeeman field from 0 to a critical value, the supercurrent profile evolves from a typical s-wave pattern to a pure p-wave pattern. In addition, by analyzing the zero-phase difference supercurrent as a function of voltage [Formula: see text] applied to the normal leads and the Zeeman field h applied to the SC, the low-momentum gap [Formula: see text] can be inferred by utilizing the fact that the emergence of a tunneling-induced current should be satisfied under the condition [Formula: see text]. For the three-terminal junction, the NE supercurrent can reveal the quasi-Andreev bound state by exploiting the Andreev reflection process-induced current occurring between the N and SC. Our findings provide an arguably easier route for manifesting the topological phase transition by observing the gap collapse and then reopening as the Zeeman field increases through multi-terminal NE transport.",3
A model of defect cluster creation in fragmented cascades in metals based on morphological analysis.,"The impacts of ions and neutrons in metals cause cascades of atomic collisions that expand and shrink, leaving microstructure defect debris, i.e. interstitial or vacancy clusters or loops of different sizes. In De Backer et al (2016 Europhys. Lett. 115 26001), we described a method to detect the first morphological transition, i.e. the cascade fragmentation in subcascades, and a model of primary damage combining the binary collision approximation and molecular dynamics (MD). In this paper including W, Fe, Be, Zr and 20 other metals, we demonstrate that the fragmentation energy increases with the atomic number and decreases with the atomic density following a unique power law. Above the fragmentation energy, the cascade morphology can be characterized by the cross pair correlation functions of the multitype point pattern formed by the subcascades. We derive the numbers of pairs of subcascades and observed that they follow broken power laws. The energy where the power law breaks indicates the second morphological transition when cascades are formed by branches decorated by chaplets of small subcascades. The subcascade interaction is introduced in our model of primary damage by adding pairwise terms. Using statistics obtained on hundreds of MD cascades in Fe, we demonstrate that the interaction of subcascades increases the proportion of large clusters in the damage created by high energy cascades. Finally, we predict the primary damage of 500 keV Fe ion in Fe and obtain cluster size distributions when large statistics of MD cascades are not feasible.",3
High-throughput assessment of vacancy formation and surface energies of materials using classical force-fields.,"In this work, we present an open access database for surface and vacancy-formation energies using classical force-fields (FFs). These quantities are essential in understanding diffusion behavior, nanoparticle formation and catalytic activities. FFs are often designed for a specific application, hence, this database allows the user to understand whether a FF is suitable for investigating particular defect and surface-related material properties. The FF results are compared to density functional theory and experimental data whenever applicable for validation. At present, we have 17 506 surface energies and 1000 vacancy formation energies calculation in our database and the database is still growing. All the data generated, and the computational tools used, are shared publicly at the following websites: www.ctcms.nist.gov/~knc6/periodic.html, https://jarvis.nist.gov and https://github.com/usnistgov/jarvis. Approximations used during the high-throughput calculations are clearly mentioned. Using some of the example cases, we show how our data can be used to directly compare different FFs for a material and to interpret experimental findings such as using Wulff construction for predicting equilibrium shape of nanoparticles. Similarly, the vacancy formation energies data can be useful in understanding diffusion related properties.",3
Quantum vortex melting and superconductor insulator transition in a 2D Josephson junction array in a perpendicular magnetic field via diffusion Monte Carlo.,"In this study, we simulated a quantum rotor model describing a Josephson junction array (JJA) in the phase representation at zero temperature in a perpendicular magnetic field [Formula: see text] (in units of [Formula: see text]) on a [Formula: see text] square lattice with spacing a for [Formula: see text]. The superconductor-insulator transition (SIT) is tuned by the ratio of charging energy to Josephson coupling, U/J. Abrupt drops in the magnetization values were observed in the bigger lattices at certain values of B and U/J caused by the formation of vortices. Increasing U/J at a fixed B field causes quantum vortex melting. The magnetization drops to zero around [Formula: see text] indicating SIT. For B = 0.1 the SIT occurs without an intermediate vortex state and the magnetization scales as [Formula: see text], whereas for B = 0.4 the scaling is [Formula: see text] during the vortex melting. For B between 0.1 and 0.4 the scaling is not clear. We used the diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method with a guiding wavefunction optimized using the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method. The ground state energy is calculated easily in DMC and its error estimates were generally smaller than [Formula: see text], both with and without the guiding wavefunction. Quantities like magnetization and vorticity that do not commute with the Hamiltonian were calculated using an efficient forward walking algorithm. Their estimates are affected severely in absence of the guiding wavefunction. With the guiding wavefunction, errors for the magnetization were generally less than [Formula: see text] and going up to [Formula: see text] percent around the phase transition from the Meissner to the vortex state, and without the guiding wavefunction errors were generally higher than [Formula: see text] and going up to [Formula: see text] around the critical point.",3
Anomalous conductance quantization in the inter-band gap of a one-dimensional channel.,"We report on a singular departure from the canonical step sequence of quantized conductance in a ballistic, quasi-one-dimensional metallic channel. Ideally in such a structure each sub-band population contributes its conductance quantum independently of the rest. In a picture based exclusively on coherent single-carrier transmission, unitary back-scattering may lower a conductance step below ideal but it is not possible for it to enhance it beyond the ideal conductance quantum. Precisely such an anomalous and robust voltage-dependent enhancement has already been observed over the whole density range between sub-band thresholds (de Picciotto R et al 2004 Phys. Rev. Lett. 92 036805, de Picciotto R et al 2008 J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 20 164204), a phenomenon left unexplained till now. We show theoretically that the anomalous enhancement of the ideal conductance is the hallmark of carrier transitions coupling the discrete sub-bands.",3
Dynamics of a single hole in the Heisenberg-Kitaev model: a self-consistent Born approximation study.,"The magnetic properties of 4d and 5d transition-metal insulating compounds with the honeycomb structure are believed to be described by the Heisenberg-Kitaev model, which contains both the isotropic Heisenberg interaction J and anisotropic Kitaev interaction K. In this paper, we study the single-hole propagation of the t-J-K model in various magnetically ordered phases by the self-consistent Born approximation. We find that there are low-energy coherent quasiparticle (QP) excitations in all of these phases which appear firstly around the K point in the first Brillouin zone (BZ), but the bandwidths of these QPs are very small due to the hole-magnon coupling. Interestingly, in the zigzag phase relevant to recent experiments, though the QP weights are largely suppressed in the physical spectra in the first BZ, we find that they recover in the extended BZs. Moreover, our results reveal that the low-energy QP spectra are reduced with the increase of K.",3
Antiferromagnetic successive superexchange interactions underlying ferromagnetic couplings in codoped diluted magnetic semiconductors.,"Our recent works have revealed that the magnetic coupling among the magnetic codopants in diluted magnetic semiconductors and doped transition metal oxides has a strong local feature. This was attributed to successive spin polarizations induced by the codopants to their neighboring anion ligands. In the present work, we analyze and refine the successive spin polarization based magnetic coupling using results of ab initio calculations and assign the magnetic coupling among the magnetic codopants to a combination of superexchange and double-exchange interactions. In particular, it is shown that antiferromagnetic successive superexchange interactions can lead to a ferromagnetic coupling between two magnetic dopants mediated by a suitable codopant with the latter forming a ferromagnetic double exchange coupling with its first nearest neighbor anions which couple it with the magnetic cations. This is exemplified by ab initio results for the magnetic coupling of two Co-dopants in the presence of a mediated Cu codopant in the environment of various hosts, namely ZnO, GaN, GaP, TiO2, CdS and SnO2. Additional results for other codopant pairs in various hosts are also presented.",3
"Confinement effects, surface effects, and transport in Bi and Bi1-x Sb x semiconducting and semimetallic nanowires.","Hicks and Dresselhaus predicted that quantum well and nanowire thermoelectric materials could show a meaningful enhancement of the heat-to-electricity conversion efficiency compared to their bulk counterparts. The unique transport properties of bismuth, specifically the low effective mass, high mobility, and large Bohr radius of its charge carriers, enabled the study of size-quantization effects in Bi nanowires following those theoretical predictions. In this review, the band structure of Bi and Bi1-x Sb x alloys is discussed as a function of their composition, temperature, and size-quantization effects. Further, the theoretical basis of the thermoelectric performance enhancement in Bi nanowires is reviewed and compared to experimental data. Single-wire conductivity and Hall data are reviewed. Finally, several synthesis routes for Bi1-x Sb x nanowire samples are discussed, including liquid pressure impregnation, vapor impregnation, electrochemical deposition and wet chemistry impregnation in a template.",3
Crystal growth and magnetic characterization of HoIr2Si2 (I4/mmm).,"Single crystals of HoIr2Si2 with the body-centered ThCr2Si2-type structure (I4/mmm) were grown by Bridgman method from indium flux. Single crystal structure determination yielded a Si-z position of 0.378(1) in the structure. We excluded the presence of the high temperature phase with the primitive CaBe2Ge2-type structure (P4/nmm) by powder x-ray diffraction. Magnetic measurements on the single crystals yield a Neel temperature of [Formula: see text] K. In the inverse magnetic susceptibility a strong anisotropy with Weiss temperatures [Formula: see text] K and [Formula: see text] K occurs above T N. The effective magnetic moment [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] is close to the expected value for a free Ho(3+) ion, [Formula: see text]. The field dependent magnetization shows a step-like behaviour due to crystalline electric field effects. The temperature and field dependence of the magnetization hint to the ordering of the magnetic moments along the c direction below T N.",3
Pressure-induced enhancement in the superconductivity of ZrTe3.,"We report the superconductivity enhancement of ZrTe3 on compression up to 33 GPa. The superconducting transition occurs above 4.1 GPa and the superconducting temperature (T C) increases with pressure in further compression, reaching a maximum of 7.1 K at ~28 GPa. An anomalous change of superconducting temperature is seen in the compression above 21 GPa. No structural phase transition is observed in the whole compression up to 36 GPa, but a subtle change in structural parameter is seen between 17-19 GPa, which seems relevant to the anomalous increase in the superconducting temperature. First-principle calculations reveal that the density of states at the Fermi level increases with pressure, which explains the enhancement of T C in ZrTe3 under compression.",3
Extended stability range of the non-Fermi liquid phase in UCoAl.,"High pressure was used to investigate the stability of the non-Fermi liquid (NFL) state, observed in electrical resistivity of uranium-based band metamagnet UCoAl in a pure form (paramagnet) or with Fe substitution (ferromagnetic ground state), both in a single-crystal form. By combining the pressure variations of magnetization and resitivity in these materials the phase diagram for UCoAl had been constructed. The band metamagnet transforms into the ferromagnetic state as the critical metamagnetic field is reduced to zero by the lattice expansion analogous to the negative pressure. Within the same diagram, the increasing hydrostatic pressure drives the critical metamagnetic field upwards while reducing the magnetization increment at the transition. The NFL state persists to about 4-5 GPa. Although spin fluctuations play an important role in the character of UCoAl, they do not exhibit any criticality in the sense of divergence of parameters describing the resistivity around the Ferro-NFL phase transition, which is of the first order type.",3
Phase diagram for the Harper model of the honeycomb lattice.,"The Harper equation arising out of a tight-binding model of electrons on a honeycomb lattice subject to a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to the plane is studied. Contrasting and complementary approaches involving von Neumann entropy, fidelity, fidelity susceptibility, and multifractal analysis are employed to characterize the phase diagram. Remarkably even in the absence of the quasi-periodic on-site potential term, the Hamiltonian allows for a metal-insulator transition. The phase diagram consists of three phases: two metallic phases and an insulating phase. A variant model where next nearest neighbor hopping is included, exhibits a mobility edge and does not allow for a simple single phase diagram characterizing all the eigenstates.",3
"Ground-state structures, physical properties and phase diagram of carbon-rich nitride C5N.","Using the ab initio evolutionary algorithm, four thermodynamically stable C5N phases ([Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]-1, [Formula: see text]-2 and C2/m) are uncovered. The structures of the [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]-1 and [Formula: see text]-2 phases possess layered features. The dense C2/m phase with 3D strong covalent bond network is calculated to be superhard with hardness of 75.4 and 83.9 GPa by Chen and Gao models. The electronic properties of the C5N is diverse including conductor ([Formula: see text]), indirect semiconductor ([Formula: see text]-1 and [Formula: see text]-2) and direct semiconductor (C2/m). Pressure-induced phase transition sequences and critical pressure points are calculated to be [Formula: see text] --> [Formula: see text]-1 --> [Formula: see text]-2 at 2.7 and 34 GPa, respectively. Though the C2/m phase is metastable at zero temperature, our established pressure-temperature phase diagram of C5N shows that the C2/m becomes stable under high temperatures and pressures. The pressure-temperature phase diagram will give theoretical guidance for further experimental synthesis of different C5N phases.",3
Magnetic and energetic properties of transition metal doped alumina.,"A doped non-diamagnetic alumina (Al2O3) would enable the usage of cutting edge technology, such as magnetoforming, to create advanced systems that take advantage of the high chemical and physical resilience of alumina. This study elucidates the magnetic properties of Cr, Fe, Ni, and Cu doped alpha- and vartheta-alumina. Density functional theory was used to predict the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of doped alumina, as well as its stability. The results indicate that the dopant species and coordination environment are the most important factors in determining the spin density distribution and net magnetic moment, which will strongly direct the ability of the doped alumina to couple with an external field. Similar coordination environments in different phases produce similar spin densities and magnetic moments, indicating that the results presented in this work may be generalizable to the other five or more phases of alumina not studied here.",3
Uniaxial and hydrostatic pressure effects in alpha-RuCl3 single crystals via thermal-expansion measurements.,"We present high-resolution thermal-expansion and specific-heat measurements of single crystalline alpha-RuCl3. An extremely hysteretic structural transition expanding over 100 K is observed by thermal-expansion along both crystallographic axes, which we attribute to a change of stacking sequence of the RuCl3 layers. Three magnetic transitions are observed, which we link to the different stacking sequences. Using our data and thermodynamic relations, we derive the uniaxial and hydrostatic pressure derivatives of all three magnetic transitions. Our results demonstrate that magnetic order of the major transition at approximately 7 K should be totally suppressed by very moderate pressures of 0.3 GPa. Finally, we discuss why our results differ from recent hydrostatic pressure measurements and suggest a possible route to reaching the spin-liquid state in alpha-RuCl3.",3
Confined states in graphene quantum blisters.,"Bilayer graphene samples may exhibit regions where the two layers are locally delaminated forming a so-called quantum blister in the graphene sheet. Electron and hole states can be confined in this graphene quantum blisters (GQB) by applying a global electrostatic bias. We scrutinize the electronic properties of these confined states under the variation of interlayer bias, coupling, and blister's size. The spectra display strong anti-crossings due to the coupling of the confined states on upper and lower layers inside the blister. These spectra are layer localized where the respective confined states reside on either layer or equally distributed. For finite angular momentum, this layer localization can be at the edge of the blister and corresponds to degenerate modes of opposite momenta. Furthermore, the energy levels in GQB exhibit electron-hole symmetry that is sensitive to the electrostatic bias. Finally, we demonstrate that confinement in GQB persists even in the presence of a variation in the inter-layer coupling.",3
"Forcing substitution of tantalum by copper in 1T-TaS2: synthesis, structure and electronic properties of 1T-Cu x Ta1-x S2.","We investigated the compound 1T-Cu x Ta1-x S2 with respect to its synthesis, homogeneity range, structure and electronic properties. The average structure of 1T-Cu x Ta1-x S2 resembles that of the high-temperature phase of the layered transition metal dichalcogenide 1T-TaS2 in which tantalum is partially substituted by copper. 1T-Cu x Ta1-x S2 readily decomposes at elevated temperatures and can only be prepared and stabilized by a sufficiently high amount of sulfur excess. XPS and NEXAFS measurements reveal that copper has the oxidation state +I in 1T-Cu x Ta1-x S2, which is supported by quantum chemical calculations. The disorder introduced by copper doping causes an Anderson-type localization of the conduction electrons as manifested by a strong increase of the electrical resistivity and a Curie-type paramagnetism at low temperatures as in other doped systems 1T-M x Ta1-x S2 with higher valent metals. Quantum chemical calculations support this interpretation.",3
Investigation of cold atmospheric plasma treatment in polydimethylsiloxane microfluidic devices with a transmural method.,"Here we report a transmural testing that proves cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) can be used to treat the aqueous samples in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic devices. The reactive species of CAP are found to be able to pass through the PDMS wall and interact with the aqueous medium in the microchannels. The H2O2 concentration, pH value and the bacterial survival number of the treated medium are detected, respectively, to evaluate the feasibility of this method. The relationship between the concentration of H2O2 in the aqueous samples and the thickness of the channel wall is explained by the diffusion mechanism of plasma species in PDMS. The acidification (i.e. decrease of pH value) and sterilization effect of plasma are also observed in the treated samples. This transmural method allows the CAP treatment in PDMS microfluidic devices, which demonstrates that the plasma biomedicine would have potential applications in biomicrofluidics.",3
Switchable Rashba effect by dipole moment switching in an Ag2Te monolayer.,"Because of the surface depolarization field, there is a critical thickness for ferroelectricity in ultrathin ferroelectric films, hindering miniaturization of high-density nonvolatile memory storage devices. A controllable Rashba effect by external electric field via switchable dipole moment could be a promising way to control and manipulate the spin degrees of freedom in spintronics. Here, based on first principles calculations, we show that non-planar Ag2Te monolayer, which has been recently predicted to be a topological insulator, possess a switchable out-of-plane electric dipole moment. The switching of the dipole can be realized by the penetration of Te atoms through the hexagonal Ag-plane. Additionally, non-planar Ag2Te shows a giant Rashba spin-splitting ([Formula: see text] eV A) due to the out-of-plane electric dipole moment. Our tight binding model indicates that the origin of such large [Formula: see text] is the large inversion symmetry breaking term ([Formula: see text] eV), which is one order of magnitude larger in non-planar Ag2Te monolayer compared with other Rashba materials. Interestingly, the Rashba effect can be turned on/off by the phase transition from non-planar to planar structure via Te displacement. Moreover, the spin-texture can be completely reversed because of switchable electric dipole moment. Our work shows a new way to realize ferroelectric-like dipole moment switching and consequently switchable Rashba spin-splitting, which may facilitate a nonvolatile electrical control of the spin degrees of freedom, down to the monolayer thickness, promising potential applications to electrically controlled spintronic devices.",3
Multi-walled carbon nanotubes under focused electron beam: metal passivation effect and nanoscaled curvature effect.,"The elongation and length contraction in multi-walled carbon nanotubes without/with metal (Au) nanoparticles under focused electron beam irradiation is in situ studied experimentally at room temperature with transmission electron microscopy. It is observed that the plastic flow and direct evaporation of carbon atoms strongly rely on the nanoscaled negative curvature and surface energy of the nanotubes. The multi-walled carbon nanotubes without metal nanoparticles shrink and elongate by the diffusion and plastic flow of carbon atoms along the shells in the tube axis direction by self contraction of shells. In contrast, multi-walled carbon nanotubes with metal nanoparticles shrink and reduce their lengths by direct evaporation (sputtering) of carbon atoms into the free space under passivation by the metal nanoparticles. Thus, experimental demonstration is provided that the non-uniform structural evolution process in multi-walled carbon nanotubes induced fleetly by the nanoscaled negative curvature effect under athermal activation effect of electron beam passivates by metal nanoparticles.",3
Interlayer excitons in transition-metal dichalcogenide heterostructures with type-II band alignment.,"Combining ab initio density functional theory with the Dirac-Bloch and gap equations, excitonic properties of transition-metal dichalcogenide hetero-bilayers with type-II band alignment are computed. The existence of interlayer excitons is predicted, whose binding energies are as large as 350 meV, only roughly 100 meV less than those of the coexisting intralayer excitons. The oscillator strength of the interlayer excitons reaches a few percent of the intralayer exciton resonances and their radiative lifetime is two orders of magnitude larger than that of the intralayer excitons.",3
Two-stage three-channel Kondo physics for an FePc molecule on the Au(1 1 1) surface.,"We study an impurity Anderson model to describe an iron phthalocyanine (FePc) molecule on Au(1 1 1), motivated by previous results of scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) and theoretical studies. The model hybridizes a spin doublet consisting in one hole at the [Formula: see text] orbital of iron and two degenerate doublets corresponding to one hole either in the 3d xz or in the 3d yz orbital (called pi orbitals) with two degenerate Hund-rule triplets with one hole in the 3d z orbital and another one in a pi orbital. We solve the model using a slave-boson mean-field approximation (SBMFA). For reasonable parameters we can describe very well the observed STS spectrum between sample bias -60 mV to 20 mV. For these parameters the Kondo effect takes place in two stages, with different energy scales [Formula: see text] corresponding to the Kondo temperatures related with the hopping of the z (2) and pi orbitals respectively. There is a strong interference between the different channels and the Kondo temperatures, particularly the lowest one is strongly reduced compared with the value in the absence of the competing channel.",3
muSR study of spin freezing and persistent spin dynamics in NaCaNi2F7.,"A new pyrochlore compound, NaCaNi2F7, was recently synthesized and has a single magnetic site with spin-1 Ni(2+) . We present zero field and longitudinal field muon spin rotation (muSR) measurements on this pyrochlore. Density functional theory calculations show that the most likely muon site is located between two fluorine ions, but off-centre. A characteristic F-mu-F muon spin polarization function is observed at high temperatures where Ni spin fluctuations are sufficiently rapid. The Ni(2+) spins undergo spin freezing into a disordered ground state below 4 K, with a characteristic internal field strength of 140 G. Persistent Ni spin dynamics are present to our lowest temperatures (75 mK), a feature characteristic of many geometrically frustrated magnetic systems.",3
Nonequilibrium optical properties of transition metals upon ultrafast electron heating.,"Femtosecond laser excitation of metals triggers swift modifications of the electronic distribution within the band structure. This has direct consequences on optical transitions transiently modifying the optical properties of materials. Influencing in real time the action of the pulse, these changes lead to substantial variations of the amount and the distribution in the energy deposited during the laser irradiation. The effect of the laser pulse can be described considering electrons heated to a range of electronic temperatures. In order to evaluate the dielectric response of ultrafast heated electrons, we performed ab initio molecular dynamic simulations coupled to the Kubo-Greenwood formalism and determined electronic temperature dependent optical properties. A series of representative transition metals was investigated: Cu, Ni, Cr, W, Ti, and Fe. The evolution of the optical properties is optically-pumped based on electronic redistribution within the density of electronic states. The proposed interpretation rely on modifications of the energy range of occupied states undergoing optical electronic transitions. It is found that the degree of filling and the shape of the d-block drive the dynamics of optical processes. Nonequilibrium optical indices, reflectivities and skin depths are reported for electron thermal excitation relevant to near-threshold laser ablation regimes. The effect of the electron temperature on optical properties allows to reconstruct and model ultrafast excitation dynamics in time-resolved diagnostics with relevance in laser micro- and nano-processing.",3
Multiple triple-point fermions in Heusler compounds.,"Using the density functional theoretical calculations, we report a new set of topological semimetals X2YZ (X = {Cu, Rh, Pd, Ag, Au, Hg}, Y = {Li, Na, Sc, Zn, Y, Zr, Hf, La, Pr, Pm, Sm, Tb, Dy, Ho, Tm} and Z = {Mg, Al, Zn, Ga, Y, Ag, Cd, In, Sn, Ta, Sm}), which show the existence of multiple topological triple point fermions along four independent [Formula: see text] axes. These fermionic quasiparticles have no analogues elementary particle in the standard model. The angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy is simulated to obtain the exotic topological surface states and the characteristic Fermi arcs. The inclusion of spin-orbit coupling splits the triple-point to two Dirac points. The triple-point fermions are exhibited on the easily cleavable (1 1 1) surface and are well separated from the surface [Formula: see text] point, allowing them to be resolved in the surface spectroscopic techniques. This intermediate linearly dispersive degeneracy between Weyl and Dirac points may offer prospective candidates for quantum transport applications.",3
Are thermal fluctuations the sole reason for finite longitudinal resistance in quantum anomalous Hall experiments?,"In some recent experiments (Bestwick et al 2015 Phys. Rev. Lett. 114 187201, Chang et al 2015 Nat. Mater. 14 473-7) it has been shown that in observations of the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect the longitudinal resistance R L increases as temperature T increases, while Hall resistance R H loses its quantization with increase in T. This behavior was explained due to increased thermal fluctuations as T increases. We show that similar effects arise in QAH samples with quasi-helical edge modes as disorder increases in the presence or absence of inelastic scattering even at temperature T = 0.",3
Hot electron relaxation dynamics in semiconductors: assessing the strength of the electron-phonon coupling from the theoretical and experimental viewpoints.,"The rapid development of the computational methods based on density functional theory, on the one hand, and of time-, energy-, and momentum-resolved spectroscopy, on the other hand, allows today an unprecedently detailed insight into the processes governing hot-electron relaxation dynamics, and, in particular, into the role of the electron-phonon coupling. Instead of focusing on the development of a particular method, theoretical or experimental, this review aims to treat the progress in the understanding of the electron-phonon coupling which can be gained from both, on the basis of recently obtained results. We start by defining several regimes of hot electron relaxation via electron-phonon coupling, with respect to the electron excitation energy. We distinguish between energy and momentum relaxation of hot electrons, and summarize, for several semiconductors of the IV and III-V groups, the orders of magnitude of different relaxation times in different regimes, on the basis of known experimental and numerical data. Momentum relaxation times of hot electrons become very short around 1 eV above the bottom of the conduction band, and such ultrafast relaxation mechanisms are measurable only in the most recent pump-probe experiments. Then, we give an overview of the recent progress in the experimental techniques allowing to obtain detailed information on the hot-electron relaxation dynamics, with the main focus on time-, energy-, and momentum-resolved photoemission experiments. The particularities of the experimental approach developed by one of us, which allows to capture time-, energy-, and momentum-resolved hot-electron distributions, as well as to measure momentum relaxation times of the order of 10 fs, are discussed. We further discuss the main advances in the calculation of the electron-phonon scattering times from first principles over the past ten years, in semiconducting materials. Ab initio techniques and efficient interpolation methods provide the possibility to calculate electron-phonon scattering times with high precision at reasonable numerical cost. We highlight the methods of analysis of the obtained numerical results, which allow to give insight into the details of the electron-phonon scattering mechanisms. Finally, we discuss the concept of hot electron ensemble which has been proposed recently to describe the hot-electron relaxation dynamics in GaAs, the applicability of this concept to other materials, and its limitations. We also mention some open problems.",3
Physics-based derivation of a formula for the mutual depolarization of two post-like field emitters.,"Recent analyses of the apex field enhancement factor (FEF) for many forms of field emitter have revealed that the depolarization effect is more persistent with respect to the separation between the emitters than originally assumed. It has been shown that, at sufficiently large separations, the fractional reduction of the FEF decays with the inverse cube power of separation, rather than exponentially. The behavior of the fractional reduction of the FEF encompassing both the range of technological interest [Formula: see text] (c being the separation and h is the height of the emitters) and large separations ([Formula: see text]) has not been predicted by the existing formulas in field emission literature, for post-like emitters of any shape. In this work, we use first principles to derive a simple two-parameter formula for fractional reduction that can be useful for experimentalists for modeling and interpreting the FEFs for small clusters of emitters or arrays at separations of interest. For the structures tested, the agreement between numerical and analytical data is approximately 1%.",3
Electrowetting on 2D dielectrics: a quantum molecular dynamics investigation.,"Electrowetting on dielectrics (EWOD) is widely used to manipulate the spreading of a conductive liquid on a dielectric surface by applying an electric field. 2D hydrophobic dielectrics are promising candidates for EWOD applications. In this study, extensive quantum molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed to investigate the electrowetting behavior of salty water on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) monolayer. The proximal adsorption of salt ions and the associated realignment of the dipole moments of interfacial water with the applied electric field are found to be the physical origin of the electrowetting behavior. At low salt concentration and low electric fields, the proximal adsorption and the realignment follow the applied electric field, and the cosine of the water contact angle (WCA) follows a quadratic dependence on the applied electric field. At high salt concentration and high electric fields, the proximal adsorption saturates, which restricts further realignment and causes a saturation of the WCA. This case study provides physical insights into the much debated mechanism that underlies the contact angle saturation (CAS) found in macroscopic electrowetting phenomena and also provides an avenue for further studies of electrowetting at the atomic scale.",3
A majority gate with chiral magnetic solitons.,"In magnetic materials, nontrivial spin textures may emerge due to the competition among different types of magnetic interactions. Among such spin textures, chiral magnetic solitons represent topologically protected spin configurations with particle-like properties. Based on atomistic spin dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that these chiral magnetic solitons are ideal to use for logical operations, and we demonstrate the functionality of a three-input majority gate, in which the input states can be controlled by applying an external electromagnetic field or spin-polarized currents. One of the main advantages of the proposed device is that the input and output signals are encoded in the chirality of solitons, that may be moved, allowing to perform logical operations using only minute electric currents. As an example we illustrate how the three input majority gate can be used to perform logical relations, such as Boolean AND and OR.",3
Spin dynamics of antiferromagnetically coupled bilayers-the case of Cr2TeO6.,"Understanding the dynamics of interacting quantum spins has been one of the active areas of condensed matter physics research. Recently, extensive inelastic neutron scattering measurements have been carried out in an interesting class of systems, Cr2(Te, W, Mo)O6. These systems consist of bilayers of Cr(3+) spins (S = 3/2) with strong antiferromagnetic inter-bilayer coupling (J) and tuneable intra-bilayer coupling (j) from ferro (for W and Mo) to antiferro (for Te). In the limit when [Formula: see text], the system reduces to weakly interacting quantum spin-3/2 dimers. In this paper, we discuss the low-temperature magnetic properties of Cr2TeO6 systems where both intra-layer and inter-layer exchange couplings are antiferromagnetic, i.e. [Formula: see text]. Using linear spin-wave theory we obtain the magnon dispersion, sublattice magnetization, two-magnon density of states, and longitudinal spin-spin correlation function.",3
Tuning spin one channel to exotic orbital two-channel Kondo effect in ferrimagnetic composites of LaNiO3 and CoFe2O4.,"We report the tuning from spin one channel to orbital two-channel Kondo (2CK) effect by varying CoFe2O4 (CFO) content in the composites with LaNiO3 (LNO) along with the presence of ferrimagnetism. Although there is no signature of resistivity upturn in the case of pure LNO, all the composites exhibit a distinct upturn in the temperature range of 30-80 K. For composites with lower percentage of CFO (10%), the electron spin plays the key role in the emergence of resistivity upturn which is affected by external magnetic field. On the other hand, when the CFO content is increased (15%), the upturn shows strong robustness against high magnetic field (14 T) and a crossover in temperature variation from [Formula: see text] to T (1/2) at the Kondo temperature, indicating the appearance of orbital 2CK effect. The orbital 2CK effect originates due to the scattering of conduction electrons from the structural two-level systems which is created at the interfaces between the two phases (LNO and CFO) of different crystal structures as well as inside the crystal planes. The specific heat data at low temperature (40 K), deviates from the usual linear temperature variation of the electronic contribution. With higher CFO content it shows more deviation which also indicates the increasing amount of two-level system. A negative magnetoresistance (MR) is observed at low temperature (<30 K) for composites containing both lower (10%) and higher percentage (15%) of CFO. We have analyzed the negative MR using Khosla and Fisher semi-empirical model based on spin dependent scattering of conduction electrons from localized spins.",3
Effects of chemical disorder in the itinerant antiferromagnet Ti1-x V x Au.,"The fragile nature of itinerant magnetism can be exploited using non-thermal parameters to study quantum criticality. The recently discovered quantum critical point (QCP) in the Sc-doped (hole-like doping) itinerant antiferromagnet TiAu (Ti1-x Sc x Au) raised questions about the effects of the crystal and electronic structures on the overall magnetic behavior. In this study, doping with V (electron-like doping) in Ti1-x V x Au introduces chemical disorder which suppresses antiferromagnetic order from [Formula: see text] 36 K for x = 0 down to 10 K for x = 0.15, whereupon a solubility limit is reached. Signatures of non-Fermi-liquid behavior are observed in transport and specific heat measurements similar to Ti1-x Sc x Au, even though Ti1-x V x Au is far from a QCP for the accessible compositions [Formula: see text].",3
Physical Forces Determining the Persistency and Centering Precision of Microtubule Asters.,"In early embryos, microtubules form star-shaped aster structures that can measure up to hundreds of micrometres, and move at high speeds to find the geometrical centre of the cell. This process, known as aster centration, is essential for the fidelity of cell division and development, but how cells succeed in moving these large structures through their crowded and fluctuating cytoplasm remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the positional fluctuations of migrating sea urchin sperm asters are small, anisotropic, and associated with the stochasticity of dynein-dependent forces moving the aster. Using in vivo magnetic tweezers to directly measure aster forces inside cells, we derive a linear aster force-velocity relationship and provide evidence for a spring-like active mechanism stabilizing the transverse position of the asters. The large frictional coefficient and spring constant quantitatively account for the amplitude and growth characteristics of athermal positional fluctuations, demonstrating that aster mechanics ensure noise suppression to promote persistent and precise centration. These findings define generic biophysical regimes of active cytoskeletal mechanics underlying the accuracy of cell division and early embryonic development.",3
Pressure tuning of light-induced superconductivity in K3C60.,"Optical excitation at terahertz frequencies has emerged as an effective means to dynamically manipulate complex materials. In the molecular solid K3C60, short mid-infrared pulses transform the high-temperature metal into a non-equilibrium state with the optical properties of a superconductor. Here we tune this effect with hydrostatic pressure and find that the superconducting-like features gradually disappear at around 0.3 GPa. Reduction with pressure underscores the similarity with the equilibrium superconducting phase of K3C60, in which a larger electronic bandwidth induced by pressure is also detrimental for pairing. Crucially, our observation excludes alternative interpretations based on a high-mobility metallic phase. The pressure dependence also suggests that transient, incipient superconductivity occurs far above the 150 K hypothesised previously, and rather extends all the way to room temperature.",3
Spontaneous shear flow in confined cellular nematics.,"In embryonic development or tumor evolution, cells often migrate collectively within confining tracks defined by their microenvironment 1,2. In some of these situations, the displacements within a cell strand are antiparallel 3, giving rise to shear flows. However, the mechanisms underlying these spontaneous flows remain poorly understood. Here, we show that an ensemble of spindle-shaped cells plated in a well-defined stripe spontaneously develop a shear flow whose characteristics depend on the width of the stripe. On wide stripes, the cells self-organize in a nematic phase with a director at a well-defined angle with the stripe's direction, and develop a shear flow close to the stripe's edges. However, on stripes narrower than a critical width, the cells perfectly align with the stripe's direction and the net flow vanishes. A hydrodynamic active gel theory provides an understanding of these observations and identifies the transition between the non-flowing phase oriented along the stripe and the tilted phase exhibiting shear flow as a Freedericksz transition driven by the activity of the cells. This physical theory is grounded in the active nature of the cells and based on symmetries and conservation laws, providing a generic mechanism to interpret in vivo antiparallel cell displacements.",3
Amplification of intense light fields by nearly free electrons.,"Light can be used to modify and control properties of media, as in the case of electromagnetically induced transparency or, more recently, for the generation of slow light or bright coherent XUV and X-ray radiation. Particularly unusual states of matter can be created by light fields with strengths comparable to the Coulomb field that binds valence electrons in atoms, leading to nearly-free electrons oscillating in the laser field and yet still loosely bound to the core [1,2]. These are known as Kramers-Henneberger states [3], a specific example of laser-dressed states [2]. Here, we demonstrate that these states arise not only in isolated atoms [4,5], but also in rare gases, at and above atmospheric pressure, where they can act as a gain medium during laser filamentation. Using shaped laser pulses, gain in these states is achieved within just a few cycles of the guided field. The corresponding lasing emission is a signature of population inversion in these states and of their stability against ionization. Our work demonstrates that these unusual states of neutral atoms can be exploited to create a general ultrafast gain mechanism during laser filamentation.",3
Disorder-free weak dynamic localization in deformable lattices.,"We study the electron transport in a deformable lattice modeled in the semiclassical approximation as a discrete nonlinear elastic chain where acoustic phonons are in thermal equilibrium at temperature T. We reveal that an effective dynamic disorder induced in the system due to thermalized phonons is not strong enough to produce Anderson localization. However, for weak nonlinearity we observe a transition between ballistic (low T) and diffusive (high T) regimes, while for strong nonlinearity the transition occurs between the localized soliton (low T) and diffusive (high T) regimes. Thus, the electron-phonon interaction results in weak temperature-dependent dynamic localization.",3
Exchange bias effect in a finite site disordered canted antiferromagnet.,"We report the temperature and magnetic field dependent magnetic properties of the single-phase polycrystalline La0.8Sr0.2Cr0.7Ru0.3O3 sample to explore the intrinsic magnetic phases of the sample. Our combined temperature and field dependent magnetization studies reveal the formation of ferromagnetic (FM) cluster-glass in the antiferromagnetic (AFM) matrix of host LaCrO3. Interestingly, the as-studied sample exhibits both zero-field-cooled (horizontal shift) and field-cooled (vertical shift) exchange bias effects and, in both cases, magnitude of exchange bias field continuously increases with the decrease of temperature. Our successive hysteresis loop measurements completely ruled out the effect of any minor hysteresis loop and thus, establishes this vertical shift as conventional field-cooled exchange bias (CEB) effect, originating from the uncompensated spins of randomly substituted canted AFM spin structure. A significantly larger value of CEB field (7.5 kOe) at 5 K is achieved for a cooling field of 50 kOe, not usually observed in conventional FM/AFM interfacial exchange-bias systems.",3
High-pressure studies on heavy-fermion antiferromagnet CeCuBi2.,"We report in-plane electrical resistivity studies of CeCuBi2 and LaCuBi2 single crystals under applied pressure. At ambient pressure, CeCuBi2 is a c-axis Ising antiferromagnet with a transition temperature [Formula: see text] K. In a magnetic field applied along the c-axis at [Formula: see text] K a spin-flop transition takes place [Formula: see text] T. Applying pressure on CeCuBi2 suppresses T N at a slow rate. [Formula: see text] extrapolates to zero temperature at [Formula: see text] GPa. The critical field of the spin-flop transition [Formula: see text] displays a maximum of 6.8 T at [Formula: see text] GPa. At low temperatures, a zero-resistance superconducting state emerges upon the application of external pressure having a maximum T c of 7 K at 2.6 GPa in CeCuBi2. High-pressure electrical-resistivity experiments on the non-magnetic reference compound LaCuBi2 reveal also a zero resistance state with similar critical temperatures in the same pressure range as CeCuBi2. The great similarity between the superconducting properties of both materials and elemental Bi suggests a common origin of the superconductivity. We discuss that the appearance of this zero resistance state superconductivity may be related to the Bi layers present in the crystalline structure of both compounds and, therefore, could be intrinsic to CeCuBi2 and LaCuBi2, however further experiments under pressure are necessary to clarify this issue.",3
Bound states in the continuum poisoned by Majorana fermions.,"In this work, we study the bound states in the continuum (BICs) in a system formed by a triple quantum dot array embedded between two one-dimensional topological superconductors (TSCs), both hosting Majorana bound states (MBSs) at their ends. The results show the formation of BICs with topological characteristics due to the presence of MBSs. This is a consequence of the interplay between the BIC arising from quantum dots states by means of energy level symmetry breaking through gate voltages, and MBSs leaked into the quantum dots. The BIC is not observed when both TSCs are in long wire limit, i.e. for vanishing inter MBSs coupling, while it projects into the electronic transmission whenever the inter MBSs couplings are away from zero, regardless if they have different strength and/or the phase difference between both TSCs. We study the behavior of BICs poisoned by MBSs as a function of the parameters that are controlling the system. We believe our findings could be useful to implement a protection tool for BICs using MBSs based on tunable gate voltages.",3
Identification of single-layer metallic structure of indium on Si(1 1 1).,"We have studied the In/Si(1 1 1) ([Formula: see text])-hex and striped phases by low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES). The two phases are formed by different processes, and hence the different names have been used conventionally. We, however, found that LEED I-[Formula: see text] curves of the two phases agree with each other, indicating that they have an identical atomic structure. Our ARPES measurement revealed that the ([Formula: see text])-hex phase has metallic surface states. The observed Fermi surface was found to be very similar to the theoretical one calculated for an indium single-layer model.",3
Junctionless versus inversion-mode lateral semiconductor nanowire transistors.,"This paper reports on gate-all-around silicon nanowire field-effect transistors (FETs) built in a lateral configuration, which represent the ultimate scaling limit of triple-gate finFET devices and allow a less disruptive CMOS scaling path in terms of processing and circuit layout design. We address several of their critical technological challenges, looking in particular at doping strategies. A comprehensive review of junctionless versus inversion-mode type of transistors is here presented, evaluating the impact on the devices' operation mode and on device properties such as: variability, reliability, noise, DC and analog/RF performance. We also discuss the potential for further manufacturable co-integration options.",3
Structure and dynamical properties of liquid Ni64Zr36 and Ni65Hf35 alloys: an ab initio molecular dynamics study.,"Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations are performed to investigate the atomic structures and dynamics of Ni64Zr36 and Ni65Hf35 metallic liquids in a temperature range of 1400-2500 K. Calculated results are in good agreement with recently reported high temperature experimental data. Local atomic structures are analyzed and compared for Ni64Zr36 and Ni65Hf35 metallic liquids in terms of average bond length, coordination number, Honey-Andersen index, Bond-orientation order, spatial correlation and Voronoi tessellation methods. It is found that Zr-Zr bonds have larger average length of 3.32 A than 3.22 A for Hf-Hf bonds, causing sluggish diffusion in Ni65Hf35 liquids. Zr and Hf atom-centered clusters with higher coordination numbers are inclined to aggregate with high-coordinated clusters, while Ni atom-centered clusters with lower coordination numbers prefer to avoiding to be the nearest neighbor with each other. Temperature dependent diffusion coefficients reveal the decoupled diffusion in both liquids, which are related with different spatial correlations for Ni- and Zr- (or Hf-) centered clusters.",3
Functionalization of the electronic and magnetic properties of silicene by halogen atoms unilateral adsorption: a first-principles study.,"Based on first-principles calculations, the structure, electronic and magnetic properties of unilateral halogenated silicene Si2X1 (X = F, Cl, Br, I) are investigated. The formation energies of all the configurations of studied Si2X1 (X = F, Cl, Br, I) are found to be lower than that in pristine silicene, which indicates the strong stability. The band structure of half-fluorinated configuration Si2F1 presents metallic property, while other unilateral halogenated silicene Si2X1 (X = Cl, Br, I) exhibits half-metallic properties. In unilateral halogenated silicene Si2X1 (X = Cl, Br, I), the unpaired electrons in unsaturated silicon atom produce the localized magnetic moment. However, due to the strong electronegativity in F atom, the half-fluorinated silicene Si2F1 is almost non-magnetic. The metallic property of Si2F1 configuration can be tuned to half-metallic by applying biaxial tensile strain from 11.95% to 13.51%. Furthermore, applying biaxial tensile strains can tune the half-metallic property of unilateral halogenated silicene Si2X1 (X = Cl, Br, I) to a semiconductor. This half-metallic property in unilateral halogenated silicene Si2X1 (X = Cl, Br, I) can be recovered and can even be tuned to metallic if continually increasing the biaxial tensile strains.",3
Structural and electronic properties of Fe monolayer on BaTiO3(0 0 1).,"The structural, electronic, and phonon properties of the BaTiO3(0 0 1) surface and the Fe/BaTiO3(0 0 1) interface have been studied within the density functional theory. Attention is paid to the lattice instabilities (soft phonon modes) that induce ferroelectric distortions in the surface and the interface. A phonon-induced monoclinic (Cm) thin-film counterpart of the low-temperature rhombohedral (R3m) ferroelectric bulk BaTiO3 phase is found. The changes in crystal structure, electronic density of states, atomic charges, and magnetic moments associated with the ferroelectric distortions are discussed comparing the results of the standard GGA and the hybrid DFT calculations. The magnetoelectric coupling at the Fe/BaTiO3(0 0 1) interface is investigated by the analysis of changes in magnetic moments on Fe and Ti atoms induced by the atomic displacements perpendicular and parallel to the surface.",3
Domain wall energy and strain in Pt/Co/Ir thin films on piezoelectric transducers.,"We study the energy and creep velocity of magnetic domain walls in perpendicularly magnetised Pt/Co/Ir thin films under strain. We find that the enhancement of domain wall creep velocity under strain from piezoelectric transducers is largest in films with the thinnest Co layers (0.56 nm), in which the strain causes the smallest relative change in perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and the largest relative change in domain wall creep velocity. We show how domain wall energy is predictive of the sensitivity of domain wall creep velocity to changes in strain, and thus provide a route to designing magnetic thin film systems for optimum strain control.",3
Surface plasmons in Weyl semimetals.,"The surface plasmon excitation spectrum is calculated for the Weyl semimetal within the random phase approximation. Recently, a surface plasmon mode has been predicted to exist at the three-dimensional Dirac semimetal surface due to the Dirac plasmon mode in the bulk. In addition, Weyl semimetals possess Fermi arc electron states on their surfaces resulting in an anisotropic Fermi arc plasmon mode. In the present work we consider the modification of the surface plasmon mode due to the Fermi arc plasmon mode. We introduce an effective surface dielectric function of Fermi arc electrons which comprises the Fermi arc plasmon mode and the surface dielectric function that determines the bare surface plasmon mode present due to the plasmon mode in the bulk from Weyl electrons. As a result, we obtain the dispersion of the renormalized surface plasmon mode from the effective surface dielectric function. We find that a renormalization of the bare surface plasmon mode increases with increases in the Fermi arc plasmon frequency. The obtained spectrum will be useful for experimentally exploring the surface spectral properties of Weyl semimetals.",3
Large-scale tight-binding simulations of quantum transport in ballistic graphene.,"Graphene has proven to host outstanding mesoscopic effects involving massless Dirac quasiparticles travelling ballistically resulting in the current flow exhibiting light-like behaviour. A new branch of 2D electronics inspired by the standard principles of optics is rapidly evolving, calling for a deeper understanding of transport in large-scale devices at a quantum level. Here we perform large-scale quantum transport calculations based on a tight-binding model of graphene and the non-equilibrium Green's function method and include the effects of p-n junctions of different shape, magnetic field, and absorptive regions acting as drains for current. We stress the importance of choosing absorbing boundary conditions in the calculations to correctly capture how current flows in the limit of infinite devices. As a specific application we present a fully quantum-mechanical framework for the '2D Dirac fermion microscope' recently proposed by Boggild et al (2017 Nat. Commun. 8 10.1038), tackling several key electron-optical effects therein predicted via semiclassical trajectory simulations, such as electron beam collimation, deflection and scattering off Veselago dots. Our results confirm that a semiclassical approach to a large extend is sufficient to capture the main transport features in the mesoscopic limit and the optical regime, but also that a richer electron-optical landscape is to be expected when coherence or other purely quantum effects are accounted for in the simulations.",3
Confinement of Dirac electrons in graphene magnetic quantum dots.,"We characterize the confinement of massless Dirac electrons under axially symmetric magnetic fields in graphene, including zero energy modes and higher energy levels. In particular, we analyze in detail the Aharonov-Casher theorem, on the existence of zero modes produced by magnetic fields with finite flux in two dimensions. We apply techniques of supersymmetric quantum mechanics to determine the confined states by means of the quantum number j associated to isospin and angular momentum. We focus on magnetic fields, regular at the origin, whose asymptotic behaviour is [Formula: see text], with alpha a real number. A confinement of infinite zero-energy modes and excited states is possible as long as [Formula: see text]. When [Formula: see text] the quantum dot is able to trap an infinite number of zero modes but no excited states, while for [Formula: see text] only a finite number of zero modes are confined.",3
Many-body wave functions for correlated systems in magnetic fields: Monte Carlo simulations in the lowest Landau level.,"We put forward possible wave functions for quantum Hall states in the lowest Landau level. These were deduced from the topological approach based on the relation between braid groups and the quantum statistics, as well as the commensurability condition unavoidable for collective states in magnetic fields. In this paper we demonstrate that the [Formula: see text]-field imposes restrictions on braid trajectories (i.e. elements of the full braid group). This results in the appearance of cyclotron subgroups, instead of the full braid group, for certain filling factors. The fermion representation of cyclotron subgroups defines transformations of wave functions in the quantum Hall regime. Hence, it sets quantum statistics (transformations of [Formula: see text] under exchanges of arguments), which is unavoidable for collective states (in compliance with the framework of Feynman's path integrals). Finally, the topological approach allows to define the hierarchy of fillings in the lowest Landau level, which agree with the hierarchy observed in quantum Hall devices (i.e. in transport measurements). The symmetry of a many-body wave function (i.e. quantum statistics) is always determined by a 1D unitary representation of the system's braid group. Using this topologically-originated property, we demonstrate that many-body wave functions for selected fillings of the lowest Landau level may not be purely antisymmetric. Only systems composed of fermions are investigated. Additionally, we present Monte Carlo calculations in a disc geometry, which remain in a nice agreement with predictions of exact diagonalizations (expected values of potential energy and pair distribution functions are presented). No boundary potential is assumed.",3
"Electronic properties of fluorides by efficient approximated quasiparticle DFT-1/2 and PSIC methods: BaF2, CaF2 and CdF2 as test cases.","Dialkali halides are materials of great interest from both fundamental and technological viewpoints, due to their wide transparency range. The accurate determination of their electronic, excitation and optical properties in bulk and low dimensional systems is therefore of crucial importance. Moreover, it is a challenge from the theoretical point of view to deal with quasiparticle band structure calculations for such large energy gap materials, requiring very expensive methods for achieving a desirable accuracy. Here we report electronic quasiparticle band structures for three representative bulk fluorides, BaF2, CaF2 and CdF2, calculated using two low computational cost methods, the DFT-1/2 and the PSIC schemes, which have been relatively little explored by the theoretical community so far. Our results, compared with both available experimental data and previous heavyweight DFT-GW self-energy calculations, demonstrate a satisfactory accuracy for the examined compounds, at a level comparable with the perturbative G0W0 approach. Remarkably, both our proposed methods scale quite similarly to standard local density functional approaches, thus resulting in a large saving of computational effort with respect to the computationally heavyweight GW. Our results open up the perspective of the computational exploration of much bigger fluoride systems. As a significant proof of concept of this capability, we also calculated the quasiparticle properties of the (1 1 1) surfaces of all the three systems under study. Very good agreement with experiment was found.",3
Medium-sized [Formula: see text] (n = 14-20) clusters: a combined study of photoelectron spectroscopy and DFT calculations.,"Size-selected anionic silicon clusters, [Formula: see text] (n = 14-20), have been investigated by photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Low-energy structures of the clusters are globally searched for by using a genetic algorithm based on DFT calculations. The electronic density of states and vertical detachment energies have been simulated by using ten DFT functionals and compared to the experimental results. We systematically evaluated the DFT functionals for the calculation of the energetics of silicon clusters. CCSD(T) single-point energies based on MP2 optimized geometries for selected isomers of [Formula: see text] are also used as benchmark for the energy sequence. The HSE06 functional with aug-cc-pVDZ basis set is found to show the best performance. Our global minimum search corroborates that most of the lowest-energy structures of [Formula: see text] (n = 14-20) clusters can be derived from assembling tricapped trigonal prisms in various ways. For most sizes previous structures are confirmed, whereas for [Formula: see text] a new structure has been found.",3
Quantum engineering of Majorana quasiparticles in one-dimensional optical lattices.,"We propose a feasible way of engineering Majorana-type quasiparticles in ultracold fermionic gases on a one-dimensional (1D) optical lattice. For this purpose, imbalanced ultracold atoms interacting by the spin-orbit coupling should be hybridized with a three-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate molecular cloud. We show that the Majorana-type excitations can be created or annihilated upon constraining the profile of a trapping potential and/or an internal scattering barier. This process is modeled within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach. Our study is relevant also to nanoscopic 1D superconductors, where both potentials can be imposed by electrostatic means.",3
Dynamical coupling of dilute magnetic impurities with quantum spin liquid state in the S = 3/2 dimer compound Ba3ZnRu2O9.,"We have investigated the dilute magnetic impurity effect on the magnetic properties of a quantum spin liquid candidate Ba3ZnRu2O9 and a spin gapped compound Ba3CaRu2O9. The magnetic ground state of each compound stands against 2% substitution of magnetic impurities for Zn or Ca. We have found that the magnetic response of these impurities, which behave as paramagnetic spins, depends on the host materials and the difference of the two manifests itself in the Weiss temperature, which can hardly be explained by the dilute magnetic impurities alone in the case of Ba3ZnRu2O9. We consider a contribution from the Ru(5+) ions which would appear only in the substituted Ba3ZnRu2O9 and discuss a possible physical meaning of the observed Weiss temperature.",3
Magnetic irreversibility in VO2/Ni bilayers.,"We studied the temperature dependence of the magnetic properties of VO2/Ni bilayers. The Ni films were deposited on either monoclinic or rutile phase VO2. The temperature induced VO2 transformation from a monoclinic to a rutile structure induces strain in the Ni film. Due to an inverse magnetoelastic effect the coercivity of the Ni films is strongly modified. Both Ni films show strong enhancement of the coercivity near the transition temperature. The coercivity enhancement of Ni is associated with the phase coexistence observed in the VO2 first order phase transition. Above the transition temperature, Ni deposited on monoclinic VO2 shows a coercivity enhancement whereas Ni deposited on rutile VO2 shows suppression of the coercivity. The samples were cycled several times to check if the changes in coercivity were reversible. While samples with Ni deposited on rutile VO2 show reversibility, samples with Ni deposited on monoclinic VO2 shown an irreversibility after the first structural phase transition. This irreversibility can be associated with cracking of the VO2 layer as it relieves stress due to the transition and has implications for the resistance versus temperature behavior of the VO2.",3
Temperature dependence of the Young's modulus of polymers calculated using a hybrid molecular mechanics-molecular dynamics method.,"A hybrid molecular mechanics-molecular dynamics (MM-MD) method is proposed to calculate the Young's modulus of polymers at various temperature. It overcomes the limitation that MD is restricted to extremely high strain rates. A case study based on poly-methyl-methacrylate demonstrates that, contrary to previous MD studies, the method is able to accurately reproduce the effect of temperature on the Young's modulus in close agreement with experimental data. The method can also predict a more clear transition between the glassy and rubbery states than previous MD studies.",3
"Structural transformation, Griffiths phase and metal-insulator transition in polycrystalline Nd2-x Sr x NiMnO6 (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5 and 1) compound.","Polycrystalline double perovskite Nd2-x Sr x NiMnO6 (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5 and 1) samples were synthesized using the solid state reaction method. There occurs a structural transformation from monoclinic (P21/n, for x = 0 to x = 0.5) to cubic (Fm [Formula: see text] m, for x = 1) with increasing Sr doping. Raman spectroscopy reveals the increase in static disorder with doping. The Curie temperature (T C) shows a small increase from x = 0 to 0.5 (T C ~ 200 K), but for x = 1, T C increases drastically upto ~264 K. The deviation of 1/chi(T) from Curie-Weiss behaviour for doped samples with exponent less than one, indicates a development of the Griffiths phase with doping. The systematic reduction in magnetic moment at 5 K suggests an increase in anti-site disorders with doping. Mn 3s x-ray photoemission spectra show an increase in exchange splitting, indicating a decrease in the valency of Mn. The x-ray absorption spectra at Ni and Mn 2p edges show that the formal valence remains 2+ (Ni) and 4+ (Mn) for all the samples, with changes in spectral weights. Ni 2p x-ray photoemission spectra show characteristic feature similar to Ni(3+) systems, only for x = 1 sample. Our GGA-based calculations for the ordered supercell, predict half metallic character for doping (x > 0) samples due to delocalization of Ni eg orbitals. The calculations with anti-site disorders yield drastic reduction in Ni moments, with the disordered anti-ferromagnetic phase having lowest energy at maximum doping. Temperature dependent resistivity measurements exhibit a clear metallic region for x = 0.2 sample, while for higher dopings (x > 0.2), the metallicity gets suppressed due to increase in anti-site disorders in these samples.",3
Structure and vibrational properties of the PTCDA/Ag(1 1 1) interface: bilayer versus monolayer.,"The structural and vibrational properties of metal-organic interfaces have been examined by means of infrared (IR) absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) with an approach accounting for long-range dispersive interactions. We focus on a comparative study of the PTCDA monolayer and bilayer on Ag(1 1 1). The equilibrium geometry at the molecule-metal interface and the IR spectrum of the chemisorbed monolayer of PTCDA on Ag(1 1 1) are well described by the computations. In the bilayer structure, the presence of a physisorbed adlayer on top of PTCDA/Ag(1 1 1) presents a challenge for DFT. As previously described for other systems, the polarization of the substrate is not captured correctly and results in too low energies of frontier molecular orbitals. This results in an apparent contribution from the vibrations of second-layer PTCDA to the IR spectrum due to interfacial dynamical charge transfer processes. After removing these peaks with artificially strong intensity, calculated and experimental data show good agreement and the IR spectrum can be described as the sum of the spectra of the PTCDA/Ag(1 1 1) contact layer and a physisorbed PTCDA monolayer on top.",3
Superconductivity in a misfit layered compound (SnSe)1.16(NbSe2).,"The large size single crystals of (SnSe)1.16(NbSe2) misfit layered compound were grown and superconductivity with T c of 3.4 K was first discovered in this system. Powder x-ray diffraction and high resolution transmission electron microscopy clearly display the misfit feature between SnSe and NbSe2 subsystems. The Sommerfeld coefficient gamma inferred from specific-heat measurements is 16.73 mJ mol(-1) K(-2), slightly larger than the usual misfit compounds. The normalized specific heat jump [Formula: see text] is about 0.98, and the electron-phonon coupling constant [Formula: see text] is estimated to be 0.80. The estimated value of the in-plane upper critical magnetic field, [Formula: see text](0), is about 7.82 T, exceeding the Pauli paramagnetic limit slightly. Both the specific-heat and H c2 data suggest that (SnSe)1.16(NbSe2) is a multi-band superconductor.",3
Simulation of inelastic spin flip excitations and Kondo effect in STM spectroscopy of magnetic molecules on metal substrates.,"Single-ion magnetic anisotropy in molecular magnets leads to spin flip excitations that can be measured by inelastic scanning tunneling microscope (STM) spectroscopy. Here I present a semi ab initio scheme to compute the spectral features associated with inelastic spin flip excitations and Kondo effect of single molecular magnets. To this end density functional theory calculations of the molecule on the substrate are combined with more sophisticated many-body techniques for solving the Anderson impurity problem of the spin-carrying orbitals of the magnetic molecule coupled to the rest of the system, containing a phenomenological magnetic anisotropy term. For calculating the STM spectra an exact expression for the [Formula: see text] in the ideal STM limit, when the coupling to the STM tip becomes negligibly small, is derived. In this limit the [Formula: see text] is simply related to the spectral function of the molecule-substrate system. For the case of an Fe porphyrin molecule on the Au(1 1 1) substrate, the calculated STM spectra are in good agreement with recently measured STM spectra, showing the typical step features at finite bias associated with spin flip excitation of a spin-1 quantum magnet. For the case of Kondo effect in Mn porphyrin on Au(1 1 1), the agreement with the experimental spectra is not as good due to the neglect of quantum interference in the tunneling.",3
Topological quantum phase transitions of Chern insulators in disk geometry.,"We investigate topological quantum phase transitions (TQPTs) of Chern insulators in two-dimensional honeycomb-lattice disk with six-fold rotational symmetry. By considering the nearest-neighbor, next-nearest-neighbor hopping parameters and the staggered-flux parameter of the Haldane model, we can obtain rich topological quantum phases. The trivial and non-trivial phases of the Haldane model in disk geometry can be distinguished based on chiral edge states, real-space particle densities and local density of states. We also explore the TQPTs of Chern insulators with an external potential which varies with the radius of the disk geometry. Some interesting topological phases with large Chern numbers can be observed when we consider long-distance hoppings. Furthermore, we use a machine learning algorithm as an effective way to automatically identify various topological phases and phase diagrams for the Haldane model in disk geometry.",3
Topological characterization of carbon nanotubes.,"We show that the tight-binding Hamiltonian of any carbon nanotube with C N symmetry can be represented by N decoupled tight-binding Hamiltonians of molecular chains, for which a general pseudospin formulation, characterized by specific paths in a two-dimensional auxiliary space, is developed. The quantum phases therefore are given by a set of N winding numbers of the paths. The paths degenerate to lines and circles for armchair and zigzag carbon nanotubes, respectively. They rotate in the auxiliary space when a magnetic field of varying strength is applied along the carbon nanotube, which gives rise to quantum phase transitions.",3
The origin of diverse lattice dynamics in the graphene family.,"We employ first principles based density functional theory calculations to explore the lattice dynamics of members of the graphene family. We explore the changes observed in the lattice thermal conductivity via adopting physical models for estimating phonon lifetimes. This allows us to establish a connection between the parameters such as group velocity, Gruneisen parameter, and Debye temperature of the acoustic phonon modes and the lattice thermal conductivity. Our calculations show that the presence of buckling reduces the group velocity and the Debye temperature of the sheets down the group, and hence, reduces their lattice thermal conductivity. However, there is no linear dependence between the buckling height and the observed lowering. An increase in buckling height in sheets with different geometries of the same atomic species, beyond a certain limit, does not lead to change in the group velocity and the Debye temperature of the sheets.",3
Breaking a one-parameter 'poor man's' scaling approach in the Luttinger liquid.,"Using a previously derived effective theory we explore the conductance in the Luttinger model with one impurity. A new approach to the renormalization group (RG) analysis of this model is developed. It is based on the original Gell-Mann-Low formulation of RG. We sum up infrared logarithmic contributions to conductance in the leading and a few subsequent approximations. We analyze the validity of the widely used 'poor man's' scaling approach and find that it is applicable only in the leading approximation. Our results for corrections to this approximation are different from results obtained in other papers. This should be expected beforehand, as the Gell-Mann-Low function of the model is not regularization scheme invariant. For this reason the observed quantity (e.g. conductance) can not satisfy the Gell-Mann-Low equation beyond the 'leading-log' approximation as it is supposed in the 'poor man's' approach. We formulate the method to calculate the conductance from the renormalized hamiltonian in post-leading approximations and match our results to the case of weak impurity where the answer is known in any order of electron-electron interaction.",3
Spin caloritronics in armchair silicene nanoribbons with sp (3) and sp (2)-type alternating hybridizations.,"Finite-layer nanoribbon materials have long been considered as potential candidates for nanodevices with novel quantum effects. Here we constructed a series of ferromagnetic armchair silicene nanoribbons (ASiNRs) with sp (3) and sp (2)-type alternating hybridizations, and found that the ASiNRs with different widths are localized in different spin-resolved electronic states. As the width parameter N is increased from 5 to 22, the ASiNR transits from indirect-gap half metallicity (HM), to indirect-gap spin semiconductor (SC), then to direct-gap SC and finally to direct-gap HM. When a temperature gradient is produced along the nanoribbons, the spin-dependent currents with the opposite flow directions are driven and a nearly perfect spin-dependent Seebeck effect (SDSE) occurs. Moreover, attributing to symmetrical spin-resolved transport channels, nearly pure thermal spin current without any accompanying charge current can be generated. In addition, for some ASiNRs with proper widths, both the thermal spin-up current and spin-down one are contributed by the electrons in energy valleys, resulting in a well-defined valley-dependent SDSE. These theoretical findings suggest that the ASiNRs with the sp (3) and sp (2)-type alternating hybridizations can be outstanding candidates for future spin caloritronic devices.",3
Chain-length dependence of lipophilic force: comparison with the two-body van der Waals' force.,"Hydrophobic dodecanethiol capped Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) form two-dimensional patterns in monolayers of amphiphilic fatty acids ([Formula: see text]) at the air water interface. An interplay between the various lipophilic interactions, in turn, decides the NP cluster size, where stronger NP-monolayer and monolayer-monolayer attraction in fatty acid monolayers with longer tail length oppose nanoparticle aggregation resulting in a decrease in cluster size in both in-plane and out-of-plane directions. The decrease in the in-plane cluster size is steepest for 14 < n < 18, n being the total number of C atoms in the fatty acid, and levels off for higher fatty acids and cannot be explained on the basis of the two body van der Waals pair potential atleast at initial phases of pattern formation. The potential can be used only at later times, closer to stability.",3
Enhanced spin polarization and valley polarization in monolayer MoS2 junctions.,"Special resonant modes in unique quantum structure can enhance spin and valley filtering effect. Hence we investigated resonant tunneling effect with large incident angles through single electric barrier in monolayer MoS2 junctions consisting of normal/ferromagnetic/normal parts. We found that for large incident angles the spin- and valley-dependent line-type resonances appear in the transmission and conductance spectra, which results in the transmission probabilities of spin-up and spin-down electrons at K and [Formula: see text] valleys being all improved to 100[Formula: see text] but for different special gate voltage. Therefore, both the spin and valley polarizations are increased, the perfect 100[Formula: see text] spin and valley polarizations are observed. Furthermore, the numbers of the line-type resonant peaks are multiplied with the increasing of the barrier's width. And the spin- and valley-polarized direction can be switched by changing the gate voltage. These intriguing features indicate that a valley or spin filter with high accuracy and efficiency can be designed, which is controllable by the electric field.",3
Phase interfaces within different vesicle shapes.,"Liquid droplets on flat surfaces generally exhibit a contact angle in a range from 0 to [Formula: see text], but the two-phase interface within a vesicle membrane is very fascinating due to the involved force balance along three bending interfaces. Giant lipid vesicles encapsulated with the poly(ethylene glycol)/dextran aqueous two-phase system are established recently, and the phase interfaces within vesicle membrane are very interesting as experimentally observed. The developed theoretical framework by a combination of the Helfrich curvature elastic theory for vesicle membranes and self-consistent field theory for polymers has been extended to explore aqueous two phases within vesicles. The intrinsic contact angle [Formula: see text] that represents the material parameter, is introduced to describe this phase interfaces within vesicles, especially the transitions from complete wetting to partial wetting, from partial wetting to complete dewetting. The dependence of intrinsic contact angles on the parameters, such as the interaction strengths between the polymers [Formula: see text] and between the membrane and polymer [Formula: see text], the volume fraction [Formula: see text], impermeability of the membrane to the enclosed polymers [Formula: see text] and membrane spontaneous curvature c 0, are thoroughly investigated, as well as these wetting/dewetting transitions are extensively discussed in the present study.",3
Ab initio study of the moisture stability of lead iodine perovskites.,"The stability of hybrid lead iodine perovskite in a humid environment has been a major obstacle to developing long-term photovoltaic devices. However, understanding the detailed degradation mechanism of lead iodine perovskite in moisture is still challenging. Herein, using first-principles calculations, we show that embedded water molecules will facilitate the decomposition of lead iodine perovskite. Alloying FAPbI3 and CsPbI3 to form mixed-cation lead iodine perovskites not only can optimize the tolerance factor to obtain better phase stability, but also can improve the moisture stability of them. With the accumulation of water molecules in the perovskite lattice, the optical absorption spectra show a blue-shift and decreased intensity, and the moisture stabilities of lead iodine perovskites are further lowered. The iodine vacancy in lead iodine perovskites can facilitate the water molecule migration and thus is a disadvantage in improving the moisture stability of them, which should be minimized during perovskite growth. These findings provide new insight in understanding the poor moisture stability of lead iodine perovskites, which should be helpful for the future design and optimization of stable perovskite solar cells.",3
Two-tag correlations and nonequilibrium fluctuation-response relation in ageing single-file diffusion.,"Spatiotemporally correlated motions of interacting Brownian particles, confined in a narrow channel of infinite length, are studied in terms of statistical quantities involving two particles. A theoretical framework that allows analytical calculation of two-tag correlations is presented on the basis of the Dean-Kawasaki equation describing density fluctuations in colloidal systems. In the equilibrium case, the time-dependent Einstein relation holds between the two-tag displacement correlation and the response function corresponding to it, which is a manifestation of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem for the correlation of density fluctuations. While the standard procedure of closure approximation for nonlinear density fluctuations is known to be obstructed by inconsistency with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, this difficulty is naturally avoided by switching from the standard Fourier representation of the density field to the label-based Fourier representation of the vacancy field. In the case of ageing dynamics started from equidistant lattice configuration, the time-dependent Einstein relation is violated, as the two-tag correlation depends on the waiting time for equilibration while the response function is not sensitive to it. Within linear approximation, however, there is a simple relation between the density (or vacancy) fluctuations and the corresponding response function, which is valid even if the system is out of equilibrium. This non-equilibrium fluctuation-response relation can be extended to the case of nonlinear fluctuations by means of closure approximation for the vacancy field.",3
Critical properties of the quasi-two-dimensional metallic ferromagnet Fe2.85GeTe2.,"We have investigated the critical behavior of Fe2.85GeTe2 single crystals near the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition by bulk dc magnetization measurements. The critical exponents beta, gamma and delta, obtained from modified Arrott plot, Kouvel-Fisher method, and critical isothermal magnetization analysis, could fulfill the Widom scaling law. The self-consistency and reliability of these exponents are further verified by the magnetic state equations below and above the Curie temperature at high magnetic field. In addition, the exchange distance deduced from the susceptibility exponent is shown to decay as [Formula: see text]. Based on the observations, we suggest that the competition between direct magnetic exchange and Coulombic and/or RKKY interactions should be responsible for the intrinsic magnetism in this system.",3
Spin-fluctuation and spin-relaxation effects of single adatoms from first principles.,"Single adatoms offer an exceptional playground for studying magnetism and its associated dynamics at the atomic scale. Here we review recent results on single adatoms deposited on metallic substrates, based on time-dependent density functional theory. First we analyze quantum zero-point spin-fluctuations (ZPSF) as calculated from the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, and show how they affect the magnetic stability by modifying the magnetic anisotropy energy. We also assess the impact of ZPSF in the limit of small hybridization to the substrate characteristic of semi-insulating substrates, connecting to recent experimental investigations where magnetic stability of a single adatom was achieved for the first time. Secondly, we inspect further the dynamics of single adatoms by considering the longitudinal and transverse spin-relaxation processes, whose time-scales are analyzed and related to the underlying electronic structure of both the adatom and the substrate. Thirdly, we analyze spin-fluctuation modes of paramagnetic adatoms, i.e. adatoms where the Stoner criterion for magnetism is almost fulfilled. Interestingly, such modes can develop well-defined peaks in the meV range, their main characteristics being determined by two fundamental electronic properties, namely the Stoner parameter and the density of states at the Fermi level. Furthermore, simulated inelastic scanning tunneling spectroscopy curves reveal that these spin-fluctuation modes can be triggered by tunneling electrons, opening up potential applications also for paramagnetic adatoms. Lastly, an overview of the outstanding issues and future directions is given.",3
Electron-donor doping enhanced Li storage in electride Ca2N monolayer: a first-principles study.,"It was reported by Hu et al (2015 ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces 7 24016) that Li adsorption on the Ca2N monolayer is energetically unfavorable, although it was found to be a good candidate for Na storage. In this paper, from first-principles calculations, it is shown that compressive stain can greatly enhance the interactions between Li adsorbate and the Ca2N host, which is beneficial to prevent Li from clustering on the surface and thus Li storage becomes possible. Charge distribution analysis further shows that the enhanced Li-adsorption is a result of the increased surface charge density and the more confined charge distribution under compressive strain. Inspired by this observation, several electron-donor-doped Ca2N materials are considered as anode materials for Li-ion batteries. Results show that the O and F doped Ca2N have the best performance, with predicted Li storage capacity reaching about 567.9 and 565.9 mAh g(-1) for O and F doped cases, respectively. It is also demonstrated that electron-donor doping does not change the metallic electronic structures and the low Li-ion migration energy barriers on the surface of the Ca2N monolayer, and thus the rate performance of the doped Ca2N can be as good as the undoped case. Our study offers a deep understanding of the Li interactions with 2D materials and provides an approach of material modification to 2D electrides for battery applications.",3
Application of PDF analysis assisted by MD simulations for determination of the atomic structure and crystal habit of CdSe nanocrystals.,"A new methodology of performing structural analysis of nanocrystals based on wide angle powder diffraction is proposed. It combines molecular dynamics simulations with the analysis of pair distribution function. The actual analysis was performed on CdSe quantum dots. MD simulations of nanocrystals with shapes defined by low-index atomic planes, (1 0 0), (1 1 0), and (1 1 1) introduced bulk and surface relaxation in initially perfect crystal lattice. In search for the best atomistic model of the actual CdSe nanocrystals, experimental structure functions S(Q) and interatomic distance functions G(r) were matched to those calculated with MD models. Eventually it was concluded that CdSe nanocrystals with dimensions of 2.5-3.5 nm assume the shape of octahedrons terminated by (1 1 1) surfaces.",3
Free and confined Brownian motion in viscoelastic Stokes-Oldroyd B fluids.,"We linearize the Stokes-Oldroyd B model for small perturbations and instantaneous hydrodynamic friction to simulate the environment for a free and confined Brownian particle. We use the standard Green's function approach to determine the viscoelasticity, and show that the expression obtained for the frequency dependent viscosity is similar to that given by the Jeffrey's model, though the latter describes viscoelasticity by the bulk storage and loss moduli that is represented by a complex elastic modulus [Formula: see text] of the fluid concerned. In contrast, we consider the characteristics of the polymer chains and the Newtonian solvent of the complex fluid individually, and determine an expression for frequency-dependent viscosity that would be useful for microrheology performed from Brownian trajectories measured in experiments. Finally, we evaluate the trajectory of a free Brownian particle in a viscoelastic environment using our formalism, and calculate various important parameters quantifying Brownian dynamics, which we then extend to the particle confined in a harmonic potential as provided by optical tweezers.",3
Nonlocal statistical field theory of dipolar particles in electrolyte solutions.,"We present a nonlocal statistical field theory of a dilute electrolyte solution with a small additive of dipolar particles. We postulate that every dipolar particle is associated with an arbitrary probability distribution function (PDF) of distance between its charge centers. Using the standard Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, we represent the configuration integral of the system in the functional integral form. We show that in the limit of a small permanent dipole moment, the functional in integrand exponent takes the well known form of the Poisson-Boltzmann-Langevin (PBL) functional. In the mean-field approximation we obtain a non-linear integro-differential equation with respect to the mean-field electrostatic potential, generalizing the PBL equation for the point-like dipoles obtained first by Abrashkin et al. We apply the obtained equation in its linearized form to derivation of the expressions for the mean-field electrostatic potential of the point-like test ion and its solvation free energy in salt-free solution, as well as in solution with salt ions. For the 'Yukawa'-type PDF we obtain analytic relations for both the electrostatic potential and the solvation free energy of the point-like test ion. We obtain a general expression for the bulk electrostatic free energy of the solution within the Random phase approximation (RPA). For the salt-free solution of the dipolar particles for the Yukawa-type PDF we obtain an analytic relation for the electrostatic free energy, resulting in two limiting regimes. Finally, we analyze the limiting laws, following from the general relation for the electrostatic free energy of solution in presence of both the ions and the dipolar particles for the case of Yukawa-type PDF.",3
Mechanical relaxation and freezing in the room temperature strain glass alloy Ti50(Pd40Cr10).,"The alloy Ti50(Pd40Cr10) undergoes a strain glass transition around room temperature evidenced by frequency dispersion of dynamic mechanical properties and lack of average structure change from that of the high symmetry austenite phase. However, since the strain glass transition is not a thermodynamic phase transition but a dynamic freezing process governed by the kinetics, a quantitative characterization of the slowing down of dynamics during the strain glass transition is still lacking. In the present study, the probability distribution function (PDF) of the relaxation time of the strain glass alloy is investigated spanning the whole transition temperature range (253 K-313 K). The slowing down of dynamics of the strain glass is indicated by the rapid increase of the characteristic relaxation time ([Formula: see text]) upon cooling. The [Formula: see text], as a function of temperature, shows a transition from Vogel-Fulcher relationship to an Arrhenius relationship. Such a change suggests two fundamentally different states: unfrozen strain glass state and frozen strain glass state. Furthermore, the spread of the PDF is connected to the fraction of quasi-static nanodomains, which helps the understanding of the dynamic freezing process in the strain glass.",3
Suppression of transport spin-polarization of surface states with emergence of ferromagnetism in Mn-doped Bi2Se3.,"The surface states of topological insulators (TI) are protected by time reversal symmetry and they display intrinsic spin helicity where the momentum of the charge carriers decides their spin states. As a consequence, a current injected through the surface states becomes spin polarized and this transport spin-polarization leads to a proportionate suppression of Andreev reflection in superconductor/TI junctions. Here we show that upon doping Bi2Se3 with Mn, the transport spin-polarization is seen to be monotonically suppressed. The parent compound Bi2Se3 is found to exhibit a transport spin-polarization of about 63% whereas crystals with 10% Mn doping show transport spin-polarization of about 48%. This suppression is accompanied by an increasing ferromagnetic order of the crystals with Mn doping. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy shows that the topological protection of the surface states reduces due to Mn doping. The net measured transport spin-polarization is due to a competition of this effect with the increased magnetization on Mn doping. The present results provide important insights for the choice of magnetic topological insulators for spintronic applications.",3
Phase diagram of the incommensurate off-diagonal Aubry-Andre model with p-wave pairing.,"Using exact numerical methods, we study the interplay between p-wave superconductivity and off-diagonal modulation in the incommensurate off-diagonal Aubry-Andre model with p-wave pairing. When chemical potential is zero, the modulation not only leads to an Anderson-like localization with all bulk states changing into critical ones, but also induces a topological phase transition accompanying the disappearing of exponentially localized zero-energy edge Majorana fermions. These two transitions happen at different places and true Anderson localization is absent. With a finite chemical potential, the quasi-periodicity of the modulation causes band splitting and drives the system into a band insulator phase. It has a fixed incommensurate particle density which is determined by the modulation frequency. Phase diagrams are identified, and can be tested with existing proposals for experimental realizations of the effective off-diagonal disorder and the p-wave pairing.",3
Electrical contact resistance in graphite-graphene contacts from ab initio methods.,"We study the ballistic transmission and the contact resistance (R c) of a graphite-graphene contact in a top contact geometry from first principles. We find that the calculated R c's depend on the amount of graphene-graphite overlap, but quickly saturate for transfer lengths of the order of a few tens of A. For contacts overlapping more than this transfer length, the R c can be lower than the 100 [Formula: see text] mark. On the other hand, edge graphite-graphene contacts are expected to have very low contact resistance.",3
Relaxation of nonequilibrium quasiparticles in mesoscopic size superconductors.,"Rapid development of micro- and nanofabrication methods have provoked interest and enabled experimental studies of electronic properties of a vast class of (sub)micrometer-size solid state systems. Mesoscopic-size hybrid structures, containing superconducting elements, have become interesting objects for basic research studies and various applications, ranging from medical and astrophysical sensors to quantum computing. One of the most important aspects of physics, governing the behavior of such systems, is the finite concentration of nonequilibrium quasiparticles, present in a superconductor even well below the temperature of superconducting transition. Those nonequilibrium excitations might limit the performance of a variety of superconducting devices, like superconducting qubits, single-electron turnstiles and microrefrigerators. On the contrary, in some applications, like detectors of electromagnetic radiation, the nonequilibrium state is essential for their operation. It is therefore of vital importance to study the mechanisms of nonequilibrium quasiparticle relaxation in superconductors of mesoscopic dimensions, where the whole structure can be considered as an 'interface'. At early stages of research the problem was mostly studied in relatively massive systems and at high temperatures close to the critical temperature of a superconductor. We review the recent progress in studies of nonequilibrium quasiparticle relaxation in superconductors including the low temperature limit. We also discuss the open physical questions and perspectives of development in the field.",3
Temperature dependence of nonlinear susceptibilities in an infinite range interaction model.,"We present a model to probe metamagnetic properties in systems with a variable number of interacting spins. Thermodynamic properties such as the magnetization per particle [Formula: see text], linear susceptibility [Formula: see text], and nonlinear susceptibilities [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] were calculated. The model produces a different magnetic response for N particles when comparing to N - 1 particles for small [Formula: see text]. For an even number of particles, the susceptibilities show maxima in their temperature dependence. An odd number produces an additional free spin response that dominates at low temperatures. This free spin response also produces a step in the field-dependent magnetization per particle at B = 0 for odd N. The magnetization shows N/2 steps at [Formula: see text] with integer n for even N and [Formula: see text] additional steps at [Formula: see text] with integer n for odd N. Small clusters respond with metamagnetism in an otherwise isotropic spin space, while the large clusters show no metamagnetism.",3
Topologically protected edge transport of sound in coupled cavities of a modified honeycomb lattice.,"In this work, we investigate comprehensively the unidirectional transport of sound in coupled cavities of a modified honeycomb lattice. The results clearly show that a pair of topological states carrying opposite pseudospins can be constructed at the edge of truncated lattices of non-trivial band gaps, which is different from previous schemes where topological states with opposite pseudospins were constructed at the interface of modified honeycomb lattices of trivial and non-trivial band gaps. Our work paves the way to exploring unidirectional edge transport of sound with topological protection in closed systems that are beneficial in large-scale device integration and low-loss operation.",3
Single crystal growth and anisotropic physical properties of Sm4Co3Ga16.,"We have synthesized high quality single crystals of Sm4Co3Ga16 with gallium flux and investigated its physical properties with electrical resistivity, magnetization and specific-heat measurements. Antiferromagnetic transition below 6.7 K has been detected. No superconducting transitions have been dectected down to 0.5 K from our single crystals. Based on our experimental result, Sm(3+) state in Sm4Co3Ga16 is likely well localized, in which stable magnetic moment in its doubly degenerated ground state contributes to the magnetic order with little interference of Kondo type of interaction.",3
Static and dynamic compact analytical model for junctionless nanowire transistors.,"This paper presents a compact analytical model for the static and dynamic electrical characteristics of Junctionless Nanowire Transistors. The static drain current model formulation is derived from the 2D solution of the Poisson equation with appropriate boundary conditions and long-channel devices, leading to a continuous effective surface potential that accounts for the conduction in partial depletion and accumulation regimes. The long-channel model is modified to account for short-channel effects by using the coupled solution of 3D Laplace equation with the 2D Poisson equation. The substrate bias influence on the drain current is also included in the model formulation. The charges at the device terminals are differentiated with respect to the applied biases leading to an analytical description of the transconductances and transcapacitances. The proposed model is validated using experimental data at different bias conditions and temperatures, showing very good agreement.",3
Experimental study and mechanism analysis on the effect of substrate wettability on graphene sheets distribution morphology within uniform printing droplets.,"Uniform graphene films and micro-patterns are the cornerstones of graphene-based printed electronics. However, disk-like reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets trend to concentrate at the edge of the drop because of the famous coffee-ring effect, resulting in non-uniform patterns. To understand the physics of coffee-ring formation for RGO droplets on hydrophilic substrates, we propose a mechanical model to elucidate the influence and its mechanism of substrate wettability on the solute migration behavior and solute distribution morphology of RGO droplets. Stronger coffee-ring morphology and a slower velocity transition on the PMMA can be observed as compared to that on the glass slides. An explanation based on the mechanical model is provided as the large contact angle on the PMMA leads to a small hindrance force and finally results in more significant coffee-ring morphology. Remarkably, we have revealed one underlying mechanism by which the hydrophilic substrate with better wettability will form more uniform patterns. This study can provide fundamental insights into the relationship between substrate wettability and RGO sheets distribution morphology. It might contribute to morphology regulation of RGO droplets in the DOD printing of graphene films and micro-patterns.",3
Type I superconductivity in Dirac materials.,"Superconductivity of the second kind was observed in many 3D Weyl and Dirac semi-metals while in the PdTe2, superconductivity is clearly of the first kind. This is very rare in Dirac semi-metals, but is expected in clean conventional metallic superconductors with 3D parabolic dispersion relation. The conduction bands in this material exhibit the linear (Dirac) dispersion only along two directions, while in the third direction the dispersion is parabolic. Therefore the 'hybrid' Dirac-parabolic material is intermediate between the two extremes. A microscopic pairing theory is derived for arbitrary tilt parameter of the 2D cone and used to determine anisotropic coherence lengths, the penetration depths and applied to recent extensive experiments. Magnetic properties of these superconductors are then studied in the parallel to the layers magnetic field on the basis of microscopically derived Ginzburg-Landau effective theory for the order parameter.",3
Structural evolution and magnetic properties of anionic clusters Cr2Ge n (n = 3-14): photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory computation.,"The structural, electronic and magnetic properties of dual Cr atoms doped germanium anionic clusters, [Formula: see text] (n = 3-14), have been investigated by using photoelectron spectroscopy in combination with density-functional theory calculations. The low-lying structures of [Formula: see text] are determined by DFT based genetic algorithm optimization. For [Formula: see text] with n 8, the structures are bipyramid-based geometries, while [Formula: see text] cluster has an opening cage-like structure, and the half-encapsulated structure is gradually covered by the additional Ge atoms to form closed-cage configuration with one Cr atom interior for n = 10 to 14. Meanwhile, the two Cr atoms in [Formula: see text] clusters tend to form a Cr-Cr bond rather than be separated. Interestingly, the magnetic moment of all the anionic clusters considered is 1 mu B. Almost all clusters exhibit antiferromagnetic Cr-Cr coupling, except for two clusters, [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]. To our knowledge, the [Formula: see text] cluster is the first kind of transition-metal doped semiconductor clusters that exhibit relatively stable antiferromagnetism within a wide size range. The experimental/theoretical results suggest high potential to modify the magnetic behavior of semiconductor clusters through introducing different transition-metal dopant atoms.",3
Enhanced optical properties of Cu2O anchored on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets.,"In this report, Cu2O and Cu2O/rGO nanocomposites were successfully synthesized through chemical reduction method using glucose as a reducing agent for GO. The x-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscope was used to investigate the phase composition and microstructure of the as-prepared materials. The presence of different functional groups in the as-synthesized sample was analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Raman spectroscopy was used to confirm structural aspects such as defects of synthesized Cu2O/rGO nanocomposites. The optical properties of the as-prepared samples were analyzed by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Urbach energy is calculated in order to find out the defects in the nanocomposites. Zeta potential analysis was done to study the surface charge and stability of the as-synthesized samples. These results show that the content of rGO introduced into nanocomposite improves the optical properties of Cu2O thereby enhancing the utilization of visible light.",3
Multi-band effects in in-plane resistivity anisotropy of strain-detwinned disordered Ba(Fe1-xRux)2As2.,"In-plane resistivity anisotropy was measured in strain-detwinned as-grown and partially annealed samples of isovalently-substituted [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]) and the results were contrasted with previous reports on anneal samples with low residual resistivity. In samples with high residual resistivity, detwinned with application of strain, the difference of the two components of in-plane resistivity in the orthorhombic phase, [Formula: see text], was found to obey Matthiessen rule irrespective of sample composition, which is in stark contrast with observations on annealed samples. Our findings are consistent with two-band transport model in which contribution from high mobility carriers of small pockets of the Fermi surface has negligible anisotropy of residual resistivity and is eliminated by disorder. Our finding suggests that magnetic/nematic order has dramatically different effect on different parts of the Fermi surface. It predominantly affects inelastic scattering for small pocket high mobility carriers and elastic impurity scattering for larger sheets of the Fermi surface.",3
"Vibration analysis of hydrogen, deuterium and tritium in metals: consequences on the isotope effect.","The present study focuses on the impact of the vibrational frequencies on the thermodynamic behavior of hydrides, deuterides and tritides, using high scale harmonic phonon calculations based on first-principle calculations. 115 MH y hydrides were considered, for [Formula: see text] with M among 30 metallic elements. The results were found to be in good agreement with the available experimental data and pointed out trends on the evolution of the hydride zero point energy as a function of the crystal structure and the host metal nature. Based on this information, the vibration contribution to the formation enthalpy was deduced. This contribution is responsible for the differences between the enthalpies and therefore pressures of formation of the hydride, deuteride and tritide compounds. This so-called 'isotope effect' is experimentally observed but has never been studied by large scale calculations. A straightforward method has been developed allowing to quantify the isotope effect at non zero temperature. It explains the experimentally observed relative stability of hydride, deuteride and tritide compounds. As a major achievement, a new phenomenon was highlighted, which has never been anticipated, consisting in an inversion of the isotope effect when the temperature increases.",3
Giant conductance anisotropy in black phosphorene tuned by external electric field.,"Based on the non-equilibrium Green's function method, the conductance anisotropy of black phosphorene has been studied under chemical potential and/or external electric field. The direction and magnitude of the conductance anisotropy strongly depend on the chemical potential, which are in good agreement with experimental observations. Furthermore, the magnitude of conductance anisotropy can be largely modulated by external electric field, which is one order of magnitude larger than previously reported. The directions of the maximum and minimum conductance can be reversed by external electric field, which shows that the former jumps from 24 degrees to 90 degrees and the latter jumps from 90 degrees to 0 degrees respectively. The results are fundamentally interesting and technologically promising in nano-electronics.",3
"Interaction between interstitial carbon atoms and a (1/2) <1 1 1> self-interstitial atoms loop in an iron matrix: a combined DFT, off lattice KMC and MD study.","A static and kinetic study of the interaction between a 19 (1/2) <1 1 1> self-interstitial atoms loop and C atoms in body-centred cubic iron is presented in this work. An empirical potential matching the density functional theory calculations is used to study the static properties of the system. The usual kinetic Monte-Carlo (KMC) on-lattice restriction is not valid when the material is highly distorted, especially in the presence of a dislocation loop. Therefore, the dynamics of the system are investigated using both molecular dynamics simulations and k-ART, a self-learning/off-lattice atomic kinetic monte-carlo. The presented work is thus a full study of the C-loop and the C2-loop systems. A good agreement is observed between the statics and the kinetics (e.g. the discovery of a zone of stability of the C atom around the Fe cluster where the C can almost freely move), even though the kinetics show some unexpected behaviours of the studied systems. The pinning time of the loop induced by the C atoms is also estimated.",3
Pressure induced anomalous magnetic behaviour in nanocrystalline YCrO3 at room temperature.,"High pressure behaviour of nanocrystalline YCrO3 is investigated up to 10 GPa using electrical, magnetic, synchrotron x-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy measurements. High pressure dielectric constant measurements show a sharp peak at 4.5 GPa, though the sample is found to be in ferroelectric phase up to the highest pressure of our study from piezoelectric current measurements. X-ray diffraction measurements show absence of any structural phase transition, however anomalies are observed in the unit cell structural parameters at about 4.3 GPa and the Y-atom position shows a maximum shift at the same pressure. In the absence of any structural transition, anomalous behaviour of relevant Raman modes with minimum in the Raman band width at about same pressure indicate towards a spin-phonon interaction. AC magnetic measurements in the toroid anvil cell show an anomalous enhancement of magnetic moment above 4 GPa indicating a collective magnetic response of nanoparticles.",3
Water-induced reordering in ultrathin ionic liquid films.,"Water-induced reordering in ultrathin ionic liquid films has been observed using in situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. An ultrathin layer of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([C4C1Im][BF4]) was deposited on a rutile TiO2 (1 1 0) single crystal and exposed to water vapour at a relative humidity of ~70% in an in situ cell. Water was found to adsorb onto the ionic liquid surface, causing a reordering of the ions at the interface. Water initially remained trapped on the ionic liquid surface as the in situ cell was evacuated. This could have negative implications for supported ionic liquid phase catalysis, where reactants and products move in and out of an ionic liquid containing the catalyst. This insight into the behaviour at the water/ionic liquid interface provides a basis for understanding interfacial behaviour in more complex gas/ionic liquid systems.",3
Use and mis-use of x-ray photoemission spectroscopy Ce3d spectra of Ce2O3 and CeO2.,"X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) work on Ce2O3 and CeO2 oxides has been an active topic of research over the past four decades or so. Such research aimed to find the reasons for the unusual complexity of Ce3d spectra of the two oxides, and it studied catalytic properties of materials that contained them. I discuss how theoretical and experimental studies exploited the diagnostic potential of XPS to reach our current knowledge of the electronic properties of the two oxides. A part of these studies provided peak-fitting guidelines to resolve Ce3d spectra produced by the co-existence of both oxides into the individual spectral components arising from Ce(3+) and Ce(4+) ions. Basing myself on the analysis of several peak-fittings of Ce3d spectra carried out in studies of the catalytic applications of CeO2-based materials, I show that more often than not they largely ignore the findings of theoretical, experimental, and methodological XPS work. I discuss typical problems that flaw Ce3d peak-fittings, and how they affect their accuracy. I argue that, although several XPS studies do list primary literature of Ce3d spectra in their bibliography, they often do so for decorative purposes, rather than practical purposes.",3
Valence charge distribution in homogenous silicon-aluminium thin-films.,"Homogenous aSi1-x Al x H y alloyed thin films, made by magnetron sputtering, has been found to exhibit tunable band gap and dielectric constant depending on their composition. The optical properties of alloys are largely defined by their electronic structure, which is is strongly influenced by interatomic charge transfer. In this work we have quantified interatomic charge transfer between Si, Al and H in aSi1-x Al x H y thin-films, with [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]. Charge transfer was found experimentally using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, by incorporating Auger parameter data into the Thomas and Weightman model. Both the perfect and imperfect screening models were tested, and the results were compared to models calculated using density functional theory based molecular dynamics. Using imperfect screening properties of Si and Al resulted in an excellent agreement between the experimental and computational results. Alloying aSi with Al is associated with donation of electrons from Al to Si for y = 0. For y > 0 electrons are transferred away from both Al and Si. The change in Si valence charge increases linearly with increasing band gap and decreasing dielectric constant. These relationships can be used as a quick guide for the evaluation of the Si valence charge and subsequently optoelectronic properties, at specific Al/Si ratios.",3
Intense yellow luminescence from Dy(3+)-doped TeO2-WO3-GeO2 glasses: structural and optical characterization.,"Different concentrations of Dy(3+)-doped oxyfluoride tellurite (TWGDy) glasses of composition (85 - x) TeO2 + 5 WO3 + 10 GeO2 + x DyF3, where x = 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mol% were prepared by melt quenching method. The Judd-Ofelt theory was applied to study the luminescence properties. Three phenomenological Judd-Ofelt (Omega lambda=2,4,6) intensity parameters were obtained as Omega2 = 4.90 x 10(-20) cm(2), Omega4 = 1.73 x 10(-20) cm(2) and Omega6 = 1.48 x 10(-20) cm(2) for 0.5 mol% of Dy(3+)-doped TWGDy glass. When excited at different wavelengths, the TWGDy glasses exhibit three emission bands due to (4)F9/2 --> (6)H15/2 (blue), (4)F9/2 --> (6)H13/2 (yellow) and (4)F9/2 --> (6)H11/2 (red) transitions. The excitation wavelength was optimized as 453 nm for strong and proficient luminescence from TWGDy glasses. Beyond 0.5 mol% of Dy(3+) concentration, the TWGDy glasses show luminescence quenching. The laser characteristic parameters such as effective bandwidth, stimulated emission cross-section, gain bandwidth and optical gain were determined using the emission spectra and radiative parameters. The 0.5 mol% of Dy(3+)-doped TWGDy glass could be potential to design a new class of yellow laser material.",3
"Electronic structure of single layer 1T-NbSe2: interplay of lattice distortions, non-local exchange, and Mott-Hubbard correlations.","Using ab initio calculations we reveal the nature of the insulating phase recently found experimentally in monolayer 1T-NbSe2. We find soft phonon modes in a large part of the Brillouin zone indicating the strong-coupling nature of a charge-density-wave instability. Structural relaxation of a [Formula: see text] supercell reveals a Star-of-David reconstruction with an energy gain of 60 meV per primitive unit cell. The band structure of the distorted phase exhibits a half-filled flat band which is associated with orbitals that are delocalized over several atoms in each Star of David. By including many-body corrections through a combined GW, hybrid-functional, and DMFT treatment, we find the flat band to split into narrow Hubbard bands. The lowest energy excitation across the gap turns out to be between itinerant Se-p states and the upper Hubbard band, determining the system to be a charge-transfer insulator. Combined hybrid-functional and GW calculations show that long-range interactions shift the Se-p states to lower energies. Thus, a delicate interplay of local and long-range correlations determines the gap nature and its size in this distorted phase of the monolayer 1T-NbSe2.",3
Transport theory for electrical detection of the spin-momentum locking of topological surface states.,"We provide a general transport theory for spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) through a doped topological insulator (TI) surface. It is found that different from the conventional magnetic substrate, the tunneling conductance through the tip-TI surface acquires an extra component determined by the in-plane spin texture, exclusively associated with the spin momentum locking. Importantly, this extra conductance unconventionally depends on the spatial azimuthal angle of the magnetized STM tip. By introducing a magnetic impurity to break the symmetry of rotation and local time reversal of the TI surface, we find that the measurement of the spatial resolved conductance can reconstruct the helical structure of spin texture, from which the spin-momentum locking angle can be extracted if the in-plane magnetization is induced purely by the spin-orbit coupling of surface Dirac electrons. Our theory offers an alternative way, differing from existing in-plane-current polarization probed in a multi-terminal setup or angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy, to electrically identify the helical spin texture on TI surfaces.",3
Electronic energy spectroscopy of monochromatic edge magnetoplasmons in the quantum Hall regime.,We investigate electronic excitation in a quantum Hall edge channel when a monochromatic plasmon wave is excited by applying a radio-frequency voltage to a long surface gate on an AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructure. A quantum-dot energy spectrometer is employed to evaluate the amplitude of the potential wave and possible electronic heating. The potential wave is analyzed with a capacitance model. Non-monotonic frequency dependence observed under specific conditions can be explained by destructive plasmon interference in the gated region. The observed small heating effect suggests that the single plasmon mode is dominantly excited with this scheme.,3
Coherent control of an opsin in living brain tissue.,"Retinal-based opsins are light-sensitive proteins. The photoisomerization reaction of these proteins has been studied outside cellular environments using ultrashort tailored light pulses(1-5). However, how living cell functions can be modulated via opsins by modifying fundamental nonlinear optical properties of light interacting with the retinal chromophore has remained largely unexplored. We report the use of chirped ultrashort near-infrared pulses to modulate light-evoked ionic current from Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in brain tissue, and consequently the firing pattern of neurons, by manipulating the phase of the spectral components of the light. These results confirm that quantum coherence of the retinal-based protein system, even in a living neuron, can influence its current output, and open up the possibilities of using designer-tailored pulses for controlling molecular dynamics of opsins in living tissue to selectively enhance or suppress neuronal function for adaptive feedback-loop applications in the future.",3
"Temporal evolution on SiO2 surface under low energy Ar(+)-ion bombardment: roles of sputtering, mass redistribution, and shadowing.","Self-organized pattern evolution on SiO2 surface under low energy Ar-ion irradiation has been investigated extensively at varied ion energies, angles of ion incidence, and ion flux. Our investigations reveal an instability on SiO2 surface in an angular window of 40 degrees 70 degrees and for a comprehensive range of Ar-ion energies (200-1000 eV). Different topographical features, viz. ripples, mounds, and elongated nanostructures evolve on the surface, depending upon the angle of incidence and ion fluence. The results are compiled in the form of a parametric phase diagram (ion energy versus angle of incidence) which summarizes the pattern formation on SiO2 surface. To understand the evolution of observed patterns, we have carried out theoretical estimation, taking into account the synergetic roles of ion induced curvature-dependent sputter erosion and prompt atomic redistribution. It is shown that irradiation-induced mass redistribution of target atoms plays a crucial role in determining the critical angle of ion incidence for pattern formation on SiO2 under the present experimental conditions, whereas the contribution of curvature-dependent sputtering needs to be considered to understand the existence of the angular window of pattern formation. In addition, ion-beam shadowing by surface features are shown to play a dominant role in the formation of mounds and elongated structures at higher ion fluences.",3
Dynamic magnetization on the low temperature magnetoelectric effect in multiferroic composites.,"The dependence of frequency and applied magnetic field in the magnetoelectric effect (ME) of the composites 0.68Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)-0.32PbTiO3/CoFe2O4 (PMN-PT/CFO) and 0.68Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)-0.32PbTiO3/NiFe2O4 (PMN-PT/NFO) are investigated. The results for PMN-PT/CFO composite, show a hysteretic behavior for the ME coefficient, at low temperatures (5 K), for frequencies higher than 1000 Hz. Contrasting with these results, the ME coefficient for the PMN-PT/NFO shows a well-known peak-peak related with the magnetostriction coefficient. Based on energy levels of stabilization for each ferromagnetic phase, it was possible to explain the ME hysteretic distinct behavior of PMN-PT/CFO, because of the degeneracy in the energy levels, due to the spin-orbit coupling causing changes in the dynamic properties of the magnetoelastic interactions.",3
Complex structures generated by competing interactions in harmonically confined colloidal suspensions.,"We investigate the structural properties of colloidal particle systems interacting via an isotropic pair potential and confined by a three-dimensional harmonic potential. The interaction potential has a repulsive-attractive-repulsive profile that varies with the interparticle distance (also known as a 'mermaid' potential). We performed Langevin dynamics simulations to find the equilibrium configurations of the system. We show that particles can self-assemble in complex structural patterns, such as compact disks, fringed disks, rods, spherical clusters with superficial entrances among others. Also, for particular values of the parameters of the interaction potential, we could identify that some configurations were formed by quasi two-dimensional (2D) structures which are stable for 2D systems.",3
The race to the bottom: approaching the ideal glass?,"Key to resolving the scientific challenge of the glass transition is to understand the origin of the massive increase in viscosity of liquids cooled below their melting temperature (avoiding crystallisation). A number of competing and often mutually exclusive theoretical approaches have been advanced to describe this phenomenon. Some posit a bona fide thermodynamic phase to an 'ideal glass', an amorphous state with exceptionally low entropy. Other approaches are built around the concept of the glass transition as a primarily dynamic phenomenon. These fundamentally different interpretations give equally good descriptions of the data available, so it is hard to determine which-if any-is correct. Recently however this situation has begun to change. A consensus has emerged that one powerful means to resolve this longstanding question is to approach the putative thermodynamic transition sufficiently closely, and a number of techniques have emerged to meet this challenge. Here we review the results of some of these new techniques and discuss the implications for the existence-or otherwise-of the thermodynamic transition to an ideal glass.",3
Surface enhancement of water at the ionic liquid-gas interface of [HMIM][Cl] under ambient water vapor.,"The ionic liquid-gas interface of 1-hexyl-3-methyl-imidazolium chloride, [HMIM][Cl], was examined in the presence of water vapor using lab-based ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) at room temperature. The interfacial water uptake was measured quantitatively in the pressure range of high vacuum up to a maximum of 5 Torr (27% RH) and back to high vacuum in a systematic manner. Water mole fractions in the interface determined from APXPS were compared to previously published tandem differential mobility analysis results on [HMIM][Cl] nanodroplets. Our findings show that water constitutes a significantly larger mole fraction at the interface when compared to the bulk. Additionally, the reverse isotherms showed that the uptake of water at the interface of [HMIM][Cl] is a reversible process.",3
Effect of quantum confinement on lifetime of anharmonic decay of optical phonons in semiconductor nanostructures.,"The anharmonic decay of phonons underlies many important effects in semiconductors, e.g. hotspot formation, phonon bottleneck and thermal resistivity. In this article, we evaluate the effect of quantum confinement on the anharmonic decay transition probability in a cubic isotropic material. This article focuses on the anharmonic decay of longitudinal optical phonons, generated from hot electrons, are directly related to formation of hotspots in the active region of semiconductor devices. The confinement effect has been realized in double interface heterostructure quantum well (DHSQW) (e.g. AlAs/GaAs/AlAs) and free-standing quantum well (FSQW) (e.g. GaAs) structures as the confined phonon modes have different properties inside the structures. The longitudinal-optical phonon decay rate is reduced for the case of a DHSQW compared to bulk material and for a FSQW the decay rate has a strong dependence on wavevector value of the three phonons involved.",3
Physical realization of 2D spin liquid state by ab initio design and strain engineering in FeX3.,"So far, no real physical two dimensional (2D) monolayer materials with spin liquid (SL) state have been identified, although the SL state has been analytically predicted to be present in 2D triangular, honeycomb and kagome model lattices. Identifying a realistic monolayer, 2D SL material thus enables one to more clearly observe and understand the physics of the fractional quantum Hall effect, high-temperature superconductivity and magnetic monopole. In this work, we have performed first principles calculations within density functional theory to investigate the magnetic phase diagram in monolayer FeCl3, which reveals that the SL state may exist near the quantum phase transition between different antiferromagnetic (AFM) phases. Fundamentally, under a biaxial in-plane strain, the quantum phase transition appear and the ratio between the second neighboring exchange interaction (J 2) and the first neighboring interaction (J 1) falls into the SL range (0.21 ~ 0.28). Through comparison, the exchange energy ratio of monolayer FeBr3 (0.327 ~ 0.565) is beyond the SL range and thus FeBr3 could not exhibit SL characters. During the quantum phase transition induced by strain, the magnetic ground state transforms from AFM-Neel phase to AFM-stripy. Near the critical point, the semiconductor FeCl3 transforms from indirect to direct band gap. Our findings provide insights that the monolayer FeCl3 is a realistic 2D SL prototype material and the SL state could be observed by strain engineering.",3
Helium in-plane migration behavior on <1 0 0> symmetric tilt grain boundaries in tungsten.,"We present the results of an atomistic modeling study of small helium cluster migration in the plane of symmetric tilt grain boundaries. The relevant migration pathways and energies were determined by way of temperature accelerated dynamics and the nudged elastic band method. We find that small helium clusters show much higher migration energies when bound to the grain boundary than in the bulk for all types of grain boundaries, indicating strongly-impeded helium transport behavior. Larger helium clusters (up to three helium atoms) tend to have higher migration energies compared with smaller clusters. Longer-distance migrations also tend to have higher migration energies, but helium cluster migration is highly affected by the structure of the grain boundary. The binding energy of the grain boundaries studied is high enough that helium clusters would be unlikely to leave the grain boundary plane. However, vacancy migration energies are relatively low compared to the bulk, and are also much lower than helium cluster migration energies on the grain boundary plane. This suggests that helium cluster migration on the grain boundary is actually governed by the rate of vacancy migration: in the bulk, helium clusters are mobile, but they become bound to and immobilized by grain boundaries, forming bubbles. Bubbles, however, are likely more mobile on the grain boundary than they are in the bulk due to the increased rate of vacancy migration on the grain boundary. We expect similar migration behavior for other types of grain boundaries because of the increased excess volume found near all grain boundaries.",3
Ising-like behaviour of mesoscopic magnetic chains.,"We demonstrate an experimental realization of the short range magnetic order in a one-dimensional Ising chain using fabricated mesospins. We confirm an excellent agreement between the experimental findings and simulations obtained using the original Ising model. In particular, we are able to show that the thermal behaviour of the mesoscopic Ising chain dominates over the thermal behaviour of the individual mesospins themselves, confirming that fabricated mesospins can be viewed as artificial magnetic atoms.",3
Strained germanium nanowire optoelectronic devices for photonic-integrated circuits.,"Strained germanium nanowires have recently become an important material of choice for silicon-compatible optoelectronic devices. While the indirect bandgap nature of germanium had long been problematic both in light absorption and emission, recent successful demonstrations of bandstructure engineering by elastic strain have opened up the possibility of achieving direct bandgap in germanium, paving the way towards the realization of various high-performance optical devices integrated on a silicon platform. In particular, the latest demonstration of a low-threshold optically pumped laser in a highly strained germanium nanowire is expected to vitalize the field of silicon photonics further. Here, we review recent advances and challenges in strained germanium nanowires for optoelectronic applications such as photodetectors and lasers. We firstly introduce the theoretical foundation behind strained germanium nanowire optoelectronics. And several practical approaches that have been proposed to apply tensile strain in germanium nanowires are further discussed. Then we address the latest progress in the developments of strained germanium nanowire optoelectronic devices. Finally, we discuss the implications of these experimental achievements and the future outlook in this promising research field.",3
Spin-orbit effects on the spin and pseudospin polarization in ac-driven silicene.,"We study the pseudospin and spin dynamical effects in single-layer silicene due to a perpendicular electric field periodically driven and its interplay with the intrinsic and extrinsic (Rashba) spin-orbit interaction. We find that the spin nonconserving processes of the real spin of the quasiparticles in silicene, induced by the rather weak spin-orbit mechanisms, manifest themselves as shifts of the resonances of its quasienergy spectrum in the low coupling regime to the driving field. We show that there is an interesting cooperative effect among the, in principle, competing Rashba and intrinsic spin-orbit contributions. This is explicitly illustrated by exact and approximated analytical solutions of the dynamical equations. In addition, we show that a finite Rashba spin-orbit interaction is indeed necessary in order to achieve a nonvanishing spin polarization. As additional feature, trivial and nontrivial topological phases might be distinguished from each other as fast or slow dynamical fluctuations of the spin polarization. We mention the possible experimental detection schemes of our theoretical results and their relevance in new practical implementation of periodically driven interactions in silicene physics and related two-dimensional systems.",3
Direct imaging of the interaction between spin wave and transverse wall in magnetic nanostrip.,"By micromagnetic simulations, the dynamical interaction between spin wave (SW) and a transverse wall (TW) in a magnetic nanostrip is studied. We find the dynamical interaction can be directly demonstrated by SW-induced TW oscillation, which can be obtained by calculating the total magnetic moment within the area of TW as a function of time. Two cases of the initial TW, in equilibrium state and in metastable state, are investigated and compared. Before SW reaches TW, the metastable TW oscillates naturally with a constant frequency, whereas the equilibrium TW does not oscillate. After SW acts on TW, both the metastable TW and the equilibrium TW will oscillate with a frequency that always equal to the frequency of the applied SW. The amplitude of the SW-induced TW oscillation for both the metastable case and the equilibrium case strongly depends on the frequency of the applied SW. Through tuning the frequency of the applied SW, we confirm that the natural oscillation of the metastable TW, which is independent of the applied SW, will not affect the amplitude of the SW-induced TW oscillation and the velocity of the TW motion in compare with those of the equilibrium TW. Interestingly, the frequency-response curves of the SW-induced TW oscillations display multiple resonance peaks. Moreover, we find the frequency-response curves of the SW-induced TW oscillation, SW reflection coefficient and TW velocity driven by SW share the same multiple-resonance property. It may suggest the SW-induced TW oscillation in the domain wall plays an important role in the SW-driven TW motion.",3
3D matters! 3D-RISM and 3D convolutional neural network for accurate bioaccumulation prediction.,"In this work, we present a new method for predicting complex physical-chemical properties of organic molecules. The approach utilizes 3D convolutional neural network (ActivNet4) that uses solvent spatial distributions around solutes as input. These spatial distributions are obtained by a molecular theory called three-dimensional reference interaction site model. We have shown that the method allows one to achieve a good accuracy of prediction of bioconcentration factor which is difficult to predict by direct application of methods of molecular theory or simulations. Our research demonstrates that combination of molecular theories with modern machine learning approaches can be effectively used for predicting properties that are otherwise inaccessible to purely theory-based models.",3
A method for predicting non-equilibrium thermal expansion using steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamics.,"Steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamics (SEAQT) is an intriguing approach that describes equilibrium and dynamic processes in a self-consistent way. To date, it has been applied primarily to gas phase systems because of the difficulty in generating the complex eigenstructures (eigenvalues and eigenfunctions) associated with solid or liquid phases. In this contribution, the SEAQT modeling is extended to the solid phase by constructing a so-called pseudo-eigenstructure, and its applicability is demonstrated by calculating the thermal expansion of metallic silver for three cases: (a) stable equilibrium, (b) along three irreversible paths from different initial non-equilibrium states to stable equilibrium, and (c) along an irreversible path between two stable equilibrium states. The SEAQT framework with an anharmonic pseudo-eigenstructure predicts reasonable values for the equilibrium thermal expansion. For the irreversible cases considered, the SEAQT approach makes it possible to predict the time-dependence of lattice relaxations from the initial state to the final equilibrium state.",3
Tailoring exchange bias in ferro/antiferromagnetic FePt3 bilayers created by He(+) beams.,"We report on artificial exchange bias created in a continuous epitaxial FePt3 film by introducing chemical disorder using a He(+) beam, which features tailorable exchange bias strength through post-irradiation annealing. By design, the ferromagnetic (FM)/antiferromagnetic (AF) heterostructure exhibits stratified degrees of chemical order; however, the chemical composition and stoichiometry are invariant throughout the film volume. This uniquely allows for a consideration purely of the magnetic exchange across the FM/AF interface without the added hindrance of structural boundary parameters which inherently affect exchange bias quality. Annealing at 840 K results in the strongest exchange biased system, which displays a cross-sectional morphology of fine (<10 nm) domain structure composed of both of chemically ordered and chemically disordered domains. A magnetic model developed from fitting the characteristic polarised neutron reflectometry spectral features reveals that dual interactions can be attributed to the observed exchange bias: magnetic coupling at the FM/AF interface and also between neighbouring FM (chemically disordered) and AF (chemically ordered) domains within the nominally FM layer. Our results indicate that exchange bias is hindered at interfaces which are both chemically and magnetically perfect, while annealing can be used to balance the volume proportions of interfacial FM and AF domains to enhance the magnetic interface roughness for customisable exchange bias in mono-stoichiometric FM/AF heterostructures crafted by ion beams.",3
Photo-induced lattice contraction in layered materials.,"Structural and electronic changes induced by optical excitation is a promising technique for functionalization of 2D crystals. Characterizing the effect of excited electronic states on the in-plane covalent bonding network as well as the relatively weaker out-of-plane dispersion interactions is necessary to tune photo-response in these highly anisotropic crystal structures. In-plane atom dynamics was measured using pump-probe experiments and characterized using ab initio simulations, but the effect of electronic excitation on weak out-of-plane van der Waals bonds is less well-studied. We use non-adiabatic quantum molecular dynamics to investigate atomic motion in photoexcited MoS2 bilayers. We observe a strong athermal reduction in the lattice parameter along the out-of-plane direction within 100 fs after electronic excitation, resulting from redistribution of electrons to excited states that have lesser anti-bonding character between layers. This non-trivial behavior of weakly bonded interactions during photoexcitation could have potential applications for modulating properties in materials systems containing non-covalent interactions like layered materials and polymers.",3
Transformation of molecular CO2-III in low-density carbon to extended CO2-V in porous diamond at high pressures and temperatures.,"The ability to modify chemical bonding in dense heterogeneous solid mixtures by applying high pressure and temperature opens new opportunities to develop a greater number of novel materials with controlled structure, stability and exceptional physical properties. Here, we present the transformation of highly strained CO2-III (Cmca) filled in porous low-density carbons (LDC) to extended CO2-V (I-42d) encapsulated in porous diamond (Fd-3m) at high pressures and temperatures. The x-ray diffraction data indicates the density of porous diamond is about 5%-8% lower than that of bulk diamond and undergoes the structural distortion to monoclinic diamond (C2/m or M-carbon) upon pressure unloading. This result, therefore, demonstrates a feasibility to use porous LDC as nm-scale reactors to synthesize and store carbon dioxide and other high energy density extended solids.",3
Field-induced canting of magnetic moments in GdCo5 at finite temperature: first-principles calculations and high-field measurements.,"We present calculations and experimental measurements of the temperature-dependent magnetization of a single crystal of GdCo5 in magnetic fields of order 60 T. At zero temperature the calculations, based on density-functional theory in the disordered-local-moment picture, predict a field-induced transition from an antiferromagnetic to a canted alignment of Gd and Co moments at 46.1 T. At higher temperatures the calculations find this critical field to increase along with the zero-field magnetization. The experimental measurements observe this transition to occur between 44-48 T at 1.4 K. Up to temperatures of at least 100 K, the experiments continue to observe the transition; however, at variance with the calculations, no strong temperature dependence of the critical field is apparent. We assign this difference to the inaccurate description of the zero-field magnetization of the calculations at low temperatures, due to the use of classical statistical mechanics. Correcting for this effect, we recover a consistent description of the high-field magnetization of GdCo5 from theory and experiment.",3
Angle dependent molecular dynamics simulation of flux pinning in YBCO superconductors with artificial pinning sites.,"A molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to simulate the vortices in superconductors with artificial pinning sites is presented. The simulation reproduces the correct anisotropic behavior in angular dependence of critical current. We also show that the shape of the [Formula: see text] curve depends on the size of the pinning sites and the change from p = 0.5 to [Formula: see text] is due to the breaking of the vortex lattice to individually acting vortices. The results beautifully correspond to experimental data. Furthermore, we found that the size and shape of the c-axis peak observed with columnar pinning sites in [Formula: see text] also depends on the size of the rods, larger pinning sites leading to wider peaks. The results obtained from the MD-simulation are similar to those of the much more computationally intensive Ginzburg-Landau simulations. Furthermore, the MD-simulations can provide insight to the vortex dynamics within the samples.",3
Defect physics in complex energy materials.,"Understanding the physics of structurally and chemically complex transition-metal oxide and polyanionic materials such as those used for battery electrodes is challenging, even at the level of pristine compounds. Yet these materials are also prone to and their properties and performance are strongly affected or even determined by crystallographic point defects. In this review, we highlight recent advances in the study of defects and doping in such materials using first-principles calculations. The emphasis is on describing a theoretical and computational approach that has the ability to predict defect landscapes under various synthesis conditions, provide guidelines for defect characterization and defect-controlled synthesis, uncover the mechanisms for electronic and ionic conduction and electrochemical extraction and (re-)insertion, and provide an understanding of the effects of doping. Though applied to battery materials here, the approach is general and applicable to any materials in which the defect physics plays a role or drives the properties of interest. Thus, this work is intended as an in-depth review of defect physics in particular classes of materials, but also as a methodological template for the understanding and design of complex functional materials.",3
Oxidation-induced negative Poisson's ratio of phosphorene.,"Mechanical properties of phosphorene oxides are investigated by using density functional theory calculations. Intriguingly, as the oxygen coverage approaches 50%, negative Poisson's ratios are found in the in-plane principal directions, originating from the asymmetric atomic structure upon oxygen adsorption. It is demonstrated that the structure of phosphorene oxide is largely weakened compared with that of pristine phosphorene. Our work indicates that certain unconventional mechanical properties, such as the negative Poisson's ratio, can be achieved by tuning the atomic structure through simple processes, which offers a new avenue to design specific properties at the nanoscale.",3
"Equilibrium kinetics of self-assembling, semi-flexible polymers.","Self-assembling, semi-flexible polymers are ubiquitous in biology and technology. However, conflicting accounts of the equilibrium kinetics remain for such an important system. Here, by focusing on a dynamical description of a minimal model in an overdamped environment, I identify the correct kinetic scheme that describes the system at equilibrium in the limits of high bonding energy and dilute concentration.",3
Perfectly conducting graphene electronic waveguide with curved channels.,"We theoretically investigate the electronic transport properties of curved graphene waveguides by employing non-equilibrium Green's function techniques. We systematically study the dependence of the confined waveguide modes on the potential difference, the width of waveguide and side barrier. Through two-terminal electronic transport calculations, we show that the conductance of confined waveguide modes is rather robust against the bending degree of waveguide, in consistence with the band insensitivity to the side barrier. This finding of the perfectly conducting channels strongly suggests the possibility of applying the graphene waveguide in the design of low-power nanoelectronics.",3
Investigation of the temperature dependent field emission from individual ZnO nanowires for evidence of field-induced hot electrons emission.,"ZnO nanowires as field emitters have important applications in flat panel display and x-ray source. Understanding the intrinsic field emission mechanism is crucial for further improving the performance of ZnO nanowire field emitters. In this article, the temperature dependent field emission from individual ZnO nanowires was investigated by an in situ measurement in ultra-high vacuum. The divergent temperature-dependent Fowler-Nordheim plots is found in the low field region. A field-induced hot electrons emission model, that takes into account penetration length, is proposed to explain the results. The carrier density and temperature dependence of the field-induced hot electrons emission current are derived theoretically. The obtained results are consistent with the experimental results, which could be attributed to the variation of effective electron temperature. All of these are important for a better understanding on the field emission process of semiconductor nanostructures.",3
The role of incidence angle in the morphology evolution of Ge surfaces irradiated by medium-energy Au ions.,"Germanium (Ge) surfaces have been irradiated with 26 keV gold (Au) ions at a constant fluence and at incidence angles varying from 0 degrees to 85 degrees . The evolution of the emerging nanostructures is studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy. The obtained results are compared with findings reported in the literature. Periodic rippled patterns with the wave vector parallel to the projection of the ion beam direction onto the Ge surface develop between 30 degrees and 45 degrees . From 75 degrees the morphology changes from parallel-mode ripples to parallel-mode terraces, and by further increasing the incidence angle the terraces coarsen and show a progressive break-up of the front facing the ion beam. No perpendicular-mode ripples or terraces have been observed. The analysis of the AFM height profiles and slope distributions shows in the 45 degrees -85 degrees range an angular dependence of the temporal scale for the onset of nonlinear processes. For incidence angles below 45 degrees , the surface develops a sponge-like structure, which persists at higher incidence angles on the top and partially on the face of the facets facing the ion beam. The XPS and the energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy evidence the presence of Au nano-aggregates of different sizes for the different incidence angles. This study points out the peculiar behavior of Ge surfaces irradiated with medium-energy Au ions and warns about the differences to be faced when trying to build a universal framework for the description of semiconductor pattern evolution under ion-beam irradiation.",3
Quasibound states in single-layer graphene quantum rings.,"We study the quasi-bound state (QBS) spectra of the graphene quantum rings created by an axially symmetric electrostatic potential. Detailed calculations are carried out for the case of rectangular confinement potentials using the T-matrix and/or the local density of states approaches. Obtained results are analyzed in detail with respect to the two principal characters of QBSs, the (resonant) level position and the level width. A unique relation is established between the QBS-spectrum of a quantum ring under study and the resonant levels formed in the corresponding one-dimensional rectangular potential barrier. Studies are realized in both cases of zero and non-zero mass.",3
Reconfiguring ferromagnetic microrod chains by alternating two orthogonal magnetic fields.,"It is well-known that ferromagnetic microrods form linear chains under an external uniform magnetic field B and the chain length is strongly dependent on the applied field, the applied time duration, and the microrod density. When the chains become long enough and the B-field switches to its orthogonal direction, an irreversible morphological transition, i.e. a parallel linear chain array to a 2D network, is observed. The formation of the network depends on the ratio of the average chain length L and separation D, L/D, as well as the magnitude of the changed B-field. When the chain pattern has an L/D larger than a critical value, the network structure will be formed. Such a critical L/D ratio is a monotonic function of B, which determines the bending length of each magnetic chain during the change of B-fields. This morphological change triggered by external magnetic field can be used as scaffolds or building blocks for biological applications or design smart materials.",3
Evidence for weak collective pinning and deltal pinning in topological superconductor Cu x Bi2Se3.,"We investigated the vortex pinning behavior in the single crystal topological superconductor Cu0.10Bi2Se3 with a pronounced anisotropic peak effect. A weak collective pinning regime is clarified from the power-law behavior in [Formula: see text] and the small critical current density ratio of [Formula: see text] ~ 10(-5) ([Formula: see text] is the critical current density, [Formula: see text] is the depairing current density). The spatial variation of the charge-carrier mean free path induced pinning is evidenced and probably results from the well-defined atomic defects. Within the framework of collective pinning theory, we computed the values of the correlated length and volume at 1.8 K, which start declining prior to the onset field of the peak effect [Formula: see text], demonstrating the vortex lattices already suffered a preferential collapse ahead of the peak effect turns up. Thus, the peak effect can be understood by elastic moduli softening near the upper critical field [Formula: see text]. We suggest Cu x Bi2Se3 is a prototype topological material for investigating the vortex pinning dynamics associated with the peak effect phenomenon.",3
Nodeless superconductivity in the cage-type superconductor Sc5Ru6Sn18 with preserved time-reversal symmetry.,"We report the single-crystal synthesis and detailed investigations of the cage-type superconductor Sc5Ru6Sn18, using powder x-ray diffraction (XRD), magnetization, specific-heat and muon-spin relaxation (microSR) measurements. Sc5Ru6Sn18 crystallizes in a tetragonal structure (space group I41/acd) with lattice parameters a = 1.387(3) nm and c = 2.641(5) nm. Both DC and AC magnetization measurements prove the type-II superconductivity in Sc5Ru6Sn18 with T c approximately 3.5(1) K, a lower critical field [Formula: see text] = 157(9) Oe and an upper critical field, [Formula: see text] = 26(1) kOe. The zero-field electronic specific-heat data are well fitted using a single-gap BCS model, with [Formula: see text] = 0.64(1) meV. The Sommerfeld constant gamma varies linearly with the applied magnetic field, indicating s-wave superconductivity in Sc5Ru6Sn18. Specific-heat and transverse-field (TF) microSR measurements reveal that Sc5Ru6Sn18 is a superconductor with strong electron-phonon coupling, with TF-microSR also suggesting a single-gap s-wave character of the superconductivity. Furthermore, zero-field microSR measurements do not detect spontaneous magnetic fields below T c, hence implying that time-reversal symmetry is preserved in Sc5Ru6Sn18.",3
Pseudo-spin skyrmions in the phase diagram of cuprate superconductors.,"Topological states of matter are at the root of some of the most fascinating phenomena in condensed matter physics. Here we argue that skyrmions in the pseudo-spin space related to an emerging SU(2) symmetry enlighten many mysterious properties of the pseudogap phase in under-doped cuprates. We detail the role of the SU(2) symmetry in controlling the phase diagram of the cuprates, in particular how a cascade of phase transitions explains the arising of the pseudogap, superconducting and charge modulation phases seen at low temperature. We specify the structure of the charge modulations inside the vortex core below T c, as well as in a wide temperature region above T c, which is a signature of the skyrmion topological structure. We argue that the underlying SU(2) symmetry is the main structure controlling the emergent complexity of excitations at the pseudogap scale T (*). The theory yields a gapping of a large part of the anti-nodal region of the Brillouin zone, along with q = 0 phase transitions, of both nematic and loop currents characters.",3
Inferences on hydrogen bond networks in water from isopermitive frequency investigations.,"Intermolecular hydrogen bonds play a crucial role in determining the unique characteristics of liquid water. We present low-frequency (1 Hz-40 MHz) dielectric spectroscopic investigations on water in the presence and absence of added solutes at different temperatures from 10 degrees C to 60 degrees C. The intersection points of temperature dependent permittivity contours at the vicinity of isopermitive frequency (IPF) in water are recorded and its properties are presumed to be related to the extent of hydrogen bond networks in water. IPF is defined as the frequency at which the relative permittivity of water is almost independent of temperature. The set of intersection points of temperature dependent permittivity contours at the vicinity of IPF are characterized by the mean [Formula: see text] and root-mean-square deviation/standard deviation [Formula: see text] associated with IPF. The tunability of M IPF by the addition of NaCl and MgCl2 salt emphasizes the strong correlation between the concentration of ions in water and the M IPF. The [Formula: see text] is surmised to be related to the orientational correlations of water dipoles as well as to the intermolecular hydrogen bond networks in water. Further, alterations in [Formula: see text] is observed with the addition of kosmotropic and chaotropic solutes into water and are thought to arise due to the restructuring of hydrogen bond networks in water in presence of added solutes. Notably, the solute induced reconfiguration of hydrogen bond networks in water or often-discussed structure making/breaking effects of the added solutes in water can be inferred, albeit qualitatively, by examining the M IPF and [Formula: see text]. Further, the Gaussian deconvoluted OH-stretching modes present in the Raman spectra of water and aqueous solutions of IPA and DMF strongly endorses the structural rearrangements occurring in water in presence of kosmotropes and chaotropes and are in line with the results derived from the root-mean-square deviation in IPF.",3
Atomic-scale study of stacking faults in Zr hydrides and implications on hydride formation.,"We performed atomic-scale ab initio calculations to investigate the stacking fault (SF) properties of the metastable zeta-Zr2H zirconium hydride. The effect of H near the SF was found to entail the existence of negative SF energies, showing that the zeta compound is probably unstable with respect to shearing in the basal plane. The effect of temperature on SFs was investigated by means of free energy calculations in the quasiharmonic approximation. This evidenced unexpectedly large temperature effects, confirming the main conclusions drawn at 0 K, in particular the zeta mechanical instability. The complex behaviour of H atoms during the shear process suggested zeta-hcp --> Zr2H[Formula: see text]-fcc as a plausible shear path leading to an fcc compound with same composition as zeta. Finally, as shown by an analysis based on microelasticity, this Zr2H[Formula: see text]-fcc intermediate compound may be relevant for better interpreting the currently intricate issue of hydride habit planes in zirconium.",3
Reflectance and fast polarization dynamics of a GaN/Si nanowire ensemble.,"Optical phenomena in an ensemble of high-quality GaN nanowires (NWs) grown on a Si substrate have been studied by reflectance and time-resolved luminescence. Such NWs form a structure that acts as a virtual layer that specifically reflects and polarizes light and can be characterized by an effective refractive index. In fact we have found that the NW ensembles of high NW density (high filling fraction) behave rather like a layer of effective medium described by the Maxwell Garnett approximation. Moreover, light extinction and strong depolarization are observed that we assign to scattering and interference of light inside the NW ensemble. The wavelength range of high extinction and depolarization correlates well with transverse localization wavelength estimated for such an ensemble of NWs, so we suppose that these effects are due to Anderson localization of light. We also report results of time-resolved measurements of polarization of individual emission centers including free and bound excitons (D(0)XA, 3.47 eV), inversion domain boundaries (IDB, 3.45 eV) and stacking faults (SF, 3.42 eV). The emission of the D(0)XA and SF lines is polarized perpendicular to GaN c-axis while the 3.45 eV line is polarized along the c-axis which supports a hypothesis that this line is emitted from IDBs. Time-dependent depolarization of luminescence is observed during the first 0.1 ns after excitation and is interpreted as the result of interaction of the emission centers with hot particles existing for a short time after excitation.",3
Magnetoresistance and valley degree of freedom in bulk bismuth.,"In this paper, we first review fundamental aspects of magnetoresistance in multi-valley systems based on the semiclassical theory. Then we will review experimental evidence and theoretical understanding of magnetoresistance in an archetypal multi-valley system, where the electric conductivity is set by the sum of the contributions of different valleys. Bulk bismuth has three valleys with an extremely anisotropic effective mass. As a consequence the magnetoconductivity in each valley is extremely sensitive to the orientation of the magnetic field. Therefore, a rotating magnetic field plays the role of a valley valve tuning the contribution of each valley to the total conductivity. In addition to this simple semiclassical effect, other phenomena arise in the high-field limit as a consequence of an intricate Landau spectrum. In the vicinity of the quantum limit, the orientation of magnetic field significantly affects the distribution of carriers in each valley, namely, the valley polarization is induced by the magnetic field. Moreover, experiment has found that well beyond the quantum limit, one or two valleys become totally empty. This is the only case in condensed matter physics where a Fermi sea is completely dried up by a magnetic field without a metal-insulator transition. There have been two long-standing problems on bismuth near the quantum limit: the large anisotropic Zeeman splitting of holes, and the extra peaks in quantum oscillations, which cannot be assigned to any known Landau levels. These problems are solved by taking into account the interband effect due to the spin-orbit couplings for the former, and the contributions from the twinned crystal for the latter. Up to here, the whole spectrum can be interpreted within the one-particle theory. Finally, we will discuss transport and thermodynamic signatures of breaking of the valley symmetry in this system. By this term, we refer to the observed spontaneous loss of threefold symmetry at high magnetic field and low temperature. Its theoretical understanding is still missing. We will discuss possible explanations.",3
Current computational trends in polyanionic cathode materials for Li and Na batteries.,"A long-standing effort has been devoted for the development of high energy density cathodes both for Li- and Na-ion batteries (LIBs and SIBs). The scientific communities in battery research primarily divide the Li- and Na-ion cathode materials into two categories: layered oxides and polyanionic compounds. Researchers are trying to improve the energy density of such materials through materials screening by mixing the transition metals or changing the concentration of Li or Na in the polyanionic compounds. Due to the fact that there is more stability in the polyanionic frameworks, batteries based on these materials mostly provide a prolonged cycling life as compared to the layered oxide materials. Nevertheless, the bottleneck for such compounds is the weight penalty from polyanionic groups that results into the lower capacity. The anion engineering could be considered as an essential way out to design such polyanionic compounds to resolve this issue and to fetch improved cathode performance. In this topical review we present a systematic overview of the polyanionic cathode materials used for LIBs and SIBs. We will also present the computational methodologies that have become significantly relevant for battery research. We will make an attempt to provide the theoretical insight with a current development in sulfate (SO4), silicate (SiO4) and phosphate (PO4) based cathode materials for LIBs and SIBs. We will end this topical review with the future outlook, that will consist of the next generation organic electrode materials, mainly based on conjugated carbonyl compounds.",3
Electron heating induced by an ac-bias current in the regime of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation in the high mobility GaAs/Al x Ga1-x As two-dimensional electron system.,The magnetotransport properties of the high mobility GaAs/AlGaAs two-dimensional electron gas systems have been examined to determine the influence of the ac current bias on the carrier temperature. The changes in the line shape of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in the longitudinal magnetoresistance ([Formula: see text]) were followed as a function of the ac current bias in the temperature range of [Formula: see text] in order to determine the carrier heating effect due to the ac bias. The lineshape analysis of these oscillations indicates that the carrier temperature of the two-dimensional electron system is linearly proportional to the ac bias current.,3
Unexpected field-induced dynamics in magnetostrictive microstructured elements under isotropic strain.,"We investigated the influence of an isotropic strain on the magnetization dynamics of microstructured magnetostrictive Co40Fe40B20 (CoFeB) elements with time-resolved scanning transmission x-ray microscopy. We observed that the application of isotropic strain leads to changes in the behavior of the microstructured magnetostrictive elements that cannot be fully explained by the volume magnetostriction term. Therefore, our results prompt for an alternative explanation to the current models used for the interpretation of the influence of mechanical strain on the dynamical processes of magnetostrictive materials.",3
Many-body perturbation theory study of type-II InAs/GaSb superlattices within the GW approximation.,"Recent studies suggest that the many-body perturbation theory in the partially self-consistent GW (GW 0) approximation significantly improves the prediction of band gaps in various semiconductors. In this work, we employed GW formalism to study the electronic structure of type-II InAs/GaSb strained-layer superlattices (T2SLs). T2SLs considered in this study, denoted by (monolayers of InAs, monolayers of GaSb) are ([Formula: see text]), ([Formula: see text]), ([Formula: see text]), ([Formula: see text]), and ([Formula: see text]). The InSb-type interfacial layer was introduced in the structures to resemble the actual growth condition in our laboratories. The electronic band gaps are indirect in all the structures. The band gaps at the center of the Brillouin zone show good agreement with experimental data. This study is the first step to investigate the electronic, optical, and defect characteristics of T2SLs within a parameter-free ab initio method.",3
Stochastic models of multi-channel particulate transport with blockage.,"Particle conveying channels may be bundled together. The limited carrying capacity of the constituent channels may cause the bundle to be subject to blockages. If coupled, the blockage of one channel causes an increase in the flux entering the others, leading to a cascade of failures. Once all the channels are blocked, no additional particles may enter the system. If the blockages are of finite duration, the system reaches a steady state with an exiting flux that is reduced compared to the incoming one. We propose a stochastic model consisting of N c channels, each with a blocking threshold of N particles. Particles enter the system's open channels according to a Poisson process, with an equally distributed input flux of intensity Lambda. In an open channel the leading particle exits at a rate mu and a blocked channel unblocks at a rate [Formula: see text], where [Formula: see text]. We present and explain the methodology of an analytical description of the behavior of bundled channels. This leads to exact expressions for the steady-state output flux, for [Formula: see text], which promises to extend to arbitrary N c and N. The results are applied to compare the efficiency of conveying a particulate stream of intensity Lambda using a single, high capacity (HC) channel with multiple channels of a proportionately reduced low capacity (LC). The HC channel is more efficient at low input intensities, while the multiple LC channels have a higher throughput at high intensities. We also compare [Formula: see text] coupled channels, each of capacity N = 2 with the corresponding number of independent channels of the same capacity. For [Formula: see text], if [Formula: see text], the coupled channels are always more efficient. Otherwise the independent channels are more efficient for sufficiently large Lambda.",3

Surface reconstruction and charge modulation in BaFe2As2 superconducting film.,"Whether or not epitaxially grown superconducting films have the same bulk-like superconducting properties is an important concern. We report the structure and the electronic properties of epitaxially grown Ba(Fe1-x Co x )2As2 films using scanning tunneling microscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS). This film showed a different surface structure, [Formula: see text]R45 degrees reconstruction, from those of as-cleaved surfaces from bulk crystals. The electronic structure of the grown film is different from that in bulk, and it is notable that the film exhibits the same superconducting transport properties. We found that the superconducting gap at the surface is screened at the Ba layer surface in STS measurements, and the charge density wave was observed at the surface in sample in the superconducting state.",3
A two-phase Hessian approach improves the DFT relaxation of slabs.,A two-phase Hessian approach to DFT slab relaxation of slabs has been implemented and tested. It addresses weaknesses in the modified Broyden and Pfrommer BFGS algorithms specific to relaxing slabs. Complete Hessian and then inverse Hessian matrices with no strain/stress components are first constructed at high force signal-to-noise ratios with no accompanying relaxation. In a second phase the static inverse Hessian is used to relax the slab down to a low force tolerance.,3
"Density-functional tight-binding approach for metal clusters, nanoparticles, surfaces and bulk: application to silver and gold.","Density-functional based tight-binding (DFTB) is an efficient quantum mechanical method that can describe a variety of systems, going from organic and inorganic compounds to metallic and hybrid materials. The present topical review addresses the ability and performance of DFTB to investigate energetic, structural, spectroscopic and dynamical properties of gold and silver materials. After a brief overview of the theoretical basis of DFTB, its parametrization and its transferability, we report its past and recent applications to gold and silver systems, including small clusters, nanoparticles, bulk and surfaces, bare and interacting with various organic and inorganic compounds. The range of applications covered by those studies goes from plasmonics and molecular electronics, to energy conversion and surface chemistry. Finally, perspectives of DFTB in the field of gold and silver surfaces and NPs are outlined.",3
Photo-excited dynamics in the excitonic insulator Ta2NiSe5.,"The excitonic insulator is an intriguing correlated electron phase formed of condensed excitons. A promising candidate is the small band gap semiconductor Ta2NiSe5. Here we investigate the quasiparticle and coherent phonon dynamics in Ta2NiSe5 in a time resolved pump probe experiment. Using the models originally developed by Kabanov et al for superconductors (Kabanov et al 1999 Phys. Rev. B 59 1497), we show that the material's intrinsic gap can be described as almost temperature independent for temperatures up to about 250 K to 275 K. This behavior supports the existence of the excitonic insulator state in Ta2NiSe5. The onset of an additional temperature dependent component to the gap above these temperatures suggests that the material is located in the BEC-BCS crossover regime. Furthermore, we show that this state is very stable against strong photoexcitation, which reveals that the free charge carriers are unable to effectively screen the attractive Coulomb interaction between electrons and holes, likely due to the quasi 1D structure of Ta2NiSe5.",3
Hydrogen in beryllium oxide investigated by DFT: on the relative stability of charged-state atomic versus molecular hydrogen.,"The behavior of hydrogen in perfect wurtzite beryllium oxide is herein investigated by means of electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory. The formation energies of the following set of states of hydrogen (H(0), H(+), H(-), H2, [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]) are computed and their solubility is established as a function of temperature and pressure with emphasis given to conditions relevant for hydrogen-implanted materials. It is found that all magnetic states H(0), [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] are unstable, while the relative stability of the non-magnetic states depends on the thermodynamic conditions: H2 prevails above temperatures around 900 K at standard pressure, which is the lowest temperature in experiments measuring the diffusion coefficient of hydrogen in wurtzite beryllium oxide. Under hydrogen implantation, the total concentration of hydrogen is fixed by the implantation source; it is found that molecular hydrogen prevails starting from a very low total concentration in hydrogen (as low as 10(-40) at.fr.). Finally, the diffusion coefficient of H2 in beryllium oxide is calculated and the results are compared with previous experimental data.",3
Tuning the ferromagnetism of a single layered titanium dioxide nanosheet with hole doping and uniaxial strain.,"The effects of hole doping and strain on the electronic and magnetic properties of a single layered TiO2 nanosheet were investigated here. It is found that the spontaneous magnetism can be introduced in all systems doped with low valence metal, indicating holes are the key fact to trigger local magnetic moments. Especially, a half-metal magnetism takes place when Li substitutes a Ti atom. As for the stability of dopants, the Al doping case shows lower formation energy than those of Li and Mg doping under O-rich conditions. Tuning the hole concentration, a phase transition from nonmagnetic to half-metal ferromagnetic ground state can emerge after the average spin magnetic moment reaches 1.0 micro B/hole. Furthermore, the uniaxial strain effectively adjusts the magnetism by shifting the main peak of density of states near the fermi level. The anisotropic transition of magnetic state under uniaxial tensile strain was observed due to the competition of orbital hybridization between Ti and O atoms along different crystal directions.",3
Interaction of two domain walls during spin-torque-induced coherent motion.,"We show that the application of a spin-polarized current to a double p domain wall system with a variable distance between the walls results in an interaction between the two domain walls. The transmission spectrum changes from that of a spin-dependent resonant double barrier to one like a [Formula: see text] wall. In addition, the spin torque on each individual wall creates coupled motion in the domain walls. The walls move independently with a fast speed at large separations, but slow considerably at small separations.",3
Perturbing the spin crossover transition activation energies in Fe(H2B(pz)2)2(bipy) with zwitterionic additions.,"A thermal component to the soft x-ray induced spin crossover transition exists in the switching of a spin crossover compound (complex [Fe{H2B(pz)2}2(bipy)] (pz = pyrazol-1-yl, bipy = 2,2'-bipyridine) combined with the dipolar molecular additives (zwitterionic p-benzoquinonemonoimine C6H2([Formula: see text])2([Formula: see text])2). The addition of the zwitterionic molecule locks the Fe(II) complex in a largely low spin state configuration over an unusually broad temperature range that includes temperatures well above the thermal spin crossover temperature of 160 K. It is demonstrated here that the process of exciting the [Fe{H2B(pz)2}2(bipy)] moiety, in the presence of with C6H2([Formula: see text])2([Formula: see text])2, to an electronic state characteristic of the high spin state though incident x-ray fluences, has a thermal activation energies are determined to 14-18 meV for a range of mixing ratios from 1:2 to 1:10. Those activation energies are also significantly reduced as compared to values of 60-80 meV found for nanometer thin films of [Fe{H2B(pz)2}2(bipy)] on SiO2.",3
Topological bound states in interacting Su-Schrieffer-Heeger rings.,"We study two-particle states in a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain with periodic boundary conditions and nearest-neighbor (NN) interactions. The system is mapped into a problem of a single particle in a two-dimensional (2D) SSH lattice with potential walls along specific edges. The 2D SSH model has a trivial Chern number but a non-trivial Zak's phase, the one-dimensional (1D) topological invariant, along specific directions of the lattice, which allow for the presence of topological edge states. Using center-of-mass and relative coordinates, we calculate the energy spectrum of these two-body states for strong interactions and find that, aside from the expected appearance of doublon bands, two extra in-gap bands are present. These are identified as bands of topological states localized at the edges of the internal coordinate, the relative distance between the two particles. As such, the topological states reported here are intrinsically many-body in what concerns their real space manifestation, having no counterpart in single-particle states derived from effective models. Finally, we compare the effect of Hubbard interactions with that of NN interactions to show how the presence of the topological bound states is specific to the latter case.",3
Resonance states near a quantum magnetic impurity in single-layer FeSe superconductors with d-wave symmetry.,"In this work, we investigate the local density of states (LDOS) near a magnetic impurity in single-layer FeSe superconductors. The two-orbital model with spin-orbit coupling proposed in Agterberg et al (2017 Phys. Rev. Lett. 119 267001) is used to describe the FeSe superconductor. In the strong coupling regime, two impurity resonance peaks appear with opposite resonance energies in the LDOS spectral function. For strong spin-orbit coupling, the superconducting gap in this model is d-wave symmetric with nodes, the spatial distributions of the LDOS at the two resonance energies are fourfold symmetric, which reveals typical characteristic of d-wave pairing. When the spin-orbit coupling is not strong enough to close the superconducting gap, we find that the spatial distribution of the LDOS at one of the resonance energies manifests s-wave symmetry, while the pairing potential preserves d-wave symmetry. This result is consistent with previous experimental investigations.",3
Thermoelectric efficiency of single-molecule junctions with long molecular linkers.,"We report results of theoretical studies of thermoelectric efficiency of single-molecule junctions with long molecular linkers. The linker is simulated by a chain of identical sites described using a tight-binding model. It is shown that thermoelectric figure of merit ZT strongly depends on the bridge length, being controlled by the lineshape of electron transmission function within the tunnel energy range corresponding to HOMO/LUMO transport channel. Using the adopted model we demonstrate that ZT may significantly increase as the linker lengthens, and that gateway states on the bridge (if any) may noticeably affect the length-dependent ZT. Temperature dependences of ZT for various bridge lengths are analyzed. It is shown that broad minima emerge in ZT versus temperature curves whose positions are controlled by the bridge lengths.",3
Cross-correlations in a quantum dot Cooper pair splitter with ferromagnetic leads.,"We investigate Andreev transport through a quantum dot attached to two external ferromagnetic leads and one superconducting electrode. The transport properties of the system are studied by means of the real-time diagrammatic technique in the sequential tunneling regime. To distinguish various contributions to Andreev current we calculate the current cross-correlations, i.e. correlations between currents flowing through two junctions with normal leads. We analyze dependence of current cross-correlations on various parameters of the considered model, both in linear and nonlinear transport regimes. The processes and mechanisms leading to enhancement, suppression or sign change of current cross-correlations are examined and discussed. Interestingly, our results show that for specific transport regimes splitted Cooper pair results in two uncorrelated electrons. However, utilizing ferromagnetic leads instead of non-magnetic electrodes can result in positive current cross-correlations.",3
Synthetic Antiferromagnetic Spintronics.,"Spintronic and nanomagnetic devices often derive their functionality from layers of different materials and the interfaces between them. This is especially true for synthetic antiferromagnets - two or more ferromagnetic layers that are separated by metallic spacers or tunnel barriers and which have antiparallel magnetizations. Here, we discuss the new opportunities that arise from synthetic antiferromagnets, as compared to crystal antiferromagnets or ferromagnets.",3
"A k . p treatment of edge states in narrow 2D topological insulators, with standard boundary conditions for the wave function and its derivative.","For 2D topological insulators with strong electron-hole hybridization, such as HgTe/CdTe quantum wells, the widely used 4 x 4 k . p Hamiltonian based on the first electron and heavy hole sub-bands yields an equal number of physical and spurious solutions, for both the bulk states and the edge states. For symmetric bands and zero wave vector parallel to the sample edge, the mid-gap bulk solutions are identical to the edge solutions. In all cases, the physical edge solution is exponentially localized to the boundary and has been shown previously to satisfy standard boundary conditions for the wave function and its derivative, even in the limit of an infinite wall potential. The same treatment is now extended to the case of narrow sample widths, where for each spin direction, a gap appears in the edge state dispersions. For widths greater than 200 nm, this gap is less than half of the value reported for open boundary conditions, which are called into question because they include a spurious wave function component. The gap in the edge state dispersions is also calculated for weakly hybridized quantum wells such as InAs/GaSb/AlSb. In contrast to the strongly hybridized case, the edge states at the zone center only have pure exponential character when the bands are symmetric and when the sample has certain characteristic width values.",3
Weak localization in bilayer graphene with Li-intercalation/desorption.,"We performed in-situ electrical transport measurements for bilayer graphene grown on SiC(0 0 0 1) substrate, Li-intercalated bilayer graphene, and after that desorbing Li atoms by heating. Bilayer graphene after desorbing intercalated Li atoms showed a higher resistivity and different behavior in magnetoconductance compared to pristine bilayer graphene. We observed the weak localization of carriers at low temperatures in all the three samples and analyzed the experimental results with the extended Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka equation to investigate the transport properties. The result shows that the magnetoconductance of pristine bilayer graphene is described by the AB stacking structure model and the phase breaking scattering is dominated by the electron-electron scattering. The intra-valley scattering occurs most frequently probably due to dopants in SiC substrate. However, in Li-desorbed graphene, the magnetoconductance can be described by neither AB nor AA-stacking model, suggesting the coexistence of domains with several different stacking structures.",3
Enhanced magnetic properties and tunable Dirac point of graphene/Mn-doped monolayer MoS2 heterostructures.,"Graphene is one of the most promising spintronic materials due to its high carrier mobility. However, the absence of a band gap and ferromagnetic order in graphene seriously limit its applications in spintronics. How to utilize its high carrier mobility as well as mediate its electronic structure remains a challenge. Herein, we design a novel composite, which is composed of graphene and Mn-doped monolayer MoS2. The magnetic properties and electronic structures of graphene/Mn-doped monolayer MoS2 heterostructures were studied by using density functional theory (DFT) with the van der Waals (vdW) correlations (DFT-D). We found that the heterostructures show increased magnetic moments and more stable ferromagnetic (FM) states compared with that of isolated Mn-doped MoS2 monolayer. Our further studies show that many electrons are transferred to Mn-doped MoS2 monolayer from graphene, which causes the Fermi level to shift down below the Dirac cone about 0.59 eV. The transfered electrons also enhance the FM coupling between Mn ions. Graphene is partially spin polarized because of the magnetic proximity effect, which leads to the spin-dependent gaps for spin-up (16.1 meV) and spin-down (5 meV) at Dirac point, respectively. The introduction of sulfur (S) vacancy to the interface results in a much more stable FM structure and a higher total magnetic moment of the FM state; furthermore, it raises the spin polarization of graphene pi orbitals and opens up a small band gap of about 7 meV. These findings propose a new route to facilitate the design of spintronic devices which both need stable ferromagnetism and finite band gap.",3
Evanescent-field-modulated two-qubit entanglement in an emitters-plasmon coupled system.,"Scalable integrated quantum information network calls for controllable entanglement modulation at subwavelength scale. To reduce laser disturbance among adjacent nanostructures, here we theoretically demonstrate two-qubit entanglement modulated by an evanescent field of a dielectric nanowire in an emitter-AgNP coupled system. This coupled system is considered as a nano-cavity system embedded in an evanescent vacuum. Through varying the amplitude of evanescent field, the concurrence of steady-state entanglement can be modified from 0 to 0.75. Because the interaction between emitters and the nanowire is much weaker than that inside the coupled system, the range of modulation for two-qubit entanglement is insensitive to their distance. The evanescent field controlled entangled state engineering provides the possibility to avoid optical crosstalk for on-chip steady-state entanglement.",3
Recent developments in ion beam-induced nanostructures on AIII-BV compound semiconductors.,"Ion-beam sputtering of two-component substrates constitutes an alternative route for the nanofabrication of 3D (three-dimensional) structures, such as quantum dots or nanowires with unique properties like a high degree of local ordering. To allow for feasibility in precision manufacturing, control and optimization it is necessary to completely understand all the phenomena behind the evolution of nanostructures. The formation and development during the ion irradiation of similar features has been extensively studied for almost a half of century, but only over the last few years have new results appeared, ones stimulating real progress within this field. In this paper we report on the growth of such 3D nanostructures after low energy ion-beam sputtering on specific materials belonging to the group of AIII-BV binary compound crystals. Special emphasis is given to the role of sample temperature (during irradiation or post-annealing) on the evolution of nanostructure patterns and their ordering. The formation of such systems will be explained as seen from a phenomenological perspective.",3
Dissipative non-equilibrium Green function methodology to treat short range Coulomb interaction: current through a 1D nanostructure.,"A methodology describing Coulomb blockade in the non-equilibrium Green function formalism is presented. We carried out ballistic and dissipative simulations through a 1D quantum dot using an Einstein phonon model. Inelastic phonons with different energies have been considered. The methodology incorporates the short-range Coulomb interaction between two electrons through the use of a two-particle Green function. Unlike previous work, the quantum dot has spatial resolution i.e. it is not just parameterized by the energy level and coupling constants of the dot. Our method intends to describe the effect of electron localization while maintaining an open boundary or extended wave function. The formalism conserves the current through the nanostructure. A simple 1D model is used to explain the increase of mobility in semi-crystalline polymers as a function of the electron concentration. The mechanism suggested is based on the lifting of energy levels into the transmission window as a result of the local electron-electron repulsion inside a crystalline domain. The results are aligned with recent experimental findings. Finally, as a proof of concept, we present a simulation of a low temperature resonant structure showing the stability diagram in the Coulomb blockade regime.",3
"Density functional study of half-metallicity and spin polarization in Fe1-x T x S2 with T = Mn,Ni.","Alloying effects by Mn and Ni substitution on FeS2 have been studied using density-functional calculations. Standard generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and local hybrid functional have been utilized to account for exchange-correlations. The alloys Fe1-x T x S2 with T = Mn,Ni have been investigated for concentrations [Formula: see text] together with the ground states of the pure compounds. The electronic structure is discussed with the main goal to identify candidates for ferromagnetic half-metals, which are of interest for spintronics applications. Depending on the used calculation framework, interesting candidates have been found at different concentrations. However, at mean concentration of the Mn-doping and low concentration for Ni-doping, both GGA and hybrid functional agree to predict half-metallic character. For the Mn alloys we also note the proximity to a low-spin to high spin transition.",3
Ground-state phases of spin-orbit coupled spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate in a plane quadrupole field.,"We study the ground-state phases of two-dimensional spin-orbit coupled spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate loaded in a plane quadrupole field. In the absence of rotation, for the fixed spin-orbit coupling strength, the ordinary stripe phase is found when the strength of the magnetic field gradient is small. As the strength of magnetic field gradient enhances, the system realizes the phases with three layer vortices along the radial direction. The number of vortices in the second layer is successively increased and the vortices in the outermost layer disappear when the strength of magnetic field gradient surpass the critical value. For the large strength of magnetic field gradient, the system only has the inner layer vortices. The magnetic field inhibits the region of vortices. For the fixed magnetic field gradient strength, the vortices of the system elongate along the radial direction and form a series of vortex lines, the number of the vortex line increases as the strength of spin-orbit coupling enhances. By adding the rotation, for the fixed strengths of spin-orbit coupling and magnetic field gradient, the number of second layer vortices also successively increases as the rotational frequency increases. The number of vortices in the certain layer of the ground-state density can be regularly changed under the effects of the magnetic field and spin-orbit coupling.",3
Investigation of room temperature multispin-assisted bulk diamond (13)C hyperpolarization at low magnetic fields.,"In this work we investigated the time behavior of the polarization of bulk (13)C nuclei in diamond above the thermal equilibrium. This nonthermal nuclear hyperpolarization is achieved by cross relaxation between two nitrogen related paramagnetic defect species in diamond in combination with optical pumping. The decay of the hyperpolarization at four different magnetic fields is measured. Furthermore, we use the comparison with conventional nuclear resonance measurements to identify the involved distances of the nuclear spin with respect to the defects and therefore the coupling strengths. Also, a careful look at the linewidth of the signal give valuable information to piece together the puzzle of the hyperpolarization mechanism.",3
beta-tungsten: a promising metal for spintronics.,"Ultrathin films of beta-tungsten provide very promising substrates for applications in spintronics, and the possibility of incorporating them into multilayers extends such expectations. Our calculations indicate that it is viable to deposit a single layer of Mn on two non-equivalent (0 0 1) surfaces of beta-tungsten that have easy axes along orthogonal directions [0 1 0] and [1 0 0], respectively. The ferromagnetic structure of this Mn monolayer adsorbed to either of those surfaces displays a giant in-plane magneto-crystalline anisotropy that exceeds 12 meV per Mn atom. Furthermore, when coated with additional layers of beta-tungsten the magnetization easy axis becomes perpendicular to the planes. We envisage that magnetic multilayers involving mono-crystalline thin films of beta-tungsten oriented along high-symmetry directions offer a very fruitful playground for spintronic applications.",3
Transport properties and enhanced figure of merit of quantum dot-based spintronic thermoelectric device.,"Transport properties of quantum dot-based thermoelectric device with magnetic leads placed in external magnetic field are considered. The exact expressions for the thermoelectric coefficients are obtained by the equation of motion method, assuming noninteracting electrons. It is shown that at the maximum power mode the figure of merit of the proposed spintronic device is several times higher than that of a device with unpolarized electrons. The influence of electron-electron interaction on the figure of merit is analyzed and it is shown that in the limit of strong Coulomb repulsion the optimal thermoelectric performance predicted for noninteracting electrons is restored.",3
Anomalous optical nonreciprocity in magnetic nanoisland arrays.,We study the phenomenon of optical nonreciprocity in multilayer systems of magnetic nanoislands [FeNi-Al2O3] N . An anomalously large optical nonreciprocity was observed in these systems. The effect was manifested in nonequivalence of polarization plane rotation of reflected light for the sample in an initial position and rotated by [Formula: see text]. We assume that the super-vortex magnetization in the FeNi layers is responsible for the optical nonreciprocity effect. It was found that the value of nonreciprocity effect depends on the effective thickness of FeNi island layer and reaches a maximum with the super-vortex magnetization formation. The nonreciprocity magnitude is significantly higher than the values observed recently in systems of specially formed magnetic nanoparticles. Nonreciprocity magnitude is strongly dependent on interlayer interaction between nanoisland layers at large distances.,3
Equation of state of fluid aluminum in the metal-nonmetal transition region.,"A phenomenological equation of state is constructed for fluid aluminum to study thermodynamic consequences of the metal-nonmetal transition occurring in the fluid on the thermal expansion. It is demonstrated that the existing experimental data clearly indicate the isochores plotted in the internal energy-pressure plane are straight lines. Based on this fact and some general thermodynamic relations it is shown that the equation of state must have the Mie-Gruneisen-Debye form in this case. This means that such concepts as the cold curve, the Gruneisen coefficient, and the Debye temperature can be applied to the fluid state. In order to demonstrate the accuracy of the present equation of state these characteristics as functions of the molar volume have been determined and compared with the dependencies used in the literature. Considering the fluid as a system constituted of the valence electrons and ions and applying the virial theorem, the dependence of the kinetic energy of the electronic subsystem on temperature and the molar volume has been determined. Using the above dependence a thermodynamic criterion has been derived for the metal-nonmetal transition which is governed by the thermal expansion.",3
Effective potential and quantum criticality for imbalanced Fermi mixtures.,"We study the analytical structure of the effective action for spin- and mass-imbalanced Fermi mixtures at the onset of the superfluid state. Of our particular focus is the possibility of suppressing the tricritical temperature to zero, so that the transition remains continuous down to T = 0 and the phase diagram hosts a quantum critical point. At mean-field level we analytically identify such a possibility in a regime of parameters in dimensionality d = 3. In contrast, in d = 2 we demonstrate that the occurrence of a quantum critical point is (at the mean-field level) excluded. We show that the Landau expansion of the effective potential remains well-defined in the limit [Formula: see text] except for a subset of model parameters which includes the standard BCS limit. We calculate the mean-field asymptotic shape of the transition line. Employing the functional renormalization group framework we go beyond the mean field theory and demonstrate the stability of the quantum critical point in d = 3 with respect to fluctuations.",3
"Electronic structure, bonding characteristics, and mechanical properties in (W2/3Sc1/3)2AlC and (W2/3Y1/3)2AlC i-MAX phases from first-principles calculations.","With the recent discovery of in-plane chemically ordered MAX phases (i-MAX) of the general formula ([Formula: see text])2 AC comes addition of non-traditional MAX phase elements. In the present study, we use density functional theory calculations to investigate the electronic structure, bonding nature, and mechanical properties of the novel (W2/3Sc1/3)2AlC and (W2/3Y1/3)2AlC i-MAX phases. From analysis of the electronic structure and projected crystal orbital Hamilton populations, we show that the metallic i-MAX phases have significant hybridization between W and C, as well as Sc(Y) and C states, indicative of strong covalent bonding. Substitution of Sc for Y (M (2)) leads to reduced bonding strength for W-C and Al-Al interactions while M (2)-C and M (2)-Al interactions are strengthened. We also compare the Voigt-Reuss-Hill bulk, shear, and Young's moduli along the series of M (1) = Cr, Mo, and W, and relate these trends to the bonding interactions. Furthermore, we find overall larger moduli for Sc-based i-MAX phases.",3
"Antiphase boundary in antiferromagnetic multiferroic LuMn0.5Fe0.5O3: anomalous ferromagnetism, exchange bias effect and large vertical hysteretic shift.","The emergence of exchange bias effect in Fe3O4 thin films has been since attributed to the presence of anti phase boundary (APB) growth defects despite lack of direct experimental evidence. In the present report, APB induced anomalous weak ferromagnetism and exchange bias property of single-phase antiferromagnetic (AFM) system LuMn0.5Fe0.5O3 (LMFO) is discussed and (57)Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) measurements are used to probe the origin of the observed effect. In addition to the sextet component corresponding to the long range AFM ordering, the measured Mossbauer spectra reveal the presence of a small component (10%-12%) near zero velocity with unusually small internal field. This indicates the presence of APB defects. From micro structural investigations using HRTEM, presence of APB type defects and dislocations are confirmed. In addition to the exchange bias effect, upon field cooling, hysteresis loop exhibits large vertical shift due to strong pinning effect of the APB. Finally we further annealed the optimally sintered sample LMFO and studied the evolution of defects, and their influence on weak ferromagnetism and exchange bias properties. Our present experimental findings may pave the way in creating new functionalities in materials using APB-type growth defects.",3
DNA capture into the ClyA nanopore: diffusion-limited versus reaction-limited processes.,"The capture and translocation of biomolecules through nanometer-scale pores are processes with a potentially large number of applications, and hence they have been intensively studied in recent years. The aim of this paper is to review existing models of the capture process by a nanopore, together with some recent experimental data of short single- and double-stranded DNA captured by the Cytolysin A (ClyA) nanopore. ClyA is a transmembrane protein of bacterial origin which has been recently engineered through site-specific mutations, to allow the translocation of double- and single-stranded DNA. A comparison between theoretical estimations and experiments suggests that for both cases the capture is a reaction-limited process. This is corroborated by the observed salt dependence of the capture rate, which we find to be in quantitative agreement with the theoretical predictions.",3
Rigorous ESR spectroscopy of Fe(3+) impurity ion with oxygen vacancy in ferroelectric SrTiO3 crystal at 20 mK.,"Impurity Fe(3+) ion electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy using multiple dielectric modes in a SrTiO3 dielectric resonator has been performed with a tunable DC magnetic field of up to 1.6 T. The Ti[Formula: see text] ion is substituted by Fe(3+) ion forming FeO6 octahedral complex with an iron-oxygen-vacancy (Fe[Formula: see text]). In such a metal-ligand complex, a giant g-factor of [Formula: see text] was observed in the ferroelectric phase at 20 mK. The change of Fe(3+) ion center-symmetry in the FeO6 complex as a soft-mode characteristics of ferroelectric phase transition and the influences of iron-oxygen-vacancy (Fe[Formula: see text]), are interactively sensitive to asymmetry in the octahedral rotational parameter Phi in SrTiO3.",3
Stability of SnSe1-x S x solid solutions revealed by first-principles cluster expansion.,"The configurational thermodynamics of a pseudo-binary alloy SnSe1-x S x in the Pnma phase is studied using first-principles cluster-expansion method in combination with canonical Monte Carlo simulations. We find that, despite the alloy having a tendency toward a phase decomposition into SnSe and SnS at 0 K, the two constituent binaries readily mix with each other to form random SnSe1-x S x solid solutions even at a temperature below room temperature. The obtained isostructural phase diagram of SnSe1-x S x reveals that the alloy is thermodynamically stable as a single-phase random solid solution over a whole composition range above 200 K. These findings provide a fundamental understanding on the alloying behavior of SnSe1-x S x and bring clarity to the debated clustering tendency in this alloy system.",3
"From tricritical ferromagnetism to metamagnetism in quasi-two dimensional Tl(Co1-x Ni x )2S2 (x = 0, 0.05).","We have investigated the critical behavior near the ferromagnetic transition of TlCo2S2 single crystals and the magnetic properties of Tl(Co0.95Ni0.05)2S2 by means of magnetization measurements. The obtained critical exponents beta, gamma and delta of TlCo2S2 could basically satisfy the scaling equations and are found very close to the prediction of the tricritical mean-field theory. 5[Formula: see text] Ni doping drives the system to an antiferromagnetic ground state which is unstable to magnetic field, yielding metamagnetic transition. The possible existence of a tricritical point (TCP) in Tl(Co0.95Ni0.05)2S2 is also discussed.",3
Variation of magnetic properties of Sr2FeMoO6 due to oxygen vacancies.,"Oxygen vacancies can be of utmost importance for improving or deteriorating physical properties of oxide materials. Here, we studied from first-principles the electronic and magnetic properties of oxygen vacancies in the double perovskite Sr2FeMoO6 (SFMO). We show that oxygen vacancies can increase the Curie temperature in SFMO, although the total magnetic moment is reduced at the same time. We found also that the experimentally observed valence change of the Fe ions from 3+ to 2+ in the x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements is better explained by oxygen vacancies than by the assumed mixed valence state. The agreement of the calculated x-ray absorption spectra and XMCD results with experimental data is considerably improved by inclusion of oxygen vacancies.",3
SQERT-T: alleviating kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC)-stiffness in transient KMC simulations.,"Lattice based kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) is often used for simulating the dynamics of systems at a supramolecular scale, based on molecular scale transitions. A common challenge in KMC simulations is rapid 'back-and-forth' reactions, which dominate the events executed during simulations and inhibit the ability for simulations to reach longer time scales. Such processes are fast frivolous processes (FFPs) and are one manifestation of a phenomenon referred to as KMC-stiffness. Here, an algorithm for staggered quasi-equilibrium rank-based throttling geared towards transient kinetics (SQERT-T) is presented. Within the SQERT-T methodology, a pace-restrictor reaction and an FFP floor are utilized along with throttling of the process transition rate constants to accelerate the KMC simulations while still retaining sufficient time resolution for sampling of the data. KMC simulations were performed for CO oxidation over RuO2(1 1 0) and over RuO2(1 1 1), and the results were compared to experimental data obtained using RuO2 powders. The experiments and simulations were for transient conditions: the system was subjected to a temperature program which included temperatures in the range of 363 to 453 K. The timescales that were achieved during the KMC simulations in this study would not have been accessible without KMC acceleration, and were enabled by the use of SQERT-T.",3
Kinetics of electron cooling in metal films at low temperatures and revision of the two-temperature model.,"The two-temperature model (2TM) introduced by Kaganov, Lifshitz, and Tanatarov is widely used to describe the energy relaxation in the electron-phonon system of a metallic film. At the same time, the accuracy of the description of the electron-phonon system in terms of the 2TM, i.e. on the basis of the electron and phonon temperatures, has not been considered in detail until now. In this paper we present a microscopic theory of cooling of instantly heated electrons in metallic films. In framework of this theory the main features of electron cooling in thick and thin films were found, and an analysis of the accuracy of the 2TM in the low-temperature region was carried out. We consider a more accurate three-temperature model, which (in contrast to the 2TM) explicitly takes into account phonons with angles of incidence exceeding the angle of total internal reflection. The contribution of these phonons to the kinetics of electron relaxation can be significant if the sound velocities in the film and the substrate are quite different.",3
Swelling as a stabilizing mechanism in irradiated thin films.,"Irradiation of semiconductor surfaces often leads to the spontaneous formation of rippled structures at certain irradiation angles. However, at high enough energies, in the keV range, these structures are sometimes observed to vanish for all angles, despite the absence of any identified, universally-stabilizing physical mechanisms in operation. Here, we examine the effect on pattern formation of radiation-induced swelling, which has been excluded from prior treatments of stress in irradiated films. After developing a suitable continuum model, we perform a linear stability analysis to determine its effect on stability. Under appropriate simplifying assumptions, we find swelling indeed to be stabilizing at all angles for wavenumbers typical of experimental observations. Therefore, this mechanism may account for the suppression of ripple formation observed at energies over 1 keV.",3
Role of external and internal perturbations on ferromagnetic phase transitions in manganites: existence of tricritical points.,"A phenomenological mean-field theory is presented to describe the role of external magnetic field, pressure and chemical substitution on the nature of ferromagnetic (FM) to paramagnetic (PM) phase transition in manganites. The application of external field (or pressure) shifts the transition, leading to a field (or pressure) dependent phase boundary along which a tricritical point is shown to exist where a first-order FM-PM transition becomes second-order. We show that the effect of chemical substitution on the FM transition is analogous to that of external perturbations (magnetic field and pressure); this includes the existence of a tricritical point at which the order of transition changes. Our theoretical predictions satisfactorily explain the nature of FM-PM transition, observed in several systems. The modeling hypothesis has been critically verified from our experimental data from a wide range of colossal magnetoresistive manganite single crystals like Sm0.52Sr0.48MnO3. The theoretical model prediction of a tricritical point has been validated in this experiment which provides a major ramification of the strength of the model proposed.",3
New high-pressure tetragonal polymorphs of SrTiO3-molecular orbital and Raman band change under pressure.,"The vibrational and structural properties of SrTiO3 were investigated using Raman spectroscopy, synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction up to 55 GPa at 300 K, and ab initio quantum chemical molecular orbital (MO) calculations. These measurements and calculations revealed the structure transformation from cubic to tetragonal phase at about 9 GPa. Above 9 GPa, sharper new peaks were associated with a tetragonal structure. At about 30 GPa some bands disappeared and several new bands emerged. Structure transformation from I4/mcm to a new structure of P4/mbm was found at above 30 GPa by Rietveld profile fitting analysis. The diffraction pattern gave no indication of a Cmcm orthorhombic phase. Ab initio MO calculation proved the change of the molecular orbital coupling with a structure transformation. The Mulliken charge of Ti is increased with increasing pressure in the cubic phase, but the Sr charge continuously decreased. The d-p-pi hybridization of the Ti-O bond and localizing the electron density are decreased with increasing pressure. The Ti-O bond becomes shorted in the P4/mbm phase and the change in the Ti charge accelerated more. All present investigations by x-ray diffraction, Raman spectra study and MO calculation show consistent results.",3
"Magnetization, resistivity, specific heat and ab initio calculations of Gd5Sb3.","We report on the combined results of the structural, magnetic, transport and calorimetric properties of Mn5Si3-type hexagonal Gd5Sb3, together with ab initio calculations. It exhibits a ferromagnetic (FM)-like transition at 265 K, antiferromagnetic (AFM) Neel transition at 95.5 K followed by a spin-orientation transition at 62 K. The system is found to be in AFM state down to 2 K in a field of 70 kOe. The FM-AFM phase coexistence is not noticeable despite large positive Curie-Weiss temperature ([Formula: see text] K). Instead, low-temperature AFM and high-temperature FM-like phases are separated in large temperatures. Temperature-magnetic field (H-T) phase diagram reveals field-driven complex magnetic phases. Within the AFM phase, the system is observed to undergo field-driven spin-orientation transitions. Field-induced tricritical and quantum critical points appear to be absent due to the strong AFM nature and by the intervention of FM-like state between paramagnetic and AFM states, respectively. The metallic behavior of the compound is inferred from resistivity along with large Sommerfeld parameter. However, no sign of strong electron-correlations is reasoned from the Kadowaki-Wood's ratio [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] cm . (mol . K)(2)(mJ)(-2), despite heavy gamma. Essentially, ab initio calculations accounting for electronic correlations confirm AFM nature of low-temperature magnetic state in Gd5Sb3 and attainable FM ordering in agreement with experimental data.",3
A Raman study of the pressure-induced densification of SiO2-based glass-ceramics.,Here we report a structural characterization study of glass-ceramics as a function of pressure by Raman spectroscopy. We selected a glass-ceramics of Li2O-Al2O3-nSiO2 (n approximately 8) doped with ZrO2 and TiO2. This composition induces slight structural modification in Si-O and Si-O-Si bonds in the glass matrix that are crucial to stabilize metastable hexagonal SiO2 (beta-quartz) solid-solution nano crystals corresponding to gamma-LiAlSi2O6. This structure yields a more compact beta-quartz-type phase that eventually stabilizes it in wider pressure range than pure SiO2. Raman spectroscopy allows to unravel at least two pressure-induced structural phase transitions at about 6 and 15 GPa that could not be previously revealed by x-ray diffraction. We show that the phase-transition sequence can tentatively be described in terms of SiO2-type structure as: beta-quartz --> Coesite I --> Coesite II. The measured transition pressures are consistent with the larger cell volume attained in the gamma-LiAlSi2O6 yielding a wider metastability pressure range of the beta-quartz-type phase.,3
Interfacially driven transport in narrow channels.,"When colloids flow in a narrow channel, the transport efficiency is controlled by the non-equilibrium interplay between colloid-wall interactions and hydrodynamics. In this paper, a general, unifying description of colloidal dispersion flow in a confined system is proposed. A momentum and mass balance founded framework implementing the colloid-interface interactions is introduced. The framework allows us to depict how interfacial forces drive the particles and the liquid flows. The interfacially driven flow (osmotic or Marangoni flows for repulsive or attractive colloid-wall interactions respectively) can be directly simulated in 2D domains. The ability of the model to describe the physics of transport in a narrow channel is discussed in detail. The hydrodynamic nature of osmosis and the associated counter-pressure are mechanically related to the colloid-interface interactions. The simulation shows an unexpected transition from axial plug to pillar accumulation for colloidal accumulation at a channel bottleneck. This transition has important consequences in transport efficiencies. Existing limiting cases, such as diffusio-osmosis, are recovered from the simulations, showing that the framework is physically well-founded. The model generalizes the existing approaches and proves the hydrodynamic character of osmosis, which cannot be fully described by purely thermodynamic considerations.",3
Viscoelastic anomaly accompanying anti-crossing behaviour in liquid As2Se3.,"We investigate the dynamic structure factor of the melt of the well known glass former, As2Se3, using inelastic x-ray scattering for temperatures, T, [Formula: see text] K and momentum transfers Q from [Formula: see text] nm(-1). An anomaly was observed at Q = 2.7 nm(-1) ([Formula: see text] K) with, in the context of a simple model, both an abrupt change in frequency and an increased linewidth reminiscent of an anti-crossing in a solid. Comparison with structural information from reverse Monte Carlo modeling of x-ray diffraction data allows us to associate the disappearance of the anomaly at higher temperatures with a drop in the number of mechanical constraints per atom, n mc, to [Formula: see text] reminiscent of the threshold applicable for glass formation in rigidity theory. It is inferred that the surprising jump in the dispersion in the liquid may be correlated with a stiffness transition in a network glass.",3
Effect of phonon scattering by substitutional and structural defects on thermal conductivity of 2D graphene.,"The ability to tailor the thermal conductivity of graphene by introducing crystalline defects has attracted considerable research attention. In this study, nonequilibrium molecular dynamics calculation is used to investigate the effect of crystalline defects on the thermal conductivity of 2D graphene. The defects considered include substitutional nitrogen and silicon, pure structural single vacancy and Stone-Wales defects, and structurally different pyridinic nitrogen. In particular, this study focuses on the unique phonon scattering behaviors arising from the low dimensionality of graphene. The results reveal that the low dimensionality of graphene has a negligible effect on phonon scattering in substitutionally defected graphene, for which the Klemens scattering model is accurate without the need for any corrections. The substitutional silicon defect leads to more effective reduction of the thermal conductivity than the structural defects because of the effect of change in the hybridization and the mass on the scattering. Almost equal reductions are observed for the two structural defects, the scattering strengths of which are significantly weakened by the two dimensionality of graphene. Callaway analysis of the vacancy scattering reveals that even with the perturbation of the vacancy, the 2D honeycomb structure preserves considerable phonon stability compared with a 3D material. In addition, the absence of mass deficiency for the Stone-Wales defect suggests that the contribution of mass deficiency is minimized for structural defects of graphene. Finally, opposite to the findings for the substitutional nitrogen defect, the introduction of pyridinic nitrogen leads to further reduction of the thermal conductivity compared with that for a single vacancy defect.",3
Effects of vacancy defects on Fe properties incorporated in MgO.,"Distributions of Fe in MgO containing Mg vacancy, O vacancy, and Schottky defect are investigated based on the density functional theory (DFT). Our results show that since Mg vacancy will remove electrons from MgO, Fe tends to get close to Mg vacancy but far from O vacancy. The Mg vacancy can decrease the magnetic moment of iron and change its valence state from 2+ to 3+, which leads to ~5% decrease of Fe-O bond length comparable to the effect of 30 GPa external pressure. Furthermore, iron incorporation can increase the Schottky defect concentration of MgO especially in the environment of the Earth's lower mantle, where ~20 mol% Fe-bearing MgO locates at extreme high temperature conditions.",3
Effects of trigonal deformation on electronic structure and thermoelectric properties of bismuth.,"First principles calculation and Boltzmann transport theory have been used to reveal the effects of trigonal deformation on electronic structure and thermoelectric properties of bulk bismuth. It is found that the semimetal-semiconductor transition would happen at the critical c/a points of 2.41 and 2.51, and that such a transition should be ascribed to the opposite changes of band edges at T and L points during trigonal deformation. Calculations also reveal that trigonal deformation has an important effect on various temperature-dependent thermoelectric properties, and that carrier density plays a decisive role in determining the magnitude of Seebeck coefficient and figure of merit. The semimetal --> semiconductor transition as a result of trigonal compression with the decrease of c/a fundamentally induces the best performance of the thermoelectric properties of bismuth at the c/a ratio of 2.45. The present results agree well with experimental observations in the literature, and provide a deep understanding of the intrinsic relationship between trigonal deformation, band structure, and thermoelectric properties of bismuth.",3
Spin-orbit interaction and controlled singlet-triplet dynamics in silicon double quantum dots.,"We undertake a theoretical study of the role of spin orbit interactions in a silicon double quantum dot. We propose that an accurate estimate of the strength of this interaction can be obtained through the study of the return probability of the double occupation singlet state in a magnetic field, as the system is gated dynamically across the relevant states in the low energy two-electron manifold. Landau-Zener type of processes involving appropriate control of voltage pulses across neighboring avoided crossings in the energy spectrum of the system are utilized to explore the system dynamics. Our description takes into account Zeeman splitting, intervalley mixing and spin-orbit interaction present in the structure. Using a density matrix equation of motion approach, we carry out numerical calculations for the return probability of the double occupation singlet state. The analysis in terms of Landau-Zener theory allows the determination of the spin-orbit coupling strength for different Zeeman splitting regimes.",3
High-pressure/high-temperature phase diagram of zinc.,"The phase diagram of zinc (Zn) has been explored up to 140 GPa and 6000 K, by combining optical observations, x-ray diffraction, and ab initio calculations. In the pressure range covered by this study, Zn is found to retain a hexagonal close-packed (hcp) crystal symmetry up to the melting temperature. The known decrease of the axial ratio (c/a) of the hcp phase of Zn under compression is observed in x-ray diffraction experiments from 300 K up to the melting temperature. The pressure at which c/a reaches [Formula: see text] ( approximately 10 GPa) is slightly affected by temperature. When this axial ratio is reached, we observed that single crystals of Zn, formed at high temperature, break into multiple poly-crystals. In addition, a noticeable change in the pressure dependence of c/a takes place at the same pressure. Both phenomena could be caused by an isomorphic second-order phase transition induced by pressure in Zn. The reported melt curve extends previous results from 24 to 135 GPa. The pressure dependence obtained for the melting temperature is accurately described up to 135 GPa by using a Simon-Glatzel equation: [Formula: see text], where P is the pressure in GPa. The determined melt curve agrees with previous low-pressure studies and with shock-wave experiments, with a melting temperature of 5060(30) K at 135 GPa. Finally, a thermal equation of state is reported, which at room-temperature agrees with the literature.",3
Realization of intrinsically broken Dirac cones in graphene via the momentum-resolved electronic band structure.,"A way to represent the band structure that distinguishes between energy-momentum and energy-crystal momentum relationships is proposed upon the band-unfolding concept. This momentum-resolved band structure offers better understanding of the physical processes requiring the information of wave functions in momentum space and provides a direct connection to angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) spectra. Following this approach, we demonstrate that Dirac cones in graphene are intrinsically broken in momentum space and can be described by a conceptual unit cell smaller than the primitive unit cell. This hidden degree of freedom can be measured by ARPES experiments as missing weight that is retrievable by investigating the effect of different polarized light. Having the energy-momentum relationship, we provide alternative understanding of the retrieved momentum intensity beyond the periodic-zone scheme, that is, the retrieved momentum intensity is assisted with the properties of final states, not from the Dirac cones directly. The revealed broken Dirac cones and momenta supplied by the lattice give interesting ingredients for designing advanced nanodevices.",3
Theoretical spin-wave dispersions in the antiferromagnetic phase AF1 of MnWO4 based on the polar atomistic model in P2.,"The spin wave dispersions of the low temperature antiferromagnetic phase (AF1) MnWO4 have been numerically calculated based on the recently reported non-collinear spin configuration with two different canting angles. A Heisenberg model with competing magnetic exchange couplings and single-ion anisotropy terms could properly describe the spin wave excitations, including the newly observed low-lying energy excitation mode [Formula: see text] meV appearing at the magnetic zone centre. The spin wave dispersion and intensities are highly sensitive to two differently aligned spin-canting sublattices in the AF1 model. Thus this study reinsures the otherwise hardly provable hidden polar character in MnWO4.",3
Analysis of the magnetic properties of Ce3Pt23Si11: orthorhombic crystal field and mean-field approximation.,"We present here a quantitative analysis of the ground state and magnetic properties of Ce3Pt23Si11, based on a crystalline electric field description within the mean-field approximation. In this face-centered cubic compound, the point group symmetry at the Ce site is orthorhombic. One main difficulty in this low symmetry case is that the CEF potential for Ce(3+) ions is determined by five independent parameters, while only two magnetic excitations are observed by inelastic neutron scattering. Moreover the anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility of the Ce ion, that permits an independent determination of the second-order CEF parameters is hidden by the cubic symmetry of the compound. A specific procedure is developed for this purpose that combines genetic algorithms and more conventional optimization methods. A set of CEF parameters is found that best reproduces the different experimental observations in both the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases of Ce3Pt23Si11. The analysis accounts for two seemingly contradictory properties: a strong local anisotropy that aligns the moment along a fourfold axis and a rather weak anisotropy of the bulk magnetization with an easy threefold magnetization axis. Ce3Pt23Si11 is shown to be a model system where single site anisotropies compete within a crystal structure of overall high symmetry.",3
Landau theory for magnetic and structural transitions in CeCo0.85Fe0.15Si.,"We present a phenomenological analysis of the magnetoelastic properties of CeCo0.85Fe0.15Si at temperatures close to the Neel transition temperature T N. Using a Landau functional we provide a qualitative description of the thermal expansion, magnetostriction, magnetization and specific heat data. We show that the available experimental results (Correa et al 2016 J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 28 346003) are consistent with the presence of a structural transition at [Formula: see text] and a strong magnetoelastic coupling. The magnetoelastic coupling presents a Janus-faced effect: while the structural transition is shifted to higher temperatures as the magnetic field is increased, the resulting striction at low temperatures decreases. The strong magnetoelastic coupling and the proximity of the structural transition to the onset temperature for magnetic fluctuations, suggest that the transition could be an analogue of the tetragonal to orthorhombic observed in Fe-based pcnictides.",3
Structural and magnetic phase transitions in Cs2[FeCl5(H2O)].,"The compound [Formula: see text] is magnetoelectric but not multiferroic with an erythrosiderite-related structure. We present a comprehensive investigation of its structural and antiferromagnetic phase transitions by polarization microscopy, pyroelectric measurements, x-ray diffraction and neutron diffraction. At about [Formula: see text] K, the compound changes its symmetry from Cmcm to I2/c, with a doubling of the original c-axis. This transformation is associated with rotations of the [Formula: see text] octahedra and corresponds to an ordering of the [Formula: see text] molecules and of the related [Formula: see text] bonds. A significant ferroelectric polarization can be excluded for this transition by precise pyrocurrent measurements. The antiferromagnetic phase transition occurring at [Formula: see text] results in the magnetic space group [Formula: see text], which perfectly agrees with previous measurements of the linear magnetoelectric effect and magnetization.",3
"Giant thermopower in 'p' type OsX2 (X: S, Se, Te) for a wide temperature range: a first principles study.","We report the electronic structure and thermoelectric (TE) properties of OsX2 (X: S, Se, Te), and find a giant value of thermopower of magnitude 600 muV K(-1)-800 muV K(-1) for a wide temperature range of 100 K-500 K for hole doping (at 10(18) cm(-3)), which is higher than the value found for well established TE materials. The optimized structural parameters are in good agreement with available experimental reports. The mechanical stability of all the compounds are confirmed from the computed elastic constants. The band gap of the investigated compounds is examined by several exchange correlation functionals, and TB-mBJ with modified parameters is found to be the best. The heavy valence bands stimulate the thermopower value for hole doping and light conduction bands intensifies the electrical conductivity values for electron doping, enabling both 'n' and 'p' type doping favourable for TE applications at higher concentrations (10(20) cm(-3)), which brings out the device application. Our results unveil the possibility of TE applications for all the examined compounds for a wide temperature range (100 K-500 K), and OsS2 specifically is quite alternative with the performing temperature ranging from 100 K-900 K.",3
Thickness evolution of transport properties in exfoliated Fe1+y Te nanoflakes.,"We report the evolution of transport properties in exfoliated Fe1+y Te (y = 0.04) nanoflakes of various thickness. In contrast to the sharp semiconducting-to-metallic phase transition observed in both bulk and thicker flakes, this transition becomes broadened for flakes with an intermediate thickness followed by the appearance of a superconducting-like feature upon further cooling. With the thickness further decreased, the flakes exhibit insulating transport behavior with significantly enhanced positive magnetoresistance, which can be explained using a variable range hopping mechanism, suggesting the nature of a highly disordered 2D system.",3
Origin of enhanced stability and oxygen adsorption capacity of medium-sized Pt-Ni nanoclusters.,"Understanding the stability and adsorption properties of O atom can be considered as the first step to understand the mechanism of the oxygen reduction reaction on Pt-Ni nanoclusters. In this work, the equilibrium structures, stability, adsorption properties and deformation energies of medium-sized Pt-Ni nanoclusters are studied by global optimization method and density functional theory calculations. It is found that Pt-Ni nanoclusters are of more stable structure and larger oxygen adsorption energy than Pt nanoclusters, and the enhanced stability and oxygen adsorption capacity of Pt-Ni nanoclusters originate from both the strain and electronic factors. Based on the strain effect, the local pressures are on average much better equilibrated on Pt-Ni nanoclusters, bringing about the more stable structure. The elongation of the metal-metal bond distances results in the increase of adsorption energy of the O atom on Pt-Ni nanoclusters. Considering the electronic effect, the charge interaction between the LDOS (d orbital) of metal atoms adjacent to the adsorbed O atom and the DOS (p orbital) of the O atom gives rise to the increase of oxygen adsorption capacity on Pt-Ni nanoclusters. Simultaneously, the charge density difference analysis shows that the Ni atoms doping is conducive for O atom adsorption. In addition, the diffusion of O atom from surface to interior is difficult due to the high diffusion energy barriers. Our results show that both strain and electronic factors are of important effects on the stability and adsorption properties of nanoalloys.",3
A comprehensive study of the magnetic properties of the pyroxenes series CaMgSi2O6-Co2Si2O6 as a function of Co content.,"We report a detailed study on the magnetic properties of the pyroxene series M2M1Si2O6, with M2 = Ca and M1 = Mg, where magnesium and then calcium are progressively substituted by cobalt. For cobalt site occupancy larger than 0.7 at the M1 site, a collinear antiferromagnetic phase is detected for T < T N1 = 12 K with a monodimensional character (i.e. M1 site intra-chain order parallel to c axis). Moreover the magnetization easy axis has been estimated to lie roughly along the [1 0 1] direction. Cobalt content 0.5 at the M2 site (overall content 1.5) determines the formation of a new independent antiferromagnetic order with higher Neel temperature, involving only the M2 site intra-chain interactions. The incoming M2 site order is accompanied by a lowering of the space symmetry which yields to a weakly ferromagnetic resultant due to spin canted distribution of the magnetic moments either along the M1 or M2 chains. Furthermore, metamagnetic transitions are observed for both M1 and M2 site intra-chain orders at relatively low critical magnetic fields, around 2 T, suggesting that this series of pyroxenes can be used as a model system for investigating the fundamental aspects of magnetism in the matter.",3
Effect of stochastic gating on the flux through a membrane channel: a steady-state approach.,"This paper deals with the effect of stochastic gating on the flux of solute molecules through a membrane channel. According to the conventional approach, this flux is given by the product of the flux through the open channel and the probability of finding the channel in the open state. Recently we derived an expression for the flux through a stochastically gated channel (Berezhkovskii and Bezrukov 2017 J. Chem. Phys. 147 084109) that showed that the conventional approach may underestimate the flux at fast gating by orders of magnitude. The present work proposes a novel approach to the problem: while our initial derivation of the expression for the flux focuses on the molecule propagator in the channel, here we treat the problem by considering the steady-state flux through an ensemble of identical stochastically gated channels. We show now that the effect of gating on the flux is independent of the gate position, i.e. whether the gate is located at the channel entrance or exit.",3
Observation of Roton Mode Population in a Dipolar Quantum Gas.,"The concept of a roton, a special kind of elementary excitation, forming a minimum of energy at finite momentum, has been essential to understand the properties of superfluid (4)He 1. In quantum liquids, rotons arise from the strong interparticle interactions, whose microscopic description remains debated 2. In the realm of highly-controllable quantum gases, a roton mode has been predicted to emerge due to magnetic dipole-dipole interactions despite of their weakly-interacting character 3. This prospect has raised considerable interest 4-12; yet roton modes in dipolar quantum gases have remained elusive to observations. Here we report experimental and theoretical studies of the momentum distribution in Bose-Einstein condensates of highly-magnetic erbium atoms, revealing the existence of the long-sought roton mode. Following an interaction quench, the roton mode manifests itself with the appearance of symmetric peaks at well-defined finite momentum. The roton momentum follows the predicted geometrical scaling with the inverse of the confinement length along the magnetisation axis. From the growth of the roton population, we probe the roton softening of the excitation spectrum in time and extract the corresponding imaginary roton gap. Our results provide a further step in the quest towards supersolidity in dipolar quantum gases 13.",3
Kondo effect with tunable spin-orbit interaction in LaTiO3/CeTiO3/SrTiO3 heterostructure.,"We have fabricated epitaxial films of CeTiO3 (CTO) on (0 0 1) oriented SrTiO3 (STO) substrates, which exhibit highly insulating and diamagnetic properties. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to establish the 3+ valence state of the Ce and Ti ions. Furthermore, we have also fabricated delta (CTO) doped LaTiO3 (LTO)/SrTiO3 thin films which exhibit variety of interesting properties including Kondo effect and spin-orbit interaction (SOI) at low temperatures. The SOI shows a non-monotonic behaviour as the thickness of the CTO layer is increased and is reflected in the value of characteristic SOI field ([Formula: see text]) obtained from weak anti-localization fitting. The maximum value of [Formula: see text] is 1.00 T for delta layer thickness of 6 u.c. This non-monotonic behaviour of SOI is attributed to the strong screening of the confining potential at the interface. The screening effect is enhanced by the CTO layer thickness and the dielectric constant of STO which increases at low temperatures. Due to the strong screening, electrons confined at the interface are spread deeper into the STO bulk where it starts to populate the Ti [Formula: see text] subbands; consequently the Fermi level crosses over from [Formula: see text] to the [Formula: see text] subbands. At the crossover region of [Formula: see text] where there is orbital mixing, SOI goes through a maximum.",3
Calculating tracer currents through narrow ion channels: beyond the independent particle model.,"Discrete state models of single-file ion permeation through a narrow ion channel pore are employed to analyze the ratio of forward to backward tracer current. Conditions under which the well-known Ussing formula for this ratio hold are explored in systems where ions do not move independently through the channel. Building detailed balance into the rate constants for the model in such a way that under equilibrium conditions (equal rate of forward versus backward permeation events) the Nernst equation is satisfied, it is found that in a model where only one ion can occupy the channel at a time, the Ussing formula is always obeyed for any number of binding sites, reservoir concentrations of the ions and electric potential difference across the membrane which the ion channel spans, independent of the internal details of the permeation pathway. However, numerical analysis demonstrates that when multiple ions can occupy the channel at once, the nonequilibrium forward/backward tracer flux ratio deviates from the prediction of the Ussing model. Assuming an appropriate effective potential experienced by ions in the channel, we provide explicit formulae for the rate constants in these models.",3
Self-organized nanopatterning of polycarbonate surfaces by argon ion sputtering.,"Polycarbonate surfaces were sputtered using 40 keV Ar(+) ions at off normal incidence of 30 degrees with ion fluences ranging from 1 x 10(16) Ar(+) cm(-2) to 5 x 10(16) Ar(+) cm(-2). Surface topography along with structural modification has been studied using atomic force microscope (AFM) and Raman spectroscopy. Substantial smoothing of polymeric surfaces along with evolution of some random dot like nano structures after ion irradiation has been revealed. Average size of dots varied from 34 to 95 nm while density of dots varied from 0.17 to 14.7 x 10(7) dots cm(-2) for various ion fluences. Power spectral density spectrum has been obtained from fast Fourier analysis of respective AFM images to get the information about underlying mechanism of sputtering induced nano structuring and smoothing of polymeric surfaces. AFM results have been well correlated with the disordering parameters calculated from the deconvoluted Raman spectra. These nanopatterned substrates are useful in a wide range of important applications, for example, in bioengineering, binary optics, making organic thin-film transistors and light-emitting diodes.",3
Effects of external magnetic field and out-of-plane strain on magneto-optical Kerr spectra in CrI3 monolayer.,"Magnetic semiconductors based on two-dimensional (2D) crystals have attracted attention owing to their intrinsic ferromagnetism and have potential for spintronic devices. Here, full-potential linearized augmented plane wave plus local orbitals method is used to explore the structural, electronic, magnetic, and magneto-optical properties of CrI3 monolayer. Our first-principles calculations show that CrI3 monolayer is a ferromagnetic indirect semiconductor with spin-up and spin-down band gaps of 1.23 and 1.90 eV, respectively, and a magnetic moment of 2.93 [Formula: see text] per Cr atom. Based on the macroscopic linear response theory, we systematically study the influences of external magnetic field and out-of-plane strain on the magneto-optical Kerr effect spectra in CrI3 monolayer. The Kerr rotation of CrI3 monolayer at 1.96 eV photon energy is [Formula: see text], which is consistent with the recent experiments. We find that the Kerr rotation reaches its maximum when the external magnetic field is perpendicular to CrI3 plane, while it is almost zero on turning the magnetic field in the plane. This result as well as the sizable magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) of 0.79 meV verifies that CrI3 monolayer has a strong magnetic anisotropy with an out-of-plane easy axis. Further, applying out-of-plane compressive and tensile strain upon CrI3 monolayer, we observe a redshift of the Kerr rotation spectra with the increase of the strain and the peak values of the Kerr rotation increase correspondingly. The rich electronic and magnetic properties, especially the magneto-optical spectra, render CrI3 monolayer a promising 2D magnetic material for applications from sensing to data storage.",3
Effects of a magnetic field on the optoelectronic properties of mono- and bi-layer transition metal dichalcogenides.,"We report a theoretical study on the effects of an external magnetic field on the electronic and optical properties of mono- and bi-layer MoS2, and bilayer MoS2/WS2 heterostructures. The direction of an applied magnetic field determines (i) the strength of the coupling between the atomic orbital moments of the structure and the field, and (ii) Zeeman contribution to the splitting of the VB and CB levels with the amplitude of the applied field. Whereas for a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the structure, calculated real part of optical conductivity reveals optical transitions red-shifted compared to zero magnetic field case, conductivity is unaffected by the the amplitude of an in-plane applied magnetic field. We show that through modifying atomic d-orbitals conduction and valence band states by an applied electric field, we can determine and control the impact of a magnetic field on the optical response of these materials. We employ our parametrized tight-binding model with non-orthogonal sp(3)d(5) orbitals and spin-orbit coupling, which was advanced to include the effects of an external magnetic field through Peierls substitution in the wave vector and the Zeeman energy term.",3
Routes for nanoparticle translocation through polymer-brush-modified nanopores.,"This work presents a theoretical study of the translocation routes of nanoparticles through polymer-brush modified nanopores. The calculations were performed with a molecular theory that explicitly accounts for the shape, size, conformations and interactions of all molecular species in the system. This work reports molecular-theory calculations allowing inhomogeneities in the three spatial dimensions, which allows us to study for the first time off-axis translocation routes, i.e. routes that do not coincide with the axis of the pore. Free-energy landscapes within the pore were obtained for particles of different sizes and affinity for the polymer brush. The minimum free-energy paths on these landscapes determine the translocation routes. Decreasing the size of the particle or increasing its affinity for the polymer, shifts the translocation route from the central axis of the pore towards its walls. Interestingly, for a given polymer-particle affinity, there exists an intermediate particle size that results in the most flat potential of mean force for translocation, therefore, that will optimize the rate of translocation.",3
Magnetotransport properties of 8-Pmmn borophene: effects of Hall field and strain.,"The polymorph of 8-Pmmn borophene is an anisotropic Dirac material with tilted Dirac cones at two valleys. The tilting of the Dirac cones at two valleys are in opposite directions, which manifests itself via the valley dependent Landau levels in presence of an in-plane electric field (Hall field). The valley dependent Landau levels cause valley polarized magnetotransport properties in presence of the Hall field, which is in contrast to the monolayer graphene with isotropic non-tilted Dirac cones. The longitudinal conductivity and Hall conductivity are evaluated by using linear response theory in low temperature regime. An analytical approximate form of the longitudinal conductivity is also obtained. It is observed that the tilting of the Dirac cones amplifies the frequency of the longitudinal conductivity oscillation (Shubnikov-de Haas). On the other hand, the Hall conductivity exhibits graphene-like plateaus except the appearance of valley dependent steps which are purely attributed to the Hall field induced lifting of the valley degeneracy in the Landau levels. Finally we look into the different cases when the Hall field is applied to the strained borophene and find that valley dependency is fully dominated by strain rather than Hall field. Another noticeable point is that if the real magnetic field is replaced by the strain induced pseudo magnetic field then the electric field looses its ability to cause valley polarized transport.",3
Two-dimensional Dirac nodal loop magnons in collinear antiferromagnets.,"We study the nontrivial linear magnon band crossings in the collinear antiferromagnets on the two-dimensional (2D) CaVO lattice, also realized in some iron-based superconductors such as AFe1.6+x Se2 (A = K, Rb, Cs). It is shown that the combination of space-inversion and time-reversal symmetry ([Formula: see text] symmetry) leads to doubly-degenerate eight magnon branches, which cross each other linearly along a one-dimensional loop in the 2D Brillouin zone. We show that the Dirac nodal loops (DNLs) are not present in the collinear ferromagnet on this lattice. Thus, the current 2D antiferromagnetic DNLs are symmetry-protected and they provide a novel platform to search for their analogs in 2D electronic antiferromagnetic systems.",3
Continuous vibronic symmetries in Jahn-Teller models.,"Explorations of the consequences of the Jahn-Teller (JT) effect remain active in solid-state and chemical physics. In this topical review we revisit the class of JT models which exhibit continuous vibronic symmetries. A treatment of these systems is given in terms of their algebraic properties. In particular, the compact symmetric spaces corresponding to JT models carrying a vibronic Lie group action are identified, and their invariants used to reduce their adiabatic potential energy surfaces into orbit spaces of the corresponding Lie groups. Additionally, a general decomposition of the molecular motion into pseudorotational and radial components is given based on the behavior of the electronic adiabatic states under the corresponding motions. We also provide a simple proof that the electronic spectrum for the space of JT minimum-energy structures (trough) displays a universality predicted by the epikernel principle. This result is in turn used to prove the topological equivalence between bosonic (fermionic) JT troughs and real (quaternionic) projective spaces. The relevance of the class of systems studied here for the more common case of JT systems with only discrete point group symmetry, and for generic asymmetric molecular systems with conical intersections involving more than two states is likewise explored. Finally, we show that JT models with continuous symmetries present the simplest models of conical intersections among an arbitrary number of electronic state crossings, and outline how this information may be utilized to obtain additional insight into generic dynamics near conical intersections.",3
Sticking of atomic hydrogen on graphene.,"Recent years have witnessed an ever growing interest in the interactions between hydrogen atoms and a graphene sheet. Largely motivated by the possibility of modulating the electric, optical and magnetic properties of graphene, a huge number of studies have appeared recently that added to and enlarged earlier investigations on graphite and other carbon materials. In this review we give a glimpse of the many facets of this adsorption process, as they emerged from these studies. The focus is on those issues that have been addressed in detail, under carefully controlled conditions, with an emphasis on the interplay between the adatom structures, their formation dynamics and the electric, magnetic and chemical properties of the carbon sheet.",3
Flexible modulation of electronic and magnetic properties of zigzag H-MoS2 nanoribbons by crack defects.,"The effects of crack defects on electronic and magnetic properties of zigzag MoS2 nanoribbons are investigated systematically by first-principles calculations based on spin-polarized density functional theory. We find that not only the electronic and spin transport ability of zigzag MoS2 nanoribbons can be enhanced significantly by the armchair crack defects, but also their magnetism could be modulated flexibly by crack defects. Our study suggests that the introduction of crack defect is a feasible way to modulate the electronic and magnetic properties of zigzag MoS2 nanoribbons. We further propose that the crack defects may also provide a useful tool for improving the performance of devices.",3
A polynomial Ansatz for norm-conserving pseudopotentials.,"We show that efficient norm-conserving pseudopotentials for electronic structure calculations can be obtained from a polynomial Ansatz for the potential. Our pseudopotential is a polynomial of degree ten in the radial variable and fulfils the same smoothness conditions imposed by the Troullier-Martins method (TM) (1991 Phys. Rev. B 43 1993) where pseudopotentials are represented by a polynomial of degree twenty-two. We compare our method to the TM approach in electronic structure calculations for diamond and iron in the bcc structure and find that the two methods perform equally well in calculations of the total energy. However, first and second derivatives of the total energy with respect to atomic coordinates converge significantly faster with the plane wave cutoff if the standard TM potentials are replaced by the pseudopotentials introduced here.",3
Inherent orbital spin textures in Rashba effect and their implications in spin-orbitronics.,"The Rashba effect gives rise to the key feature of chiral spin texture. Recently it was demonstrated that the orbital angular momentum (OAM) texture forms the underlying basis for Rashba spin texture. Here we solve a model Hamiltonian of a generic p-orbital system in the presence of crystal field, internal spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and inversion symmetry breaking (ISB), and demonstrate, in addition to OAM and spin texture, the existence of orbital projection (OP) of the spin texture in a general Rashba system. The unique form of the OP pattern follows from the same condition for the existence of chirality of the spin texture. From the analytical results, we obtained the spin polarization as a function of parameters such as the SOC strength, crystal field splitting and degree of ISB, and compare them with those from numerical solutions and ab initio calculations. All three methods yield highly consistent results. Our results suggest means of external modulation, and elucidate the multi-orbital nature of the Rashba effect and the underlying OP of the spin texture. The understanding has potential applications in fields such as spin-orbitronics that requires delicate control between orbital occupancy and spin momentum.",3
Phase difference dependence of output power in synchronized stacked spin Hall nano-oscillators.,"Synchronization between stacked spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNO), attributed to the spin Hall effect and anisotropic magnetoresistance effect, was studied by numerical calculations. In order to obtain the synchronized state of the SHNOs, we considered the magneto-dipolar field, which was calculated in the rectangular prism. We revealed that the output power depended on the distance between the SHNOs, as the phase difference between the SHNOs depended on the coupling strength. For N = 3 (number of SHNOs), we investigated the phase difference by considering the influence of the coupling strength of all magnetic layers. Furthermore, we observed that the output power increased with the number of SHNOs in the synchronization system.",3
On-demand electron source with tunable energy distribution.,"We propose a scheme to manipulate the electron-hole excitation in the voltage pulse electron source, which can be realized by a voltage-driven Ohmic contact connecting to a quantum hall edge channel. It has been known that the electron-hole excitation can be suppressed via Lorentzian pulses, leading to noiseless electron current. We show that, instead of the Lorentzian pulses, driven via the voltage pulse [Formula: see text] with duration t 0, the electron-hole excitation can be tuned so that the corresponding energy distribution of the emitted electrons follows the Fermi distribution with temperature [Formula: see text], with T S being the electron temperature in the Ohmic contact. Such Fermi distribution can be established without introducing additional energy relaxation mechanism and can be detected via shot noise thermometry technique, making it helpful in the study of thermal transport and decoherence in mesoscopic system.",3
An efficient mechanism for enhancing the thermoelectricity of nanoribbons by blocking phonon transport in 2D materials.,"Inspired by the novel mechanism of reducing thermal conductivity by local phonon resonance instead of by inducing structural defects, we investigate the effect of side branching on the thermoelectric properties of [Formula: see text] nanoribbons, and prove that side branching is a highly efficient mechanism for enhancing the thermoelectricity of different kinds of nanoribbons. For both armchair and zigzag [Formula: see text] nanoribbons, the side branches result in not only significant blocking of phonon transport but also notable increase of the Seebeck coefficient. Consequently, the thermoelectric figure of merit of the armchair [Formula: see text] nanoribbon is boosted from 0.72 to as high as 1.93, and the originally non-thermoelectric metallic zigzag [Formula: see text] nanoribbon is turned into a thermoelectric material due to the appearance of the band gap induced by the side branches. These results mean that the mechanism of branching is not only very efficient, but also takes effect regardless of the original properties of the nanoribbons, and thus will hold great promise for its application in the thermoelectric field.",3
Surface morphology of amorphous SiO2 substrates bombarded with 1.0 MeV Si(+) ions.,"Surface pattern formation on amorphous SiO2 substrates by implantation of 1.0 MeV Si(+) ions at a current of 1.3 microA at 70 degrees angle is reported. Surface micrometer sized ripples perpendicular to the ion beam direction are formed, observed by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The morphological features are more or less similar for different fluences. The formation of surface ripples at this energy is discussed in terms of ion stopping mechanisms and patterns obtained within the low- and medium-energy ranges.",3
"Proximity exchange induced gap opening and topological feature in graphene/1T'-MX2 (M = Mo,W; X = S,Se,Te) Dirac heterostructures.","By using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the influence of proximity effect on the band structures of heterostructures formed by graphene stacking on a two dimensional (2D) topological insulator (TI) 1T'-MX2. The interlayer distance d between graphene and TI decreases with the enhancement of the intrinsic lattice anisotropy of 1T'-MX2, which determines different strength of the interlayer proximity interaction. The bandgap can be opened by the proximity exchange. The weak anisotropic symmetry of heterostructure (large d) only results in a small band gap ( approximately 50 meV) in graphene/MoTe2. However, a large energy gap (up to approximately 200 meV) can be obtained in graphene/MoS2, which is attributed to the inter-intralayer charge transfer due to the strong proximity interaction of the hetero-interface (small d). In addition, the 1T'-MX2 of heterostructure still possesses the topological feature of Z 2 = 1, since the graphene has a negligible effect on the band structure of the system.",3
High resolution AFM studies of irradiated mica-following the traces of swift heavy ions under grazing incidence.,"High resolution AFM imaging of swift heavy ion irradiated muscovite mica under grazing incidence provides detailed insight into the created nanostructure features. Swift heavy ions under grazing incidence form a complex track structure along the surface, which consists of a double track of nanohillocks at the impact site accompanied by a single, several 100 nm long protrusion. Detailed track studies by varying the irradiation parameters, i.e. the angle of incidence (0.2 degrees -2 degrees ) and the kinetic energy of the impinging ions (23, 55, 75, 95 MeV) are presented. Moreover, the track formation in dependence of the sample temperature (between room temperature and 600 degrees C) and of the chemical composition (muscovite mica and fluorphlogopite mica) is studied.",3
Influence of temperature on the magnetic oscillations in graphene with spin splitting: a new approach.,"We analyze the magnetic oscillations (MO) due to the de Haas-van Alphen effect, in pristine graphene under a perpendicular magnetic field, taking into account the Zeeman effect. We consider a constant Fermi energy, such that the valence band is always full and only the conduction band is available. At zero temperature the MO consist of two sawtooth peaks, one for each spin. Both peaks have the same frequency, but different amplitude and phase. We show that, in order to observe the spin splitting in the MO, Fermi energy of about 0.1 eV is required. At low temperatures we obtain that the MO can be expressed as the MO at zero temperature, plus small Fermi-Dirac like functions, each centered around the MO peaks. Using this expression, we show that the spin splitting is observable in the MO only when the thermal energy is smaller than the Zeeman energy. We also analyze the shift of the MO extrema as the temperature increases. We show that it depends on the magnetic field, which implies a broken periodicity at nonzero temperature. Finally, we obtain an analytical expression for the MO envelope. The results obtained could be used to infer temperature changes from the MO extrema shift and vice versa.",3
Nanopatterning by ion beam sputtering in unconventional formats.,"Nanopatterning at solid surfaces by ion beam sputtering (IBS) has been practiced mostly for stationary substrates with an ion beam incident under a fixed sputter geometry. We have released such constraints in the sputter condition. We simultaneously apply two ion beams or sequentially vary the orientation of substrate with respect to an ion beam. We also periodically change either the azimuthal or polar angle of the substrate with respect to an ion beam during IBS. These unconventional ways of IBS can improve the order of the pattern, and produce novel and non trivial nano patterns that well serve as touch stones to refine the theoretical models and thus deepen our understanding of the patterning mechanisms by IBS.",3
"Suppression of ferromagnetic order by Ag-doping: a neutron scattering investigation on Ce2(Pd1-x Ag x )2In (x = 0.20, 0.50).","The ground state magnetic behaviour of Ce2(Pd0.8Ag0.2)2In and Ce2(Pd0.5Ag0.5)2In, found in the ferromagnetic branch of Ce2Pd2In, has been investigated by neutron powder diffraction at low temperature. Ce2(Pd0.8Ag0.2)2In is characterized by a ferromagnetic structure with the Ce moments aligned along the c-axis and values of 0.96(2) micro B. The compound retains the P4/mbm throughout the magnetic transition, although the magnetic ordering is accompanied by a significant decrease of the lattice strain along [0 0 l], suggesting a magnetostructural contribution. The magnetic behaviour of Ce2(Pd0.5Ag0.5)2In is very different; this compound exhibits an extremely reduced magnetic scattering contribution in the diffraction pattern, that can be ascribed to a different kind of ferromagnetic ordering, with extremely reduced magnetic moments (~0.1 micro B) aligned along [0 l 0]. These results point to a competition between different types of magnetic correlations induced by Ag-substitution, giving rise to a magnetically frustrated scenario in Ce2(Pd0.5Ag0.5)2In.",3
Comparative study of DFT+U functionals for non-collinear magnetism.,"We performed comparative analysis for DFT+U functionals to better understand their applicability to non-collinear magnetism. Taking LiNiPO4 and Sr2IrO4 as examples, we investigated the results out of two formalisms based on charge-only density and spin density functional plus U calculations. Our results show that the ground state spin order in terms of tilting angle is strongly dependent on Hund J. In particular, the opposite behavior of canting angles as a function of J is found for LiNiPO4. The dependence on the other physical parameters such as Hubbard U and Slater parameterization [Formula: see text] is investigated. We also discuss the formal aspects of these functional dependences as well as parameter dependences. The current study provides useful information and important intuition for the first-principles calculation of non-collinear magnetic materials.",3
Theory of pore-driven and end-pulled polymer translocation dynamics through a nanopore: an overview.,"We review recent progress on the theory of dynamics of polymer translocation through a nanopore based on the iso-flux tension propagation (IFTP) theory. We investigate both pore-driven translocation of flexible and a semi-flexible polymers, and the end-pulled case of flexible chains by means of the IFTP theory and extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The validity of the IFTP theory can be quantified by the waiting time distributions of the monomers which reveal the details of the dynamics of the translocation process. The IFTP theory allows a parameter-free description of the translocation process and can be used to derive exact analytic scaling forms in the appropriate limits, including the influence due to the pore friction that appears as a finite-size correction to asymptotic scaling. We show that in the case of pore-driven semi-flexible and end-pulled polymer chains the IFTP theory must be augmented with an explicit trans side friction term for a quantitative description of the translocation process.",3
The influence of the entry region on the instability of a coflowing injector device.,"The occurrence of dripping and jetting regimes in a microfluidic coflowing injector device has been related recently to the spatio-temporal stability properties of the developed velocity profile. Dripping corresponds to an absolutely unstable flow while jetting is observed when the Rayleigh-Plateau instability of the core-annular jet is convective. In this work we take into account the effect of the entry region on the dripping to jetting transition by carrying out a global stability analysis of the steady two-phase base flow. We show that, depending on the flow parameters, the entry region can affect significantly the transition between the two regimes.",3

Concurrent segregation and erosion effects in medium-energy iron beam patterning of silicon surfaces.,"We have bombarded crystalline silicon targets with a 40 keV Fe(+) ion beam at different incidence angles. The resulting surfaces have been characterized by atomic force, current-sensing and magnetic force microscopies, scanning electron microscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. We have found that there is a threshold angle smaller than 40 degrees for the formation of ripple patterns, which is definitely lower than those frequently reported for noble gas ion beams. We compare our observations with estimates of the value of the critical angle and of additional basic properties of the patterning process, which are based on a continuum model whose parameters are obtained from binary collision simulations. We have further studied experimentally the ripple structures and measured how the surface slopes change with the ion incidence angle. We explore in particular detail the fluence dependence of the pattern for an incidence angle value (40 degrees ) close to the threshold. Initially, rimmed holes appear randomly scattered on the surface, which evolve into large, bug-like structures. Further increasing the ion fluence induces a smooth, rippled background morphology. By means of microscopy techniques, a correlation between the morphology of these structures and their metal content can be unambiguously established.",3
Magnetic field induced metal-insulator transition in single nodal ring topological semimetals.,"Our theoretical investigation indicates that an applied magnetic field can open a gap between the conduction and valence bands of a nodal line semimetal (NLSM), though it is a kind of gapless material in the absence of a magnetic field. The emerging bandgap depends sensitively on the strength and orientation of the magnetic field which implies a tunable and large anisotropy of magnetoresistance in such kinds of topological materials. Following such a theoretical finding, we predict that in some candidates of NSLMs with a single nodal ring, such as the materials of CaP3 family, a transition between metallic and insulating states driven by a magnetic field is possibly observed experimentally. Consequently, a magnetic field can be viewed as a novel mechanism for metal-insulator transition of solid materials, in additional to the well-known conventional ones such as the Anderson and Mott transitions.",3
Fabrication of ion bombardment induced rippled TiO2 surfaces to influence subsequent organic thin film growth.,"Control over organic thin film growth is a central issue in the development of organic electronics. The anisotropy and extended size of the molecular building blocks introduce a high degree of complexity within the formation of thin films. This complexity can be even increased for substrates with induced, sophisticated morphology and anisotropy. Thus, targeted structuring like ion beam mediated modification of substrates in order to create ripples, pyramids, or pit structures provides a further degree of freedom in manipulating the growth morphology of organic thin films. We provide a comprehensive review of recent work on para-hexaphenyl (C36H26, 6P) as a typical representative of the class of small, rod-like conjugated molecules and rutile TiO2(1 1 0) as an example for a transparent oxide electrode to demonstrate the effect of ion beam induced nanostructuring on organic thin film growth. Starting from molecular growth on smooth, atomically flat TiO2(1 1 0) (1 x 1) surfaces, we investigate the influence of the ripple size on the resulting 6P thin films. The achieved 6P morphologies are either crystalline nano-needles composed of flat lying molecules or islands consisting of upright standing 6P, which are elongated in ripple direction. The islands' length-to-width ratio can be controlled by tuning the ripples' shape.",3
"Surface terminations of hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) exposed to oxygen, hydrogen, or water: dependence on the density functional theory methodology.","Hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) is the most stable and abundant iron oxide in nature, and is used in many important environmental and industrial technologies, such as waste-water treatment, gas sensors, and photoelectrocatalysis. A clear understanding of the structure, composition, and chemistry of the hematite surface is crucial for improving its function in these technologies. Here we employ density functional theory (DFT) together with the DFT+U approach using semi-local functionals, as well as hybrid functionals, to study the structure, stability, and electronic properties of the (0 0 0 1) surface exposed to oxygen, hydrogen, or water. The use of hybrid functionals allow for a description of strong correlation without the need for atom-specific empirical parameters (i.e. U). However, we find that PBE+U, and in part also PBE, give similar results as the hybrid functional HSE(12%) in terms of structure optimization. When it comes to stability, work function, as well as electronic structure, the results are sensitive to the choice of functionals, but we cannot judge which level of functional is most appropriate due to the lack of experimental observations.",3
Rhombohedral R3c to orthorhombic Pnma phase transition induced by Y-doping in BiFeO3.,"In this work we study, by means of ab initio calculations, the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of Y-doped BiFeO3 compounds. We determine that there is a morphotropic phase boundary at an yttrium concentration of [Formula: see text], where the structure changes from R3c to Pnma. This structural transition is driven by the chemical pressure induced by the dopant. By analyzing the evolution of the oxygen octahedral tilts we find an enhanced antiferrodistortive distortion when increasing the Y-doping, together with a reduction of the ferroelectric distorsion, that gives rise to a smaller value of the electric polarization. These cooperative effects should lead to a larger canting of the Fe magnetic moments and to a larger ferromagnetic response in the R3c phase, as it is observed in the experiments.",3
The lower symmetry electron-density distribution and the charge transport anisotropy in cubic dodecaboride LuB12.,"High-quality single crystals of LuB12 are grown using the induction zone melting method. The x-ray data are collected at temperatures 293, 135, 95, 50 K. The crystal structure of LuB12 can be refined with record low R-factor in the cubic Fm [Formula: see text] m symmetry group despite reiterated observations of the cubic symmetry distortions both in the unit-cell values and in the physical properties. A peculiar computing strategy is developed to resolve this contradiction. True symmetry of the electron-density distribution in LuB12 is proved to be much lower than cubic as a result, which correlates very accurately with anisotropy of transport properties of LuB12.",3
In situ NAP-XPS spectroscopy during methane dry reforming on ZrO2/Pt(1 1 1) inverse model catalyst.,"Due to the need of sustainable energy sources, methane dry reforming is a useful reaction for conversion of the greenhouse gases CH4 and CO2 to synthesis gas (CO + H2). Syngas is the basis for a wide range of commodity chemicals and can be utilized for fuel production via Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The current study focuses on spectroscopic investigations of the surface and reaction properties of a ZrO2/Pt inverse model catalyst, i.e. ZrO2 particles (islands) grown on a Pt(1 1 1) single crystal, with emphasis on in situ near ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) during MDR reaction. In comparison to technological systems, model catalysts facilitate characterization of the surface (oxidation) state, surface adsorbates, and the role of the metal-support interface. Using XPS and infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy we demonstrated that under reducing conditions (UHV or CH4) the ZrO2 particles transformed to an ultrathin ZrO2 film that started to cover (wet) the Pt surface in an SMSI-like fashion, paralleled by a decrease in surface/interface oxygen. In contrast, (more oxidizing) dry reforming conditions with a 1:1 ratio of CH4 and CO2 were stabilizing the ZrO2 particles on the model catalyst surface (or were even reversing the strong metal support interaction (SMSI) effect), as revealed by in situ XPS. Carbon deposits resulting from CH4 dissociation were easily removed by CO2 or by switching to dry reforming conditions (673-873 K). Thus, at these temperatures the active Pt surface remained free of carbon deposits, also preserving the ZrO2/Pt interface.",3
Biophysics of membrane curvature remodeling at molecular and mesoscopic lengthscales.,"At the micron scale, where cell organelles display an amazing complexity in their shape and organization, the physical properties of a biological membrane can be better-understood using continuum models subject to thermal (stochastic) undulations. Yet, the chief orchestrators of these complex and intriguing shapes are a specialized class of membrane associating often peripheral proteins called curvature remodeling proteins (CRPs) that operate at the molecular level through specific protein-lipid interactions. We review multiscale methodologies to model these systems at the molecular as well as at the mesoscopic and cellular scales, and also present a free energy perspective of membrane remodeling through the organization and assembly of CRPs. We discuss the morphological space of nearly planar to highly curved membranes, methods to include thermal fluctuations, and review studies that model such proteins as curvature fields to describe the emergent curved morphologies. We also discuss several mesoscale models applied to a variety of cellular processes, where the phenomenological parameters (such as curvature field strength) are often mapped to models of real systems based on molecular simulations. Much insight can be gained from the calculation of free energies of membranes states with protein fields, which enable accurate mapping of the state and parameter values at which the membrane undergoes morphological transformations such as vesiculation or tubulation. By tuning the strength, anisotropy, and spatial organization of the curvature-field, one can generate a rich array of membrane morphologies that are highly relevant to shapes of several cellular organelles. We review applications of these models to budding of vesicles commonly seen in cellular signaling and trafficking processes such as clathrin mediated endocytosis, sorting by the ESCRT protein complexes, and cellular exocytosis regulated by the exocyst complex. We discuss future prospects where such models can be combined with other models for cytoskeletal assembly, and discuss their role in understanding the effects of cell membrane tension and the mechanics of the extracellular microenvironment on cellular processes.",3
Microscopic aspects of wetting using classical density functional theory.,"Wetting is a rather efficient mechanism for nucleation of a phase (typically liquid) on the interface between two other phases (typically solid and gas). In many experimentally accessible cases of wetting, the interplay between the substrate structure, and the fluid-fluid and fluid-substrate intermolecular interactions brings about an entire 'zoo' of possible fluid configurations, such as liquid films with a thickness of a few nanometers, liquid nanodrops and liquid bridges. These fluid configurations are often associated with phase transitions occurring at the solid-gas interface and at lengths of just several molecular diameters away from the substrate. In this special issue article, we demonstrate how a fully microscopic classical density-functional framework can be applied to the efficient, rational and systematic exploration of the rich phase space of wetting phenomena. We consider a number of model prototype systems such as wetting on a planar wall, a chemically patterned wall and a wedge. Through density-functional computations we demonstrate that for these simply structured substrates the behaviour of the solid-gas interface is already highly complex and non-trivial.",3
Crystal and magnetic structure of antiferromagnetic Mn2PtPd.,"We have investigated the crystal and magnetic structure of Mn2PtPd alloy using powder x-ray and neutron diffraction experiments. This compound is believed to belong to the Heusler family having crystal symmetry I4/mmm (TiAl3-type). However, in this work we found that the Pd and Pt atoms are disordered and thus Mn2PtPd crystallizes in the L10 structure having P4/mmm symmetry (CuAu-I type) like MnPt and MnPd binary alloys. The lattice constants are a = 2.86 A and c = 3.62 A at room temperature. Mn2PtPd has a collinear antiferromagnetic spin structure below the Neel temperature T N = 866 K, where Mn moments of ~4 micro B lie in the ab-plane. We observed a strong change in the lattice parameters near T N. The sample exhibits metallic behaviour, where electrical resistivity and carrier concentration are of the order of 10(-5) Omega cm and 10(21) cm(-3), respectively.",3
Shock synthesis and characterization of titanium dioxide with alpha-PbO2 structure.,"The phase transformation behavior of anatase and rutile titanium dioxide with particle sizes of 60 nm and 150 nm under shock compression have been investigated. To increase the shock pressure and reduce the shock temperature, copper powder and a small amount of paraffin were mixed with the TiO2 powder. The shock recovered samples were characterized by x-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscope. The results indicate that both anatase and rutile TiO2 can transform to alpha-PbO2 phase TiO2 through shock-induced phase transition. The transformation rate of alpha-PbO2 phase TiO2 for anatase TiO2 under shock compression is 100% and pure alpha-PbO2 phase TiO2 can be obtained, while the transformation rate for rutile TiO2 is over 90%. The influence of the particle size on the yield of alpha-PbO2 phase TiO2 is not noticeable. The thermal stability of the recovered pure alpha-PbO2 phase TiO2 was characterized by high temperature x-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. The results show that alpha-PbO2 phase TiO2 transforms to rutile TiO2 when heated to temperature higher than 560 degrees C. The mechanisms of the phase transition of TiO2 under shock compression are discussed.",3
Hot electron cooling in Dirac semimetal Cd3As2 due to polar optical phonons.,"A theory of hot electron cooling power due to polar optical phonons P op is developed in 3D Dirac semimetal (3DDS) Cd3As2 taking account of hot phonon effect. Hot phonon distribution N q and P op are investigated as a function of electron temperature T e, electron density n e, and phonon relaxation time [Formula: see text]. It is found that P op increases rapidly (slowly) with T e at lower (higher) temperature regime. Whereas, P op is weakly decreasing with increasing n e. The results are compared with those for three-dimensional electron gas (3DEG) in Cd3As2 semiconductor. Hot phonon effect is found to reduce P op considerably and it is stronger in 3DDS Cd3As2 than in Cd3As2 semiconductor. P op is also compared with the hot electron cooling power due to acoustic phonons P ac. We find that a crossover takes place from P ac dominated cooling at low T e to P op dominated cooling at higher T e. The temperature at which this crossover occurs shifts towards higher values with the increase of n e. Also, hot electron energy relaxation time [Formula: see text] is discussed. It is suggested that [Formula: see text] can be tuned to achieve faster or slower energy loss for suitable applications of Cd3As2.",3
"Anisotropic bulk and planar Heisenberg ferromagnets in uniform, arbitrarily oriented magnetic fields.","Today, further downscaling of mobile electronic devices poses serious problems, such as energy consumption and local heat dissipation. In this context, spin wave majority gates made of very thin ferromagnetic films may offer a viable alternative. However, similar downscaling of magnetic thin films eventually enforces the latter to operate as quasi-2D magnets, the magnetic properties of which are not yet fully understood, especially those related to anisotropies and external magnetic fields in arbitrary directions. To this end, we have investigated the behaviour of an easy-plane and easy-axis anisotropic ferromagnet-both in two and three dimensions-subjected to a uniform magnetic field, applied along an arbitrary direction. In this paper, a spin-[Formula: see text] Heisenberg Hamiltonian with anisotropic exchange interactions is solved using double-time temperature-dependent Green's functions and the Tyablikov decoupling approximation. We determine various magnetic properties such as the Curie temperature and the magnetization as a function of temperature and the applied magnetic field, discussing the impact of the system's dimensionality and the type of anisotropy. The magnetic reorientation transition taking place in anisotropic Heisenberg ferromagnets is studied in detail. Importantly, spontaneous magnetization is found to be absent for easy-plane 2D spin systems with short range interactions.",3
Strong antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling and superconducting properties: the case of noncentrosymmetric LaPtSi.,"In this work we aim to analyze the effect of a strong antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling (ASOC) on the superconductivity of noncentrosymmetric LaPtSi. We study the energy gap structure of polycrystalline LaPtSi by using magnetic penetration depth measurements down to 0.02T c. We observed a dirty s-wave behavior, which provides compelling evidence that the spin-singlet component of the mixed pairing state is highly dominant. This is consistent with previous results in the sense that the mere presence of a strong ASOC does not lead to unconventional behaviors. Our result also downplays LaPtSi as a good candidate for realizing time-reversal invariant topological superconductivity.",3
Bandgap and pseudohelicity effects over conductance in gapped graphene junctures.,"We study the conductance in gapped single-layer graphene junctures as a function of bangap, pseudohelicity and charge carriers density. To do it, we first calculate the transmission coefficients of massive charge carries for p-n and n-p-n junctures of gapped single-layer graphene. Next, we calculate the conductance for these two systems using the Landauer formula. Only for the p-n juncture case and non-zero bandgap values, we find the existence of a contribution to the conductance from pseudohelicity inversion states, which is small compared to the contribution from pseudohelicity conservation states. Also, we find for both type of junctures that there exists a window of charge carriers densities values where the conductance is zero (conductance gap), in such a way that the size of this window depends on the squared of the bandgap. We observe that the existence of a bandgap in the system leads to valley mixing and this fact could be useful for the future design of devices based on single-layer graphene.",3
Colloidal transport through trap arrays controlled by active microswimmers.,"We investigate the dynamics of a binary mixture consisting of active and passive colloidal particles diffusing in a 2D array of truncated harmonic wells, or traps. We explore the possibility of using a small fraction of active particles to manipulate a much larger fraction of passive particles, for instance, to confine them in or extract them from the traps. The results of our study have potential application in biology and medical sciences, for example, to remove dead cells or undesired contaminants from biological systems by means of self-propelled nano-robots.",3
Optically dark excitonic states mediated exciton and biexciton valley dynamics in monolayer WSe2.,"We present a theory to address the photoluminescence (PL) intensity and valley polarization (VP) dynamics in monolayer WSe2, under the impact of excitonic dark states of both excitons and biexcitons. We find that the PL intensity of all excitonic channels including intravalley exciton (Xb), intravalley biexciton (XXk,k) and intervalley biexciton (XX[Formula: see text]) in particular for the XXk,k PL is enhanced by laser excitation fluence. In addition, our results indicate the anomalous temperature dependence of PL, i.e. increasing with temperature, as a result of favored phonon assisted dark-to-bright scatterings at high temperatures. Moreover, we observe that the PL is almost immune to intervalley scatterings, which trigger the exchange of excitonic states between the two valleys. As far as the valley polarization is concerned, we find that the VP of Xb shrinks as temperature increases, exhibiting opposite temperature response to PL, while the intravalley XXk,k VP is found almost independent of temperature. In contrast to both Xb and XXk,k, the intervalley XX[Formula: see text] VP identically vanishes, because of equal populations of excitons in the K and [Formula: see text] valleys bounded to form intervalley biexcitons. Notably, it is found that the Xb VP much more strongly depends on bright-dark scattering than that of XXk,k, making dark state act as a robust reservoir for valley polarization against intervalley scatterings for Xb at strong bright-dark scatterings, but not for XXk,k. Dark excitonic states enabled enhancement of VP benefits quantum technology for information processing based on the valley degree of freedom in valleytronic devices. Furthermore, the VP has strong dependence on intervalley scattering but maintains essentially constant with excitation fluence. Finally, the dependence of time evolution of PL and VP on temperature and excitation fluence is discussed.",3
Broadband polarized emission from P(NDI2OD-T2) polymer.,"We investigate the P(NDI2OD-T2) photophysical properties via absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy, in association with the experimental approach baptized Stokes Spectroscopy, which provides valuable material information through the acquisition and analysis of the fluorescence polarization degree. By changing solvents and using different samples such as solutions, thick, and thin films, it is possible to control the polarization degree spectrum associated to the fluorescence emitted by the polymer's isolated chains and aggregates. We show that the polarization degree could become a powerful tool to obtain information related to the samples morphology, which is connected to their microscopic structure. Moreover, the polarization degree spectra suggest that depolarization effects linked to energy and charge transfer mechanisms are likely taking place. Our findings indicate that P(NDI2OD-T2) polymers are excellent candidates for the advancement of organic technologies that rely on the emission and detection of polarized lights.",3
Competing spin fluctuations and trace of vortex dynamics in the two-dimensional triangular-lattice antiferromagnet AgCrS2.,"The spin dynamics of the two-dimensional triangular-lattice antiferromagnet AgCrS2 is investigated by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. The g-factor is found to show an unusual non-monotonously temperature dependent behavior, which, along with the super-Curie behavior observed in the ESR intensity data, provides clear evidence for the competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic fluctuations at temperatures well above T N. On approaching the Neel temperature T N from above, the linewidth is found to diverge. Such a divergent behavior could be well described by the Kawamura-Miyashita model due to Z2 type magnetic vortex-antivortex pairing, which is consistent with the expectation for a 2D Heisenberg magnetic system.",3
Generalisation of Gilbert damping and magnetic inertia parameter as a series of higher-order relativistic terms.,"The phenomenological Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation of motion remains as the cornerstone of contemporary magnetisation dynamics studies, wherein the Gilbert damping parameter has been attributed to first-order relativistic effects. To include magnetic inertial effects the LLG equation has previously been extended with a supplemental inertia term; the arising inertial dynamics has been related to second-order relativistic effects. Here we start from the relativistic Dirac equation and, performing a Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation, derive a generalised Pauli spin Hamiltonian that contains relativistic correction terms to any higher order. Using the Heisenberg equation of spin motion we derive general relativistic expressions for the tensorial Gilbert damping and magnetic inertia parameters, and show that these tensors can be expressed as series of higher-order relativistic correction terms. We further show that, in the case of a harmonic external driving field, these series can be summed and we provide closed analytical expressions for the Gilbert and inertial parameters that are functions of the frequency of the driving field.",3
III-V heterostructure tunnel field-effect transistor.,"The tunnel field-effect transistor (TFET) is regarded as one of the most promising solid-state switches to overcome the power dissipation challenge in ultra-low power integrated circuits. TFETs take advantage of quantum mechanical tunneling hence exploit a different current control mechanism compared to standard MOSFETs. In this review, we describe state-of-the-art development of TFET both in terms of performances and of materials integration and we identify the main remaining technological challenges such as heterojunction defects and oxide/channel interface traps causing trap-assisted-tunneling (TAT). Mesa-structures, planar as well as vertical geometries are examined. Conductance slope analysis on InAs/GaSb nanowire tunnel diodes are reported, these two-terminal measurements can be relevant to investigate the tunneling behavior. A special focus is dedicated to III-V heterostructure TFET, as different groups have recently shown encouraging results achieving the predicted sub-thermionic low-voltage operation.",3
Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in p and n-type topological insulator (Bi x Sb1-x )2Te3.,"We show Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations in topological insulator (Bi x Sb1-x )2Te3 flakes whose carrier types are p-type (x = 0.29, 0.34) and n-type (x = 0.42). The physical properties such as the Berry phase, carrier mobility, and scattering time significantly changed by tuning the Fermi-level position with the concentration x. The analyses of SdH oscillations by Landau-level fan diagram, Lifshitz-Kosevich theory, and Dingle-plot in the p-type samples with x = 0.29 and 0.34 showed the Berry phase of zero and a relatively low mobility (2000-6000 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1)). This is due to the dominant bulk component in transport. On the other hand, the mobility in the n-type sample with x = 0.42 reached a very large value ~17 000 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) and the Berry phase of near pi, whereas the SdH oscillations were neither purely two- nor three-dimensional. These suggest that the transport channel has a surface-bulk coupling state which makes the carrier scattering lesser and enhances the mobility and has a character between two- and three-dimension.",3
I-V characteristics of graphene nanoribbon/h-BN heterojunctions and resonant tunneling.,"We present the first principle calculations of the electrical properties of graphene sheet/h-BN heterojunction (GS/h-BN) and 11-armchair graphene nanoribbon/h-BN heterojunction (11-AGNR/h-BN), which are carried out using the density functional theory (DFT) method and the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) technique. Since 11-AGNR belongs to the conductive (3n-1)-family of AGNR, both are metallic nanomaterials with two transverse arrays of h-BN, which is a wide-gap semi-conductor. The two h-BN arrays act as double barriers. The transmission functions (TF) and I-[Formula: see text] characteristics of GS/h-BN and 11-AGNR/h-BN are calculated by DFT and NEGF, and they show that quantum double barrier tunneling occurs. The TF becomes very spiky in both materials, and it leads to step-wise I-[Formula: see text] characteristics rather than negative resistance, which is the typical behavior of double barriers in semiconductors. The results of our first principle calculations are also compared with 1D Dirac equation model for the double barrier system. The model explains most of the peaks of the transmission functions nearby the Fermi energy quite well. They are due to quantum tunneling.",3
Viral nanomechanics with a virtual atomic force microscope.,"One of the most important components of a virus is the protein shell or capsid that encloses its genetic material. The main role of the capsid is to protect the viral genome against external aggressions, facilitating its safe and efficient encapsulation and delivery. As a consequence, viral capsids have developed astonishing mechanical properties that are crucial for viral function. These remarkable properties have started to be unveiled in single-virus nanoindentation experiments, and are opening the door to the use of viral-derived artificial nanocages for promising bio- and nano-technological applications. However, the interpretation of nanoindentation experiments is often difficult, requiring the support of theoretical and simulation analysis. Here we present a 'Virtual AFM' (VAFM), a Brownian Dynamics simulation of a coarse-grained model of virus aimed to mimic the standard setup of atomic force microscopy (AFM) nanoindentation experiments. Despite the heavy level of coarse-graining, these simulations provide valuable information which is not accessible in experiments. Rather than focusing on a specific virus, the VAFM will be used to analyze how the mechanical response and breaking of viruses depend on different parameters controlling the effective interactions between capsid's structural units. In particular, we will discuss the influence of adsorption, the tip radius, and the rigidity and shape of the shell on its mechanical response.",3
Finite-temperature stress calculations in atomic models using moments of position.,"Continuum modeling of finite temperature mechanical behavior of atomic systems requires refined description of atomic motions. In this paper, we identify additional kinematical quantities that are relevant for a more accurate continuum description as the system is subjected to step-wise loading. The presented formalism avoids the necessity for atomic trajectory mapping with deformation, provides the definitions of the kinematic variables and their conjugates in real space, and simplifies local work conjugacy. The total work done on an atom under deformation is decomposed into the work corresponding to changing its equilibrium position and work corresponding to changing its second moment about equilibrium position. Correspondingly, we define two kinematic variables: a deformation gradient tensor and a vibration tensor, and derive their stress conjugates, termed here as static and vibration stresses, respectively. The proposed approach is validated using MD simulation in NVT ensembles for fcc aluminum subjected to uniaxial extension. The observed evolution of second moments in the MD simulation with macroscopic deformation is not directly related to the transformation of atomic trajectories through the deformation gradient using generator functions. However, it is noteworthy that deformation leads to a change in the second moment of the trajectories. Correspondingly, the vibration part of the Piola stress becomes particularly significant at high temperature and high tensile strain as the crystal approaches the softening limit. In contrast to the eigenvectors of the deformation gradient, the eigenvectors of the vibration tensor show strong spatial heterogeneity in the vicinity of softening. More importantly, the elliptic distribution of local atomic density transitions to a dumbbell shape, before significant non-affinity in equilibrium positions has occurred.",3
n-type Rashba spin splitting in a bilayer inorganic halide perovskite with external electric field.,"Here, we investigated the Rashba effect of the CsPbBr3 bilayers under the external electric field (EEF) with first-principles calculations. For the PbBr2 terminated bilayer, we found that only electrons experience the Rashba splitting under EEF, while holes do not. Such an n-type Rashba effect can be ascribed to the surface relaxation effect that reverses the positions of the top valence bands. The n-type Rashba parameter can be tuned monotonically to the maximum of 0.88 eV A at EEF of 1.35 V nm(-1) at which the sequence of top valence bands recover to the bulk style. During this process the p-type spins will not survive in this 2D CsPbBr3, that indeed reveals a new way for making advanced functional spintronic devices.",3
Rapid freezing of water under dynamic compression.,"Understanding the behavior of materials at extreme pressures is a central issue in fields like aerodynamics, astronomy, and geology, as well as for advancing technological grand challenges such as inertial confinement fusion. Dynamic compression experiments to probe high-pressure states often encounter rapid phase transitions that may cause the materials to behave in unexpected ways, and understanding the kinetics of these phase transitions remains an area of great interest. In this review, we examine experimental and theoretical/computational efforts to study the freezing kinetics of water to a high-pressure solid phase known as ice VII. We first present a detailed analysis of dynamic compression experiments in which water has been observed to freeze on sub-microsecond time scales to ice VII. This is followed by a discussion of the limitations of currently available molecular and continuum simulation methods in modeling these experiments. We then describe how our phase transition kinetics models, which are based on classical nucleation theory, provide a more physics-based framework that overcomes some of these limitations. Finally, we give suggestions on future experimental and modeling work on the liquid-ice VII transition, including an outline of the development of a predictive multiscale model in which molecular and continuum simulations are intimately coupled.",3
Density anomaly of water at negative pressures from first principles.,"Using molecular dynamics simulations based on ab initio trained high-dimensional neural network potentials, we study the equation of state of liquid water at negative pressures. From density isobars computed for various pressures down to p = -230 MPa we determine the line of density maxima for two potentials based on the BLYP and the RPBE functionals, respectively. In both cases, dispersion corrections are included to account for non-local long-range correlations that give rise to van der Waals forces. We have followed the density maximum down to negative pressures close to the spinodal instability. For both functionals, the temperature of maximum density increases with decreasing pressure under moderate stretching, but changes slope at [Formula: see text] MPa and [Formula: see text] MPa for BLYP and RPBE, respectively. Our calculations confirm qualitatively the retracing shape of the line of density maxima found for empirical water models, indicating that the spinodal line maintains a positive slope even at strongly negative pressures.",3
Surface morphology of molybdenum silicide films upon low-energy ion beam sputtering.,"The surface morphology of molybdenum silicide (Mo x Si1-x ) films has been studied after low-energy Ar(+) ion beam sputtering (IBS) to explore eventual pattern formation on compound targets and, simultaneously, gather information about the mechanisms behind silicide-assisted nanopatterning of silicon surfaces by IBS. For this purpose, Mo x Si1-x films with compositions below, equal and above the MoSi2 stoichiometry (x = 0.33) have been produced by magnetron sputtering, as assessed by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS). The surface morphology of silicon and silicide films before and after IBS has been imaged by atomic force microscopy (AFM), comprising conditions where typical nanodot or ripple patterns emerge on the former. In the case of irradiated Mo x Si1-x surfaces, AFM shows a marked surface smoothing at normal incidence with and without additional Mo incorporation (the former results in nanodot patterns on Si). The morphological analysis also provides no evidence of ion-induced phase separation in irradiated Mo x Si1-x . Contrary to silicon, Mo x Si1-x surfaces also do not display ripple formation for (impurity free) oblique irradiations, except at grazing incidence conditions where parallel ripples emerge in a more evident fashion than in the Si counterpart. By means of RBS, irradiated Mo x Si1-x films with 1 keV Ar(+) at normal incidence have also been used to measure experimentally the (absolute) sputtering yield and rate of Si and Mo x Si1-x materials. The analysis reveals that, under the present working conditions, the erosion rate of silicides is larger than for silicon, supporting simulations from the TRIDYN code. This finding questions the shielding effect from silicide regions as roughening mechanism in metal-assisted nanopatterning of silicon. On the contrary, the results highlight the relevance of in situ silicide formation. Ripple formation on Mo x Si1-x under grazing incidence is also attributed to the dominance of sputtering effects under this geometry. In conclusion, our work provides some insights into the complex morphological evolution of compound surfaces and solid experimental evidences regarding the mechanisms behind silicide-assisted nanopatterning.",3
Scaling analysis of the non-Abelian quasiparticle tunneling in [Formula: see text] FQH states.,"Quasiparticle tunneling between two counter propagating edges through point contacts could provide information on its statistics. Previous study of the short distance tunneling displays a scaling behavior, especially in the conformal limit with zero tunneling distance. The scaling exponents for the non-Abelian quasiparticle tunneling exhibit some non-trivial behaviors. In this work, we revisit the quasiparticle tunneling amplitudes and their scaling behavior in a full range of the tunneling distance by putting the electrons on the surface of a cylinder. The edge-edge distance can be smoothly tuned by varying the aspect ratio for a finite size cylinder. We analyze the scaling behavior of the quasiparticles for the Read-Rezayi [Formula: see text] states for [Formula: see text] and 4 both in the short and long tunneling distance region. The finite size scaling analysis automatically gives us a critical length scale where the anomalous correction appears. We demonstrate this length scale is related to the size of the quasiparticle at which the backscattering between two counter propagating edges starts to be significant.",3
Evidence and evolution of magnetic polaron in HgCr2Se4 investigated by electron spin resonance.,"The evidence and evolution of magnetic polarons (MPs) in HgCr2Se4 have been studied by electron spin resonance (ESR), magnetism and conductivity measurements in a temperature range of 5-300 K. A single paramagnetic resonance line is observed in the high-temperature range while multiple resonance lines appear in the low-temperature range. As temperature decreases, the peak-to-peak linewidth DeltaH pp shows a minimum at T min approximately 210 K, with the activation energy fitted by small polaron hopping model consistent with the bottleneck mechanism, providing an evidence for existence of small MPs above T min. The analysis of the temperature dependence of DeltaH pp, double integrated intensity I, and g factor of ESR signals, combined with the temperature dependence of magnetization and conductivity, reveals an evolution process from small MPs at zone I (T > T min) to correlated MPs at zone II (T c < T (*) T T min) in the paramagnetic regime. Three critical temperatures, T min ( approximately 210 K), T th ( approximately 175 K), and T (*) ( approximately 121 K), which determine the evolution characteristics of MPs, are distinguished. The magnetic correlation length xi of Cr(3+)-Se(2-)-Cr(3+) should account for the evolution of MPs.",3
Two dimensional self-assembly zinc porphyrin and zinc phthalocyanine heterojunctions with record high power conversion efficiencies.,"Compared to inorganic solar cells, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells are much lower, but they are compensated by many merits such as lower cost, less weight, and tunable structures, making them prospective for further applications. Porphyrin and phthalocyanine are the two most significant materials for organic solar cells due to their strong light-absorbing properties and semiconductor characteristics. However, there is little research on the 2D heterojunction solar cells based on these two materials, meanwhile the PCEs of them are still low. Here we have self-assembled several 2D zinc porphyrins (ZnPors) and performed first-principles simulation to demonstrate their good stability, suitable light harvesting, and high charge carrier mobility. By perfectly matching lattice constants and molecular energy levels between those 2D ZnPors and our previous proposed zinc phthalocyanines (ZnPcs), 11 type-II organic heterojunctions are constructed to further improve their charge separation capability. Those advantages endow 2D ZnPors and ZnPcs appreciable PCEs for solar cells. Among them, the theoretical PCE of 2D ZnPors/ZnPcs heterojunctions achieves as high as 19.84%, which exceeds all reported organic solar cells, and even approaches the PCEs of inorganic solar cells. These results indicate that our 2D ZnPors and 2D ZnPcs are good candidate materials for future organic solar cells.",3
Low-bias negative differential resistance in junction of a benzene between zigzag-edged phosphorene nanoribbons.,"We study the electron transport properties through the junction of a benzene molecule in conjunction with two monolayer zigzag-edged phosphorene nanoribbon (ZPNR) electrodes by applying the nonequilibrium Green's functions in combination with the density functional theory. We find that the molecular junction with two phosphorus-carbon bonds exhibits an interesting low-bias negative differential resistance effect with a peak-to-valley ratio of 29, which originates from the edge states in ZPNR due to the anisotropic band structure of phosphorene. Importantly, the performance of the junction can be tuned via the molecule-ZPNR interface bonding. The findings may be useful in sensitive-device applications. Furthermore, the physical mechanisms are revealed and discussed in terms of the electronic transmission spectrum, the evolution of the frontier molecular orbitals, the local device density of states around the Fermi level, and the projected density of states.",3
Collective excitations in Weyl semimetals in the hydrodynamic regime.,"The spectrum of collective excitations in Weyl materials is studied by using consistent hydrodynamics. The corresponding framework includes the vortical and chiral anomaly effects, as well as the dependence on the separations between the Weyl nodes in energy b 0 and momentum [Formula: see text]. The latter are introduced via the Chern-Simons contributions to the electric current and charge densities in Maxwell's equations. It is found that, even in the absence of a background magnetic field, certain collective excitations (e.g. the helicon-like modes and the anomalous Hall waves) are strongly affected by the chiral shift [Formula: see text]. In a background magnetic field, the existence of the distinctive longitudinal and transverse anomalous Hall waves with a linear dispersion relation is predicted. They originate from the oscillations of the electric charge density and electromagnetic fields, in which different components of the fields are connected via the anomalous Hall effect in Weyl semimetals.",3
Simple and efficient LCAO basis sets for the diffuse states in carbon nanostructures.,"We present a simple way to describe the lowest unoccupied diffuse states in carbon nanostructures in density functional theory calculations using a minimal LCAO (linear combination of atomic orbitals) basis set. By comparing plane wave basis calculations, we show how these states can be captured by adding long-range orbitals to the standard LCAO basis sets for the extreme cases of planar sp (2) (graphene) and curved carbon (C60). In particular, using Bessel functions with a long range as additional basis functions retain a minimal basis size. This provides a smaller and simpler atom-centered basis set compared to the standard pseudo-atomic orbitals (PAOs) with multiple polarization orbitals or by adding non-atom-centered states to the basis.",3
Anomalous mobility of a driven active particle in a steady laminar flow.,"We study, via extensive numerical simulations, the force-velocity curve of an active particle advected by a steady laminar flow, in the nonlinear response regime. Our model for an active particle relies on a colored noise term that mimics its persistent motion over a time scale [Formula: see text]. We find that the active particle dynamics shows non-trivial effects, such as negative differential and absolute mobility (NDM and ANM, respectively). We explore the space of the model parameters and compare the observed behaviors with those obtained for a passive particle ([Formula: see text]) advected by the same laminar flow. Our results show that the phenomena of NDM and ANM are quite robust with respect to the details of the considered noise: in particular for finite [Formula: see text] a more complex force-velocity relation can be observed.",3
Growth of two-dimensional decagonal colloidal quasicrystals.,"The growth of quasicrystals, i.e. structures with long-range positional order but no periodic translational symmetry, is more complex than the growth of periodic crystals. By employing Brownian dynamics simulations in two dimensions for colloidal particles that interact according to an isotropic pair potential with two incommensurate lengths, we study the growth of quasicrystalline structures by sequentially depositing particles at their surface. We quantify the occurrence of quasicrystalline order as a function of the temperature and the rate of added particles. In addition, we explore defects like local triangular order or gaps within the quasicrystalline structure. Furthermore, we analyze the shapes of the surfaces in grown structures which tend to build straight lines along the symmetry axes of the quasicrystal. Finally, we identify phasonic flips which are rearrangements of the particles due to additional degrees of freedom. The number of phasonic flips decreases with the distance to the surface.",3
Human Brain Organoids on a Chip Reveal the Physics of Folding.,"Human brain wrinkling has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders and yet its origins remain unknown. Polymer gel models suggest that wrinkling emerges spontaneously due to compression forces arising during differential swelling, but these ideas have not been tested in a living system. Here, we report the appearance of surface wrinkles during the in vitro development and self-organization of human brain organoids in a micro-fabricated compartment that supports in situ imaging over a timescale of weeks. We observe the emergence of convolutions at a critical cell density and maximal nuclear strain, which are indicative of a mechanical instability. We identify two opposing forces contributing to differential growth: cytoskeletal contraction at the organoid core and cell-cycle-dependent nuclear expansion at the organoid perimeter. The wrinkling wavelength exhibits linear scaling with tissue thickness, consistent with balanced bending and stretching energies. Lissencephalic (smooth brain) organoids display reduced convolutions, modified scaling and a reduced elastic modulus. Although the mechanism here does not include the neuronal migration seen in in vivo, it models the physics of the folding brain remarkably well. Our on-chip approach offers a means for studying the emergent properties of organoid development, with implications for the embryonic human brain.",3
"Structural, electronic and vibrational properties of LaF3 according to density functional theory and Raman spectroscopy.","Crystal structure of LaF3 single crystal is refined in tysonite-type trigonal unit cell P [Formula: see text] c1 using density functional theory calculations and Raman spectroscopy. It is shown that trigonal structure with P [Formula: see text] c1 space group is more energy-efficient than hexagonal structure with space group P63 cm. Simulated Raman spectra obtained using LDA approximation is in much better agreement with experimental data than that obtained with PBE and PBEsol functionals of GGA. The calculated frequency value of silent mode B 2 in case of hexagonal structure P63 cm was found to be imaginary (unstable mode), thus the energy surface obtains negative curvature with respect to the corresponding normal coordinates of the mode which leads to instability of the hexagonal structure in harmonic approximation. The A 1g line at 214 cm(-1) in Raman spectra of LaF3 related to the translation of F2 ions along c axis can be connected with F2 ionic conductivity.",3
Absence of 2.5 power law for fractal packing in metallic glasses.,"Atomic packing is still a mystery for topologically disordered amorphous solids owing primarily to the absence of Bragg diffraction in this class of materials. Among many hypotheses, fractal packing is suggested based on a scaling relation with '2.5 power law' found in multicomponent metallic glasses. Here we examine the atomic packing critically in a pure Tantalum metallic glass under hydrostatic pressure. Without complications of chemical compositions as in the multicomponent systems, the genuine amorphous structure along in the single component metallic glass exhibits a cubic scaling exponent that indicates absence of the 2.5 power law. However, fractal-like short- and medium-range icosahedral cluster packing is observed; but these substructures do not contribute to the fractal dimension through the power law scaling.",3
Effect of (1 1 1)-oriented strain on the structure and magnetic properties of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 thin films.,"Using strain, i.e. subtle changes in lattice constant in a thin film induced by the underlying substrate, opens up intriguing new ways to control material properties. We present a study of the effects of strain on structural and ferromagnetic properties of (1 1 1)pc-oriented La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 epitaxial thin films grown on NdGaO3, SrTiO3, and DyScO3 substrates. (The subscript pc denotes the pseudo-cubic symmetry.) The results show that La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 assumes a monoclinic unit cell on NdGaO3 and DyScO3 and a rhombohedral unit cell on SrTiO3. For La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 on NdGaO3 and DyScO3 a uniaxial magnetic anisotropy is found, while La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 on SrTiO3 is magnetically isotropic. The Neel model is used to explain the anisotropy of the thin films on NdGaO3 and SrTiO3, however, for La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 on DyScO3 the effect of octahedral rotations needs to be included through the single ion model. Through examination of the Curie temperature of the strained films we suggest that (1 1 1)-strain has a different effect on the Jahn-Teller splitting of e g and t 2g electron levels than what is seen in (0 0 1)pc-oriented La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 thin films.",3
Sawtooth structure formation under nonlinear-regime ion bombardment.,"Linear-regime Ar(+) bombardment of Si produces symmetrical ripple structures at ion incidence angles above 45 degrees measured off-normal (Madi 2009 J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 21). In the nonlinear regime, new behaviors emerge. In this paper, we present experimental results of ion bombardment that continues into the nonlinear regime until pattern saturation at multiple ion incidence angles, showing the evolution of their grazing incidence small-angle x-ray scattering (GISAXS) spectra as well as atomic force microscopy topographs of the final, saturated structures. Asymmetric structures emerge parallel to the direction of the projected ion beam on the sample surface, constituting a height asymmetry not found in the linear regime. We then present simulations of surface height evolution under ion bombardment using a nonlinear partial differential equation developed by Pearson and Bradley (2015 J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 27 015010). We present simulated GISAXS spectra from these simulations, as well as simulated scattering from a sawtooth structure using the FitGISAXS software package (Babonneau 2010 J. Appl. Crystallogr. 43 929-36), and compare the simulated spectra to those observed experimentally. We find that these simulations reproduce many features of the sawtooth structures, as well as the nearly-flat final GISAXS spectra observed experimentally perpendicular to the sawtooth structures. However, the model fails to reproduce the final GISAXS spectra observed parallel to the sawtooth structures.",3
State diagram of a three-sphere microswimmer in a channel.,"Geometric confinements are frequently encountered in soft matter systems and in particular significantly alter the dynamics of swimming microorganisms in viscous media. Surface-related effects on the motility of microswimmers can lead to important consequences in a large number of biological systems, such as biofilm formation, bacterial adhesion and microbial activity. On the basis of low-Reynolds-number hydrodynamics, we explore the state diagram of a three-sphere microswimmer under channel confinement in a slit geometry and fully characterize the swimming behavior and trajectories for neutral swimmers, puller- and pusher-type swimmers. While pushers always end up trapped at the channel walls, neutral swimmers and pullers may further perform a gliding motion and maintain a stable navigation along the channel. We find that the resulting dynamical system exhibits a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation in which swimming in the mid-plane becomes unstable beyond a transition channel height while two new stable limit cycles or fixed points that are symmetrically disposed with respect to the channel mid-height emerge. Additionally, we show that an accurate description of the averaged swimming velocity and rotation rate in a channel can be captured analytically using the method of hydrodynamic images, provided that the swimmer size is much smaller than the channel height.",3
First-principles study of strain-induced Jahn-Teller distortions in BaFeO3.,"The effect of epitaxial strain on structural, magnetic and electronic properties of BaFeO3 perovskite oxide are investigated from first principles calculations, using the density functional theory (DFT) plus the Hubbard approach (DFT+U) within the generalized gradient approximation. Hybrid functional calculations, based on mixed exact Hartree-Fock and DFT exchange energy functionals, are also performed. For the ground state calculations, the DFT+U is found more suitable to describe the half metallic and ferromagnetic state of cubic BaFeO3. Jahn-Teller distortions, oxygen octahedra rotations and charge orderings in BaFeO3 under biaxial strain are explored. The obtained results reveal that structural changes associated with Jahn-Teller distortions are induced under tensile biaxial strain while the oxygen octahedra rotations and breathing are unusually not observed. Then, the strained BaFeO3 is considered as a particular Jahn-Teller distorted perovskite with exceptional properties when compared to CaFeO3 and SrFeO3. These findings lead to a strain engineering of the JT distortions in BaFeO3, and thus for high fundamental and technological interests.",3
Metallic hydrogen.,"Hydrogen is the simplest and most abundant element in the Universe. There are two pathways for creating metallic hydrogen under high pressures. Over 80 years ago Wigner and Huntington predicted that if solid molecular hydrogen was sufficiently compressed in the T = 0 K limit, molecules would dissociate to form atomic metallic hydrogen (MH). We have observed this transition at a pressure of 4.95 megabars. MH in this form has probably never existed on Earth or in the Universe; it may be a room temperature superconductor and is predicted to be metastable. If metastable it will have an important technological impact. Liquid metallic hydrogen can also be produced at intermediate pressures and high temperatures and is believed to make up ~90% of the planet Jupiter. We have observed this liquid-liquid transition, also known as the plasma phase transition, at pressures of ~1-2 megabar and temperatures ~1000-2000 K. However, in this paper we shall focus on the Wigner-Huntington transition. We shall discuss the methods used to observe metallic hydrogen at extreme conditions of static pressure in the laboratory, extending our understanding of the phase diagram of the simplest atom in the periodic table.",3
Crystal field in NdPd5Al2 investigated by inelastic neutron scattering.,"We report on inelastic neutron scattering measurements of the antiferromagnetic NdPd5Al2 compound. NdPd5Al2 crystallizes in the tetragonal I4/mmm space group and exhibits a distinct uniaxial anisotropy due to crystal field effects. In this study, we have revealed the crystal field energy levels of NdPd5Al2 composed of five Kramers doublets. The corresponding four inelastic excitations are located at energies 3.0 meV, 7.4 meV, 8.6 meV and 17.1 meV. We additionally interpreted the neutron spectra within a crystal field model. It has been established that the crystal field parameters found by a Monte Carlo technique and the derived ground-state wavefunctions consisting primarily of the [Formula: see text] states reproduce correctly magnetic susceptibility data.",3
Peculiar phase diagram with isolated superconducting regions in ThFeAsN1-x O x.,"ThFeAsN1-x O x ([Formula: see text]) system with heavy electron doping has been studied by the measurements of x-ray diffraction, electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility and specific heat. The non-doped compound exhibits superconductivity at [Formula: see text] K, which is possibly due to an internal uniaxial chemical pressure that is manifested by the extremely small value of As height with respect to the Fe plane. With the oxygen substitution, the T c value decreases rapidly to below 2 K for [Formula: see text], and surprisingly, superconductivity re-appears in the range of [Formula: see text] with a maximum [Formula: see text] of 17.5 K at x = 0.3. For the normal-state resistivity, while the samples in intermediate non-superconducting interval exhibit Fermi liquid behavior, those in other regions show a non-Fermi-liquid behavior. The specific heat jump for the superconducting sample of x = 0.4 is [Formula: see text], which is discussed in terms of anisotropic superconducting gap. The peculiar phase diagram in ThFeAsN1-x O x presents additional ingredients for understanding the superconducting mechanism in iron-based superconductors.",3
Effects of temperature and void on the dynamics and microstructure of structural transition in single crystal iron.,"With classic molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the effects of temperature and void on the bcc to hcp/fcc structural transition in single crystal iron driven by 1D ([0 0 1]) and 3D (uniform) compressions. The results show that the pressure threshold does not reduce monotonously with temperature. The pressure threshold firstly increases and then decreases in the range of 60-360 K under 1D compression, while the variation trend is just opposite under 3D compression. As expected, the initial defect may lower the pressure threshold via heterogenous nucleation. This effect is found to be more distinct at lower temperature, and the heterogenous nucleation mainly results in hcp structure. Under the condition of strain constraint, the products of structural transition will respectively form flaky hcp twin structure ((1 0 0) or (0 1 0)) and lamellar structure ({1 1 0}) of mixed phases under 1D and 3D compressions. During the structural transition, we find the shear stress (1D compression) of hcp phase is always lower than that of bcc phase. The cold energy calculations indicate that the hcp phase is the most stable under high pressure. However, we observe the evident metastable state of bcc phase, whose energy will be much higher than both hcp and fcc phases, and then provides the possibility for the occurrence of fcc nucleation.",3
Superconductivity in solid benzene molecular crystal.,"Light-element compounds hold great promise of high critical temperature superconductivity judging from the theoretical perspective. A hydrogen-rich material, benzene, is such a kind of candidate but also an organic compound. A series of first-principles calculations are performed on the electronic structures, dynamics properties, and electron-phonon interactions of solid benzene at high pressures. Benzene is found to be dynamically stable in the pressure range of 180-200 GPa and to exhibit superconductivity with a maximum transition temperature of 20 K at 195 GPa. The phonon modes of carbon atoms are identified to mainly contribute to the electron-phonon interactions driving this superconductivity. The predicted superconductivity in this simplest pristine hydrocarbon shows a common feature in aromatic hydrocarbons and also makes it a bridge to organic and hydrogen-rich superconductors.",3
Coulomb interaction rules timescales in potassium ion channel tunneling.,"Assuming the selectivity filter of KcsA potassium ion channel may exhibit quantum coherence, we extend a previous model by Vaziri and Plenio (2010 New J. Phys. 12 085001) to take into account Coulomb repulsion between potassium ions. We show that typical ion transit timescales are determined by this interaction, which imposes optimal input/output parameter ranges. Also, as observed in other examples of quantum tunneling in biological systems, the addition of moderate noise helps coherent ion transport.",3
Tunable optical and excitonic properties of phosphorene via oxidation.,"The optical properties and excitonic wave function of phosphorene oxides (PO) are studied using the first principle many-body Green function and the Bethe-Salpeter equation formalism. In this work, the optical properties are determined using ab initio calculations of the dielectric function. At the long wavelength limit q [Formula: see text] of EM wave (i.e. [Formula: see text]), the dielectric function, the absorption spectrum, the lectivity, the electron energy loss spectra (EELS) and the wave function are calculated. The results show an excitonic binding energy of 818 meV with a bright exciton located in the armchair direction in pristine phosphorene. For PO, the arrangement of the oxygen atoms significantly influences the optical properties. In particular, the absorption spectrum is extended along the solar spectrum, with a high absorption coefficient observed in the dangling structures. The maximum lectivity values are observed for the high energies of the light spectrum. Moreover, the first EELS peak is located in the visible region in all the structures except for one configuration that exhibits the same behavior as pure phosphorene. Finally, the exciton effect reveals that all PO conformers have a dark exciton state, which is suitable for long-lived applications.",3
Modulation of magnetization dynamics in an epitaxial Heusler ferromagnet due to pure spin current in a laterally configured structure.,"Using a laterally configured structure, we demonstrate modulation of the magnetization dynamics of an epitaxial Heusler ferromagnet, Fe3Si, by nonlocally injecting pure spin currents. From the ferromagnetic resonance signals, the effective Gilbert damping constant ([Formula: see text]) of the epitaxial Fe3Si nanomagnet is estimated to be approximately 0.003 at room temperature. By using the lateral and nonlocal spin injection, the [Formula: see text] value of the epitaxial Fe3Si nanomagnet can be modulated from 0.0034 to 0.0024. This study will open a way for control of the magnetization dynamics of high-performance ferromagnetic Heusler alloys due to pure spin currents even in laterally configured structures.",3
Do the contact angle and line tension of surface-attached droplets depend on the radius of curvature?,"Results from Monte Carlo simulations of wall-attached droplets in the three-dimensional Ising lattice gas model and in a symmetric binary Lennard-Jones fluid, confined by antisymmetric walls, are analyzed, with the aim to estimate the dependence of the contact angle [Formula: see text] on the droplet radius [Formula: see text] of curvature. Sphere-cap shape of the wall-attached droplets is assumed throughout. An approach, based purely on 'thermodynamic' observables, e.g. chemical potential, excess density due to the droplet, etc, is used, to avoid ambiguities in the decision which particles belong (or do not belong, respectively) to the droplet. It is found that the results are compatible with a variation [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] being the contact angle in the thermodynamic limit ([Formula: see text]). The possibility to use such results to estimate the excess free energy related to the contact line of the droplet, namely the line tension, at the wall, is discussed. Various problems that hamper this approach and were not fully recognized in previous attempts to extract the line tension are identified. It is also found that the dependence of wall tensions on the difference of chemical potential of the droplet from that at the bulk coexistence provides effectively a change of the contact angle of similar magnitude. The simulation approach yields precise estimates for the excess density due to wall-attached droplets and the corresponding free energy excess, relative to a system without a droplet at the same chemical potential. It is shown that this information suffices to estimate nucleation barriers, not affected by ambiguities on droplet shape, contact angle and line tension.",3
Effects of high pressure on the ferromagnetism and in-plane electrical transport of (Ba0.904K0.096)(Zn0.805Mn0.195)2As2 single crystal.,"Pressure technique is an effective way to modify magnetic properties of diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS). Based on single crystal, in-plane electrical transport properties of a new generation DMS (Ba0.904K0.096)(Zn0.805Mn0.195)2As2 have been measured with hydrostatic pressure up to 1.8 GPa. Magnetic properties of the single crystal sample are effectively tuned by pressure. Upon compression, the in-plane resistivity initially decreases but then increases when pressure is higher than 1.2 GPa. First principle calculations suggest that decrease of the resistivity is due to enhancement of density of state at Femi energy while increase of the resistivity under higher pressure is caused by distorted MnAs4 tetrahedra. We reveal that the configuration of the MnAs4 tetrahedra and strength of interlayer As-As bonding are of importance to ferromagnetic coupling of (Ba,K)(Zn,Mn)2As2.",3
Local atomic order of a metallic glass made visible by scanning tunneling microscopy.,"Exploring the atomic level structure in amorphous materials by STM becomes extremely difficult due to the localized electronic states. Here we carried out STM studies on a quasi-low-dimensional film of metallic glass Zr65Cu27.5Al7.5 which is 'ultrathin' compared with the localization length and/or the length scale of short range order. The local electronic structure must appear more inherent, having states at E f available for tip-sample tunneling current. To enhance imaging contrasts between long-range and short-range orders, the highly oriented pyrolytic graphite was chosen as substrate, so that the structural heterogeneity arising from competition between the glass former ability and the epitaxy can be ascertained. A chemical order predicted for this system was observed in atomic ordered regimes (1-2 monolayers), accompanied with a superstructure with the period Zr-Cu(Al)-Zr along three hexagonal axes. The result implies a chemical short range order in disordered regimes, where polyhedral clusters are dominant with the solute atom Cu(Al) in the center. An attempt for the structural modelling was made based on high resolution STM images, giving icosahedral order on the surface and different Voronoi clusters in 3D space.",3
Strain-induced topological magnon phase transitions: applications to kagome-lattice ferromagnets.,"A common feature of topological insulators is that they are characterized by topologically invariant quantity such as the Chern number and the [Formula: see text] index. This quantity distinguishes a nontrivial topological system from a trivial one. A topological phase transition may occur when there are two topologically distinct phases, and it is usually defined by a gap closing point where the topologically invariant quantity is ill-defined. In this paper, we show that the magnon bands in the strained (distorted) kagome-lattice ferromagnets realize an example of a topological magnon phase transition in the realistic parameter regime of the system. When spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is neglected (i.e. no Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction), we show that all three magnon branches are dispersive with no flat band, and there exists a critical point where tilted Dirac and semi-Dirac point coexist in the magnon spectra. The critical point separates two gapless magnon phases as opposed to the usual phase transition. Upon the inclusion of SOC, we realize a topological magnon phase transition point at the critical strain [Formula: see text], where D and J denote the perturbative SOC and the Heisenberg spin exchange interaction respectively. It separates two distinct topological magnon phases with different Chern numbers for [Formula: see text] and for [Formula: see text]. The associated anomalous thermal Hall conductivity develops an abrupt change at [Formula: see text], due to the divergence of the Berry curvature in momentum space. The proposed topological magnon phase transition is experimentally feasible by applying external perturbations such as uniaxial strain or pressure.",3
Universality of clone dynamics during tissue development.,"The emergence of complex organs is driven by the coordinated proliferation, migration and differentiation of precursor cells. The fate behaviour of these cells is reflected in the time evolution their progeny, termed clones, which serve as a key experimental observable. In adult tissues, where cell dynamics is constrained by the condition of homeostasis, clonal tracing studies based on transgenic animal models have advanced our understanding of cell fate behaviour and its dysregulation in disease (1, 2). But what can be learned from clonal dynamics in development, where the spatial cohesiveness of clones is impaired by tissue deformations during tissue growth? Drawing on the results of clonal tracing studies, we show that, despite the complexity of organ development, clonal dynamics may converge to a critical state characterized by universal scaling behaviour of clone sizes. By mapping clonal dynamics onto a generalization of the classical theory of aerosols, we elucidate the origin and range of scaling behaviours and show how the identification of universal scaling dependences may allow lineage-specific information to be distilled from experiments. Our study shows the emergence of core concepts of statistical physics in an unexpected context, identifying cellular systems as a laboratory to study non-equilibrium statistical physics.",3
Robust integer and fractional helical modes in the quantum Hall effect.,"Electronic systems harboring one-dimensional helical modes, where spin and momentum are locked, have lately become an important field of its own. When coupled to a conventional superconductor, such systems are expected to manifest topological superconductivity; a unique phase hosting exotic Majorana zero modes. Even more interesting are fractional helical modes, yet to be observed, which open the route for realizing generalized parafermions. Possessing non-abelian exchange statistics, these quasiparticles may serve as building blocks in topological quantum computing. Here, we present a new approach to form protected one-dimensional helical edge modes in the quantum Hall regime. The novel platform is based on a carefully designed double-quantum-well structure in a GaAs based system hosting two electronic sub-bands; each tuned to the quantum Hall effect regime. By electrostatic gating of different areas of the structure, counter-propagating integer, as well as fractional, edge modes with opposite spins are formed. We demonstrate that due to spin-protection, these helical modes remain ballistic for large distances. In addition to the formation of helical modes, this platform can serve as a rich playground for artificial induction of compounded fractional edge modes, and for construction of edge modes based interferometers.",3
Tunable surface configuration of skyrmion lattices in cubic helimagnets.,"In bulk helimagnets, the presence of magnetic skyrmion lattices is always accompanied by a periodic stress field due to the intrinsic magnetoelastic coupling. The release of this nontrivial stress field at the surface causes a periodic displacement field, which characterizes a novel particle-like property of skyrmion: its surface configuration. Here, we derive the analytical solution of this displacement field for semi-infinite cubic helimagnet with the skyrmion magnetization approximated by the triple-Q representation. For MnSi, we show that the skyrmion lattices have a bumpy surface configuration characterized by periodically arranged peaks with a characteristic height of about 10(-13) m. The pattern of the peaks can be controlled by varying the strength of the applied magnetic field. Moreover, we prove that the surface configuration varies together with the motion and deformation of the skyrmion lattices. As a result, the surface configuration can be tuned by application of electric current, mechanical loads, as well as any other effective external fields for skyrmion lattices.",3
An atomic-scale evaluation of the fracture toughness of silica glass.,"Using an atomistic technique consistent with continuum balance laws and drawing on classical fracture mechanics theory, we estimate the resistance to fracture propagation of amorphous silica. We discuss correspondence and deviations from classical linear elastic fracture mechanics theory including size dependence, rigid/floppy modes of deformation, and the effects of surface energy and stress.",3
Inversion symmetry breaking induced triply degenerate points in orderly arranged PtSeTe family materials.,"k paths exactly with [Formula: see text] symmetry allow to find triply degenerate points (TDPs) in band structures. The paths that host the type-II Dirac points in PtSe2 family materials also have the [Formula: see text] spatial symmetry. However, due to Kramers degeneracy (the systems have both inversion symmetry and time reversal symmetry), the crossing points in them are Dirac ones. In this work, based on symmetry analysis, first-principles calculations, and [Formula: see text] method, we predict that PtSe2 family materials should undergo topological transitions if the inversion symmetry is broken, i.e. the Dirac fermions in PtSe2 family materials split into TDPs in PtSeTe family materials (PtSSe, PtSeTe, and PdSeTe) with orderly arranged S/Se (Se/Te). It is different from the case in high-energy physics that breaking inversion symmetry I leads to the splitting of Dirac fermion into Weyl fermions. We also address a possible method to achieve the orderly arranged in PtSeTe family materials in experiments. Our study provides a real example that Dirac points transform into TDPs, and is helpful to investigate the topological transition between Dirac fermions and TDP fermions.",3
The effect of nonlocal dielectric response on the surface-enhanced Raman and fluorescence spectra of molecular systems.,"We present a theoretical study on the influence of the nonlocal dielectric response on surface-enhanced resonant Raman scattering (SERRS) and fluorescence (SEF) spectra of a model molecule confined in the center of a Ag nanoparticle (NP) dimer. In the simulations, the nonlocal dielectric response caused by the electron-hole pair generation in Ag NPs was computed with the d-parameter theory, and the scattering spectra of a model molecule representing the commonly used fluorescent dye rhodamine 6G (R6G) were obtained by density-matrix calculations. The influence of the separation between Ag NP dimers on the damping rate and scattering spectra with and without the nonlocal response were systematically analyzed. The results show that the nonlocal dielectric response is very sensitive to the gap distance of the NP dimers, and it undergoes much faster decay with the increase of the separation than the radiative and energy transfer rates. The Raman and fluorescence peaks as simulated with the nonlocal dielectric response are relative weaker than that without the nonlocal effect for smaller NP separations because the extra decay rates of the nonlocal effect could reduce both the population of the excited state and the interband coherence between the ground and excited states. Our result also indicates that the nonlocal effect is more prominent on the SEF process than the SERRS process.",3
Coexistence of long-range cycloidal order and spin-cluster glass state in the multiferroic BaYFeO4.,"We report the presence of spin glass state below the cycloidal spin ordering in the multiferroic BaYFeO4. This compound is known to crystallize in an orthorhombic structure with a centrosymmetric space group Pnma and exhibits two successive antiferromagnetic phase transitions. Upon cooling, it undergoes a spin density wave (SDW)-like antiferromagnetic ordering at T N1 ~ 48 K and a cycloidal ordering at T N2 ~ 35 K. Using dc magnetic memory effect and magnetization relaxation studies, we have shown that this oxide undergoes a reentrant spin glass transition below T (*) ~ 17 K. Our analysis suggests the presence of spin clusters in the glassy state. The coexistence of spin-cluster glass and long-range cycloidal ordered states results in an exchange bias effect at 2 K. The origin of the glassy state has been attributed to freezing of some Fe(3+) moments, which do not participate in the long-range ordering.",3
Compressing a confined DNA: from nano-channel to nano-cavity.,"We analyze the behavior of a semiflexible polymer confined in nanochannel under compression in axial direction. Key to our discussion is the identification of two length scales; the correlation length xi of concentration fluctuation and what we call the segregation length [Formula: see text]. These length scales, while degenerate in uncompressed state in nanochannel, generally split as [Formula: see text] upon compression, and the way they compete with the system size during the compression determines the crossover from quasi-1D nanochannel to quasi-0D nanocavity behaviors. For a flexible polymer, the story becomes very simple, which corresponds to a special limit of our description, but a much richer behavior is expected for a semiflexible polymer relevant to DNA in confined spaces. We also briefly discuss the dynamical properties of the compressed polymer.",3
Glass transition memorized by the enthalpy-entropy compensation in the shear thinning of supercooled metallic liquids.,"To unravel the true nature of glass transition, broader insights into glass forming have been gained by examining the stress-driven glassy systems, where strong shear thinning, i.e. a reduced viscosity under increasing shear rate, is encountered. It is argued that arbitrarily small stress-driven shear rates would 'melt' the glass and erase any memory of its thermal history. In this work, we report a glass transition memorized by the enthalpy-entropy compensation in strongly shear-thinned supercooled metallic liquids, which coincides with the thermal glass transition in both the transition temperature and the activation Gibbs free energy. Our findings provide distinctive insights into both glass forming and shear thinning, and enrich current knowledge on the ubiquitous enthalpy-entropy compensation empirical law in condensed matter physics.",3
Decoupling of magnetism and electric transport in single-crystal (Sr1-x A x )2IrO4 (A = Ca or Ba).,"We report a systematical structural, transport and magnetic study of Ca or Ba doped Sr2IrO4 single crystals. Isoelectronically substituting Ca(2+) (up to 15%) or Ba(2+) (up to 4%) ion for the Sr(2+) ion provides no additional charge carriers but effectively changes the lattice parameters in Sr2IrO4. In particular, 15% Ca doping considerably reduces the c-axis and the unit cell by nearly 0.45% and 1.00%, respectively. These significant, anisotropic compressions in the lattice parameters conspicuously cause no change in the Neel temperature which remains at 240 K, but drastically reduces the electrical resistivity by up to five orders of magnitude or even precipitates a sharp insulator-to-metal transition at lower temperatures, i.e. the vanishing insulating state accompanies an unchanged Neel temperature in (Sr1-x A x )2IrO4. This observation brings to light an intriguing difference between chemical pressure and applied pressure, the latter of which does suppress the long-range magnetic order in Sr2IrO4. This difference reveals the importance of the Ir1-O2-Ir1 bond angle and homogenous volume compression in determining the magnetic ground state. All results, along with a comparison drawn with results of Tb and La doped Sr2IrO4, underscore that the magnetic transition plays a nonessential role in the formation of the charge gap in the spin-orbit-tuned iridate.",3
Zitterbewegung in time-reversal Weyl semimetals.,"We perform a systematic study of the Zitterbewegung effect of fermions, which are described by a Gaussian wave with broken spatial-inversion symmetry in a three-dimensional low-energy Weyl semimetal. Our results show that the motion of fermions near the Weyl points is characterized by rectilinear motion and Zitterbewegung oscillation. The ZB oscillation is affected by the width of the Gaussian wave packet, the position of the Weyl node, and the chirality and anisotropy of the fermions. By introducing a one-dimensional cosine potential, the new generated massless fermions have lower Fermi velocities, which results in a robust relativistic oscillation. Modulating the height and periodicity of periodic potential demonstrates that the ZB effect of fermions in the different Brillouin zones exhibits quasi-periodic behavior. These results may provide an appropriate system for probing the Zitterbewegung effect experimentally.",3
Clogging and transport of driven particles in asymmetric funnel arrays.,"We numerically examine the flow and clogging of particles driven through asymmetric funnel arrays when the commensurability ratio of the number of particles per plaquette is varied. The particle-particle interactions are modeled with a soft repulsive potential that could represent vortex flow in type-II superconductors or driven charged colloids. The velocity-force curves for driving in the easy flow direction of the funnels exhibit a single depinning threshold; however, for driving in the hard flow direction, we find that there can be both negative mobility where the velocity decreases with increasing driving force as well as a reentrant pinning effect in which the particles flow at low drives but become pinned at intermediate drives. This reentrant pinning is associated with a transition from smooth 1D flow at low drives to a clogged state at higher drives that occurs when the particles cluster in a small number of plaquettes and block the flow. When the drive is further increased, particle rearrangements occur that cause the clog to break apart. We map out the regimes in which the pinned, flowing, and clogged states appear as a function of plaquette filling and drive. The clogged states remain robust at finite temperatures but develop intermittent bursts of flow in which a clog temporarily breaks apart but quickly reforms.",3
Theoretical approach to embed nanocrystallites into a bulk crystalline matrix and the embedding influence on the electronic band structure and optical properties of the resulting heterostructures.,"We develop an approach and present results of the combined molecular dynamics and density functional theory calculations of the structural and optical properties of the nanometer-sized crystallites embedded in a bulk crystalline matrix. The method is designed and implemented for both compatible and incompatible lattices of the nanocrystallite (NC) and the host matrix, when determining the NC optimal orientation relative to the matrix constitutes a challenging problem. We suggest and substantiate an expression for the cost function of the search algorithm, which is the energy per supercell generalized for varying number of atoms in the latter. The epitaxial relationships at the Si/NC interfaces and the optical properties are obtained and found to be in a reasonable agreement with experimental data. Dielectric functions show significant sensitivity to the NC's orientation relative to the matrix at energies below 0.5 eV.",3
Bond compressibility and bond Gruneisen parameters of CdTe.,"Extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) at the Cd K edge and diffraction patterns have been measured on CdTe as a function of pressure from 100 kPa (1 bar) to 5 GPa using a cell with nano-polycrystalline diamond anvils and an x-ray focussing scanning spectrometer. Three phases-zincblende (ZB), mixed cinnabar-ZB and rocksalt (RS)-are well distinguished in different pressure intervals. The bond compressibility measured by EXAFS in the ZB phase is slightly smaller than the one measured by diffraction and decreases significantly faster when the pressure increases; the difference is attributed to the effect of relative vibrations perpendicular to the Cd-Te bond. The parallel mean square relative displacement (MSRD) decreases, the perpendicular MSRD increases when the pressure increases, leading to an increasing anisotropy of relative atomic vibrations. A constant-temperature bond Gruneisen parameter (GP) has been evaluated for the ZB phase and compared with the constant-pressure bond GP measured in a previous experiment; an attempt is made to connect the bond GPs measured by EXAFS and the more familiar thermodynamic GP and mode GPs; the comparisons suggest the inadequacy of the quasi-harmonic approximation to deal with the local vibrational properties sampled by EXAFS.",3
"Dielectric function, critical points, and Rydberg exciton series of WSe2 monolayer.","The complex dielectric function ([Formula: see text]) of WSe2 monolayer grown by atomic layer deposition is investigated using spectroscopic ellipsometry. Band structure parameters are obtained by standard line-shape analysis of the second-energy-derivative of [Formula: see text] spectra. The fundamental band gap is observed at 2.26 eV, corresponds to transition between valence band (VB) maximum at the K point and conduction band (CB) minimum at Q point in the Brillouin zone (BZ). Two strong so-called A and B excitonic peaks in [Formula: see text] spectra originate from vertical transitions from spin-orbit split (0.43 eV) VB to CB at K point of the BZ. Binding energies of A and B exactions are 0.71 and 0.28 eV, respectively. Well resolved five excited excitons states has been detected within the spectral region between A and B. Energy profile of the Rydberg series shows significant deviation from the hydrogenic behavior, discussed in connection with the 2D hydrogen model. Results presented here will improve our understanding about the optical response of 2D materials and will help to design better optoelectronic applications and validate theoretical considerations.",3
Superconductivity in Li-intercalated bilayer arsenene and hole-doped monolayer arsenene: a first-principles prediction.,"Using first-principles calculations, we find Li-intercalated bilayer arsenene with AB stacking is dynamically stable, which is different from pristine bilayer with AA stacking. Electron-phonon coupling of the stable Li-intercalated bilayer arsenene are dominated by the low frequency vibrational modes (E''(1), [Formula: see text](1), E'(1) and acoustic modes) and lead to an superconductivity with T c = 8.68 K with isotropical Eliashberg function. Small biaxial tensile strain (2%) can improve T c to 11.22 K due to the increase of DOS and phonon softening. By considering the fully anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg theory, T c are found to be enhanced by 50% and exhibits a single anisotropic gap nature. In addition, considering its nearly flat top valence band which is favorable for high temperature superconductivity, we also explore the superconducting properties of hole-doped monolayer arsenene under different strains. the unstrained monolayer arsenene superconducts at T c = 0.22 K with 0.1 hole/cell doping. By applying 3% biaxial strain, T c can be lifted up strikingly to 6.69 K due to a strong Fermi nesting of the nearly flat band. Then T c decreases slowly with strain. Our findings provide another insight to realize 2D superconductivity and suggest that the strain is crucial to further enhance the transition temperature.",3
Lymphatic System Flows.,"The supply of oxygen and nutrients to tissues is performed by the blood system, and involves a net leakage of fluid outward at the capillary level. One of the principal functions of the lymphatic system is to gather this fluid and return it to the blood system to maintain overall fluid balance. Fluid in the interstitial spaces is often at subatmospheric pressure, and the return points into the venous system are at pressures of approximately 20 cmH2O. This adverse pressure difference is overcome by the active pumping of collecting lymphatic vessels, which feature closely spaced one-way valves and contractile muscle cells in their walls. Passive vessel squeezing causes further pumping. The dynamics of lymphatic pumping have been investigated experimentally and mathematically, revealing complex behaviours indicating that the system performance is robust against minor perturbations in pressure and flow. More serious disruptions can lead to incurable swelling of tissues called lymphoedema.",3
Functionalization of group-14 two-dimensional materials.,"The great success of graphene has boosted intensive search for other single-layer thick materials, mainly composed of group-14 atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice. This new class of two-dimensional (2D) crystals, known as 2D-Xenes, has become an emerging field of intensive research due to their remarkable electronic properties and the promise for a future generation of nanoelectronics. In contrast to graphene, Xenes are not completely planar, and feature a low buckled geometry with two sublattices displaced vertically as a result of the interplay between sp(2) and sp(3) orbital hybridization. In spite of the buckling, the outstanding electronic properties of graphene governed by Dirac physics are preserved in Xenes too. The buckled structure also has several advantages over graphene. Together with the spin-orbit (SO) interaction it may lead to the emergence of various experimentally accessible topological phases, like the quantum spin Hall effect. This in turn would lead to designing and building new electronic and spintronic devices, like topological field effect transistors. In this regard an important issue concerns the electron energy gap, which for Xenes naturally exists owing to the buckling and SO interaction. The electronic properties, including the magnitude of the energy gap, can further be tuned and controlled by external means. Xenes can easily be functionalized by substrate, chemical adsorption, defects, charge doping, external electric field, periodic potential, in-plane uniaxial and biaxial stress, and out-of-plane long-range structural deformation, to name a few. This topical review explores structural, electronic and magnetic properties of Xenes and addresses the question of their functionalization in various ways, including external factors acting simultaneously. It also points to future directions to be explored in functionalization of Xenes. The results of experimental and theoretical studies obtained so far have many promising features making the 2D-Xene materials important players in the field of future nanoelectronics and spintronics.",3
Resonant magneto-acoustic switching: influence of Rayleigh wave frequency and wavevector.,"We show on in-plane magnetized thin films that magnetization can be switched efficiently by 180 degrees using large amplitude Rayleigh waves travelling along the hard or easy magnetic axis. Large characteristic filament-like domains are formed in the latter case. Micromagnetic simulations clearly confirm that this multi-domain configuration is compatible with a resonant precessional mechanism. The reversed domains are in both geometries several hundreds of [Formula: see text], much larger than has been shown using spin transfer torque- or field-driven precessional switching. We show that surface acoustic waves can travel at least 1 mm before addressing a given area, and can interfere to create magnetic stripes that can be positioned with a sub-micronic precision.",3
Large enhancement of superconductivity in Zr point contacts.,"For certain complex superconducting systems, the superconducting properties get enhanced under mesoscopic point contacts made of elemental non-superconducting metals. However, understanding of the mechanism through which such contact induced local enhancement of superconductivity happens has been limited due to the complex nature of such compounds. In this paper we present a large enhancement of superconducting transition temperature T c and superconducting energy gap Delta in a simple elemental superconductor Zr. While bulk Zr shows a critical temperature around 0.6 K, superconductivity survives at Ag/Zr and Pt/Zr point contacts up to 3 K with a corresponding five-fold enhancement of Delta. Further, the first-principles calculations on a model system provide useful insights. We show that the enhancement in superconducting properties can be attributed to a modification in the electron-phonon coupling accompanied by an enhancement of the density of states which involves the appearance of a new electron band at the Ag/Zr interfaces.",3
Dimensional reduction of a general advection-diffusion equation in 2D channels.,"Diffusion of point-like particles in a two-dimensional channel of varying width is studied. The particles are driven by an arbitrary space dependent force. We construct a general recurrence procedure mapping the corresponding two-dimensional advection-diffusion equation onto the longitudinal coordinate x. Unlike the previous specific cases, the presented procedure enables us to find the one-dimensional description of the confined diffusion even for non-conservative (vortex) forces, e.g. caused by flowing solvent dragging the particles. We show that the result is again the generalized Fick-Jacobs equation. Despite of non existing scalar potential in the case of vortex forces, the effective one-dimensional scalar potential, as well as the corresponding quasi-equilibrium and the effective diffusion coefficient [Formula: see text] can be always found.",3
Physics and performances of III-V nanowire broken-gap heterojunction TFETs using an efficient tight-binding mode-space NEGF model enabling million-atom nanowire simulations.,"We report the capability to simulate in a quantum-mechanical atomistic fashion record-large nanowire devices, featuring several hundred to millions of atoms and a diameter up to 18.2 nm. We have employed a tight-binding mode-space NEGF technique demonstrating by far the fastest (up to 10 000 x faster) but accurate (error < 1%) atomistic simulations to date. Such technique and capability opens new avenues to explore and understand the physics of nanoscale and mesoscopic devices dominated by quantum effects. In particular, our method addresses in an unprecedented way the technologically-relevant case of band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) in III-V nanowire broken-gap heterojunction tunnel-FETs (HTFETs). We demonstrate an accurate match of simulated BTBT currents to experimental measurements in a 12 nm diameter InAs NW and in an InAs/GaSb Esaki tunneling diode. We apply our TB MS simulations and report the first in-depth atomistic study of the scaling potential of III-V GAA nanowire HTFETs including the effect of electron-phonon scattering and discrete dopant impurity band tails, quantifying the benefits of this technology for low-power low-voltage CMOS applications.",3
Coexisting exchange bias effect and ferroelectricity in geometrically frustrated ZnCr2O4.,"Concomitant occurrence of exchange bias effect and ferroelectric order is revealed in antiferromagnetic spinel ZnCr2O4. The exchange bias effect is observed below antiferromagnetic Neel temperature (T N) with a reasonable value of exchange bias field ([Formula: see text] Oe at 2 K). Intriguingly, the [Formula: see text] ratio is found unusually high as approximately 2.2, where H C is the coercivity. This indicates that large H C is not always primary for obtaining large exchange bias effect. Ferroelectric order is observed at T N, where non-centrosymmetric magnetic structure with [Formula: see text] space group associated with the magnetoelectric coupling correlates the ferroelectric order, proposing that, ZnCr2O4 is an improper multiferroic material. Rare occurrence of exchange bias effect and ferroelectric order in ZnCr2O4 attracts the community for fundamental interest and draws special attention in designing new materials for possible electric field control of exchange bias effect.",3
Entropy production and rectification efficiency in colloid transport along a pulsating channel.,"We study the current rectification of particles moving in a pulsating channel under the influence of an applied force. We have shown the existence of different rectification scenarios in which entropic and energetic effects compete. The effect can be quantified by means of a rectification coefficient that is analyzed in terms of the force, the frequency and the diffusion coefficient. The energetic cost of the motion of the particles expressed in terms of the entropy production depends on the importance of the entropic contribution to the total force. Rectification is more important at low values of the applied force when entropic effects become dominant. In this regime, the entropy production is not invariant under reversal of the applied force. The phenomenon observed could be used to optimize transport in microfluidic devices or in biological channels.",3
Two-dimensional dispersion of magnetostatic volume spin waves.,"Owing to the dipolar (magnetostatic) interaction, long-wavelength spin waves in in-plane magnetized films show an unusual dispersion behavior, which can be mathematically described by the model of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] and refinements thereof. However, solving the two-dimensional dispersion [Formula: see text] requires the evaluation of a set of coupled transcendental equations and one has to rely on numerics. In this work, we present a systematic perturbative analysis of the spin wave model. An expansion in the in-plane wavevector [Formula: see text] allows us to obtain explicit closed-form expressions for the dispersion relation and mode profiles in various asymptotic regimes. Moreover, we derive a very accurate semi-analytical expression for the dispersion relation of the lowest-frequency mode that is straightforward to evaluate.",3
"Transport of nano-objects in narrow channels: influence of Brownian diffusion, confinement and particle nature.","This paper presents experimental results about transport of dilute suspensions of nano-objects in silicon-glass micrometric and sub-micrometric channels. Two kinds of objects are used: solid, rigid latex beads and spherical capsule-shaped, soft polymersomes. They are tracked using fluorescence microscopy. Three aspects are studied: confinement (ratio between particle diameter and channel depth), Brownian diffusion and particle nature. The aim of this work is to understand how these different aspects affect the transport of suspensions in narrow channels and to understand the different mechanisms at play. Concerning the solid beads we observe the appearance of two regimes, one where the experimental mean velocity is close to the expected one and another where this velocity is lower. This is directly related to a competition between confinement, Brownian diffusion and advection. These two regimes are shown to be linked to the inhomogeneity of particles distribution in the channel depth, which we experimentally deduce from velocity distributions. This inhomogeneity appears during the entrance process into the sub-micrometric channels, as for hydrodynamic separation or deterministic lateral displacement. Concerning the nature of the particles we observed a shift of transition towards the second regime likely due to the relationships between shear stress and polymersomes mechanical properties which could reduce the inhomogeneity imposed by the geometry of our device.",3
Stability of the antiferromagnetic state in the electron doped iridates.,"Iridates such as Sr2IrO4 are of considerable interest owing to the formation of the Mott insulating state driven by a large spin-orbit coupling. However, in contrast to the expectation from the Nagaoka theorem that a single doped hole or electron destroys the anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) state of the half-filled Hubbard model in the large U limit, the anti-ferromagnetism persists in the doped Iridates for a large dopant concentration beyond half-filling. With a tight-binding description of the relevant [Formula: see text] states by the third-neighbor (t 1, t 2, t 3, U) Hubbard model on the square lattice, we examine the stability of the AFM state to the formation of a spin spiral state in the strong coupling limit. The third-neighbor interaction t 3 is important for the description of the Fermi surface of the electron doped system. A phase diagram in the parameter space is obtained for the regions of stability of the AFM state. Our results qualitatively explain the robustness of the AFM state in the electron doped iridate (such as Sr2-x La x IrO4), observed in many experiments, where the AFM state continues to be stable until a critical dopant concentration.",3
"Determination of the hydrogen-bond network and the ferrimagnetic structure of a rockbridgeite-type compound, [Formula: see text].","Applying neutron powder diffraction, four unique hydrogen positions were determined in a rockbridgeite-type compound, [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text]. Its honeycomb-like H-bond network running without interruption along the crystallographic [Formula: see text] axis resembles those in alkali sulphatic and arsenatic oxyhydroxides. They provide the so-called dynamically disordered H-bond network over which protons are superconducting in a vehicle mechanism. This is indicated by dramatic increases of dielectric constant and loss factor at room temperature. The relevance of static and dynamic disorder of OH and HOH groups are explained in terms of a high number of structural defects at octahedral chains alternatingly half-occupied by [Formula: see text] cations. The structure is built up by unusual octahedral doublet, triplet, and quartet clusters of aliovalent 3d transition metal cations, predicting complicate magnetic ordering and interaction. The ferrimagnetic structure below the Curie temperature [Formula: see text]-83 K could be determined from the structure analysis with neutron diffraction data at 25 K.",3
Functional thiols as repair and doping agents of defective MoS2 monolayers.,"Recent experimental and theoretical studies indicate that thiols (R-SH) can be used to repair sulfur vacancy defects in MoS2 monolayers (MLs). This density functional theory study investigates how the thiol repair mechanism process can be used to dope MoS2 MLs. Fluorinated thiols as well as amine-containing ones are used to p- and n-dope the MoS2 ML, respectively. It is shown that functional groups are only physisorbed on the repaired MoS2 surface. This explains the reversible doping with fluorinated thiols.",3
Bulk and interface quantum states of electrons in multi-layer heterostructures with topological materials.,"In this article we describe the bulk and interface quantum states of electrons in multi-layer heterostructures in one dimension, consisting of topological insulators (TIs) and topologically trivial materials. We use and extend an effective four-band continuum Hamiltonian by introducing position dependence to the eight material parameters of the Hamiltonian. We are able to demonstrate complete conduction-valence band mixing in the interface states. We find evidence for topological features of bulk states of multi-layer TI heterostructures, as well as demonstrating both complete and incomplete conduction-valence band inversion at different bulk state energies. We show that the linear k z terms in the low-energy Hamiltonian, arising from overlap of p z orbitals between different atomic layers in the case of chalcogenides, control the amount of tunneling from TIs to trivial insulators. Finally, we show that the same linear k z terms in the low-energy Hamiltonian affect the material's ability to form the localised interface state, and we demonstrate that due to this effect the spin and probability density localisation in a thin film of Sb2Te3 is incomplete. We show that changing the parameter that controls the magnitude of the overlap of p z orbitals affects the transport characteristics of the topologically conducting states, with incomplete topological state localisation resulting in increased backscattering.",3
Quantum corrections for the phase diagram of systems with competing order.,"We use the effective potential method of quantum field theory to obtain the quantum corrections to the zero temperature phase diagram of systems with competing order parameters. We are particularly interested in two different scenarios: regions of the phase diagram where there is a bicritical point, at which both phases vanish continuously, and the case where both phases coexist homogeneously. We consider different types of couplings between the order parameters, including a bilinear one. This kind of coupling breaks time-reversal symmetry and it is only allowed if both order parameters transform according to the same irreducible representation. This occurs in many physical systems of actual interest like competing spin density waves, different types of orbital antiferromagnetism, elastic instabilities of crystal lattices, vortices in a multigap SC and also applies to describe the unusual magnetism of the heavy fermion compound URu2Si2. Our results show that quantum corrections have an important effect on the phase diagram of systems with competing orders.",3
Exchange interactions in two-state systems: rare earth pyrochlores.,"The general form of the nearest neighbour exchange interaction for rare earth pyrochlores is derived based on symmetry. Generally, the rare earth angular momentum degeneracy is lifted by the crystal electric field (CEF) into singlets and doublets. When the CEF ground state is a doublet that is well-separated from the first excited state the CEF ground state doublet can be treated as a pseudo-spin of some kind. The general form of the nearest neighbour exchange interaction for pseudo-spins on the pyrochlore lattice is derived for three different types of pseudo-spins. The methodology presented in this paper can be applied to other two-state spin systems with a high space group symmetry.",3
"Low-energy spin dynamics of orthoferrites AFeO3 (A = Y, La, Bi).","YFeO3 and LaFeO3 are members of the rare-earth orthoferrites family with Pbnm space group. Using inelastic neutron scattering, the low-energy spin excitations have been measured around the magnetic Brillouin zone center. Splitting of magnon branches and finite magnon gaps ( approximately 2 meV) are observed for both compounds, where the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interactions account for most of this gap with some additional contribution from single-ion anisotropy. We also make comparisons with multiferroic BiFeO3 (R3c space group), in which similar behavior was observed. By taking into account all relevant local Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interactions, our analysis allows for the precise determination of all experimentally observed parameters in the spin-Hamiltonian. We find that different properties of the Pbnm and R3c space group lead to the stabilization of a spin cycloid structure in the latter case but not in the former, which explains the difference in the levels of complexity of magnon band structures for the respective compounds.",3
Magnetization reversal in orthorhombic Sr-doped LaFe0.5Cr0.5O3-delta.,"In this paper we studied the reversal magnetization of La1-x Sr x Fe0.5Cr0.5O3-delta (x = 0, 0.1 and 0.2) samples produced by combustion synthesis. The structural analysis was carried out by x-ray diffraction with Rietveld analysis. These analyses revealed that all samples have an orthorhombic structure with space group Pbnm (62) and that the Sr-doping induces a decrease of the lattice parameter. The x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis indicates that the Sr-doping favor the change of the valence states of the Fe(3+) to Fe(4+). The magnetization as a function of the temperature reveals an unusual magnetic behavior with a reversal of magnetization. The increase of the Sr content induces a decrease of the temperature where occurs an inversion of the magnetization and do the value of the magnetization at 5 K more negative. This effect is attributed to the increase of the concentration of Fe(4+) with increasing of the Sr content. The Fe and Cr with a valence of 4+ act as paramagnetic impurities in the antiferromagnetic lattice and are responsible for the changes in the magnetic behavior.",3
Negative electron affinity from aluminium on the diamond (1 0 0) surface: a theoretical study.,"Density functional theory calculations were performed to model the adsorption of up to 1 monolayer (ML) of aluminium on the bare and O-terminated (1 0 0) diamond surface. Large adsorption energies of up to -6.36 eV per atom are observed for the Al-adsorbed O-terminated diamond surface. Most adsorption sites give a negative electron affinity (NEA), with the largest NEAs -1.47 eV on the bare surface (1 ML coverage) and -1.36 eV on the O-terminated surface (0.25 ML coverage). The associated adsorption energies per Al atom for these sites are -4.11 eV and -5.24 eV, respectively. Thus, with suitably controlled coverage, Al on diamond shows promise as a thermally-stable surface for electron emission applications.",3
Excitonic terahertz photoconductivity in intrinsic semiconductor nanowires.,"Excitonic terahertz photoconductivity in intrinsic semiconductor nanowires is studied. Based on the excitonic theory, the numerical method to calculate the photoconductivity spectrum in the nanowires is developed, which can simulate optical pump terahertz-probe spectroscopy measurements on real nanowires and thereby calculate the typical photoconductivity spectrum. With the help of the energetic structure deduced from the calculated linear absorption spectrum, the numerically observed shift of the resonant peak in the photoconductivity spectrum is found to result from the dominant exciton transition between excited or continuum states to the ground state, and the quantitative analysis is in good agreement with the quantum plasmon model. Besides, the dependence of the photoconductivity on the polarization of the terahertz field is also discussed. The numerical method and supporting theoretical analysis provide a new tool for experimentalists to understand the terahertz photoconductivity in intrinsic semiconductor nanowires at low temperatures or for nanowires subjected to below bandgap photoexcitation, where excitonic effects dominate.",3
Monotropic polymorphism in a glass-forming metallic alloy.,"This study investigates the crystallization and phase transition behavior of the amorphous metallic alloy Au70Cu5.5Ag7.5Si17. This alloy has been recently shown to exhibit a transition of a metastable to a more stable crystalline state, occurring via metastable melting under strong non-equilibrium conditions. Such behavior had so far not been observed in other metallic alloys. In this investigation fast differential scanning calorimetry (FDSC) is used to explore crystallization and the solid-liquid-solid transition upon linear heating and during isothermal annealing, as a function of the conditions under which the metastable phase is formed. It is shown that the occurrence of the solid-liquid-solid transformation in FDSC depends on the initial conditions; this is explained by a history-dependent nucleation of the stable crystalline phase. The microstructure was investigated by scanning and transmission electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction. Chemical mapping was performed by energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry. The relationship between the microstructure and the phase transitions observed in FSDC is discussed with respect to the possible kinetic paths of the solid-liquid-solid transition, which is a typical phenomenon in monotropic polymorphism.",3
Phase transition and field effect topological quantum transistor made of monolayer MoS2.,"We study topological phase transitions and topological quantum field effect transistor in monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) using a two-band Hamiltonian model. Without considering the quadratic (q (2)) diagonal term in the Hamiltonian, we show that the phase diagram includes quantum anomalous Hall effect, quantum spin Hall effect, and spin quantum anomalous Hall effect regions such that the topological Kirchhoff law is satisfied in the plane. By considering the q (2) diagonal term and including one valley, it is shown that MoS2 has a non-trivial topology, and the valley Chern number is non-zero for each spin. We show that the wave function is (is not) localized at the edges when the q (2) diagonal term is added (deleted) to (from) the spin-valley Dirac mass equation. We calculate the quantum conductance of zigzag MoS2 nanoribbons by using the nonequilibrium Green function method and show how this device works as a field effect topological quantum transistor.",3
Intrinsic charge trapping in amorphous oxide films: status and challenges.,"We review the current understanding of intrinsic electron and hole trapping in insulating amorphous oxide films on semiconductor and metal substrates. The experimental and theoretical evidences are provided for the existence of intrinsic deep electron and hole trap states stemming from the disorder of amorphous metal oxide networks. We start from presenting the results for amorphous (a) HfO2, chosen due to the availability of highest purity amorphous films, which is vital for studying their intrinsic electronic properties. Exhaustive photo-depopulation spectroscopy measurements and theoretical calculations using density functional theory shed light on the atomic nature of electronic gap states responsible for deep electron trapping observed in a-HfO2. We review theoretical methods used for creating models of amorphous structures and electronic structure calculations of amorphous oxides and outline some of the challenges in modeling defects in amorphous materials. We then discuss theoretical models of electron polarons and bi-polarons in a-HfO2 and demonstrate that these intrinsic states originate from low-coordinated ions and elongated metal-oxygen bonds in the amorphous oxide network. Similarly, holes can be captured at under-coordinated O sites. We then discuss electron and hole trapping in other amorphous oxides, such as a-SiO2, a-Al2O3, a-TiO2. We propose that the presence of low-coordinated ions in amorphous oxides with electron states of significant p and d character near the conduction band minimum can lead to electron trapping and that deep hole trapping should be common to all amorphous oxides. Finally, we demonstrate that bi-electron trapping in a-HfO2 and a-SiO2 weakens Hf(Si)-O bonds and significantly reduces barriers for forming Frenkel defects, neutral O vacancies and O(2-) ions in these materials. These results should be useful for better understanding of electronic properties and structural evolution of thin amorphous films under carrier injection conditions.",3
Electrodynamics of quantum spin liquids.,"Quantum spin liquids attract great interest due to their exceptional magnetic properties characterized by the absence of long-range order down to low temperatures despite the strong magnetic interaction. Commonly, these compounds are strongly correlated electron systems, and their electrodynamic response is governed by the Mott gap in the excitation spectrum. Here we summarize and discuss the optical properties of several two-dimensional quantum spin liquid candidates. First we consider the inorganic material herbertsmithite ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2 and related compounds, which crystallize in a kagome lattice. Then we turn to the organic compounds [Formula: see text]-EtMe3Sb[Pd(dmit)2]2, kappa-(BEDT-TTF)2Ag2(CN)3 and kappa-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu2(CN)3, where the spins are arranged in an almost perfect triangular lattice, leading to strong frustration. Due to differences in bandwidth, the effective correlation strength varies over a wide range, leading to a rather distinct behavior as far as the electrodynamic properties are concerned. We discuss the spinon contributions to the optical conductivity in comparison to metallic quantum fluctuations in the vicinity of the Mott transition.",3
MnSi nanostructures obtained from epitaxially grown thin films: magnetotransport and Hall effect.,"We present a comparative study of the (magneto)transport properties, including Hall effect, of bulk, epitaxially grown thin film and nanostructured MnSi. In order to set our results in relation to published data we extensively characterize our materials, this way establishing a comparatively good sample quality. Our analysis reveals that in particular for thin film and nanostructured material, there are extrinsic and intrinsic contributions to the electronic transport properties, which by modeling the data we separate out. Finally, we discuss our Hall effect data of nanostructured MnSi under consideration of the extrinsic contributions and with respect to the question of the detection of a topological Hall effect in a skyrmionic lattice.",3
Thermoelectric properties of layered NaSbSe2.,"We investigate ordered monoclinic NaSbSe2 as a thermoelectric using first principles calculations. We find that from an electronic point of view, ordered and oriented n-type NaSbSe2 is comparable to the best known thermoelectric materials. This phase has a sufficiently large band gap for thermoelectric and solar absorber applications in contrast to the disordered phase which has a much narrower gap. The electronic structure shows anisotropic, non-parabolic bands. The results show a high Seebeck coefficient in addition to direction dependent high conductivity. The electronic structure quantified by an electron fitness function is very favorable, especially in the n-type case.",3
Topological chiral phonons in center-stacked bilayer triangle lattices.,"Since chiral phonons were found in an asymmetric two-dimensional hexagonal lattice, there has been growing interest in the study of phonon chirality, which were experimentally verified very recently in monolayer tungsten diselenide (2018 Science 359 579). In this work, we find chiral phonons with nontrivial topology in center-stacked bilayer triangle lattices. At the Brillouin-zone corners, [Formula: see text]([Formula: see text]), circularly polarized phonons and nonzero phonon Berry curvature are observed. Moreover, we find that the phonon chirality remain robust with changing sublattice mass ratio and interlayer coupling. The chiral phonons at the valleys are demonstrated in doubler-layer sodium chloride along the [1 1 1] direction. We believe that the findings on topological chiral phonons in triangle lattices will give guidance in the study of chiral phonons in real materials and promote the phononic applications.",3
Universal doping evolution of the superconducting gap anisotropy in single crystals of electron-doped Ba(Fe1-x Rh x )2As2 from London penetration depth measurements.,"Doping evolution of the superconducting gap anisotropy was studied in single crystals of 4d-electron doped Ba(Fe1-x Rh x )2As2 using tunnel diode resonator measurements of the temperature variation of the London penetration depth [Formula: see text]. Single crystals with doping levels representative of an underdoped regime x = 0.039 ([Formula: see text] K), close to optimal doping x = 0.057 ([Formula: see text] K) and overdoped x = 0.079 ([Formula: see text] K) and x = 0.131([Formula: see text] K) were studied. Superconducting energy gap anisotropy was characterized by the exponent, n, by fitting the data to the power-law, [Formula: see text]. The exponent n varies non-monotonically with x, increasing to a maximum n = 2.5 for x = 0.079 and rapidly decreasing towards overdoped compositions to 1.6 for x = 0.131. This behavior is qualitatively similar to the doping evolution of the superconducting gap anisotropy in other iron pnictides, including hole-doped (Ba,K)Fe2As2 and 3d-electron-doped Ba(Fe,Co)2As2 superconductors, finding a full gap near optimal doping and strong anisotropy toward the ends of the superconducting dome in the T-x phase diagram. The normalized superfluid density in an optimally Rh-doped sample is almost identical to the temperature-dependence in the optimally doped Ba(Fe,Co)2As2 samples. Our study supports the universal superconducting gap variation with doping and [Formula: see text] pairing at least in iron based superconductors of the BaFe2As2 family.",3
"Probing ionization potential, electron affinity and self-energy effect on the spectral shape and exciton binding energy of quantum liquid water with self-consistent many-body perturbation theory and the Bethe-Salpeter equation.","An accurate theoretical prediction of ionization potential (IP) and electron affinity (EA) is key in understanding complex photochemical processes in aqueous environments. There have been numerous efforts in literature to accurately predict IP and EA of liquid water, however with often conflicting results depending on the level of theory and the underlying water structures. In a recent study based on hybrid-non-self-consistent many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) Gaiduk et al (2018 Nat. Commun. 9 247) predicted an IP of 10.2 eV and EA of 0.2 eV, resulting in an electronic band gap (i.e. electronic gap (IP-EA) as measured by photoelectron spectroscopy) of about 10 eV, redefining the widely cited experimental gap of 8.7 eV in literature. In the present work, we show that GW self-consistency and an implicit vertex correction in MBPT considerably affect recently reported EA values by Gaiduk et al (2018 Nat. Commun. 9 247) by about 1 eV. Furthermore, the choice of pseudo-potential is critical for an accurate determination of the absolute band positions. Consequently, the self-consistent GW approach with an implicit vertex correction based on projector augmented wave (PAW) method on top of quantum water structures predicts an IP of 10.2, an EA of 1.1, a fundamental gap of 9.1 eV and an exciton binding (Eb) energy of 0.9 eV for the first absorption band of liquid water via the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). Only within such a self-consistent approach a simultanously accurate prediction of IP, EA, Eg, Eb is possible.",3
Sensitive singular-phase optical detection without phase measurements with Tamm plasmons.,"Spectrally-tailored interactions of light with material interfaces offer many exciting applications in sensing, photo-detection, and optical energy conversion. In particular, complete suppression of light reflectance at select frequencies accompanied by sharp phase variations in the reflected signal forms the basis for the development of ultra-sensitive singular-phase optical detection schemes such as Brewster and surface plasmon interferometry. However, both the Brewster effect and surface-plasmon-mediated absorption on planar interfaces are limited to one polarization of the incident light and oblique excitation angles, and may have limited bandwidth dictated by the material dielectric index and plasma frequency. To alleviate these limitations, we design narrow-band super-absorbers composed of plasmonic materials embedded into dielectric photonic nanostructures with topologically-protected interfacial Tamm plasmon states. These structures have planar geometry and do not require nanopatterning to achieve perfect absorption of both polarizations of the incident light in a wide range of incident angles, including the normal incidence. Their absorption lines are tunable across a very broad spectral range via engineering of the photon bandstructure of the dielectric photonic nanostructures to achieve reversal of the geometrical phase across the interface with the plasmonic absorber. We outline the design strategy to achieve perfect absorptance in Tamm structures with dissipative losses via conjugate impedance matching. We further demonstrate via modeling how these structures can be engineered to support sharp asymmetric amplitude resonances, which can be used to improve the sensitivity of optical sensors in the amplitude-only detection scheme that does not require use of bulky and expensive ellipsometry equipment.",3
"Superconducting selenides intercalated with organic molecules: synthesis, crystal structure, electric and magnetic properties, superconducting properties, and phase separation in iron based-chalcogenides and hybrid organic-inorganic superconductors.","Layered iron-based superconducting chalcogenides intercalated with molecular species are the subject of intensive studies, especially in the field of solid state chemistry and condensed matter physics, because of their intriguing chemistry and tunable electric and magnetic properties. Considerable progress in the research, revealing superconducting inorganic-organic hybrid materials with transition temperatures to superconducting state, T c, up to 46 K, has been brought in recent years. These novel materials are synthesized by low-temperature intercalation of molecular species, such as solvates of alkali metals and nitrogen-containing donor compounds, into layered FeSe-type structure. Both the chemical nature as well as orientation of organic molecules between the layers of inorganic host, play an important role in structural modifications and may be used for fine tuning of superconducting properties. Furthermore, a variety of donor species compatible with alkali metals, as well as the possibility of doping also in the host structure (either on Fe or Se sites), makes this system quite flexible and gives a vast array of new materials with tunable electric and magnetic properties. In this review, the main aspects of intercalation chemistry are discussed with a particular attention paid to the influence of the unique nature of intercalating species on the crystal structure and physical properties of the hybrid inorganic-organic materials. To get a full picture of these materials, a comprehensive description of the most effective chemical and electrochemical methods, utilized for synthesis of intercalated species, with critical evaluation of their strong and weak points, related to feasibility of synthesis, phase purity, crystal size and morphology of final products, is included as well.",3
Current phase relation from graphs and diagrams and application to thick ferromagnetic Josephson junctions.,"In this work we present a method of representing terms in the current-phase-relation of a ballistic Josephson junction by combinations of diagrams, used in previous work to represent an equivalent of the matching condition determinant of the junction. This is accomplished by the expansion of the logarithm of this determinant in Taylor series and keeping track of surviving terms, i.e. terms that do not annihilate each other. The types of the surviving terms are represented by connected graphs, whose points represent diagrammatic terms of the determinant expansion. Then the theory is applied to obtain approximations of the current-phase relation of relatively thick ballistic ferromagnetic Josephson junctions with non-collinear magnetizations. This demonstrates the versatility of the method in developing approximations schemes and providing physical insight into the nature of contributions to the supercurrent from the available particle excitations in the junction. We also discuss the strong second harmonic contribution to the supercurrent in junctions with three mutually orthogonal magnetization vectors and a weak intermediate ferromagnet.",3
Steering particles by breaking symmetries.,"We derive general equations of motions for highly-confined particles that perform quasi-two-dimensional motion in Hele-Shaw channels, which we solve analytically, aiming to derive design principles for self-steering particles. Based on symmetry properties of a particle, its equations of motion can be simplified, where we retrieve an earlier-known equation of motion for the orientation of dimer particles consisting of disks (Uspal et al 2013 Nat. Commun. 4), but now in full generality. Subsequently, these solutions are compared with particle trajectories that are obtained numerically. For mirror-symmetric particles, excellent agreement between the analytical and numerical solutions is found. For particles lacking mirror symmetry, the analytic solutions provide means to classify the motion based on particle geometry, while we find that taking the side-wall interactions into account is important to accurately describe the trajectories.",3
Pressure-induced amorphization and reactivity of solid dimethyl acetylene probed by in situ FTIR and Raman spectroscopy.,"Conjugated polymers are prominent semiconductors that have unique electric conductivity and photoluminescence. Synthesis of conjugated polymers under high pressure is extremely appealing because it does not require a catalyst or solvent used in conventional chemical methods. Transformation of acetylene and many of its derivatives to conjugated polymers using high pressure has been successfully achieved, but not with dimethyl acetylene (DMA). In this work, we present a high-pressure study on solid DMA using a diamond anvil cell up to 24.4 GPa at room temperature characterized by in situ Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectroscopy. Our results show that solid DMA exists in a phase II crystal structure and is stable up to 12 GPa. Above this pressure, amorphization was initiated and the process was completed at 24.4 GPa. The expected polymeric transformation was not evident upon compression, but only observed upon decompression from a threshold compression pressure (e.g. 14.4 GPa). In situ florescence measurements suggest excimer formation via crystal defects, which induces the chemical reactions. The vibrational spectral analysis suggests the products contain the amorphous poly(DMA) and possibly additional amorphous hydrogenated carbon material.",3
Evidence of universal inverse-third power law for the shielding-induced fractional decrease in apex field enhancement factor at large spacings: a response via accurate Laplace-type calculations.,"Numerical simulations are important when assessing the many characteristics of field emission related phenomena. In small simulation domains, the electrostatic effect from the boundaries is known to influence the calculated apex field enhancement factor (FEF) of the emitter, but no established dependence has been reported at present. In this work, we report the dependence of the lateral size, L, and the height, H, of the simulation domain on the apex-FEF of a single conducting ellipsoidal emitter. Firstly, we analyze the error, epsilon, in the calculation of the apex-FEF as a function of H and L. Importantly, our results show that the effects of H and L on epsilon are scale invariant, allowing one to predict epsilon for ratios L/h and H/h, where h is the height of the emitter. Next, we analyze the fractional change of the apex-FEF, delta, from a single emitter, [Formula: see text], and a pair, [Formula: see text]. We show that small relative errors in [Formula: see text] (i.e. [Formula: see text]), due to the finite domain size, are sufficient to alter the functional dependence [Formula: see text], where c is the distance from the emitters in the pair. We show that [Formula: see text] obeys a recently proposed power law decay (Forbes 2016 J. Appl. Phys. 120 054302), at sufficiently large distances in the limit of infinite domain size ([Formula: see text], say), which is not observed when using a long time established exponential decay (Bonard et al 2001 Adv. Mater. 13 184) or a more sophisticated fitting formula proposed recently by Harris et al (2015 AIP Adv. 5 087182). We show that the inverse-third power law functional dependence is respected for various systems like infinity arrays and small clusters of emitters with different shapes. Thus, [Formula: see text], with m = 3, is suggested to be a universal signature of the charge-blunting effect in small clusters or arrays, at sufficient large distances between emitters with any shape. These results improve the physical understanding of the field electron emission theory to accurately characterize emitters in small clusters or arrays.",3
Invasion of gas into mica nanopores: a molecular dynamics study.,The invasion of gas into liquid-filled nanopores is encountered in many engineering problems but is not yet well understood. We report molecular dynamics simulations of the invasion of methane gas into water-filled mica pores with widths of 2-6 nm. Gas invades into a pore only when the pressure exceeds a breakthrough pressure and a thin residual water film is left on the mica wall as the gas phase moves deeper into the pore. The gas breakthrough pressure of pores as narrow as 2 nm can be modeled reasonably well by the capillary pressure if the finite thickness of residual liquid water film and the liquid-gas interface are taken into account. The movement of the front of the liquid meniscus during gas invasion can be quantitatively described using the classical hydrodynamics when the negative slip length on the strongly hydrophilic mica walls is taken into account. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the gas invasion in the system studied here will form the foundation for quantitative prediction of gas invasion in practical porous media.,3
Role of zero-point effects in stabilizing the ground state structure of bulk Fe2P.,"Structural stability of Fe2P is investigated in detail using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory. While the orthorhombic C23 phase is found to be energetically more stable, the experiments suggest it to be hexagonal C22 phase. In the present study, we show that in order to obtain the correct ground state structure of Fe2P from the first-principles based methods it is utmost necessary to consider the zero-point effects such as zero-point vibrations and spin fluctuations. This study demonstrates an exceptional case where a bulk material is stabilized by quantum effects, which are usually important in low-dimensional materials. Our results also indicate the possibility of magnetic field induced structural quantum phase transition in Fe2P, which should form the basis for further theoretical and experimental efforts.",3
Optical absorption by indirect excitons in a transition metal dichalcogenide/hexagonal boron nitride heterostructure.,"We study optical transitions in spatially indirect excitons in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) heterostructures separated by an integer number of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) monolayers. By solving the Schrodinger equation with the Keldysh potential for a spatially indirect exciton, we obtain eigenfunctions and eigenenergies for the ground and excited states and study their dependence on the interlayer separation, controlled by varying the number of h-BN monolayers. The oscillator strength, optical absorption coefficient, and optical absorption factor, the fraction of incoming photons absorbed in the TMDC/h-BN/TMDC heterostructure, are evaluated and studied as a function of the interlayer separation. Using input parameters from the existing literature which give the largest and the smallest spatially indirect exciton binding energy, we provide upper and lower bounds on all quantities presented.",3
Two-qubit logical operations in three quantum dots system.,"We consider a model of two interacting always-on, exchange-only qubits for which controlled phase (CPHASE), controlled NOT (CNOT), quantum Fourier transform (QFT) and SWAP operations can be implemented only in a few electrical pulses in a nanosecond time scale. Each qubit is built of three quantum dots (TQD) in a triangular geometry with three electron spins which are always kept coupled by exchange interactions only. The qubit states are encoded in a doublet subspace and are fully electrically controlled by a voltage applied to gate electrodes. The two qubit quantum gates are realized by short electrical pulses which change the triangular symmetry of TQD and switch on exchange interaction between the qubits. We found an optimal configuration to implement the CPHASE gate by a single pulse of the order 2.3 ns. Using this gate, in combination with single qubit operations, we searched for optimal conditions to perform the other gates: CNOT, QFT and SWAP. Our studies take into account environment effects and leakage processes as well. The results suggest that the system can be implemented for fault tolerant quantum computations.",3
Swelling kinetics and electrical charge transport in PEDOT:PSS thin films exposed to water vapor.,"We report the swelling kinetics and evolution of the electrical charge transport in poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) thin films subjected to water vapor. Polymer films swell by the diffusion of water vapor and are found to undergo structural relaxations. Upon exposure to water vapor, primarily the hygroscopic PSS shell, which surrounds the conducting PEDOT-rich cores, takes up water vapor and subsequently swells. We found that the degree of swelling largely depends on the PEDOT to PSS ratio. Swelling driven microscopic rearrangement of the conducting PEDOT-rich cores in the PSS matrix strongly influences the electrical charge transport of the polymer film. Swelling induced increase as well as decrease of electrical resistance are observed in polymer films having different PEDOT to PSS ratio. This anomalous charge transport behavior in PEDOT:PSS films is reconciled by taking into account the contrasting swelling behavior of the PSS and the conducting PEDOT-rich cores leading to spatial segregation of PSS in films with PSS as a minority phase and by a net increase in mean separation between conducting PEDOT-rich cores for films having abundance of PSS.",3
Modal analysis of the thermal conductivity of nanowires: examining unique thermal transport features.,"In this study, unique thermal transport features of nanowires over bulk materials are investigated using a combined analysis based on lattice dynamics and equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD). The evaluation of the thermal conductivity (TC) of Lenard-Jones nanowires becomes feasible due to the multi-step normal mode decomposition (NMD) procedure implemented in the study. A convergence issue of the TC of nanowires is addressed by the NMD implementation for two case studies, which employ pristine nanowires (PNW) and superlattice nanowires. Interestingly, mode relaxation times at low frequencies of acoustic branches exhibit signs of approaching constant values, thus indicating the convergence of TC. The TC evaluation procedure is further verified by implementing EMD-based Green-Kubo analysis, which is based on a fundamentally different physical perspective. Having verified the NMD procedure, the non-monotonic trend of the TC of nanowires is addressed. It is shown that the principal cause for the observed trend is due to the competing effects of long wavelength phonons and phonon-surface scatterings as the nanowire's cross-sectional width is changed. A computational procedure is developed to decompose the different modal contribution to the TC of shell alloy nanowires (SANWs) using virtual crystal NMD and the Allen-Feldman theory. Several important conclusions can be drawn from the results. A propagons to non-propagons boundary appeared, resulting in a cut-off frequency (omega cut); moreover, as alloy atomic mass is increased, omega cut shifts to lower frequencies. The existence of non-propagons partly causes the low TC of SANWs. It can be seen that modes with low frequencies demonstrate a similar behavior to corresponding modes of PNWs. Moreover, lower group velocities associated with higher alloy atomic mass resulted in a lower TC of SANWs.",3
Ba9V3Se15: a novel compound with spin chains.,"In this work, a novel compound Ba9V3Se15 with one-dimensional (1D) spin chains was synthesized under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions. It was systematically characterized via structural, magnetic, thermodynamic and transport measurements. Ba9V3Se15 crystallizes into a hexagonal structure with a space group of P-6c2 (188) and the lattice constants of a = b = 9.5745(7) A and c = 18.7814(4) A. The crystal structure consists of face-sharing octahedral VSe6 chains along c axis, which are trimeric and arranged in a triangular lattice in ab-plane. Ba9V3Se15 is a semiconductor and undergoes complex magnetic transitions. In the zero-field-cooled (ZFC) process with magnetic field of 10 Oe, Ba9V3Se15 sequentially undergoes ferrimagnetic and spin cluster glass transition at 2.5 K and 3.3 K, respectively. When the magnetic field exceeds 50 Oe, only the ferrimagnetic transition can be observed. Above the transition temperature, the specific heat contains a significant magnetic contribution that is proportional to T (1/2). The calculation suggests that the nearest neighbor (NN) intra-chain antiferromagnetic exchange J 1 is much larger than the next nearest neighbor (NNN) intra-chain ferromagnetic exchange J 2. Therefore, Ba9V3Se15 can be regarded as an effective ferromagnetic chains with effective spin-1/2 by the formation of the V(2)(( downward arrow)) V(1)(( upward arrow)) V(2)(( downward arrow)) cluster.",3
Superconductivity switch from spin-singlet to -triplet pairing in a topological superconducting junction.,"The interedge coupling is the cardinal characteristic of the narrow quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator, and thus could bring about exotic transport phenomena. Herein, we present a theoretical investigation of the spin-resolved Andreev reflection (AR) in a QSH insulator strip touching on two neighbouring ferromagnetic insulators and one s-wave superconductor. It is demonstrated that, due to the interplay of the interedge coupling and ferromagnetic configuration, there could be not only usual local ARs leading to the spin-singlet pairing with the incident electron and Andreev-reflected hole from different spin subbands, but also novel local ARs giving rise to the spin-triplet pairing from the same spin subband. However, only the latter exists in the absence of the interedge coupling, and therefore the two pairings in turn testify the helical spin texture of the edge states. By proper tuning of the band structures of the ferromagnetic layers, under the resonance bias voltage, the usual and novel local ARs of [Formula: see text] can be all exhibited, resulting in fully spin-polarized pure spin-singlet superconductivity and pure spin-triplet superconductivity, respectively, which suggests a superconductivity switch from spin-singlet to -triplet pairing by electrical control. The results can be experimentally confirmed by the tunneling conductance and the noise power.",3
Investigation of TbMn2O5 by polarized neutron diffraction.,"In order to make a new approach to the elucidation of the microscopic mechanisms of multiferroicity in the RMn2O5 family, experiments with different methods of polarized neutrons scattering were performed on a TbMn2O5 single crystal. We employed three different techniques of polarized neutron diffraction without the analysis after scattering, the XYZ-polarization analysis, and technique of spherical neutron polarimetry (SNP). Measurements with SNP were undertaken both with and without external electric field. A characteristic difference in the population of 'right' and 'left' helix domains in all magnetically ordered phases of TbMn2O5, was observed. This difference can be controlled by an external electric field in the field-cooled mode. The analysis of the results gives an evidence that antisymmetric Dzyaloshinsky-Moria exchange is effective in all the magnetic phases in TbMn2O5.",3
Accurate quasiparticle calculation of x-ray photoelectron spectra of solids.,"It has been highly desired to provide an accurate and reliable method to calculate core electron binding energies (CEBEs) of crystals and to understand the final state screening effect on a core hole in high resolution x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), because the DeltaSCF method cannot be simply used for bulk systems. We propose to use the quasiparticle calculation based on many-body perturbation theory for this problem. In this study, CEBEs of band-gapped crystals, silicon, diamond, beta-SiC, BN, and AlP, are investigated by means of the GW approximation (GWA) using the full omega integration and compared with the preexisting XPS data. The screening effect on a deep core hole is also investigated in detail by evaluating the relaxation energy (RE) from the core and valence contributions separately. Calculated results show that not only the valence electrons but also the core electrons have an important contribution to the RE, and the GWA have a tendency to underestimate CEBEs due to the excess RE. This underestimation can be improved by introducing the self-screening correction to the GWA. The resulting C1s, B1s, N1s, Si2p, and Al2p CEBEs are in excellent agreement with the experiments within 1 eV absolute error range. The present self-screening corrected GW approach has the capability to achieve the highly accurate prediction of CEBEs without any empirical parameter for band-gapped crystals, and provide a more reliable theoretical approach than the conventional DeltaSCF-DFT method.",3
Effective field theory of chiral spin liquid between ordered phases in a kagome antiferromagnet.,"We propose in this work an effective field theory description of the chiral spin liquid state in a Heisenberg spin system on a kagome lattice. To this end, we derive the low-energy effective theory of a kagome (isotropic) Heisenberg antiferromagnet around its ordered ground states found numerically and show that quantum fluctuations induced by further neighbor spin exchanges are equally strong as those from the first neighbor. We use a chiral order parameter theory to argue for the occurrence of finite temperature chiral symmetry breaking transition into a chiral ordered state in a kagome antiferromagnet with further neighbor spin exchange interactions. We compute the chiral symmetry breaking term in the effective ground state energy and show that chiral spin liquid necessarily occurs in the ground state of a kagome antiferromagnet with the first three nearest-neighbor spin exchange interactions. Finally, we consider the quantum criticality of the kagome antiferromagnet and show that a Chern-Simons term emerges naturally at the transition between the two ordered states that satisfy an appropriate 'matching condition' that we derive, providing an explanation for why chiral spin liquid could occur at the transition between appropriate ordered states. This emergent Chern-Simons term is the low energy effective theory of the chiral spin liquid state, where the chirality is the immediate consequence of the breaking of discrete symmetries by this topological field theory.",3
Ab initio effective deformation potentials of phosphorene and consistency checks.,"Electron-phonon interaction in single-layer phosphorene is studied from first principles based on the density functional theory, using finite displacement method. Scattering rates and mobility are numerically evaluated for carriers in the conduction and valence bands. A criterion for the selection of phonon wave-vector in scatterings is proposed. Scattering selection rules are studied, utilizing group theory for the structure with [Formula: see text] space group symmetry. Approximate analytical formulas for scattering rates, adopting the anisotropy intrinsic to phosphorene, are derived, and effective deformation potentials are evaluated by fitting the formulas to numerical scattering rates extracted from ab initio calculations.",3
Measuring the excitations in a new S = 1/2 quantum spin chain material with competing interactions.,"Recently a new one-dimensional (1D) quantum spin chain system has been reported: catena-dichloro(2-Cl-3Mpy)copper(II), (where 2-Cl-3Mpy=2-chloro-3-methylpyridine). Preliminary calculations and bulk magnetic property measurements indicate that this system does not undergo magnetic ordering down to 1.8 K and is a prime candidate for investigating frustration in a J 1/J 2 system (where the nearest neighbour interactions, J 1, are ferromagnetic and the next nearest neighbour interactions, J 2, are antiferromagnetic). Calculations predicted three possible magnetic interaction strengths for J 1 below 6 meV depending on the orientation of the ligand. For one of the predicted J 1 values, the existence of a quantum critical point is implied. A deuterated sample of catena-dichloro(2-Cl-3Mpy)copper(II) was synthesised and the excitations measured using inelastic neutron scattering. Scattering indicated the most likely scenario involves spin-chains where each chain consists of only one of the three possible magnetic excitations in this material, rather than the completely random array of exchange interactions within each chain as predicted by Herringer et al (2014 Chem. Eur. J. 20 8355-62). This indicates the possibility of tuning the chemical structure to favour a system which may exhibit a quantum critical point.",3
Collective gradient sensing and chemotaxis: modeling and recent developments.,"Cells measure a vast variety of signals, from their environment's stiffness to chemical concentrations and gradients; physical principles strongly limit how accurately they can do this. However, when many cells work together, they can cooperate to exceed the accuracy of any single cell. In this topical review, I will discuss the experimental evidence showing that cells collectively sense gradients of many signal types, and the models and physical principles involved. I also propose new routes by which experiments and theory can expand our understanding of these problems.",3
Mechanical and electronic properties of Janus monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides.,"The mechanical and electronic properties of Janus monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides MXY (M = Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W; X/Y = S, Se, Te) were investigated using density functional theory. Results show that breaking the out-of-plane structural symmetry can be used to tune the electronic and mechanical behavior of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. The band gaps of monolayer WXY and MoXY are in the ranges of 0.16-1.91 and 0.94-1.69 eV, respectively. A semiconductor to metallic phase transition occurred in Janus monolayer MXY (M = Ti, Zr and Hf). The monolayers MXY (M = V, Nb, Ta and Cr) show metallic characteristics, which show no dependence on the structural symmetry breaking. The mechanical properties of MXY depended on the composition. Monolayer MXY (M = Mo, Ti, Zr, Hf and W) showed brittle characteristic, whereas monolayer CrXY and VXY are with ductile characteristic. The in-plane stiffness of pristine and Janus monolayer MXY are in the range between 22 and 158 N m(-1). The tunable electronic and mechanical properties of these 2D materials would advance the development of ultra-sensitive detectors, nanogenerators, low-power electronics, and energy harvesting and electromechanical systems.",3
Pressure gradients fail to predict diffusio-osmosis.,"We present numerical simulations of diffusio-osmotic flow, i.e. the fluid flow generated by a concentration gradient along a solid-fluid interface. In our study, we compare a number of distinct approaches that have been proposed for computing such flows and compare them with a reference calculation based on direct, non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. As alternatives, we consider schemes that compute diffusio-osmotic flow from the gradient of the chemical potentials of the constituent species and from the gradient of the component of the pressure tensor parallel to the interface. We find that the approach based on treating chemical potential gradients as external forces acting on various species agrees with the direct simulations, thereby supporting the approach of Marbach et al (2017 J. Chem. Phys. 146 194701). In contrast, an approach based on computing the gradients of the microscopic pressure tensor does not reproduce the direct non-equilibrium results.",3
Tunable magnetic coupling in Mn-doped monolayer MoS2 under lattice strain.,"First-principles calculations are conducted to study the electronic and magnetic states of Mn-doped monolayer MoS2 under lattice strain. Mn-doped MoS2 exhibits half-metallic and ferromagnetic (FM) characteristics in which the majority spin channel exhibits metallic features but there is a bandgap in the minority spin channel. The FM state and the total magnetic moment of 1 micro B are always maintained for the larger supercells of monolayer MoS2 with only one doped Mn, no matter under tensile or compressive strain. Furthermore, the FM state will be enhanced by the tensile strain if two Mo atoms are substituted by Mn atoms in the monolayer MoS2. The magnetic moment increases up to 0.50 micro B per unit cell at a tensile strain of 7%. However, the Mn-doped MoS2 changes to metallic and antiferromagnetic under compressive strain. The spin polarization of Mn 3d orbitals disappears gradually with increasing compressive strain, and the superexchange interaction between Mn atoms increases gradually. The results suggest that the electronic and magnetic properties of Mn-doped monolayer MoS2 can be effectively modulated by strain engineering providing insight into application to electronic and spintronic devices.",3
Simplified DFT methods for consistent structures and energies of large systems.,"Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) is routinely used for the fast electronic structure computation of large systems and will most likely continue to be the method of choice for the generation of reliable geometries in the foreseeable future. Here, we present a hierarchy of simplified DFT methods designed for consistent structures and non-covalent interactions of large systems with particular focus on molecular crystals. The covered methods are a minimal basis set Hartree-Fock (HF-3c), a small basis set screened exchange hybrid functional (HSE-3c), and a generalized gradient approximated functional evaluated in a medium-sized basis set (B97-3c), all augmented with semi-classical correction potentials. We give an overview on the methods design, a comprehensive evaluation on established benchmark sets for geometries and lattice energies of molecular crystals, and highlight some realistic applications on large organic crystals with several hundreds of atoms in the primitive unit cell.",3
"Ab initio study for the IR spectroscopy of PbTiO3 and PbZrO3, primary blocks of PbZr1-x Ti x O3.","PbTiO3 (PT) and PbZrO3 (PZ) are the two primary blocks of the solid solution PbZr1-x Ti x O3 (PZT). They can be modelled in different ways; but, in order to do comparable DFT calculations on PZT, with different values of x, one must find a unique method that can be used for both PT and PZ. In particular, we want to evaluate their vibrational properties to compare them with experimental data. Density functional theory (DFT) is used to perform structure geometry optimizations and electronic structure calculations, both on low- and high-temperature phase. Then, harmonic vibrational frequencies of their low-temperature phase are determined for transverse and longitudinal optical (TO & LO) phonons. Moreover, a detailed study of the eigenvectors shows that accurate calculations are necessary to correctly interpret and understand the IR spectra. In the end, the comparison of our theoretical results with previous experimental and theoretical data confirm the strong potential of the SOGGA (second-order generalized gradient approximation) functional to correctly describe PT, PZ and, hopefully, PZT; especially their structural and vibrational properties.",3
Benchmark study of ionization potentials and electron affinities of armchair single-walled carbon nanotubes using density functional theory.,"The intrinsic parameters of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) such as ionization potential (IP) and electron affinity (EA) are closely related to their unique properties and associated applications. In this work, we demonstrated the success of optimal tuning method based on range-separated (RS) density functionals for both accurate and efficient prediction of vertical IPs and electron affinities (EAs) of a series of armchair single-walled carbon nanotubes C20n H20 (n = 2-6) compared to the high-level IP/EA equation-of-motion coupled-cluster method with single and double substitutions (IP/EA-EOM-CCSD). Notably, the resulting frontier orbital energies (-epsilon HOMO and -epsilon LUMO) from the tuning method exhibit an excellent approximation to the corresponding IPs and EAs, that significantly outperform other conventional density functionals. In addition, it is suggested that the RS density functionals that possess both a fixed amount of exact exchange in the short-range and a correct long-range asymptotic behavior are suitable for calculating electronic structures of finite-sized CNTs. Next the performance of density functionals for description of various molecular properties such as chemical potential, hardness and electrophilicity are assessed as a function of tube length. Thanks to the efficiency and accuracy of this tuning method, the related behaviors of much longer armchair single-walled CNTs until C200H20 were studied. Lastly, the present work is proved to provide an efficient theoretical tool for future materials design and reliable characterization of other interesting properties of CNT-based systems.",3
Local deformation gradients in epitaxial Pb(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3 layers investigated by transmission electron microscopy.,"Lead zirconate titanate samples are used for their piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties in various types of micro-devices. Epitaxial layers of tetragonal perovskites have a tendency to relax by forming [Formula: see text] ferroelastic domains. The accommodation of the a/c/a/c polydomain structure on a flat substrate leads to nanoscale deformation gradients which locally influence the polarization by flexoelectric effect. Here, we investigated the deformation fields in epitaxial layers of Pb(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3 grown on SrTiO3 substrates using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We found that the deformation gradients depend on the domain walls inclination ([Formula: see text] or [Formula: see text] to the substrate interface) of the successive [Formula: see text] domains and we describe three different a/c/a domain configurations: one configuration with parallel a-domains and two configurations with perpendicular a-domains (V-shaped and hat-[Formula: see text]-shaped). In the parallel configuration, the c-domains contain horizontal and vertical gradients of out-of-plane deformation. In the V-shaped and hat-[Formula: see text]-shaped configurations, the c-domains exhibit a bending deformation field with vertical gradients of in-plane deformation. Each of these configurations is expected to have a different influence on the polarization and so the local properties of the film. The deformation gradients were measured using dark-field electron holography, a TEM technique, which offers a good sensitivity (0.1%) and a large field-of-view (hundreds of nanometers). The measurements are compared with finite element simulations.",3
Investigation of indirect excitons in bulk 2H-MoS2 using transmission electron energy-loss spectroscopy.,"We have investigated indirect excitons in bulk 2H-MoS2 using transmission electron energy-loss spectroscopy. The electron energy-loss spectra were measured for various momentum transfer values parallel to the [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] directions of the Brillouin zone. The results allowed the identification of the indirect excitons between the valence band K v and conduction band Lambdac points, the Gammav and K c points as well as adjacent K v and [Formula: see text] points. The energy-momentum dispersions for the K v-Lambdac, Gammav-K c and K v1-[Formula: see text] excitons along the [Formula: see text] line are presented. The former two transitions exhibit a quadratic dispersion which allowed calculating their effective exciton masses based on the effective mass approximation. The K v1-[Formula: see text] transition follows a more linear dispersion relationship.",3
Thermoelectricity in correlated narrow-gap semiconductors.,"We review many-body effects, their microscopic origin, as well as their impact on thermoelectricity in correlated narrow-gap semiconductors. Members of this class-such as FeSi and FeSb2-display an unusual temperature dependence in various observables: insulating with large thermopowers at low temperatures, they turn bad metals at temperatures much smaller than the size of their gaps. This insulator-to-metal crossover is accompanied by spectral weight-transfers over large energies in the optical conductivity and by a gradual transition from activated to Curie-Weiss-like behaviour in the magnetic susceptibility. We show a retrospective of the understanding of these phenomena, discuss the relation to heavy-fermion Kondo insulators-such as Ce3Bi4Pt3 for which we present new results-and propose a general classification of paramagnetic insulators. From the latter, FeSi emerges as an orbital-selective Kondo insulator. Focussing on intermetallics such as silicides, antimonides, skutterudites, and Heusler compounds we showcase successes and challenges for the realistic simulation of transport properties in the presence of electronic correlations. Further, we explore new avenues in which electronic correlations may contribute to the improvement of thermoelectric performance.",3
Spin-glass polyamorphism induced by a magnetic field in LaMnO3 single crystal.,"We present experimental evidence of field-driven transition in spin-glass state, similar to pressure-induced transition between amorphous phases in structural and metallic glasses, attributed to the polyamorphism phenomena. Cusp in temperature dependences of ac magnetic susceptibility of weakly disordered LaMnO3 single crystal is registered below the temperature of magnetic ordering. Frequency dependence of the cusp temperature proves its spin-glass origin. The transition induced by a magnetic field in spin-glass state, is manifested by peculiarity in dependence of cusp temperature on applied magnetic field. Field dependent maximum of heat capacity is observed in the same magnetic field and temperature range.",3
Development of half metallicity within mixed magnetic phase of Cu1-x Co x MnSb alloy.,"Cubic half-Heusler Cu1-x Co x MnSb ([Formula: see text]) compounds have been investigated both experimentally and theoretically for their magnetic, transport and electronic properties in search of possible half metallic antiferromagnetism. The systems (Cu,Co)MnSb are of particular interest as the end member alloys CuMnSb and CoMnSb are semi metallic (SM) antiferromagnetic (AFM) and half metallic (HM) ferromagnetic (FM), respectively. Clearly, Co-doping at the Cu-site of CuMnSb introduces changes in the carrier concentration at the Fermi level that may lead to half metallic ground state but there remains a persistent controversy whether the AFM to FM transition occurs simultaneously. Our experimental results reveal that the AFM to FM magnetic transition occurs through a percolation mechanism where Co-substitution gradually suppresses the AFM phase and forces FM polarization around every dopant cobalt. As a result a mixed magnetic phase is realized within this composition range while a nearly HM band structure is developed already at the 10% Co-doping. Absence of T (2) dependence in the resistivity variation at low T-region serves as an indirect proof of opening up an energy gap at the Fermi surface in one of the spin channels. This is further corroborated by the ab initio electronic structure calculations that suggests that a nearly ferromagnetic half-metallic ground state is stabilized by Sb-p holes produced upon Co doping.",3
Comparative study of the compensated semi-metals LaBi and LuBi: a first-principles approach.,"We have investigated the electronic structures of LaBi and LuBi, employing the full-potential all electron method as implemented in Wien2k. Using this, we have studied in detail both the bulk and the surface states of these materials. From our band structure calculations we find that LuBi, like LaBi, is a compensated semi-metal with almost equal and sizable electron and hole pockets. In analogy with experimental evidence in LaBi, we thus predict that LuBi will also be a candidate for extremely large magneto-resistance (XMR), which should be of immense technological interest. Our calculations reveal that LaBi, despite being gapless in the bulk spectrum, displays the characteristic features of a [Formula: see text] topological semi-metal, resulting in gapless Dirac cones on the surface, whereas LuBi only shows avoided band inversion in the bulk and is thus a conventional compensated semi-metal with extremely large magneto-resistance.",3
Universal shape characteristics for the mesoscopic star-shaped polymer via dissipative particle dynamics simulations.,"In this paper we study the shape characteristics of star-like polymers in various solvent quality using a mesoscopic level of modeling. The dissipative particle dynamics simulations are performed for the homogeneous and four different heterogeneous star polymers with the same molecular weight. We analyse the gyration radius and asphericity at the poor, good and theta-solvent regimes. Detailed explanation based on interplay between enthalpic and entropic contributions to the free energy and analyses on of the asphericity of individual branches are provided to explain the increase of the apsphericity in theta-solvent regime.",3
"Role of random magnetic anisotropy on the valence, magnetocaloric and resistivity properties in a hexagonal Sm2Ni0.87Si2.87 compound.","In this work, we report the effect of random magnetic anisotropy (RMA) on the valence, magnetocaloric and resistivity properties in a glassy intermetallic material Sm2Ni0.87Si2.87. On the basis of detailed studies on the valence band and core level electronic structure, we have established that both the Sm(3+) and Sm(2+) ions are present in the system, suggesting the compound to be of mixed valence in nature. The significant observation of positive magnetic entropy change in zero-field cooled measurement has been argued due to the presence of RMA that develops due to local electronic environmental variations between the rare-earth ions in the system. The quantum interference effect caused by the elastic electron-electron interaction is responsible for the resistivity upturn at low-temperature for this disordered metallic conductor.",3
Single-particle fusion of influenza viruses reveals complex interactions with target membranes.,"The first step in infection of influenza A virus is contact with the host cell membrane, with which it later fuses. The composition of the target bilayer exerts a complex influence on both fusion efficiency and time. Here, an in vitro, single-particle approach is used to study this effect. Using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and a microfluidic flow cell, the hemifusion of single virions is visualized. Hemifusion efficiency and kinetics are studied while altering target bilayer cholesterol content and sialic-acid donor. Cholesterol ratios tested were 0%, 10%, 20%, and 40%. Sialic-acid donors GD1a and GYPA were used. Both cholesterol ratio and sialic-acid donors proved to have a significant effect on hemifusion efficiency. Furthermore, comparison between GD1a and GYPA conditions shows that the cholesterol dependence of the hemifusion time is severely affected by the sialic-acid donor. Only GD1a shows a clear increasing trend in hemifusion efficiency and time with increasing cholesterol concentration of the target bilayer with maximum rates for GD1A and 40% cholesterol. Overall our results show that sialic acid donor and target bilayer composition should be carefully chosen, depending on the desired hemifusion time and efficiency in the experiment.",3
Critical exponents and universal magnetic behavior of noncentrosymmetric Fe0.6Co0.4Si.,"The critical magnetic properties of a non-centrosymmetric B20 cubic helimagnet Fe0.6Co0.4Si are investigated using magnetization isotherms. It belongs to the 3D-Heisenberg universality class with short range magnetic coupling as inferred from the self-consistent critical exponents [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] in combination with exchange interaction [Formula: see text]. Itinerant magnetic nature of the compound is realized by the Rhodes-Wholfarth analysis. Field-induced weak first (para[Formula: see text]helical) to second (para[Formula: see text]field-polarized) order transition is reported to occur at low critical field due to the weak spin-orbit coupling arising from the weak Dzyaloshinksii-Moriya interactions. Our study suggests the distinct phenomenological magnetic structures for Fe-based cubic magnets (Fe1-x Co x Si and FeGe) and MnSi which cause contrasting physical properties.",3
Nature of magnetization and lateral spin-orbit interaction in gated semiconductor nanowires.,"Semiconductor nanowires are interesting candidates for realization of spintronics devices. In this paper we study electronic states and effects of lateral spin-orbit coupling (LSOC) in a one-dimensional asymmetrically biased nanowire using the Hartree-Fock method with Dirac interaction. We have shown that spin polarization can be triggered by LSOC at finite source-drain bias,as a result of numerical noise representing a random magnetic field due to wiring or a random background magnetic field by Earth magnetic field, for instance. The electrons spontaneously arrange into spin rows in the wire due to electron interactions leading to a finite spin polarization. The direction of polarization is, however, random at zero source-drain bias. We have found that LSOC has an effect on orientation of spin rows only in the case when source-drain bias is applied.",3
Basic modelling of transport in 2D wave-mechanical nanodots and billiards with balanced gain and loss mediated by complex potentials.,"Non-Hermitian quantum mechanics with parity-time (PT) symmetry is presently gaining great interest, especially within the fields of photonics and optics. Here, we give a brief overview of low-dimensional semiconductor nanodevices using the example of a quantum dot with input and output leads, which are mimicked by imaginary potentials for gain and loss, and how wave functions, particle flow, coalescence of levels and associated breaking of PT symmetry may be analysed within such a framework. Special attention is given to the presence of exceptional points and symmetry breaking. Related features for musical string instruments and 'wolf-notes' are outlined briefly with suggestions for further experiments.",3
Complex magnetic behaviour and evidence of a superspin glass state in the binary intermetallic compound Er5Pd2.,"The binary intermetallic compound Er5Pd2 has been investigated using dc and ac magnetic susceptibilities, magnetic memory effect, isothermal magnetization, non-linear dc susceptibility, heat capacity and magnetocaloric effect studies. Interestingly, even though the compound does not show geometrical frustration it undergoes glassy magnetic phase transition below 17.2 K. Investigation of dc magnetization and heat capacity data divulged absence of long-ranged magnetic ordering. Through the magnetic memory effect, time dependent magnetization and ac susceptibility studies it was revealed that the compound undergoes glass-like freezing below 17.2 K. Analysis of frequency dependence of this transition temperature through scaling and Arrhenius law; along with the Mydosh parameter indicate, that the dynamics in Er5Pd2 are due to the presence of strongly interacting superspins rather than individual spins. This phase transition was further investigated by non-linear dc susceptibility and was characterized by static critical exponents gamma and delta. Our results indicate that this compound shows the signature of superspin glass at low temperature. Additionally, both conventional and inverse magnetocaloric effect was observed with a large value of magnetic entropy change and relative cooling power. Our results suggest that Er5Pd2 can be classified as a superspin glass system with large magnetocaloric effect.",3
Quantum transport through MoS2 constrictions defined by photodoping.,"We present a device scheme to explore mesoscopic transport through molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) constrictions using photodoping. The devices are based on van-der-Waals heterostructures where few-layer MoS2 flakes are partially encapsulated by hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and covered by a few-layer graphene flake to fabricate electrical contacts. Since the as-fabricated devices are insulating at low temperatures, we use photo-induced remote doping in the hBN substrate to create free charge carriers in the MoS2 layer. On top of the device, we place additional metal structures, which define the shape of the constriction and act as shadow masks during photodoping of the underlying MoS2/hBN heterostructure. Low temperature two- and four-terminal transport measurements show evidence of quantum confinement effects.",3
"Electronic scattering, focusing, and resonance by a spherical barrier in Weyl semimetals.","We solve the Weyl electron scattered by a spherical step potential barrier. Tuning the incident energy and the potential radius, one can enter both quasiclassical and quantum regimes. Transport features related to far-field currents and integrated cross sections are studied to reveal the preferred forward scattering. In the quasiclassical regime, a strong focusing effect along the incident spherical axis is found in addition to optical caustic patterns. In the quantum regime, at energies of successive angular momentum resonances, a polar aggregation of electron density is found inside the potential. The findings will be useful in transport studies and electronic lens applications in Weyl systems.",3
Effect of the shell material and confinement type on the conversion efficiency of core/shell quantum dot nanocrystal solar cells.,"In this study, the effects of the shell material and confinement type on the conversion efficiency of core/shell quantum dot nanocrystal (QDNC) solar cells have been investigated in detail. For this purpose, the conventional, i.e. original, detailed balance model, developed by Shockley and Queisser to calculate an upper limit for the conversion efficiency of silicon p-n junction solar cells, is modified in a simple and effective way to calculate the conversion efficiency of core/shell QDNC solar cells. Since the existing model relies on the gap energy ([Formula: see text]) of the solar cell, it does not make an estimation about the effect of QDNC materials on the efficiency of the solar cells, and gives the same efficiency values for several QDNC solar cells with the same [Formula: see text]. The proposed modification, however, estimates a conversion efficiency in relation to the material properties and also the confinement type of the QDNCs. The results of the modified model show that, in contrast to the original one, the conversion efficiencies of different QDNC solar cells, even if they have the same [Formula: see text], become different depending upon the confinement type and shell material of the core/shell QDNCs, and this is crucial in the design and fabrication of the new generation solar cells to predict the confinement type and also appropriate QDNC materials for better efficiency.",3
Role of electron back action on photons in hybridizing double-layer graphene plasmons with localized photons.,"In this paper, we deal with the electromagnetic coupling between an incident surface-plasmon-polariton wave and relativistic electrons in two graphene layers. Our previous investigation was limited to single-layer graphene (Iurov et al 2017 Phys. Rev. B 96 081408). However, the present work, is both an expanded and extended version of this previous Phys. Rev. B paper after having included very detailed theoretical formalisms and extensive comparisons of results from either one or two graphene layers embedded in a dielectric medium. The additional retarded Coulomb interaction between two graphene layers will compete with the coupling between the single graphene layer and the surface of a conductor. Consequently, some distinctive features, such as triply-hybridized absorption peaks and a new acoustic-like graphene plasmon mode within the anticrossing region, have been found for the double-layer graphene system. Physically, our theory is self-consistent, in comparison with a commonly adopted perturbative theory, for studying hybrid light-plasmon modes and the electron back action on photons. Instead of usual radiation or grating-deflection field coupling, a surface-plasmon-polariton localized field coupling is introduced with completely different dispersion relations for radiative (small wave numbers) and evanescent (large wave numbers) field modes. Technically, the exactly calculated effective scattering matrix for this theory can be employed to construct an effective-medium theory in order to improve the accuracy of the well-known finite-difference time-domain method for solving Maxwell's equations numerically. Practically, the predicted triply-hybridized absorption peaks can excite polaritons only, giving rise to a possible polariton-condensation based laser.",3
Pressure-induced photoluminescence of MgO.,It is reported in this paper that pressure can promote strong photoluminescence (PL) in MgO. The PL measurements of MgO indicate that it has no obvious luminescence at pressures lower than 13 GPa. PL starts to appear upon further compression and reaches a maximum intensity at about 35 GPa. The center of the emission band shows a red shift at lower pressures and turns to a blue shift as pressure exceeds 25 GPa. The PL is preserved upon complete decompression. The defects and micro-strain due to the plastic deformation of MgO are likely responsible for the origin of the luminescence.,3
Energy shifts in photoemission lines during the tetragonal- to cubic-phase transition in BaTiO3 single crystals and systems with CoFe2O4 and NiFe2O4 overlayers.,"In BaTiO3 the phase transition from tetragonal to cubic is connected with the disappearance of the ferroelectric polarization. In photoelectron spectroscopy huge transient shifts in the binding energies of all core-level photoemission lines have been observed while heating and cooling through the Curie temperature. Excitation energies from 2 keV to 6 keV have been used to show this to be a bulk effect and not a surface effect alone. These observations are discussed in terms of charging, which results from the disappearance of the ferroelectric polarization. This mechanism has previously been proposed as the origin of electron emission in ferroelectric materials. Besides the jump-like shifts, additional permanent shifts in binding energies have been observed for the tetragonal and the cubic phase. These experimental shifts have been related to theoretical ones from ab initio calculations. In addition to BaTiO3 single crystals, systems with CoFe2O4 and NiFe2O4 overlayers on BaTiO3 have been investigated. The low conductivity of these layers sets them apart from metallic overlayers like Fe or Co, where the shifts are suppressed. This difference adds further support for charging as the origin of the effect.",3
Theory of in-plane current induced spin torque in metal/ferromagnet bilayers.,"Using a semiclassical approach that simultaneously incorporates the spin Hall effect (SHE), spin diffusion, quantum well states, and interface spin-orbit coupling (SOC), we address the interplay of these mechanisms as the origin of the spin-orbit torque (SOT) induced by in-plane currents, as observed in the normal metal/ferromagnetic metal bilayer thin films. Focusing on the bilayers with a ferromagnet much thinner than its spin diffusion length, such as Pt/Co with approximately 10 nm thickness, our approach addresses simultaneously the two contributions to the SOT, namely the spin-transfer torque (SHE-STT) due to SHE-induced spin injection, and the inverse spin Galvanic effect spin-orbit torque (ISGE-SOT) due to SOC-induced spin accumulation. The SOC produces an effective magnetic field at the interface, hence it modifies the angular momentum conservation expected for the SHE-STT. The SHE-induced spin voltage and the interface spin current are mutually dependent and, hence, are solved in a self-consistent manner. The result suggests that the SHE-STT and ISGE-SOT are of the same order of magnitude, and the spin transport mediated by the quantum well states may be an important mechanism for the experimentally observed rapid variation of the SOT with respect to the thickness of the ferromagnet.",3
Protein sequencing via nanopore based devices: a nanofluidics perspective.,"Proteins perform a huge number of central functions in living organisms, thus all the new techniques allowing their precise, fast and accurate characterization at single-molecule level certainly represent a burst in proteomics with important biomedical impact. In this review, we describe the recent progresses in the developing of nanopore based devices for protein sequencing. We start with a critical analysis of the main technical requirements for nanopore protein sequencing, summarizing some ideas and methodologies that have recently appeared in the literature. In the last sections, we focus on the physical modelling of the transport phenomena occurring in nanopore based devices. The multiscale nature of the problem is discussed and, in this respect, some of the main possible computational approaches are illustrated.",3
Can disorder act as a chemical pressure? An optical study of the Hubbard model.,"The optical properties have been studied using the dynamical mean-field theory on a disordered Hubbard model. Despite the fact that disorder turns a metal to an insulator in high dimensional correlated materials, we notice that it can enhance certain metallic behavior as if a chemical pressure is applied to the system resulting in an increase of the effective lattice bandwidth (BW). We study optical properties in such a scenario and compare results with experiments where the BW is changed through isovalent chemical substitution (keeping electron filling unaltered) and obtain remarkable similarities vindicating our claim. We also make the point that these similarities differ from some other forms of BW tuned optical effects.",3
Fermi-edge singularity and the functional renormalization group.,"We study the Fermi-edge singularity, describing the response of a degenerate electron system to optical excitation, in the framework of the functional renormalization group (fRG). Results for the (interband) particle-hole susceptibility from various implementations of fRG (one- and two-particle-irreducible, multi-channel Hubbard-Stratonovich, flowing susceptibility) are compared to the summation of all leading logarithmic (log) diagrams, achieved by a (first-order) solution of the parquet equations. For the (zero-dimensional) special case of the x-ray-edge singularity, we show that the leading log formula can be analytically reproduced in a consistent way from a truncated, one-loop fRG flow. However, reviewing the underlying diagrammatic structure, we show that this derivation relies on fortuitous partial cancellations special to the form of and accuracy applied to the x-ray-edge singularity and does not generalize.",3
Phase transitions and magnetization of the mixed-spin Ising-Heisenberg double sawtooth frustrated ladder.,"The mixed spin-(1,1/2) Ising-Heisenberg double sawtooth ladder containing a mixture of both spin-1 and spin-1/2 nodal atoms, and the spin-1/2 interstitial dimers are approximately solved by the transfer-matrix method. Here, we study in detail the ground-state phase diagrams, also influences of the bilinear exchange coupling on the rungs and cyclic four-spin exchange interaction in square plaquette of each block on the magnetization and magnetic susceptibility of the suggested ladder at low temperature. Such a double sawtooth ladder may be found in a Shastry-Sutherland lattice-type. In spite of the spin ordering of odd and even blocks being different from each other, due to the commutation relation between all different block Hamiltonians, phase diagrams, magnetization behavior and thermodynamic properties of the model are the same for odd and even blocks. We show that at low temperature, both exchange couplings can change the quality and quantity of the magnetization plateaus versus the magnetic field changes. Specially, we find a new magnetization plateau [Formula: see text] for this model. Besides, we examine the magnetic susceptibility and specific heat of the model in detail. It is proven that behaviors of the magnetization and the magnetic susceptibility coincide at low temperature. The specific heat displays diverse temperature dependencies, which include a Schottky-type peak at a special temperature interval. We observe that with increase of the bilinear exchange coupling on the rungs, second peak temperature dependence grows.",3
Two-leg ladder systems with dipole-dipole Fermion interactions.,"The ground-state phase diagram of a two-leg fermionic dipolar ladder with inter-site interactions is studied using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) techniques. We use a state-of-the-art implementation of the DMRG algorithm and finite size scaling to simulate large system sizes with high accuracy. We also consider two different model systems and explore stable phases in half and quarter filling factors. We find that in the half filling, the charge and spin gaps emerge in a finite value of the dipole-dipole and on-site interactions. In the quarter filling case, s-wave superconducting state, charge density wave, homogenous insulating and phase separation phases occur depend on the interaction values. Moreover, in the dipole-dipole interaction, the D-Mott phase emerges when the hopping terms along the chain and rung are the same, whereas, this phase has been only proposed for the anisotropic Hubbard model. In the half filling case, on the other hand, there is either charge-density wave or charged Mott order phase depends on the orientation of the dipole moments of the particles with respect to the ladder geometry.",3
Electronic transport in torsional strained Weyl semimetals.,"In a recent paper (Munoz and Soto-Garrido 2017 J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 29 445302) we have studied the effects of mechanical strain and magnetic field on the electronic transport properties in graphene. In this article we extended our work to Weyl semimetals (WSM). We show that although the WSM are 3D materials, most of the analysis done for graphene (2D material) can be carried out. In particular, we studied the electronic transport through a cylindrical region submitted to torsional strain and external magnetic field. We provide exact analytical expressions for the scattering cross section and the transmitted electronic current. In addition, we show the node-polarization effect on the current and propose a recipe to measure the torsion angle from transmission experiments.",3
Magnetocrystalline anisotropy in cobalt based magnets: a choice of correlation parameters and the relativistic effects.,"The dependence of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) in MCo5 (M = Y, La, Ce, Gd) and CoPt on the Coulomb correlations and strength of spin orbit (SO) interaction within the GGA + U scheme is investigated. A range of parameters suitable for the satisfactory description of key magnetic properties is determined. We show that for a large variation of SO interaction the MAE in these materials can be well described by the traditional second order perturbation theory. We also show that in these materials the MAE can be both proportional and negatively proportional to the orbital moment anisotropy (OMA) of Co atoms. Dependence of relativistic effects on Coulomb correlations, applicability of the second order perturbation theory for the description of MAE, and effective screening of the SO interaction in these systems are discussed using a generalized virial theorem. Such determined sets of parameters of Coulomb correlations can be used in much needed large scale atomistic simulations.",3
Static dielectric constant of water within a bilayer using recent water models: a molecular dynamics study.,"The water confined within a surfactant bilayer is studied using different water models via molecular dynamics simulations. We considered four representative rigid models of water: the SPC/E and the TIP4P/2005, which are commonly used in numerical calculations and the more recent TIP4Q and SPC/epsilon models, developed to reproduce the dielectric behaviour of pure water. The static dielectric constant of the confined water was analyzed as a function of the temperature for the four models. In all cases it decreases as the temperature increases. Additionally, the static dielectric constant of the bilayer-water system was estimated through its expression in terms of the fluctuations in the total dipole moment, usually applied for isotropic systems. The estimated dielectric was compared with the available experimental data. We found that the TIP4Q and the SPC/epsilon produce closer values to the experimental data than the other models, particularly at room temperature. It was found that the probability of finding the sodium ion close to the head of the surfactant decreases as the temperature increases, thus the head of the surfactant is more exposed to the interaction with water when the temperature is higher.",3
Influence of spin and charge fluctuations on spectra of the two-dimensional Hubbard model.,"The influence of spin and charge fluctuations on spectra of the two-dimensional fermionic Hubbard model is considered using the strong coupling diagram technique. Infinite sequences of diagrams containing ladder inserts, which describe the interaction of electrons with these fluctuations, are summed, and obtained equations are self-consistently solved for the ranges of Hubbard repulsions [Formula: see text], temperatures [Formula: see text] and electron concentrations [Formula: see text] with t the intersite hopping constant. For all considered U the system exhibits a transition to the long-range antiferromagnetic order at [Formula: see text]. At the same time no indication of charge ordering is observed. Obtained solutions agree satisfactorily with results of other approaches and obey moments sum rules. In the considered region of the U-T plane, the curve separating metallic solutions passes from [Formula: see text] at the highest temperatures to U = 2t at [Formula: see text] for half-filling. If only short-range fluctuations are allowed for the remaining part of this region is occupied by insulating solutions. Taking into account long-range fluctuations leads to strengthening of maxima tails, which transform a part of insulating solutions into bad-metal states. For low T, obtained results allow us to trace the gradual transition from the regime of strong correlations with the pronounced four-band structure and well-defined Mott gap for [Formula: see text] to the Slater regime of weak correlations with the spectral intensity having a dip along the boundary of the magnetic Brillouin zone due to an antiferromagnetic ordering for [Formula: see text]. For [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] doping leads to the occurrence of a pseudogap near the Fermi level, which is a consequence of the splitting out of a narrow band from a Hubbard subband. Obtained spectra feature waterfalls and Fermi arcs, which are similar to those observed in hole-doped cuprates.",3
Mobility gap and quantum transport in a functionalized graphene bilayer.,"In a Bernal graphene bilayer, carbon atoms belong to two inequivalent sublattices A and B, with atoms that are coupled to the other layer by [Formula: see text] bonds belonging to sublattice A and the other atoms belonging to sublattice B. We analyze the density of states and the conductivity of Bernal graphene bilayers when atoms of sublattice A or B only are randomly functionalized. We find that for a selective functionalization on sublattice B only, a mobility gap of the order of 0.5 eV is formed close to the Dirac energy at concentration of adatoms [Formula: see text]. In addition, at some other energies conductivity presents anomalous behaviors. We show that these properties are related to the bipartite structure of the graphene layer.",3
Effects of curved midline and varying width on the description of the effective diffusivity of Brownian particles.,"Axial diffusion in channels and tubes of smoothly-varying geometry can be approximately described as one-dimensional diffusion in the entropy potential with a position-dependent effective diffusion coefficient, by means of the modified Fick-Jacobs equation. In this work, we derive analytical expressions for the position-dependent effective diffusivity for two-dimensional asymmetric varying-width channels, and for three-dimensional curved midline tubes, formed by straight walls. To this end, we use a recently developed theoretical framework using the Frenet-Serret moving frame as the coordinate system (2016 J. Chem. Phys. 145 074105). For narrow tubes and channels, an effective one-dimensional description reducing the diffusion equation to a Fick-Jacobs-like equation in general coordinates is used. From this last equation, one can calculate the effective diffusion coefficient applying Neumann boundary conditions.",3
Ultrafast demagnetization at high temperatures.,Time-resolved pump-probe measurements were made at variable heat accumulation in Co/Pd superlattices. Heat accumulation increases the baseline temperature and decreases the equilibrium magnetization. Transient ultrafast demagnetization first develops with higher fluence in parallel with strong equilibrium thermal spin fluctuations. The ultrafast demagnetization is then gradually removed as the equilibrium temperature approaches the Curie temperature. The transient magnetization time-dependence is well fit with the spin-flip scattering model.,3
Dynamical stability of the one-dimensional rigid Brownian rotator: the role of the rotator's spatial size and shape.,"We investigate dynamical stability of a single propeller-like shaped molecular cogwheel modelled as the fixed-axis rigid rotator. In the realistic situations, rotation of the finite-size cogwheel is subject to the environmentally-induced Brownian-motion effect that we describe by utilizing the quantum Caldeira-Leggett master equation. Assuming the initially narrow (classical-like) standard deviations for the angle and the angular momentum of the rotator, we investigate the dynamics of the first and second moments depending on the size, i.e. on the number of blades of both the free rotator as well as of the rotator in the external harmonic field. The larger the standard deviations, the less stable (i.e. less predictable) rotation. We detect the absence of the simple and straightforward rules for utilizing the rotator's stability. Instead, a number of the size-related criteria appear whose combinations may provide the optimal rules for the rotator dynamical stability and possibly control. In the realistic situations, the quantum-mechanical corrections, albeit individually small, may effectively prove non-negligible, and also revealing subtlety of the transition from the quantum to the classical dynamics of the rotator. As to the latter, we detect a strong size-dependence of the transition to the classical dynamics beyond the quantum decoherence process.",3
Effect of atomic disorder on the magnetic phase separation.,"The effect of disorder on the magnetic phase separation between the antiferromagnetic and incommensurate helical [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] phases is investigated. The study is based on the quasi-two-dimensional single-band Hubbard model in the presence of atomic disorder (the [Formula: see text] Anderson-Hubbard model). A model of binary alloy disorder is considered, in which the disorder is determined by the difference in energy between the host and impurity atomic levels at a fixed impurity concentration. The problem is solved within the theory of functional integration in static approximation. Magnetic phase diagrams are obtained as functions of the temperature, the number of electrons and impurity concentration with allowance for phase separation. It is shown that for the model parameters chosen, the disorder caused by impurities whose atomic-level energy is greater than that of the host atomic levels, leads to qualitative changes in the phase diagram of the impurity-free system. In the opposite case, only quantitative changes occur. The peculiarities of the effect of disorder on the phase separation regions of the quasi-two-dimensional Hubbard model are discussed.",3

Corrigendum: Van der Waals interaction in uniaxial anisotropic media (2013 J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 25 035102).,"A multiplication error led to incorrect values of C2e and C1o in Table 1 of the above paper. The correct table is given below. All numerical results, graphs, and conclusions of the paper remain unchanged. &#13.",3
Spin Hall effect originated from fractal surface.,"The spin Hall effect (SHE) has shown promising impact in the field of spintronics and magnonics from fundamental and practical points of view. This effect originates from several mechanisms of spin scatterers based on spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and also can be manipulated through the surface roughness. Here, the effect of correlated surface roughness on the SHE in metallic thin films with small SOC is investigated theoretically. Toward this, the self-affine fractal surface in the framework of the Born approximation is exploited. The surface roughness is described by the k-correlation model and is characterized by the roughness exponent H [Formula: see text], the in-plane correlation length xi and the rms roughness amplitude delta. It is found that the spin Hall angle in metallic thin film increases by two orders of magnitude when H decreases from H = 1 to H = 0. In addition, the source of SHE for surface roughness with Gaussian profile distribution function is found to be mainly the side jump scattering while that with a non-Gaussian profile suggests both of the side jump and skew scatterings are present. Our achievements address how details of the surface roughness profile can adjust the SHE in non-heavy metals.",3
Entanglement loss in molecular quantum-dot qubits due to interaction with the environment.,"We study quantum entanglement loss due to environmental interaction in a condensed matter system with a complex geometry relevant to recent proposals for computing with single electrons at the nanoscale. We consider a system consisting of two qubits, each realized by an electron in a double quantum dot, which are initially in an entangled Bell state. The qubits are widely separated and each interacts with its own environment. The environment for each is modeled by surrounding double quantum dots placed at random positions with random orientations. We calculate the unitary evolution of the joint system and environment. The global state remains pure throughout. We examine the time dependence of the expectation value of the bipartite Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) and Brukner-Paunkovic-Rudolph-Vedral (BPRV) Bell operators and explore the emergence of correlations consistent with local realism. Though the details of this transition depend on the specific environmental geometry, we show how the results can be mapped on to a universal behavior with appropriate scaling. We determine the relevant disentanglement times based on realistic physical parameters for molecular double-dots.",3
Effect of pH on the hinge region of influenza viral protein: a combined constant pH and well-tempered molecular dynamics study.,"Despite the knowledge that the influenza protein, hemagglutinin, undergoes a large conformational change at low pH during the process of fusion with the host cell, its molecular mechanism remains elusive. The present constant pH molecular dynamics (CpHMD) study identifies the residues responsible for large conformational change in acidic condition. Based on the pKa calculations, it is predicted that His-106 is much more responsible for the large conformational change than any other residues in the hinge region of hemagglutinin protein. Potential of mean force profile from well-tempered meta-dynamics (WT-MtD) simulation is also generated along the folding pathway by considering radius of gyration (R gyr) as a collective variable (CV). It is very clear from the present WT-MtD study, that the initial bending starts at that hinge region, which may trigger other conformational changes. Both the protein-protein and protein-water HB time correlation functions are monitored along the folding pathway. The protein-protein (full or hinge region) HB time correlation functions are always found to be stronger than those of the protein-water time correlation functions. The dynamical balance between protein-protein and protein-water HB interactions favors the stabilization of the folded state.",3
Instability of the sliding Luttinger liquid.,"We revise a phase diagram for the sliding Luttinger liquid (SLL) of coupled one-dimensional quantum wires packed in two- or three-dimensional arrays in the absence of a magnetic field. We analyse whether physically justifiable (reasonable) inter-wire interactions, i.e. either the screened Coulomb or 'Coulomb-blockade' type interactions, stabilise the SLL phase. Calculating the scaling dimensions of the most relevant perturbations (the inter-wire single-particle hybridisation, charge-density wave, and superconducting inter-wire couplings), we find that their combination always destroys the SLL phase for the repulsive intra-wire interaction. However, suppressing the inter-wire tunnelling of repulsive fermions (when the charge-density wave is the only remaining perturbation), one can observe a stability region emerging due to the inter-wire forward scattering interaction.",3
Multiphoton excitation and high-harmonics generation in topological insulator.,Multiphoton interaction of coherent electromagnetic radiation with 2D metallic carriers confined on the surface of the 3D topological insulator is considered. A microscopic theory describing the nonlinear interaction of a strong wave and metallic carriers with many-body Coulomb interaction is developed. The set of integrodifferential equations for the interband polarization and carrier occupation distribution is solved numerically. Multiphoton excitation of Fermi-Dirac sea of 2D massless carriers is considered for a THz pump wave. It is shown that in the moderately strong pump wave field along with multiphoton interband/intraband transitions the intense radiation of high harmonics takes place.,3
Inkjet printable-photoactive all inorganic perovskite films with long effective photocarrier lifetimes.,"Photoactive perovskite quantum dot films, deposited via an inkjet printer, have been characterized by x-ray diffraction and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The crystal structure and bonding environment are consistent with CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots. The current-voltage (I-V) and capacitance-voltage (C-V) transport measurements indicate that the photo-carrier drift lifetime can exceed 1 ms for some printed perovskite films. This far exceeds the dark drift carrier lifetime, which is below 50 ns. The printed films show a photocarrier density 10(9) greater than the dark carrier density, making these printed films ideal candidates for application in photodetectors. The successful printing of photoactive-perovskite quantum dot films of CsPbBr3, indicates that the rapid prototyping of various perovskite inks and multilayers is realizable.",3
Smectic viral capsids and the aneurysm instability.,"The capsids of certain Archaea-infecting viruses undergo large shape changes, while maintaining their integrity against rupture by osmotic pressure. We propose that these capsids are in a smectic liquid crystalline state, with the capsid proteins assembling along spirals. We show that smectic capsids are intrinsically stabilized against the formation of localized bulges with non-zero Gauss curvature while still allowing for large-scale cooperative shape transformation that involves global changes in the Gauss curvature.",3
Quantum tunneling of electron snake states in an inhomogeneous magnetic field.,"In a two dimensional free electron gas subjected to a perpendicular spatially varying magnetic field, the classical paths of electrons are snake-like trajectories that weave along the line where the field crosses zero. But quantum mechanically this system is described by a symmetric double well potential which, for low excitations, leads to very different electron behavior. We compute the spectrum, as well as the wavefunctions, for states of definite parity in the limit of nearly degenerate states, i.e. for electrons sufficiently far from the B z = 0 line. Transitions between the states are shown to give rise to a tunneling current. If the well is made asymmetrical by a time-dependent parity breaking perturbation then Rabi-like oscillations between parity states occur. Resonances can be excited and used to stimulate the transfer of electrons from one side of the potential barrier to the other through quantum tunneling.",3
Barrier tunneling of the loop-nodal semimetal in the hyperhoneycomb lattice.,"We theoretically investigate the barrier tunneling in the 3D model of the hyperhoneycomb lattice, which is a nodal-line semimetal with a Dirac loop at zero energy. In the presence of a rectangular potential, the scattering amplitudes for different injecting states around the nodal loop are calculated, by using analytical treatments of the effective model, as well as numerical simulations of the tight binding model. In the low energy regime, states with remarkable transmissions are only concentrated in a small range around the loop plane. When the momentum of the injecting electron is coplanar with the nodal loop, nearly perfect transmissions can occur for a large range of injecting azimuthal angles if the potential is not high. For higher potential energies, the transmission shows a resonant oscillation with the potential, but still with peaks being perfect transmissions that do not decay with the potential width. These strikingly robust transports of the loop-nodal semimetal can be approximately explained by a momentum dependent Dirac Hamiltonian.",3
Enhanced electronic and magnetic properties by functionalization of monolayer GaS via substitutional doping and adsorption.,"The structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of two-dimensional (2D) GaS are investigated using density functional theory (DFT). After confirming that the pristine 2D GaS is a non-magnetic, indirect band gap semiconductor, we consider N and F as substitutional dopants or adsorbed atoms. Except for N substituting for Ga (NGa), all considered cases are found to possess a magnetic moment. Fluorine, both in its atomic and molecular form, undergoes a highly exothermic reaction with GaS. Its site preference (FS or FGa) as substitutional dopant depends on Ga-rich or S-rich conditions. Both for FGa and F adsorption at the Ga site, a strong F-Ga bond is formed, resulting in broken bonds within the GaS monolayer. As a result, FGa induces p-type conductivity in GaS, whereas FS induces a dispersive, partly occupied impurity band about 0.5 e below the conduction band edge of GaS. Substitutional doping with N at both the S and the Ga site is exothermic when using N atoms, whereas only the more favourable site under the prevailing conditions can be accessed by the less reactive N2 molecules. While NGa induces a deep level occupied by one electron at 0.5 eV above the valence band, non-magnetic NS impurities in sufficiently high concentrations modify the band structure such that a direct transition between N-induced states becomes possible. This effect can be exploited to render monolayer GaS a direct-band gap semiconductor for optoelectronic applications. Moreover, functionalization by N or F adsorption on GaS leads to in-gap states with characteristic transition energies that can be used to tune light absorption and emission. These results suggest that GaS is a good candidate for design and construction of 2D optoelectronic and spintronics devices.",3

Enabling liquid solvent structure analysis using hard x-ray absorption spectroscopy with a transferrable microfluidic reactor.,"In this paper, a vacuum compatible microfluidic device, system for analysis at the liquid vacuum interface, is integrated to hard x-ray absorption spectroscopy to obtain the local structure of K3[Fe(CN)6] in aqueous solutions with three concentrations of 0.5 M, 0.05 M, and 0.005 M. The solutions were sealed in a microchannel 500 microm wide and 300 microm deep in a portable microfluidic device. The Fe K-edge x-ray absorption spectra indicate a presence of Fe(III) in the complex in water, with an octahedral geometry coordinated with 6 C atoms in the first shell with a distance of ~1.92 A and 6 N atoms in the second shell with a distance of ~3.10 A. Varying the concentration has no observable influence on the structure of K3[Fe(CN)6]. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using microfluidic based liquid cells in large synchrotron facilities. Using portable microfludic reactors provides a viable approach to enable multifaceted measurements of liquids in the future.",3
Origin of the monolayer Raman signature in hexagonal boron nitride: a first-principles analysis.,"Monolayers of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) can in principle be identified by a Raman signature, consisting of an upshift in the frequency of the E2g vibrational mode with respect to the bulk value, but the origin of this shift (intrinsic or support-induced) is still debated. Herein we use density functional theory calculations to investigate whether there is an intrinsic Raman shift in the h-BN monolayer in comparison with the bulk. There is universal agreement among all tested functionals in predicting the magnitude of the frequency shift upon a variation in the in-plane cell parameter. It is clear that a small in-plane contraction can explain the Raman peak upshift from bulk to monolayer. However, we show that the larger in-plane parameter in the bulk (compared to the monolayer) results from non-local correlation effects, which cannot be accounted for by local functionals or those with empirical dispersion corrections. Using a non-local-correlation functional, we then investigate the effect of finite temperatures on the Raman signature. We demonstrate that bulk h-BN thermally expands in the direction perpendicular to the layers, while the intralayer distances slightly contract, in agreement with observed experimental behavior. Interestingly, the difference in in-plane cell parameter between bulk and monolayer decreases with temperature, and becomes very small at room temperature. We conclude that the different thermal expansion of bulk and monolayer partially 'erases' the intrinsic Raman signature, accounting for its small magnitude in recent experiments on suspended samples.",3
"Magnetic, thermal, and optical properties of single-crystalline CoTa2O6 and FeTa2O6 and their anisotropic magnetocaloric effect.","The magnetic, thermal, and optical properties of single-crystalline CoTa2O6 and FeTa2O6 are reported. Optical dichroism was observed in CoTa2O6. Magnetic susceptibility chi(T) measurements reveal long-range antiferromagnetic order with Neel temperatures [Formula: see text] K and 8.11(5) K, respectively, and anisotropy in chi. The thermal expansion coefficients exhibit significant anisotropy and the influence of the magnetic ions and long-range order. A structural phase transition to orthorhombic occurs below T N for FeTa2O6. Magnetic field H lowers T N with its affect largest when H is directed along either [1 1 0] or [1 [Formula: see text] 0], and smallest when directed along [0 0 1]. This leads to an anisotropic magnetocaloric effect that is investigated through measurements of the specific heat and magnetization in applied magnetic field.",3
Size-scaling behaviour of the electronic polarizability of one-dimensional interacting systems.,"Electronic polarizability of finite chains is accurately calculated from the total energy variation of the system produced by small but finite static electric fields applied along the chain direction. Normalized polarizability, that is, polarizability divided by chain length, diverges as the second power of length for metallic systems but approaches a constant value for insulating systems. This behaviour provides a very convenient way to characterize the wave-function malleability of finite systems as it avoids the need of attaching infinite contacts to the chain ends. Hubbard model calculations at half filling show that the method works for a small U = 1 interaction value that corresponds to a really small spectral gap of 0.005 (hopping t = -1 is assumed). Once successfully checked, the method has been applied to the long-range hopping model of Gebhard and Ruckenstein showing 1/r hopping decay (Gebhard and Ruckenstein 1992 Phys. Rev. Lett. 68 244; Gebhard et al 1994 Phys. Rev. B 49 10926). Metallicity for U values below the reported metal-insulator transition is obtained but the surprise comes for U values larger than the critical one (when a gap appears in the spectral density of states) because a steady increase of the normalized polarizability with size is obtained. This critical size-scaling behaviour can be understood as corresponding to a molecule which polarizability is unbounded. We have checked that a real transfer of charge from one chain end to the opposite occurs as a response to very small electric fields in spite of the existence of a large gap of the order of U for one-particle excitations. Finally, ab initio quantum chemistry calculations of realistic poly-acetylene chains prove that the occurrence of such critical behaviour in real systems is unlikely.",3
Phase diagram of a symmetric electron-hole bilayer system: a variational Monte Carlo study.,"We study the phase diagram of a symmetric electron-hole bilayer system at absolute zero temperature and in zero magnetic field within the quantum Monte Carlo approach. In particular, we conduct variational Monte Carlo simulations for various phases, i.e. the paramagnetic fluid phase, the ferromagnetic fluid phase, the anti-ferromagnetic Wigner crystal phase, the ferromagnetic Wigner crystal phase and the excitonic phase, to estimate the ground-state energy at different values of in-layer density and inter-layer spacing. Slater-Jastrow style trial wave functions, with single-particle orbitals appropriate for different phases, are used to construct the phase diagram in the (r s , d) plane by finding the relative stability of trial wave functions. At very small layer separations, we find that the fluid phases are stable, with the paramagnetic fluid phase being particularly stable at [Formula: see text] and the ferromagnetic fluid phase being particularly stable at [Formula: see text]. As the layer spacing increases, we first find that there is a phase transition from the ferromagnetic fluid phase to the ferromagnetic Wigner crystal phase when d reaches 0.4 a.u. at r s = 20, and before there is a return to the ferromagnetic fluid phase when d approaches 1 a.u. However, for r s < 20 and [Formula: see text] a.u., the excitonic phase is found to be stable. We do not find that the anti-ferromagnetic Wigner crystal is stable over the considered range of r s and d. We also find that as r s increases, the critical layer separations for Wigner crystallization increase.",3
Electrically active induced energy levels and metastability of B and N vacancy-complexes in 4H-SiC.,"Electrically active induced energy levels in semiconductor devices could be beneficial to the discovery of an enhanced p or n-type semiconductor. Nitrogen (N) implanted into 4H-SiC is a high energy process that produced high defect concentrations which could be removed during dopant activation annealing. On the other hand, boron (B) substituted for silicon in SiC causes a reduction in the number of defects. This scenario leads to a decrease in the dielectric properties and induced deep donor and shallow acceptor levels. Complexes formed by the N, such as the nitrogen-vacancy centre, have been reported to play a significant role in the application of quantum bits. In this paper, results of charge states thermodynamic transition level of the N and B vacancy-complexes in 4H-SiC are presented. We explore complexes where substitutional N[Formula: see text]/N[Formula: see text] or B[Formula: see text]/B[Formula: see text] sits near a Si (V[Formula: see text]) or C (V[Formula: see text]) vacancy to form vacancy-complexes (N[Formula: see text]V[Formula: see text], N[Formula: see text]V[Formula: see text], N[Formula: see text]V[Formula: see text], N[Formula: see text]V[Formula: see text], B[Formula: see text]V[Formula: see text], B[Formula: see text]V[Formula: see text], B[Formula: see text]V[Formula: see text] and B[Formula: see text]V[Formula: see text]). The energies of formation of the N related vacancy-complexes showed the N[Formula: see text]V[Formula: see text] to be energetically stable close to the valence band maximum in its double positive charge state. The N[Formula: see text]V[Formula: see text] is more energetically stable in the double negative charge state close to the conduction band minimum. The N[Formula: see text]V[Formula: see text] on the other hand, induced double donor level and the N[Formula: see text]V[Formula: see text] induced a double acceptor level. For B related complexes, the B[Formula: see text]V[Formula: see text] and B[Formula: see text]V[Formula: see text] were energetically stable in their single positive charge state close to the valence band maximum. As the Fermi energy is varied across the band gap, the neutral and single negative charge states of the B[Formula: see text]V[Formula: see text] become more stable at different energy levels. B and N related complexes exhibited charge state controlled metastability behaviour.",3
Effects of crystalline electronic field and onsite interorbital interaction in Yb-based quasicrystal and approximant crystal.,"To get an insight into a new type of quantum critical phenomena recently discovered in the quasicrystal Yb15Al34Au51 and approximant crystal (AC) Yb14Al35Au51 under pressure, we discuss the property of the crystalline electronic field (CEF) at Yb in the AC and show that uneven CEF levels at each Yb site can appear because of the Al/Au mixed sites. Then we construct the minimal model for the electronic state on the AC by introducing the onsite Coulomb repulsion between the 4f and 5d orbitals at Yb. Numerical calculations for the ground state shows that the lattice constant dependence of the Yb valence well explains the recent measurement done by systematic substitution of elements of Al and Au in the quasicrystal and AC, where the quasicrystal Yb15Al34Au51 is just located at the point from where the Yb-valence starts to change drastically. Our calculation convincingly demonstrates that this is indeed the evidence that this material is just located at the quantum critical point of the Yb-valence transition.",3
Resonant photoluminescence studies of carrier localisation in c-plane InGaN/GaN quantum well structures.,In this paper we report on changes in the form of the low temperature (12 K) photoluminescence spectra of an InGaN/GaN quantum well structure as a function of excitation photon energy. As the photon energy is progressively reduced we observe at a critical energy a change in the form of the spectra from one which is determined by the occupation of the complete distribution of hole localisation centres to one which is determined by the resonant excitation of specific localisation sites. This change is governed by an effective mobility edge whereby the photo-excited holes remain localised at their initial energy and are prevented from scattering to other localisation sites. This assignment is confirmed by the results of atomistic tight binding calculations which show that the wave function overlap of the lowest lying localised holes with other hole states is low compared with the overlap of higher lying hole states with other higher lying hole states.,3
Terahertz magneto-optical properties of bi- and tri-layer graphene.,"Magneto-optical (MO) properties of bi- and tri-layer graphene are investigated utilizing terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz TDS) in the presence of a strong magnetic field at room-temperature. In the Faraday configuration and applying optical polarization measurements, we measure the real and imaginary parts of the longitudinal and transverse MO conductivities of different graphene samples. The obtained experimental data fits very well with the classical MO Drude formula. Thus, we are able to obtain the key sample and material parameters of bi- and tri-layer graphene, such as the electron effective mass, the electronic relaxation time and the electron density. It is found that in high magnetic fields the electronic relaxation time tau for bi- and tri-layer graphene increases with magnetic field B roughly in a form [Formula: see text]. Most importantly, we obtain the electron effective mass for bi- and tri-layer graphene at room-temperature under non-resonant conditions. This work shows how the advanced THz MO techniques can be applied for the investigation into fundamental physics properties of atomically thin 2D electronic systems.",3
Quantum anomalous Hall effect and topological phase transition in two-dimensional antiferromagnetic Chern insulator NiOsCl6.,"By doing calculations based on density functional theory, we predict that the two-dimensional anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) NiOsCl6 as a Chern insulator can realize the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect. We investigate the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies in different magnetic configurations and the Neel AFM configuration is proved to be ground state. When considering spin-orbit coupling (SOC), this layered material with spins perpendicular to the plane shows properties as a Chern insulator characterized by an inversion band structure and a nonzero Chern number. The nontrivial band gap is 37 meV and the Chern number C = -1, which are induced by a strong SOC and AFM order. With strong SOC, the NiOsCl6 system performs a continuous topological phase transition from the Chern insulator to the trivial insulator upon the increasing Coulomb repulsion U. The critical U c is indicated as 0.23 eV, at which the system is in a metallic phase with [Formula: see text]. Upon increasing U, the E g reduces linearly with C = -1 for 0 < U < U c and increases linearly with C = 0 for U > U c . At last we analysis the QAH properties and this continuous topological phase transition theoretically in a two-band [Formula: see text] model. This AFM Chern insulator NiOsCl6 proposes not only a promising way to realize the QAH effect, but also a new material to study the continuous topological phase transition.",3

Hidden chiral symmetries in BDI multichannel Kitaev chains.,"Realistic implementations of the Kitaev chain require, in general, the introduction of extra internal degrees of freedom. In the present work, we discuss the presence of hidden BDI symmetries for free Hamiltonians describing systems with an arbitrary number of internal degrees of freedom. We generalize results of a spinfull Kitaev chain to construct a Hamiltonian with n internal degrees of freedom and obtain the corresponding hidden chiral symmetry. As an explicit application of this generalized result, we exploit by analytical and numerical calculations the case of a spinful two-band Kitaev chain, which can host up to four Majorana bound states. We also observe the appearence of minigap states, when chiral symmetry is broken.",3
Study of plasmonics in hybrids made from a quantum emitter and double metallic nanoshell dimer.,"We developed a theory for the fluorescence (FL) for quantum emitter and double metallic nanoshell dimer hybrids using the density matrix method. The dimer is made from two identical double metallic nanoshells, which are made of a dielectric core, a gold metallic shell and a dielectric spacer layer. The quantum emitters are deposited on the surface of the spacer layers of the dimers due to the electrostatic absorptions. We consider that dimer hybrids are surrounded by biological cells. This can be achieved by injecting them into human or animal cells. The surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) are calculated for the dimer using Maxwell's equations in the static wave approximation. The calculated SPP energy agrees with experimental data from Zhai et al (2017 Plasmonics 12 263) for the dimer made from a silica core, a gold metallic nanoshell and a silica spacer layer. We have also obtained an analytical expression of the FL using the density matrix method. We compare our theory with FL experimental data from Zhai et al (2017 Plasmonics 12 263) where the FL spectrum was measured by varying the thickness of the spacer layer from 9 nm to 40 nm. A good agreement between theory and experiment is found. We have shown that the enhancement of the FL increases as the thickness of the spacer layer decreases. We have also found that the enhancement of the FL increases as the distance between the double metallic nanoshells in the dimer decreases. These are interesting findings which are consistent with the experiments of Zhai et al (2017 Plasmonics 12 263) and can be used to control the FL enhancement in the FL-based biomedical imaging and cancer treatment. These interesting findings may also be useful in the fabrication of nanosensors and nanoswitches for applications in medicine.",3
Exploring the effect of nanoholes on arsenene: a density functional theory study.,"Effectively modulating the electronic and magnetic properties of a two-dimensional system is critical for the application of it in nanoscale devices. In this work, we explore the effect of nanohole on arsenene on the basis of density functional theory calculations. Our calculations show that, except slight distortion at the corner of nanoholes, geometries of both un-hydrogenated nanohole-embedded arsenene (As-NH) structure and hydrogenated nanohole-embedded arsenene (H-As-NH) structure are well maintained after optimization. Interestingly, the As-NH structure can be magnetized so that it can represent ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic or antiferromagnetic behavior depending on the shape of the nanoholes. Furthermore, As-NH structure with triangle nanoholes is expected to exhibit remarkable magnetism. Besides, owning to the induction of flat defect levels by the nanoholes, As-NH structure can represent a relatively small band gap. In contrast, the H-As-NH structure is shown to lack the magnetism due to the saturation of unpaired As atoms. In this case, the H-As-NH structure exhibits a relatively large band gap due to the quantum confinement effect. These results indicate an opportunity for the design of arsenene-based nanoscale devices with potential applications in spintronic and optical fields.",3
Thermal and active fluctuations of a compressible bilayer vesicle.,"We discuss thermal and active fluctuations of a compressible bilayer vesicle by using the results of hydrodynamic theory for vesicles. Coupled Langevin equations for the membrane deformation and the density fields are employed to calculate the power spectral density matrix of membrane fluctuations. Thermal contribution is obtained by means of the fluctuation dissipation theorem, whereas active contribution is calculated from exponentially decaying time correlation functions of active random forces. We obtain the total power spectral density as a sum of thermal and active contributions. An apparent response function is further calculated in order to compare with the recent microrheology experiment on red blood cells. An enhanced response is predicted in the low-frequency regime for non-thermal active fluctuations.",3
Antiferromagnetic monolayer MnC2 with density functional theory prediction.,"A new monolayer MnC2 was predicted as a stable 2D material associated with the result of phonon and AIMD calculations. The in-plane young's modulus is 73.6 N m(-1), which is about [Formula: see text] of graphene. The monolayer MnC2 is antiferromagnetic with a Neel temperature around 280 K and from the Dirac point of the electronic band we got the fermi velocity of [Formula: see text] m s(-1) showing excellent electronic transport property. The MnC2 sheet also possesses a promising application as an anode material in lithium ion battery.",3
Photon-induced tunability of the thermospin current in a Rashba ring.,"The goal of this work is to show how the thermospin polarization current in a quantum ring changes in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit coupling and a quantized single photon mode of a cavity the ring is placed in. Employing the reduced density operator and a general master equation formalism, we find that both the Rashba interaction and the photon field can significantly modulate the spin polarization and the thermospin polarization current. Tuning the Rashba coupling constant, degenerate energy levels are formed corresponding to the Aharonov-Casher destructive phase interference in the quantum ring system. Our analysis indicates that the maximum spin polarization can be observed at the points of degenerate energy levels due to spin accumulation in the system without the photon field. The thermospin current is thus suppressed. In the presence of the cavity, the photon field leads to an additional kinetic momentum of the electron. As a result the spin polarization can be enhanced by the photon field.",3
Evidence of a 2D Fermi surface due to surface states in a p-type metallic Bi2Te3.,"We present a systematic quantum oscillations study on a metallic, p-type Bi2Te3 topological single crystal in magnetic fields up to B = 7 T. The maxima/minima positions of oscillations measured at different tilt angles align to one another when plotted as a function of the normal component of magnetic field, confirming the presence of the 2D Fermi surface. Additionally, the Berry phase, beta = 0.4 +/- 0.05 obtained from the Landau level fan plot, is very close to the theoretical value of 0.5 for the Dirac particles, confirming the presence of topological surface states in the Bi2Te3 single crystal. Using the Lifshitz-Kosevich analyses, the Fermi energy is estimated to be [Formula: see text] meV, which is lower than that of other bismuth-based topological systems. The detection of surface states in the Bi2Te3 crystal can be explained by our previous hypothesis of the lower position of the Fermi surface that cuts the 'M'-shaped valence band maxima. As a result, the bulk state frequency is shifted to higher magnetic fields, which allows measurement of the surface states signal at low magnetic fields.",3
Equilibrating high-molecular-weight symmetric and miscible polymer blends with hierarchical back-mapping.,"Understanding properties of polymer alloys with computer simulations frequently requires equilibration of samples comprised of microscopically described long molecules. We present the extension of an efficient hierarchical backmapping strategy, initially developed for homopolymer melts, to equilibrate high-molecular-weight binary blends. These mixtures present significant interest for practical applications and fundamental polymer physics. In our approach, the blend is coarse-grained into models representing polymers as chains of soft blobs. Each blob stands for a subchain with N b microscopic monomers. A hierarchy of blob-based models with different resolution is obtained by varying N b. First the model with the largest N b is used to obtain an equilibrated blend. This configuration is sequentially fine-grained, reinserting at each step the degrees of freedom of the next in the hierarchy blob-based model. Once the blob-based description is sufficiently detailed, the microscopic monomers are reinserted. The hard excluded volume is recovered through a push-off procedure and the sample is re-equilibrated with molecular dynamics (MD), requiring relaxation on the order of the entanglement time. For the initial method development we focus on miscible blends described on microscopic level through a generic bead-spring model, which reproduces hard excluded volume, strong covalent bonds, and realistic liquid density. The blended homopolymers are symmetric with respect to molecular architecture and liquid structure. To parameterize the blob-based models and validate equilibration of backmapped samples, we obtain reference data from independent hybrid simulations combining MD and identity exchange Monte Carlo moves, taking advantage of the symmetry of the blends. The potential of the backmapping strategy is demonstrated by equilibrating blend samples with different degree of miscibility, containing 500 chains with 1000 monomers each. Equilibration is verified by comparing chain conformations and liquid structure in backmapped blends with the reference data. Possible directions for further methodological developments are discussed.",3
Twisted bilayer graphene photoluminescence emission peaks at van Hove singularities.,We report on photoluminescence emission imaging by femtosecond laser excitation on twisted bilayer graphene samples. The emission images are obtained by tuning the excitation laser energies in the near infrared region. We demonstrate an increase of the photoluminescence emission at excitation energies that depends on the bilayer twist angle. The results show a peak for the light emission when the excitation is in resonance with transitions at the van Hove singularities in the electronic density of states. We measured the photoluminescence excitation peak position and width for samples with various twist angles showing resonances in the energy range of 1.2 to 1.7 eV.,3
The piezoelectric gating effect in a thin bent membrane with a two-dimensional electron gas.,"Thin suspended nanostructures with a two-dimensional electron gas can be used as nanoelectromechanical systems in which electron transport is piezoelectrically coupled to mechanical motion and vibrations. Apart from practical applications, these systems are interesting for studying electron transport under unusual conditions, namely, in the presence of additional mechanical degrees of freedom. In the present paper, we analyze the influence of the bending on the density of a gated two-dimensional electron gas contained in a suspended membrane using the Thomas-Fermi approach and the model of pure electrostatic screening. We show that a small bending is analogous to a small change in gate voltages. Our calculations demonstrate that the density change is most prominent near the edges of the conductive channel created by negatively biased gates. When moving away from these edges, the bending-induced density change rapidly decays. We propose several methods to increase the magnitude of the effect, with the largest benefit obtained from coverage of the conductive channel with an additional grounded gate. It is shown that, for a conductive channel under a bare surface, the largest effect can be achieved if the two-dimensional electron gas is placed near the middle of the membrane thickness, despite the bending-induced strain is zero there.",3
Tail-like regime and BCS-BEC crossover due to hybridization in a two-band superconductor.,"Superconductivity in strongly correlated systems is a remarkable phenomenon that attracts huge interest. The study of this problem is relevant for materials such as the high T c oxides, pnictides and heavy fermions. These systems also have in common the existence of electrons of several orbitals that coexist at a common Fermi surface. In this paper we study the effect of pressure, chemical or applied on multi-band superconductivity. Pressure varies the atomic distances and consequently the overlap of the wave-functions in the crystal. This rearranges the electronic structure that we model including a pressure dependent hybridization between the bands. We consider the case of two-dimensional systems in a square lattice with inverted bands. We study the conditions for obtaining a pressure induced superconductor quantum critical point and show that hybridization, i.e. pressure can induce a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-Bose-Einstein condensation crossover in multi-band systems even for moderate interactions. We found a tail-like superconductor regime and briefly discuss the influence of the symmetry of the order parameter in the results.",3
Magnetic field mediated conductance oscillation in graphene p-n junctions.,"The electronic transport of graphene p-n junctions under perpendicular magnetic field is investigated in theory. Under low magnetic field, the transport is determined by the resonant tunneling of Landau levels and conductance versus magnetic field shows a Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation. At higher magnetic field, the p-n junction subjected to the quasi-classical regime and the formation of snake states results in periodical backscattering and transmission as magnetic field varies. The conductance oscillation pattern is mediated both by magnetic field and the carrier concentration on bipolar regions. For medium magnetic field between above two regimes, the combined contributions of resonant tunneling, snake states oscillation and Aharanov-Bohm interference induce irregular oscillation of conductance. At very high magnetic field, the system is subjected to quantum Hall regime. Under disorder, the quantum tunneling at low magnetic field is slightly affected and the oscillation of snake states at higher magnetic field is suppressed. In the quantum Hall regime, the conductance is a constant as predicted by the mixture rule.",3
Spectroscopic evidence for two-gap superconductivity in the quasi-1D chalcogenide Nb2Pd0.81S5.,"Low-dimensional electronic systems with confined electronic wave functions have attracted interest due to their propensity toward novel quantum phases and their use in wide range of nanotechnologies. The newly discovered chalcogenide Nb2PdS5 possesses a quasi-one-dimensional electronic structure and becomes superconducting. Here, we report spectroscopic evidence for two-band superconductivity, where soft point-contact spectroscopic measurements in the superconducting (SC) state reveal Andreev reflection in the differential conductance G. Multiple peaks in G are observed at 1.8 K and explained by the two-band Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk model with two gaps Delta1 = 0.61 meV and Delta2 = 1.20 meV. The progressive evolution of G with temperature and magnetic field corroborates the multiple nature of the SC gaps.",3
Pressure-induced Lifshitz and structural transitions in NbAs and TaAs: experiments and theory.,"High pressure Raman, resistivity and synchrotron x-ray diffraction studies on Weyl semimetals NbAs and TaAs have been carried out along with density functional theoretical (DFT) analysis to explain pressure induced structural and electronic topological phase transitions. The frequencies of first order Raman modes harden with increasing pressure, exhibiting a slope change at [Formula: see text] GPa for NbAs and [Formula: see text] GPa for TaAs. The resistivities of NbAs and TaAs exhibit a minimum at pressures close to these transition pressures and also a change in the bulk modulus is observed. Our first-principles calculations reveal that the transition is associated with an electronic Lifshitz transition at [Formula: see text] for NbAs while it is a structural phase transition from body centered tetragonal to hexagonal phase at [Formula: see text] for TaAs. Further, our DFT calculations show a structural phase transition at 24 GPa from body centered tetragonal phase to hexagonal phase.",3
Spin-orbit coupling induced three-dimensional topological objects in attractive Bose-Einstein condensates.,"Attractive Bose-Einstein condensates of dilute alkali gases are unstable against collapse in two- and three-dimensional free space. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that the spin-orbit coupling of the two-component condensates counteracts the tendency of collapse and makes the system preferable to an extended spatial distribution in the three-dimensional case. Furthermore, stable topological objects can be formed in the condensates, which are shown to be the lowest energy states. Two configurations of the density profiles, called three-dimensional skyrmion and three-dimensional dimeron, respectively, are identified depending on the strength of the spin-orbit coupling.",3
Spin current and second harmonic generation in non-collinear magnetic systems: the hydrodynamic model.,"We report a theoretical study of the second harmonic generation in a noncollinearly magnetized conductive medium with equilibrium spin current. The hydrodynamic model is used to unravel the mechanism of a novel effect of the double frequency signal generation that is attributed to the spin current. According to our calculations, this second harmonic response appears due to the 'non-adiabatic' spin polarization of the conduction electrons induced by the oscillations in the non-uniform magnetization forced by the electric field of the electromagnetic wave. Together with the linear velocity response this leads to the generation of the double frequency spin current. This spin current is converted to the electric current via the inverse spin Hall effect, and the double-frequency electric current emits the second harmonic radiation. Possible experiment for detection of the new second harmonic effect is proposed.",3
Pressure-induced superconductivity in palladium sulfide.,"An extended study on PdS is carried out with the measurements of the resistivity, Hall coefficient, Raman scattering, and x-ray diffraction at high pressures up to 42.3 GPa. With increasing pressure, superconductivity is observed accompanying with a structural phase transition at around 19.5 GPa. The coexistence of semiconducting and metallic phases observed at normal state is examined by the Raman scattering and x-ray diffraction between 19.5 and 29.5 GPa. After that, only the metallic normal state maintains with an almost constant superconducting transition temperature. The similar evolution between the superconducting transition temperature and carrier concentration with pressure supports the phonon-mediated superconductivity in this material. These results highlight the important role of pressure played in inducing superconductivity from these narrow band-gap semiconductors.",3
Depth resolved grazing incidence neutron scattering experiments from semi-infinite interfaces: a statistical analysis of the scattering contributions.,"Grazing incidence neutron scattering experiments offer surface sensitivity by reflecting from an interface at momentum transfers close to total external reflection. Under these conditions the penetration depth is strongly non-linear and may change by many orders of magnitude. This fact imposes severe challenges for depth resolved experiments, since the brilliance of neutron beams is relatively low in comparison to e.g. synchrotron radiation. In this article we use probability density functions to calculate the contribution of scattering at different distances from an interface to the intensities registered on the detector. Our method has the particular advantage that the depth sensitivity is directly extracted from the scattering pattern itself. Hence for perfectly known samples exact resolution functions can be calculated and visa versa. We show that any tails in the resolution function, e.g. Gaussian shaped, hinders depth resolved experiments. More importantly we provide means for a descriptive statistical analysis of detector images with respect to the scattering contributions and show that even for perfect resolution near surface scattering is hardly accessible.",3
Enhanced photocatalytic property of hybrid graphitic C3N4 and graphitic ZnO nanocomposite: the effects of interface and doping.,"Using first-principles calculations, we present a potential new way to improve the photocatalytic efficiency of the g-C3N4 sheet by coupling with the g-ZnO sheet to form heterojunction nanostructure followed by the addition of N atom at an atomic level. The result indicates the g-C3N4/g-ZnO heterojunction is a staggered band alignment (type II) structure and a polarized field is generated by the electrons transfer across the interface simultaneously, which facilitate the separation of e(-)-h(+) pairs and promote the photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, a great difference in energy levels between redox potentials and band edges of the C3N4/g-ZnO nanocomposite ensures that the water splitting/CO2 reduction reaction is energetically favored. In addition, through the incorporation of nitrogen dopant, the g-C3N4/N-g-ZnO nanocomposite displays desirable properties. The N-derived doping peak causes a decrease of the band gap width of the g-C3N4/g-ZnO nanocomposite, resulting in the enhanced optical absorption from UV into visible light. This theoretical predictions provide insightful outlooks in understanding the effects of interface and doping on the enhanced photocatalytic property of the g-C3N4/g-ZnO nanocomposites, which will assist in engineering highly efficient g-C3N4-based photocatalysts.",3
Graphene-like monolayer InSe-X: several promising half-metallic nanosheets in spintronics.,"Several half-metallic graphene-like nanosheets, namely halogen atom adsorbed InSe-X (X = F, Cl, Br and I) nanosheets, are predicted by first-principles calculations. Then, their structural, electric and magnetic properties are studied in detail. The calculated negative adsorption energies of these InSe-X nanosheets ensure that they attain stable adsorption structures, which suggests that they may be prepared experimentally. The pristine InSe monolayer is a typical semi-conductor, whereas it is interesting that the X ion (X = F, Cl, Br and I) adsorbed InSe-X nanosheets are electronically conductive. They can be promising and good candidates for applications of half-metallic 2D materials. The calculated magnetic moments of these nanosheets are close to 1.0 micro B. In the InSe-F nanosheet, there are sp(2) hybridized orbitals due to the crystal field effect, and its electroconductibility, half-metallicity and magnetic moments originate from the In and Se ions, not the F ion. However, in InSe-X (X = Cl, Br and I) nanosheets, there are sp(3) hybridized orbitals, and their electroconductibility, half-metallicity and magnetic moments originate mainly from X ions, together partially with the In and Se ions.",3
Investigation of iron spin crossover pressure in Fe-bearing MgO using hybrid functional.,"Pressure-induced spin crossover behaviors of Fe-bearing MgO were widely investigated by using an LDA + U functional for describing the strongly correlated Fe-O bonding. Moreover, the simulated spin crossover pressures depend on the applied U values, which are sensitive to environments and parameters. In this work, the spin crossover pressures of (Mg1-x ,Fe x )O are investigated by using the hybrid functional with a uniform parameter. Our results indicate that the spin crossover pressures increase with increasing iron concentration. For example, the spin crossover pressure of (Mg0.03125,Fe0.96875)O and FeO was 56 GPa and 127 GPa, respectively. The calculated crossover pressures agreed well with the experimental observations. Therefore, the hybrid functional should be an effective method for describing the pressure-induced spin crossover behaviors in transition metal oxides.",3
Magnetism of the 35 K superconductor CsEuFe4As4.,"The results of ab initio hyperfine-interaction parameters calculations, and of x-ray diffraction and (57)Fe and (151)Eu Mossbauer spectroscopy study of the new 35 K superconductor CsEuFe4As4 are reported. The superconductor crystallizes in the tetragonal space group P4/mmm with the lattice parameters [Formula: see text] A and [Formula: see text] A. It is demonstrated unequivocally that there is no magnetic order of the Fe magnetic moments down to 2.1 K and that the ferromagnetic order is associated with the Eu magnetic moments. The Curie temperature [Formula: see text] K determined from the temperature dependence of the hyperfine magnetic field at (151)Eu nuclei is shown to be compatible with the temperature dependence of the transferred hyperfine magnetic field at (57)Fe nuclei that is induced by the ferromagnetically ordered Eu sublattice. The Eu magnetic moments are shown to be perpendicular to the crystallographic c-axis. The temperature dependence of the principal component of the electric field gradient tensor, both at Fe and Eu sites, is well described by a T (3/2) power-law relation. Good agreement between the calculated and measured hyperfine-interaction parameters is observed. The Debye temperature of CsEuFe4As4 is found to be 295(3) K.",3
Induced Forster resonance energy transfer by encapsulation of DNA-scaffold based probes inside a plant virus based protein cage.,"Insight into the assembly and disassembly of viruses can play a crucial role in developing cures for viral diseases. Specialized fluorescent probes can benefit the study of interactions within viruses, especially during cell studies. In this work, we developed a strategy based on Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) to study the assembly of viruses without labeling the exterior of viruses. Instead, we exploit their encapsulation of nucleic cargo, using three different fluorescent ATTO dyes linked to single-stranded DNA oligomers, which are hybridised to a longer DNA strand. FRET is induced upon assembly of the cowpea chlorotic mottle virus, which forms monodisperse icosahedral particles of about 22 nm, thereby increasing the FRET efficiency by a factor of 8. Additionally, encapsulation of the dyes in virus-like particles induces a two-step FRET. When the formed constructs are disassembled, this FRET signal is fully reduced to the value before encapsulation. This reversible behavior makes the system a good probe for studying viral assembly and disassembly. It, furthermore, shows that multi-component supramolecular materials are stabilized in the confinement of a protein cage.",3
High pressure phase transformations revisited.,"High pressure phase transformations play an important role in the search for new materials and material synthesis, as well as in geophysics. However, they are poorly characterized, and phase transformation pressure and pressure hysteresis vary drastically in experiments of different researchers, with different pressure transmitting media, and with different material suppliers. Here we review the current state, challenges in studying phase transformations under high pressure, and the possible ways in overcoming the challenges. This field is critically compared with fields of phase transformations under normal pressure in steels and shape memory alloys, as well as plastic deformation of materials. The main reason for the above mentioned discrepancy is the lack of understanding that there is a fundamental difference between pressure-induced transformations under hydrostatic conditions, stress-induced transformations under nonhydrostatic conditions below yield, and strain-induced transformations during plastic flow. Each of these types of transformations has different mechanisms and requires a completely different thermodynamic and kinetic description and experimental characterization. In comparison with other fields the following challenges are indicated for high pressure phase transformation: (a) initial and evolving microstructure is not included in characterization of transformations; (b) continuum theory is poorly developed; (c) heterogeneous stress and strain fields in experiments are not determined, which leads to confusing material transformational properties with a system behavior. Some ways to advance the field of high pressure phase transformations are suggested. The key points are: (a) to take into account plastic deformations and microstructure evolution during transformations; (b) to formulate phase transformation criteria and kinetic equations in terms of stress and plastic strain tensors (instead of pressure alone); (c) to develop multiscale continuum theories, and (d) to couple experimental, theoretical, and computational studies of the behavior of a tested sample to extract information about fields of stress and strain tensors and concentration of high pressure phase, transformation criteria and kinetics. The ideal characterization should contain complete information which is required for simulation of the same experiments.",3
Leading temperature dependence of the conductance in Kondo-correlated quantum dots.,"Using renormalized perturbation theory in the Coulomb repulsion, we derive an analytical expression for the leading term in the temperature dependence of the conductance through a quantum dot described by the impurity Anderson model, in terms of the renormalized parameters of the model. Taking these parameters from the literature, we compare the results with published ones calculated using the numerical renormalization group obtaining a very good agreement. The approach is superior to alternative perturbative treatments. We compare in particular to the results of a simple interpolative perturbation approach.",3
"Structural, electrical properties and dielectric relaxations in Na(+)-ion-conducting solid polymer electrolyte.","In this paper, we have studied the structural, microstructural, electrical, dielectric properties and ion dynamics of a sodium-ion-conducting solid polymer electrolyte film comprising PEO8-NaPF6+ x wt. % succinonitrile. The structural and surface morphology properties have been investigated, respectively using x-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscopy. The complex formation was examined using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and the fraction of free anions/ion pairs obtained via deconvolution. The complex dielectric permittivity and loss tangent has been analyzed across the whole frequency window, and enables us to estimate the DC conductivity, dielectric strength, double layer capacitance and relaxation time. The presence of relaxing dipoles was determined by the addition of succinonitrile (wt./wt.) and the peak shift towards high frequency indicates the decrease of relaxation time. Further, relations among various relaxation times ([Formula: see text]) have been elucidated. The complex conductivity has been examined across the whole frequency window; it obeys the Universal Power Law, and displays strong dependency on succinonitrile content. The sigma representation ([Formula: see text]) was introduced in order to explore the ion dynamics by highlighting the dispersion region in the Cole-Cole plot ([Formula: see text]) in the lower frequency window; increase in the semicircle radius indicates a decrease of relaxation time. This observation is accompanied by enhancement in ionic conductivity and faster ion transport. A convincing, logical scheme to justify the experimental data has been proposed.",3
"Phase boundaries, nucleation rates and speed of crystal growth of the water-to-ice transition under an electric field: a simulation study.","We investigate with computer simulations the effect of applying an electric field on the water-to-ice transition. We use a combination of state-of-the-art simulation techniques to obtain phase boundaries and crystal growth rates (direct coexistence), nucleation rates (seeding) and interfacial free energies (seeding and mold integration). First, we consider ice Ih, the most stable polymorph in the absence of a field. Its normal melting temperature, speed of crystal growth and nucleation rate (for a given supercooling) diminish as the intensity of the field goes up. Then, we study polarised cubic ice, or ice Icf, the most stable solid phase under a strong electric field. Its normal melting point goes up with the field and, for a given supercooling, under the studied field (0.3 V nm(-1)) ice Icf nucleates and grows at a similar rate as Ih with no field. The net effect of the field would then be that ice nucleates at warmer temperatures, but in the form of ice Icf. The main conclusion of this work is that reasonable electric fields (not strong enough to break water molecules apart) are not relevant in the context of homogeneous ice nucleation at 1 bar.",3
Pressure-jump induced rapid solidification of melt: a method of preparing amorphous materials.,"By using a self-designed pressure-jump apparatus, we investigated the melt solidification behavior in rapid compression process for several kinds of materials, such as elementary sulfur, polymer polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK) and poly-ethylene-terephthalate, alloy La68Al10Cu20Co2 and Nd60Cu20Ni10Al10. Experimental results clearly show that their melts could be solidified to be amorphous states through the rapid compression process. Bulk amorphous PEEK with 24 mm in diameter and 12 mm in height was prepared, which exceeds the size obtained by melt quenching method. The bulk amorphous sulfur thus obtained exhibited extraordinarily high thermal stability, and an abnormal exothermic transition to liquid sulfur was observed at around 396 K for the first time. Furthermore, it is suggested that the glass transition pressure and critical compression rate exist to form the amorphous phase. This approach of rapid compression is very attractive not only because it is a new technique of make bulk amorphous materials, but also because novel properties are expected in the amorphous materials solidified by the pressure-jump within milliseconds or microseconds.",3
A novel metastable state magnetic phase of monolayer FeSe.,"We found a novel metastable magnetic phase by systematically calculating total energy of monolayer FeSe in various antiferromagnetic (AFM) orders using first-principles method. The new metastable magnetic phase named as QAFM is a magnetic state with short-range magnetic structure which can be regarded as a transitional state between checkerboard-like AFM state and collinear AFM state. Both magnetic moments with important fluctuation and charge density difference with a 2 x 4 reconstruction of orbitals breaks C 4 symmetry and possibly commonly corresponds to the nematic phase in recent transmission electron microscopy and neutron scattering experiment observations. Its electronic band displays a Dirac-like band structure along Gamma-X in the folding Brillouin zone of the supercell. The QAFM phase of FeSe holds metallic feature with d xz , d yz and [Formula: see text] band crossing Fermi level even including spin-orbit coupling. Additionally, the weight of 3d orbitals varies as the applied expansion strain which may be directly correlated with the emerging nematic phase and superconducting state of strained monolayer FeSe. The finding of novel magnetic order may provide important clues to elucidate the relationship of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity for unconventional Fe-based superconductor.",3
Phononic thermal conductivity in silicene: the role of vacancy defects and boundary scattering.,"We calculate the thermal conductivity of free-standing silicene using the phonon Boltzmann transport equation within the relaxation time approximation. In this calculation, we investigate the effects of sample size and different scattering mechanisms such as phonon-phonon, phonon-boundary, phonon-isotope and phonon-vacancy defect. We obtain some similar results to earlier works using a different model and provide a more detailed analysis of the phonon conduction behavior and various mode contributions. We show that the dominant contribution to the thermal conductivity of silicene, which originates from the in-plane acoustic branches, is about 70% at room temperature and this contribution becomes larger by considering vacancy defects. Our results indicate that while the thermal conductivity of silicene is significantly suppressed by the vacancy defects, the effect of isotopes on the phononic transport is small. Our calculations demonstrate that by removing only one of every 400 silicon atoms, a substantial reduction of about 58% in thermal conductivity is achieved. Furthermore, we find that the phonon-boundary scattering is important in defectless and small-size silicene samples, especially at low temperatures.",3
Low-energy electron inelastic mean free paths for liquid water.,"We improve the Mermin-Penn algorithm (MPA) for determining the energy loss function (ELF) within the dielectric formalism. The present algorithm is applicable not only to real metals, but also to materials that have an energy gap in the excitation spectrum. Applying the improved MPA to liquid water, we show that the present algorithm is able to address the ELF overestimation at the energy gap, and the calculated results are in good agreement with experimental data.",3
Doped Sc2C(OH)2 MXene: new type s-pd band inversion topological insulator.,"The electronic structures of Si and Ge substitutionally doped Sc2C(OH)2 MXene monolayers are investigated in density functional theory. The doped systems exhibit band inversion, and are found to be topological invariants in Z 2 theory. The inclusion of spin orbit coupling results in band gap openings. Our results point out that the Si and Ge doped Sc2C(OH)2 MXene monolayers are topological insulators. The band inversion is observed to have a new mechanism that involves s and pd states.",3
Anisotropic thermal conductivity in carbon honeycomb.,"Carbon honeycomb, a new kind of 3D carbon allotrope experimentally synthesized recently, has received much attention for its fascinating applications in electronic device and energy storage. In the present work, we perform equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD) to study the thermal transport properties of carbon honeycombs with different chirality. It is found that the thermal conductivity along the honeycomb axis ([Formula: see text]) is three times larger than that normal to the axis ([Formula: see text]), which shows strong anisotropy reflecting their geometric anisotropy. Lattice dynamics calculations reveal that this anisotropy stems from the orientation-dependent phonon group velocities. Moreover, when ambient temperature ([Formula: see text]) increases from 200 K to 800 K, the [Formula: see text] dependence of [Formula: see text] is observed due to the enhanced Umklapp scattering. The detailed phonon spectra analyses indicate phonon group velocities are insensitive to the variation of ambient temperature, and the temperature dependence of the relaxation times of low-frequency phonons (<20 THz) follows [Formula: see text] behavior. Our results have a certain guiding significance to develop carbon honeycomb for effective thermal channeling devices.",3
Interface structure and composition of MoO3/GaAs(0 0 1).,"We studied growth, structure, stress, oxidation state as well as surface and interface structure and composition of thermally-evaporated thin MoO3 films on the technologically important III/V-semiconductor substrate GaAs(0 0 1). The MoO3 films grow with Mo in the 6+ oxidation state. The electrical resistance is tunable by the oxygen partial pressure during deposition from transparent insulating to semi-transparant halfmetallic. In the investigated growth temperature range (room temperature to 200 degrees C) no diffraction spots are detected by x-ray diffraction. However, high resolution transmission electron microscopy reveals the formation of MoO3 nanocrystal grains with diameters of 5-8 nm. At the interface a approximately 3 nm-thick intermediate layer has formed, where the single-crystal lattice of GaAs gradually transforms to the nanocrystalline MoO3 structure. This interpretation is corroborated by our in situ and real-time stress measurements evidencing a two-stage growth process as well as by elemental interface analysis revealing coexistance of Ga, As, Mo, and oxygen in a intermediate layer of 3-4 nm.",3
Low temperature magnetic properties of Nd2Ru2O7.,"We present magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and neutron diffraction measurements of polycrystalline Nd2Ru2O7 down to 0.4 K. Three anomalies in the magnetic susceptibility measurements at 146, 21 and 1.8 K are associated with an antiferromagnetic ordering of the Ru(4+) moments, a weak ferromagnetic signal attributed to a canting of the Ru(4+) and Nd(3+) moments, and a long-range-ordering of the Nd(3+) moments, respectively. The long-range order of the Nd(3+) moments was observed in all the measurements, indicating that the ground state of the compound is not a spin glass. The magnetic entropy of Rln2 accumulated up to 5 K, suggests the Nd(3+) has a doublet ground state. Lattice distortions accompany the transitions, as revealed by neutron diffraction measurements, and in agreement with earlier synchrotron x-ray studies. The magnetic moment of the Nd(3+) ion at 0.4 K is estimated to be 1.54(2)micro B and the magnetic structure is all-in all-out as determined by our neutron diffraction measurements.",3
Many-body perturbation theory and non-perturbative approaches: screened interaction as the key ingredient.,"Many-body perturbation theory is often formulated in terms of an expansion in the dressed instead of the bare Green's function, and in the screened instead of the bare Coulomb interaction. However, screening can be calculated on different levels of approximation, and it is important to define what is the most appropriate choice. We explore this question by studying a zero-dimensional model (so called 'one-point model') that retains the structure of the full equations. We study both linear and non-linear response approximations to the screening. We find that an expansion in terms of the screening in the random phase approximation is the most promising way for an application in real systems. Moreover, by making use of the nonperturbative features of the Kadanoff-Baym equation for the one-body Green's function, we obtain an approximate solution in our model that is very promising, although its applicability to real systems has still to be explored.",3
Correlation between structural change and electrical transport properties of Fe-doped chrysotile nanotubes under high pressure.,"Fe(3+) doped chrysotile nanotubes (NTs) have been synthesized under controlled hydrothermal conditions, and have been characteristic of layered-walls and room-temperature ferromagnetism. High-pressure in situ impedance spectra and synchrotron XRD measurements are performed on Fe-doped chrysotile NTs to reveal the electrical transport and structural properties under compression. Sample resistance (R sum) was found to increase with the pressure elevation, accompanying the step decrease in the grain boundary relaxation frequency (f gb), which reflects the bandgap broadening and dipoles polarization weakening due to the application of pressure. Furthermore, it is found that both R sum and f gb change their pressure dependences at ~5.0 GPa, which is attributed to the nonlinear compressibility of c-axis and even the underlying lattice distortion of monoclinic structure obtained in the XRD observations.",3
Two spin-canting textures in the antiferromagnetic phase AF1 of MnWO4 based on the new polar atomistic model in P2.,"The low temperature antiferromagnetic (AF) phase of MnWO4 (the so-called AF1 phase) exhibits different spin-canting configurations at two Mn(2+) sublattices of the (3 + 1)-dimensional magnetic structure. The suggested superspace group [Formula: see text] is a significant consequence of the polar space group [Formula: see text]2 true for the nuclear structure of MnWO4. Density functional theory calculations showed that its ground state prefers this two spin-canting system. The structural difference between two independent atomic sites for Mn (Mn a , Mn b ) is too small to allow microscopically detectable electric polarisation. However, this hidden intrinsic polar character allows AF1 two commensurately modulated spin-canting textures. This is considered as the prerequisite onset of the improper ferroelectricity enhanced by the helical spin order in the multiferroic phase AF2 of MnWO4.",3
Magnetic and electronic properties of single-walled Mo2C nanotube: a first-principles study.,"The structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of single-walled Mo2C nanotubes are investigated by using first-principles calculations. We establish that single-walled Mo2C nanotubes can be rolled up from a graphene-like Mo2C monolayer with H- or T-type phase, i.e. H-Mo2C and T-Mo2C nanotubes. The armchair-type T-Mo2C nanotubes are more energetically stable than H-Mo2C nanotubes with the same diameter, while zigzag-type H-Mo2C nanotubes are more energetically stable than T-Mo2C nanotubes. In particular, (8, 0) H-Mo2C nanotube are more stable than Mo2C monolayer due to structural deformation. All Mo2C nanotubes are magnetic metals, independent of their chirality, and the magnetic moments of Mo atoms in the outer layer are larger than the inner. The ionic and metallic bonds in Mo2C nanotubes and delocalized electrons around Mo atoms lead to the versatile electronic and magnetic properties in them, endowing them potential applications in catalysts and electronics.",3
Phase transition studies of Na3Bi system under uniaxial strain.,"We investigated the electronic properties and phase transitions of Na3Bi in four structural phases (space groups P63/mmc, P [Formula: see text] c1, Fm [Formula: see text] m and Cmcm) under constant-volume uniaxial strain using the first-principles method. For P63/mmc and P [Formula: see text] c1-Na3Bi, an important phase transition from a topological Dirac semimetal (TDS) to a topological insulator appears under compression strain around 4.5%. The insulating gap increases with the increasing compressive strain and up to around 0.1 eV at a strain of 10%. However, both P63/mmc and P [Formula: see text] c1-Na3Bi still keep the properties of a TDS within a tensile strain of 0-10%, although the Dirac points move away from the Gamma point along Gamma-A in reciprocal space as the tensile strain increases. The Na3Bi with space group Fm [Formula: see text] m is identified as a topological semimetal with the inverted bands between Na-3s and Bi-6p and a parabolic dispersion in the vicinity of Gamma point. Interestingly, for Fm [Formula: see text] m-Na3Bi, both compression and tensile strain lead to a TDS which is identified by calculating surface Fermi arcs and topological invariants at time-reversal planes (k z = 0 and k z = pi/c) in reciprocal space. Additionally, we confirmed the high pressure phase Cmcm-Na3Bi is an ordinary insulator with a gap of about 0.62 eV. It is noteworthy that its gap almost keeps constant around 0.60 eV within a compression strain of 0-10%. In contrast, a remarkable phase transition from an insulator to a metal phase appears under tensile strain. Moreover, this phase transition is highly sensitive to tensile strain and takes place only at a strain 1.0%. These strain-induced electronic structures and phase transitions of the Na3Bi system in various phases are important due to their possible applications under high pressure in future electronic devices.",3
Exploring the formation and electronic structure properties of the g-C3N4 nanoribbon with density functional theory.,"The optical properties and condensation degree (structure) of polymeric g-C3N4 depend strongly on the process temperature. For polymeric g-C3N4, its structure and condensation degree depend on the structure of molecular strand(s). Here, the formation and electronic structure properties of the g-C3N4 nanoribbon are investigated by studying the polymerization and crystallinity of molecular strand(s) employing first-principle density functional theory. The calculations show that the width of the molecular strand has a significant effect on the electronic structure of polymerized and crystallized g-C3N4 nanoribbons, a conclusion which would be indirect evidence that the electronic structure depends on the structure of g-C3N4. The edge shape also has a distinct effect on the electronic structure of the crystallized g-C3N4 nanoribbon. Furthermore, the conductive band minimum and valence band maximum of the polymeric g-C3N4 nanoribbon show a strong localization, which is in good agreement with the quasi-monomer characters. In addition, molecular strands prefer to grow along the planar direction on graphene. These results provide new insight on the properties of the g-C3N4 nanoribbon and the relationship between the structure and properties of g-C3N4.",3
Entanglement entropy and entanglement spectrum of Bi1-x Sb x (1 1 1) bilayers.,"We study topological properties of Bi1-x Sb x bilayers in the (1 1 1) plane using entanglement measures. Electronic structures are investigated within multi-orbital tight-binding model and structural stability is confirmed through first-principles calculations. The topologically non-trivial nature of the bismuth bilayer is proved by the presence of spectral flow in the entanglement spectrum. We consider topological phase transitions driven by a composition change x, an applied external electric field in Bi bilayers and strain in Sb bilayers. Composition- and strain-induced phase transitions reveal a finite discontinuity in the entanglement entropy. This quantity remains a continuous function of the electric field strength, but shows a finite discontinuity in the first derivative. We relate the difference in behavior of the entanglement entropy to the breaking of inversion symmetry in the last case.",3
Density functional theory computational study of ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity in BaTiO3/PbTiO3 (0 1 1) superlattices.,"The structure, ferroelectricity (FE), and piezoelectricity of epitaxial BaTiO3/PbTiO3 (BTO/PTO) (0 1 1) superlattices are studied using density functional theory calculations. Our results show that compressive strain arising from the SrTiO3 (0 1 1) substrate stabilizes the (BTO) m /(PTO) n (0 1 1) superlattices in orthorhombic phase with the FE polarization along [0 1 1] direction. Tuning the BTO contents significantly changes the structural, ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties. The FE polarization of superlattices significantly drops with increasing BTO contents, which can be attributed to depolarization of the PTO layers. The averaged c/a ratio of the whole superlattices exhibits anomalous non-monotonic relation with respect to BTO contents. Interestingly, our results predict the (0 1 1) superlattices can enhance the piezoelectric coefficient e 33 with a maximum value at ~67% BTO concentration. This result suggests a potential avenue to design high performance piezoelectric materials with less Pb contents. In-depth analysis reveals the B-site Ti cation as the origin for the enhanced e 33 value, which implies the potential of B-site cation engineering in perovskite heterostructure designs.",3
Depth dependant element analysis of PbMg1/3Nb2/3O3 using muonic x-rays.,"The relaxor PbMg1/3Nb2/3O3 (PMN) has received attention due to its potential applications as a piezoelectric when doped with PbTiO3 (PT). Previous results have found that there are two phases existing in the system, one linked to the near-surface regions of the sample, the other in the bulk. However, the exact origin of these two phases is unclear. In this paper, depth dependant analysis results from negative muon implantation experiments are presented. It is shown that the Pb content is constant throughout all depths probed in the sample, but the Mg and Nb content changes in the near-surface region below 100 mum. At an implantation depth of 60 mum, it is found that there is a 25% increase in Mg content, with a simultaneous 5% decrease in Nb content in order to maintain charge neutrality. These results show that the previously observed skin effects in PMN are due to a change in concentration and unit cell.",3
Inducing and manipulating magnetization in 2D zinc-oxide by strain and external voltage.,"Two-dimensional (2D) structures that exhibit intriguing magnetic phenomena such as perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and its switchable feature are of great interests in spintronics research. Herein, the density functional theory studies reveal the critical impacts of strain and external gating on vacancy-induced magnetism and its spin direction in a graphene-like single layer of zinc oxide (ZnO). In contrast to the pristine and defective ZnO with an O-vacancy, the presence of a Zn-vacancy induces significant magnetic moments to its first neighboring O and Zn atoms due to the charge deficit. We further predict that the direction of magnetization easy axis reverses from an in-plane to perpendicular orientation under a practically achievable biaxial compressive strain of only ~1-2% or applying an electric field by means of the charge density modulation. This magnetization reversal is mainly driven by the strain- and electric-field-induced changes in the spin-orbit coupled d states of the first-neighbor Zn atom to a Zn-vacancy. These findings open interesting prospects for exploiting strain and electric field engineering to manipulate magnetism and magnetization orientation of 2D materials.",3
Effect of sulphur vacancy and interlayer interaction on the electronic structure and spin splitting of bilayer MoS2.,"Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is one of the candidate materials for nanoelectronics and optoelectronics devices in the future. The electronic and magnetic properties of MoS2 can be regulated by interlayer interaction and the vacancy effect. Nevertheless, the combined effect of these two factors on MoS2 is not clearly understood. In this study, we have investigated the impact of a single S vacancy combined with interlayer interaction on the properties of bilayer MoS2. Our calculated results show that an S vacancy brings impurity states in the band structure of bilayer MoS2, and the energy level of the impurity states can be affected by the interlayer distance, which finally disappears in the bulk state when the layer distance is relatively small. Moreover, during the compression of bilayer MoS2, the bottom layer, where the S vacancy stays, gets an additional charge due to interlayer charge transfer, which first increases, and then decreases due to gradually forming the interlayer S-S covalent bond, as interlayer distance decreases. The change of the additional charge is consistent with the change of the total magnetic moment of the bottom layers, no magnetic moment has been found in the top layer. The distribution of magnetic moment mainly concentrates on the three Mo atoms around the S vacancy, for each of which the magnetic moment is very much related to the Mo-Mo length. Our conclusion is that the interlayer charge transfer and S vacancy co-determine the magnetic properties of this system, which may be a useful way to regulate the electronic and magnetic properties of MoS2 for potential applications.",3
Strain tuning of electronic properties of various dimension elemental tellurium with broken screw symmetry.,"We present a systematical study of atomic structures and electronic properties of various dimension tellurium (Te) with broken intrinsical screw symmetry by applying reasonable strain. It is demonstrated that (i) bulk trigonal Te has degenerate Weyl nodes around the H point near the Fermi energy, and this degeneracy will be broken by introducing the selenium (Se) atom through creating the inner unsymmetrical strain, instead of external shear strain. (ii) 2D structures of tetragonal Te (t-Te) and 1T-MoS2-like Te (1T-Te) show direct and indirect band gap, respectively. Under the uniform biaxial compressive (BC) strain, monolayer of t-Te shows the direct-to-indirect band gap transition, while 1T-Te monolayer has a band gap transition firstly from indirect to direct and then from direct to indirect. Their effective masses of hole and electron can be effectively tuned by BC strain. (iii) One-dimensional (1D) structures of single helix, triangular Te and hexagonal Te nanowires display the obvious quantum confinement effect on the band structure and different sensitivity to the effect of uniaxial compressive strain.",3
Magnetotransport study of topological superconductor Cu0.10Bi2Se3 single crystal.,"We report a magnetotransport study of vortex-pinning in Cu0.10Bi2Se3 single crystal. The sample is demonstrated to be in clean limit and absent of Pauli spin-limiting effect. Interestingly, the resistivity versus magnetic field shows an anomalously pronounced increase when approaching the superconducting-normal state boundary for both [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] configurations. We have investigated the flux-flowing behavior under various magnetic fields and temperatures, enabling us to establish its anisotropic vortex phase diagram. Our results suggest the Cu0.10Bi2Se3 can be served as one unique material for exploring exotic surface vortex states in topological superconductors.",3
Ideal versus real: simulated annealing of experimentally derived and geometric platinum nanoparticles.,"Platinum nanoparticles find significant use as catalysts in industrial applications such as fuel cells. Research into their design has focussed heavily on nanoparticle size and shape as they greatly influence activity. Using high throughput, high precision electron microscopy, the structures of commercially available Pt catalysts have been determined, and we have used classical and quantum atomistic simulations to examine and compare them with geometric cuboctahedral and truncated octahedral structures. A simulated annealing procedure was used both to explore the potential energy surface at different temperatures, and also to assess the effect on catalytic activity that annealing would have on nanoparticles with different geometries and sizes. The differences in response to annealing between the real and geometric nanoparticles are discussed in terms of thermal stability, coordination number and the proportion of optimal binding sites on the surface of the nanoparticles. We find that annealing both experimental and geometric nanoparticles results in structures that appear similar in shape and predicted activity, using oxygen adsorption as a measure. Annealing is predicted to increase the catalytic activity in all cases except the truncated octahedra, where it has the opposite effect. As our simulations have been performed with a classical force field, we also assess its suitability to describe the potential energy of such nanoparticles by comparing with large scale density functional theory calculations.",3
Topological nature of the node-arc semimetal PtSn4 probed by de Haas-van Alphen quantum oscillations.,"Dirac node arc semimetal state is a new topological quantum state which is proposed to exist in PtSn4 (Wu et al 2016 Dirac node arcs in PtSn4 Nat. Phys. 12 667-71). We present a systematic de Haas-van Alphen quantum oscillation study on this compound. Two intriguing oscillation branches, i.e. F 1 and F 2, are detected in the fast Fourier transformation spectra, both of which are characterized to possess tiny effective mass and ultrahigh quantum mobility. And the F 2 branch exhibits an angle-dependent nontrivial Berry phase. The features are consistent with the existence of the node arc semimetal state and shed new light on its complicated Fermi surfaces and topological nature.",3
Electrically tunable polarizer based on graphene-loaded plasmonic cross antenna.,"The unique gate-voltage dependent optical properties of graphene make it a promising electrically-tunable plasmonic material. In this work, we proposed in situ control of the polarization of nanoantennas by combining plasmonic structures with an electrostatically tunable graphene monolayer. The tunable polarizer is designed based on an asymmetric cross nanoantenna comprising two orthogonal metallic dipoles sharing the same feed gap. Graphene monolayer is deposited on a Si/SiO2 substrate, and inserted beneath the nanoantenna. Our modelling demonstrates that as the chemical potential is incremented up to 1 eV by electrostatic doping, resonant wavelength for the longer graphene-loaded dipole is blue shifted for 500 nm (~10% of the resonance) in the mid-infrared range, whereas the shorter dipole experiences much smaller influences due to the unique wavelength-dependent optical properties of graphene. In this way, the relative field amplitude and phase between the two dipole nanoantennas are electrically adjusted, and the polarization state of the reflected wave can be electrically tuned from the circular into near-linear states with the axial ratio changing over 8 dB. Our study thus confirms the strong light-graphene interaction with metallic nanostructures, and illuminates promises for high-speed electrically controllable optoelectronic devices.",3
Bonding in phase change materials: concepts and misconceptions.,"Bonding concepts originating in chemistry are surveyed from a condensed matter perspective, beginning around 1850 with 'valence' and the word 'bond' itself. The analysis of chemical data in the 19th century resulted in astonishing progress in understanding the connectivity and stereochemistry of molecules, almost without input from physicists until the development of quantum mechanics in 1925 and afterwards. The valence bond method popularized by Pauling and the molecular orbital methods of Hund, Mulliken, Bloch, and Huckel play major roles in the subsequent development, as does the central part played by the kinetic energy in covalent bonding (Ruedenberg and others). 'Metallic' (free electron) and related approaches, including pseudopotential and density functional theories, have been remarkably successful in understanding structures and bonding in molecules and solids. We discuss these concepts in the context of phase change materials, which involve the rapid and reversible transition between amorphous and crystalline states, and note the confusion that some have caused, in particular 'resonance' and 'resonant bonding'.",3
Topologically protected edge states for out-of-plane and in-plane bulk elastic waves.,"Topological phononic insulators (TPnIs) show promise for application in the manipulation of acoustic waves for the design of low-loss transmission and perfectly integrated communication devices. Since solid phononic crystals exist as a transverse polarization mode and a mixed longitudinal-transverse polarization mode, the realization of topological edge states for both out-of-plane and in-plane bulk elastic waves is desirable to enhance the controllability of the edge waves in solid systems. In this paper, a two-dimensional (2D) solid/solid hexagonal-latticed phononic system that simultaneously supports the topologically protected edge states for out-of-plane and in-plane bulk elastic waves is investigated. Firstly, two pairs of two-fold Dirac cones, respectively corresponding to the out-of-plane and in-plane waves, are obtained at the same frequency by tuning the crystal parameters. Then, a strategy of zone folding is invoked to form double Dirac cones. By shrinking and expanding the steel scatterer, the lattice symmetry is broken, and band inversions induced, giving rise to an intriguing topological phase transition. Finally, the topologically protected edge states for both out-of-plane and in-plane bulk elastic waves, which can be simultaneously located at the frequency range from 1.223 to 1.251 MHz, are numerically observed. Robust pseudospin-dependent elastic edge wave propagation along arbitrary paths is further demonstrated. Our results will significantly broaden its practical application in the engineering field.",3
Diamond lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet.,"We investigate ground-state and high-temperature properties of the nearest-neighbour Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the three-dimensional diamond lattice, using series expansion methods. The ground-state energy and magnetization, as well as the magnon spectrum, are calculated and found to be in good agreement with first-order spin-wave theory, with a quantum renormalization factor of about 1.13. High-temperature series are derived for the free energy, and physical and staggered susceptibilities for spin S = 1/2, 1 and 3/2, and analysed to obtain the corresponding Curie and Neel temperatures.",3
Tunable dynamic moduli of magnetic elastomers: from characterization by x-ray micro-computed tomography to mesoscopic modeling.,"Ferrogels and magnetorheological elastomers are composite materials obtained by embedding magnetic particles of mesoscopic size in a crosslinked polymeric matrix. They combine the reversible elastic deformability of polymeric materials with the high responsivity of ferrofluids to external magnetic fields. These materials stand out, for example, for significant magnetostriction as well as a pronounced increase of the elastic moduli in the presence of external magnetic fields. By means of x-ray micro-computed tomography, the position and size of each magnetic particle can be measured with a high degree of accuracy. We here use data extracted from real magnetoelastic samples as input for coarse-grained dipole-spring modeling and calculations to investigate internal restructuring, stiffening, and changes in the normal modes spectrum. More precisely, we assign to each particle a dipole moment proportional to its volume and set a randomized network of springs between them that mimics the behavior of the polymeric elastic matrix. Extending our previously developed methods, we compute the resulting structural changes in the systems as well as the frequency-dependent elastic moduli when magnetic interactions are turned on. Particularly, with increasing magnetization, we observe the formation of chain-like aggregates. Interestingly, the static elastic moduli can first show a slight decrease with growing amplitude of the magnetic interactions, before a pronounced increase appears upon the chain formation. The change of the dynamic moduli with increasing magnetization depends on the frequency and can even feature nonmonotonic behavior. Overall, we demonstrate how theory and experiments can complement each other to learn more about the dynamic behavior of this interesting class of materials.",3
Study of irradiation effect of Xe(+22) and Kr(+14) ions on structural properties of Zn nanotubes.,"The paper presents the results of synthesis and directed modification of structural properties of Zn nanotubes by irradiating with heavy ions. The nanotubes were obtained by electrochemical deposition in pores of template polymer matrices. It was established using SEM, XRD and EDS methods where irradiation with Xe(+22) and Kr(+14) ions makes it possible to modify the crystal structure of nanotubes. As a result of irradiation with Xe(+22) ions, partial destruction of nanotubes is observed, which indicates an increase in the number of defects in the structure and a decrease in strength properties. Change in the crystal structure parameters is observed when irradiation with Kr(+14) ions with fluence below 5 x 10(11) ion cm(-2). That indicates the possibility of using Kr(+14) ions for directional modification of nanostructures, while irradiation with Xe(+22) ions leads to amorphization and destruction of nanotubes.",3
The elusive role of NbLi bound polaron energy in hopping charge transport in Fe: LiNbO3.,"Charge transport due to small polarons hopping among defective (bound polarons) and regular (free polarons) sites is shown to depend in a non-trivial way on the value of the stabilization energy provided by the lattice distortion surrounding the charge carriers. This energy, normally not directly accessible for bound polarons using spectroscopic techniques, is determined here by a combination of experimental and numerical methods for the important case of small electron polarons bound to [Formula: see text] defects in the prototype ferroelectric oxide lithium niobate. Our findings provide an estimation of the [Formula: see text] polaron stabilization energy [Formula: see text] and demonstrate that in lithium niobate both free and bound polarons contribute to charge transport at room temperature, explaining the fast decay of the light-induced bound polaron population observed by transient absorption spectroscopy.",3
Local Bi-O bonds correlated with infrared emission properties in triply doped Gd2.95Yb0.02Bi0.02Er0.01Ga5O12 via temperature-dependent Raman spectra and x-ray absorption fine structure analysis.,"A correlation function between the Raman intensities and the nearest-neighbor mean-square relative displacement (MSRD) [Formula: see text] of local Bi-O bonds is successfully established based on x-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and temperature-dependent Raman spectra in the temperature range 77-300 K in amorphous and crystalline Gd2.95Yb0.02Bi0.02Er0.01Ga5O12. The structural symmetries of Gd2.95Yb0.02Bi0.02Er0.01Ga5O12 are described by using [Formula: see text] of local Bi-O bonds. More importantly, Gd2.95Yb0.02Bi0.02Er0.01Ga5O12 is found to show excellent infrared (IR) emission properties due to changes in Bi-O bonds, and the IR emission intensities are found to depend on [Formula: see text], by using temperature-dependent photoluminescence spectroscopy. The maximum emission intensity at 1533 nm is obtained when [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] at the lowest symmetry. This work shows that temperature-dependent Raman intensities can be used effectively to analyze the local covalent bonds around absorbing atoms as well as to study the emission properties of this visible-light-activated IR luminophor.",3
Spin-flop and magnetodielectric reversal in Yb substituted GdMnO3.,"The evolution of various spin structures in Yb doped GdMnO3 distorted orthorhombic perovskite system was investigated from their magnetic, dielectric and magnetodielectric characteristics. The Gd1-x Yb x MnO3 (0 x 0.15) revealed an enhanced magnetodielectric coupling when their magnetic structure is guided from ab to the bc-cycloidal spin structure upon Yb doping. The compounds exhibit magnetic field and temperature controlled spin-flop from c to a-axis. Additionally, magnetodielectric reversal is observed for the x = 0.1 sample which depends on both magnetic field and temperature. The resultant correlation between magnetic and electric orderings is discussed in the frame of symmetric and antisymmetric exchange interaction models. These findings provide further insight in understanding the magnetoelectric materials and importantly show a way to tune the magnetic and magnetodielectric properties towards better application potential.",3
Absence of a long-range ordered magnetic ground state in Pr3Rh4Sn13 studied through specific heat and inelastic neutron scattering.,"Signatures of absence of a long-range ordered magnetic ground state down to 0.36 K are observed in magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, thermal/electrical transport and inelastic neutron scattering data of the quasi-skutterudite compound Pr3Rh4Sn13 which crystallizes in the Yb3Rh4Sn13-type structure with a cage-like network of Sn atoms. In this structure, Pr(3+) occupies a lattice site with D 2d point symmetry having a ninefold degeneracy corresponding to J = 4. The magnetic susceptibility of Pr3Rh4Sn13 shows only a weak temperature dependence below 10 K; otherwise remaining paramagnetic-like in the range, 10 K-300 K. From the inelastic neutron scattering intensity of Pr3Rh4Sn13 recorded at different temperatures, we identify excitations at 4.5(7) K, 5.42(6) K, 10.77(5) K, 27.27(5) K, 192.28(4) K and 308.33(3) K through a careful peak analysis. However, no signatures of long-range magnetic order are observed in the neutron data down to 1.5 K, which is also confirmed by the specific heat data down to 0.36 K. A broad Schottky-like peak is recovered for the magnetic part of the specific heat, C 4f, which suggests the role of crystal electric fields of Pr(3+) . A crystalline electric field model consisting of 7 levels was applied to C 4f which leads to the estimation of energy levels at 4.48(2) K, 6.94(4) K, 11.23(8) K, 27.01(5) K, 193.12(6) K and 367.30(2) K. The CEF energy levels estimated from the heat capacity analysis are in close agreement with the excitation energies seen in the neutron data. The Sommerfeld coefficient estimated from the analysis of magnetic specific heat is [Formula: see text] mJ K(-2) mol-Pr which suggests the formation of heavy itinerant quasi-particles in Pr3Rh4Sn13. Combining inelastic neutron scattering results, analysis of the specific heat data down to 0.36 K, magnetic susceptibility and, electrical and thermal transport, we establish the absence of long-range ordered magnetic ground state in Pr3Rh4Sn13.",3
Generation and detection of dissipationless spin current in a MgO/Si bilayer.,"Spintronics is an analogue to electronics where the spin of the electron rather than its charge is functionally controlled for devices. The generation and detection of spin current without ferromagnetic or exotic/scarce materials are two of the biggest challenges for spintronics devices. In this study, we report a solution to the two problems of spin current generation and detection in Si. Using non-local measurement, we experimentally demonstrate the generation of helical dissipationless spin current using the spin-Hall effect. Contrary to the theoretical prediction, we observe the spin-Hall effect in both n-doped and p-doped Si. The helical spin current is attributed to the site-inversion asymmetry of the diamond cubic lattice of Si and structure inversion asymmetry in a MgO/Si bilayer. The spin to charge conversion in Si is insignificant due to weak spin-orbit coupling. For the efficient detection of spin current, we report spin to charge conversion at the MgO (1 nm)/Si (2 microm) (p-doped and n-doped) thin film interface due to Rashba spin-orbit coupling. We detected the spin current at a distance of >100 microm, which is an order of magnitude larger than the longest spin diffusion length measured using spin injection techniques. The existence of spin current in Si is verified from the coercivity reduction in a Co/Pd multilayer due to spin-orbit torque generated by spin current from Si.",3
Multi-band magnetotransport in exfoliated thin films of Cu x Bi2Se3.,"We report magnetotransport studies in thin (<100 nm) exfoliated films of Cu x Bi2Se3 and we detect an unusual electronic transition at low temperatures. Bulk crystals show weak superconductivity with [Formula: see text] K and a possible electronic phase transition around 200 K. Following exfoliation, superconductivity is supressed and a strongly temperature dependent multi-band conductivity is observed for T < 30 K. This transition between competing conducting channels may be enhanced due to the presence of electronic ordering, and could be affected by the presence of an effective internal stress due to Cu intercalation. By fitting to the weak antilocalisation conductivity correction at low magnetic fields we confirm that the low temperature regime maintains a quantum phase coherence length [Formula: see text] nm indicating the presence of topologically protected surface states.",3
Local structure and defects in ion irradiated KTaO3.,"The modification of the local structure in cubic perovskite KTaO3 irradiated with 3 MeV and 1.1 GeV Au ions is studied by Raman and x-ray absorption spectroscopy, complemented by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In the case of irradiation with 3 MeV Au ions where displacement cascade processes are dominant, the Ta L3-edge x-ray absorption measurements suggest that a peak corresponding to the Ta-O bonds in the TaO6 octahedra splits, which is attributed to the formation of TaK antisite defects that are coupled with oxygen vacancies, V O. This finding is consistent with the DFT calculations. Under irradiation with 1.1 GeV ions, the intense ionization and electronic energy deposition lead to a blue shift and an intensity reduction of active Raman bands. In the case of sequential irradiations, extended x-ray absorption fine structure measurements reveal a decrease in concentration of coupled TaK-V O defects under subsequent irradiation with 1.1 GeV Au ions.",3
Dimethyl methylphosphonate adsorption and decomposition on MoO2 as studied by ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and DFT calculations.,"Organophosphonates range in their toxicity and are used as pesticides, herbicides, and chemical warfare agents (CWAs). Few laboratories are equipped to handle the most toxic molecules, thus simulants such as dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP), are used as a first step in studying adsorption and reactivity on materials. Benchmarked by combined experimental and theoretical studies of simulants, calculations offer an opportunity to understand how molecular interactions with a surface changes upon using a CWA. However, most calculations of DMMP and CWAs on surfaces are limited to adsorption studies on clusters of atoms, which may differ markedly from the behavior on bulk solid-state materials with extended surfaces. We have benchmarked our solid-state periodic calculations of DMMP adsorption and reactivity on MoO2 with ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies (APXPS). DMMP is found to interact strongly with a MoO2 film, a model system for the MoO x component in the ASZM-TEDA(c) gas filtration material. Density functional theory modeling of several adsorption and decomposition mechanisms assist the assignment of APXPS peaks. Our results show that some of the adsorbed DMMP decomposes, with all the products remaining on the surface. The rigorous calculations benchmarked with experiments pave a path to reliable and predictive theoretical studies of CWA interactions with surfaces.",3
Evaluating the Laplace pressure of water nanodroplets from simulations.,"We calculate the components of the microscopic pressure tensor as a function of radial distance r from the centre of a spherical water droplet, modelled using the TIP4P/2005 potential. To do so, we modify a coarse-graining method for calculating the microscopic pressure (Ikeshoji et al 2003 Mol. Simul. 29 101) in order to apply it to a rigid molecular model of water. As test cases, we study nanodroplets ranging in size from 776 to 2880 molecules at 220 K. Beneath a surface region comprising approximately two molecular layers, the pressure tensor becomes approximately isotropic and constant with r. We find that the dependence of the pressure on droplet radius is that expected from the Young-Laplace equation, despite the small size of the droplets.",3
Straightforward measurement of anisotropic thermal properties of a Bi2Se3 single crystal.,"We demonstrate here a simple measurement protocol which allows the thermal properties of anisotropic crystalline materials to be determined. This protocol is validated by the measurement of Bi2Se3, a layered material consisting of covalently bonded sheets with weak van der Waals bonds between each layer, which has highly anisotropic thermal properties. Thermoreflectance microscopy measurements were carried out on a single-crystal Bi2Se3 sample, firstly on the bare sample and then after capping with a 100 nm thick gold layer. Whereas on the bare sample lateral heat diffusion is dominated by the in-plane thermal diffusivity, on the metal-capped substrate heat diffusion perpendicular to the sample surface dominates. Using a simple theoretical model, we show how this double measurement protocol allows the anisotropic thermal conductivity coefficients of bulk Bi2Se3 to be evaluated.",3
Distinguishing Majorana bound states and Andreev bound states with microwave spectra.,"Majorana fermions are a fascinating and not yet confirmed quasiparticles in condensed matter physics. Here we propose using microwave spectra to distinguish Majorana bound states (MBSs) from topological trivial Andreev bound states. By numerically calculating the transmission and Zeeman field dependence of the many-body excitation spectrum of a 1D Josephson junction, we find that the two kinds of bound states have distinct responses to variations in the related parameters. Furthermore, the singular behaviors of the MBSs spectrum could be attributed to the robust fractional Josephson coupling and nonlocality of MBSs. Our results provide a feasible method to verify the existence of MBSs and could accelerate its application to topological quantum computation.",3
Pressure and compressibility factor of bidisperse magnetic fluids.,"In this work, we investigate the pressure and compressibility factors of bidisperse magnetic fluids with relatively weak dipolar interactions and different granulometric compositions. In order to study these properties, we employ the method of diagram expansion, taking into account two possible scenarios: (1) dipolar particles repel each other as hard spheres; (2) the polymer shell on the surface of the particles is modelled through a soft-sphere approximation. The theoretical predictions of the pressure and compressibility factors of bidisperse ferrofluids at different granulometric compositions are supported by data obtained by means of molecular dynamics computer simulations, which we also carried out for these systems. Both theory and simulations reveal that the pressure and compressibility factors decrease with growing dipolar correlations in the system, namely with an increasing fraction of large particles. We also demonstrate that even if dipolar interactions are too weak for any self-assembly to take place, the interparticle correlations lead to a qualitative change in the behaviour of the compressibility factors when compared to that of non-dipolar spheres, making the dependence monotonic.",3
Room-temperature superparamagnetism due to giant magnetic anisotropy in Mo S defected single-layer MoS2.,"Room-temperature superparamagnetism due to a large magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) of a single atom magnet has always been a prerequisite for nanoscale magnetic devices. Realization of two dimensional (2D) materials such as single-layer (SL) MoS2, has provided new platforms for exploring magnetic effects, which is important for both fundamental research and for industrial applications. Here, we use density functional theory (DFT) to show that the antisite defect (Mo S ) in SL MoS2 is magnetic in nature with a magnetic moment mu of approximately 2 [Formula: see text] and, remarkably, exhibits an exceptionally large atomic scale MAE [Formula: see text] of approximately 500 meV. Our calculations reveal that this giant anisotropy is the joint effect of strong crystal field and significant spin-orbit coupling (SOC). In addition, the magnetic moment mu can be tuned between 1 [Formula: see text] and 3 [Formula: see text] by varying the Fermi energy [Formula: see text], which can be achieved either by changing the gate voltage or by chemical doping. We also show that MAE can be raised to approximately 1 eV with n-type doping of the MoS2:Mo S sample. Our systematic investigations deepen our understanding of spin-related phenomena in SL MoS2 and could provide a route to nanoscale spintronic devices.",3
"Dynamical, structural and chemical heterogeneities in a binary metallic glass-forming liquid.","As it approaches the glass transition, particle motion in liquids becomes highly heterogeneous and regions with virtually no mobility coexist with liquid-like domains. This complex dynamic is believed to be responsible for different phenomena including non-exponential relaxation and the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation. Understanding the relationships between dynamical heterogeneities and local structure in metallic liquids and glasses is a major scientific challenge. Here we use classical molecular dynamics simulations to study the atomic dynamics and microscopic structure of [Formula: see text] alloy in the supercooling regime. Dynamical heterogeneities are identified via an isoconfigurational analysis. We demonstrate the transition from isolated to clustering low mobility with decreasing temperature. These slow clusters, whose sizes grow upon cooling, are also associated with concentration fluctuations, characterized by a Zr-enriched phase, with a composition [Formula: see text]. In addition, a structural analysis of slow clusters based on Voronoi tessellation evidences an increase with respect of the bulk system of the fraction of Cu atoms having a local icosahedral order. These results are in agreement with the consolidated scenario of the relevant role played by icosahedral order in the dynamic slowing-down in supercooled metal alloys.",3
Giant magnetic anisotropy and robust quantum anomalous Hall effect in boron-doped graphene with Re-adsorption.,"Recently topological materials have attracted much attention due to their quantization transports as well as edge states. It will be excellent to realize the robust quantum anomalous Hall transports in graphene-based devices. Using density-functional theory and tight-binding method, we investigated the structural, magnetic and topological properties for the boron-doped graphene with Re-adsorption. A large band-gap of 32.5 meV is opened by the Rashba spin-orbital coupling, and the band-gap is robust against the shape deformation of +/-[Formula: see text] along the zigzag direction. Giant magnetic anisotropy emerges in this adsorption system together with the Fermi level lying in the band gap. Both the magnetic anisotropy and the band gap can be tuned by a moderate electric field. Calculations reveal that the system exhibits the quantization transports with the Chern number [Formula: see text].",3
Charge screening-controlled Verwey phase transition in Fe3O4/SrTiO3 heterostructure.,"Despite intensive investigations into the Verwey phase transition of Fe3O4 over half a century, the mechanism of this phase transition remains controversial and needs further research. In this work, we build the Fe3O4/SrTiO3 multiferroic heterostructure and investigate the temperature dependence of its saturation magnetization under various electric fields. It is found that the charge-screening effect not only influences the magnetization but also induces the temperature of the Verwey phase transition shifting ~13 K. It suggests that the Verwey phase transition has certain correlations with the electron distribution and the change of the number of minority spin electrons in the trimerons plays a dominant role in the temperature shift of the phase transition.",3
Modelling of nanoscale multi-gate transistors affected by atomistic interface roughness.,"Interface roughness scattering (IRS) is one of the major scattering mechanisms limiting the performance of non-planar multi-gate transistors, like Fin field-effect transistors (FETs). Here, two physical models (Ando's and multi-sub-band) of electron scattering with the interface roughness induced potential are investigated using an in-house built 3D finite element ensemble Monte Carlo simulation toolbox including parameter-free 2D Schrodinger equation quantum correction that handles all relevant scattering mechanisms within highly non-equilibrium carrier transport. Moreover, we predict the effect of IRS on performance of FinFETs with realistic channel cross-section shapes with respect to the IRS correlation length (Lambda) and RMS height ([Formula: see text]). The simulations of the n-type SOI FinFETs with the multi-sub-band IRS model shows its very strong effect on electron transport in the device channel compared to the Ando's model. We have also found that the FinFETs are strongly affected by the IRS in the ON-region. The limiting effect of the IRS significantly increases as the Fin width is reduced. The FinFETs with [Formula: see text] channel orientation are affected more by the IRS than those with the [Formula: see text] crystal orientation. Finally, Lambda and [Formula: see text] are shown to affect the device performance similarly. A change in values by 30% (Lambda) or [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]) results in an increase (decrease) of up to [Formula: see text] in the drive current.",3
Many-body perturbation theory for understanding optical excitations in organic molecules and solids.,"Semiconductors composed of organic molecules are promising as components for flexible and inexpensive optoelectronic devices, with many recent studies aimed at understanding their electronic and optical properties. In particular, computational modeling of these complex materials has provided new understanding of the underlying properties which give rise to their excited-state phenomena. This article provides an overview of recent many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) studies of optical excitations within organic molecules and solids. We discuss the accuracy of MBPT within the GW/BSE approach in predicting excitation energies and absorption spectra, and assess the impact of two commonly used approximations, the DFT starting point and the Tamm-Dancoff approximation. Moreover, we summarize studies that elucidate the role of solid-state structure on the nature of excitons in organic crystals. These studies show that a rich physical understanding of organic materials can be obtained from GW/BSE.",3
Band structure and unconventional electronic topology of CoSi.,"Semimetals with certain crystal symmetries may possess unusual electronic structure topology, distinct from that of the conventional Weyl and Dirac semimetals. Characteristic property of these materials is the existence of band-touching points with multiple (higher than two-fold) degeneracy and nonzero Chern number. CoSi is a representative of this group of materials exhibiting the so-called 'new fermions'. We report on an ab initio calculation of the electronic structure of CoSi using density functional methods, taking into account the spin-orbit interactions. The linearized [Formula: see text] Hamiltonian, describing the anisotropic electronic structure of CoSi near the Gamma point is derived. The topological features of band-touching nodes with four- and six-fold degeneracy located at the Gamma and R points in the first Brillouin zone are analysed using the linearized Hamiltonians and first principle calculations. In particular, we show, using the non-Abelian Berry curvature, that these band-touching points carry topological charges of [Formula: see text], which change signs at certain values of parameters of the Hamiltonians. We describe the resulting Fermi arc surface states and their spin texture. We also discuss the influence of many body [Formula: see text] corrections on the electronic band structure and the topological properties of CoSi.",3
On-surface synthesis on a bulk insulator surface.,"On-surface synthesis has rapidly emerged as a most promising approach to prepare functional molecular structures directly on a support surface. Compared to solution synthesis, performing chemical reactions on a surface offers several exciting new options: due to the absence of a solvent, reactions can be envisioned that are otherwise not feasible due to the insolubility of the reaction product. Perhaps even more important, the confinement to a two-dimensional surface might enable reaction pathways that are not accessible otherwise. Consequently, on-surface synthesis has attracted great attention in the last decade, with an impressive number of classical reactions transferred to a surface as well as new reactions demonstrated that have no classical analogue. So far, the majority of the work has been carried out on conducting surfaces. However, when aiming for electronic decoupling of the resulting structures, e.g. for the use in future molecular electronic devices, non-conducting surfaces are highly desired. Here, we review the current status of on-surface reactions demonstrated on the (10.4) surface of the bulk insulator calcite. Besides thermally induced C-C coupling of halogen-substituted aryls, photochemically induced [2 + 2] cycloaddition has been proven possible on this surface. Moreover, experimental evidence exists for coupling of terminal alkynes as well as diacetylene polymerization. While imaging of the resulting structures with dynamic atomic force microscopy provides a direct means of reaction verification, the detailed reaction pathway often remains unclear. Especially in cases where the presence of metal atoms is known to catalyze the corresponding solution chemistry reaction (e.g. in the case of the Ullmann reaction), disclosing the precise reaction pathway is of importance to understand and generalize on-surface reactivity on a bulk insulator surface. To this end, density-functional theory calculations have proven to provide atomic-scale insights that have greatly contributed to unravelling the details of on-surface synthesis on a bulk insulator surface.",3
Robust tunable excitonic features in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide quantum dots.,"The effects of quantum confinement on excitons in parabolic quantum dots of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC QDs) are investigated within a massive Dirac fermion model. A giant spin-valley coupling of the TMDC QDs is obtained, larger than that of monolayer TMDC sheets and consistent with recent experimental measurements. The exciton transition energy and the binding energy are calculated, and it is found that the strong quantum confinement results in extremely high exciton binding energies. The enormously large exciton binding energy in TMDC QDs ([Formula: see text] for different kinds of TMDC QDs) ensures that the many body interactions play a significant role in the investigation of the optical properties of these novel nanostructures. The estimated oscillator strength and radiative lifetime of excitons are strongly size-dependent and indicate a giant oscillator strength enhancement and ultrafast radiative annihilation of excitons, varying from a few tens of femtoseconds to a few picoseconds. We found that the spin-dependent band gap, spin-valley coupling, binding energy and excitonic effects can be tuned by quantum confinements, leading to tunable quantum dots in monolayer TMDCs. This finding offers new functionality in engineering the interaction of a 2D material with light and creates promise for the quantum manipulation of spin and valley degrees of freedom in TMDC nanostructures, enabling versatile novel 2D quantum photonic and optoelectronic nanodevices.",3
Self consistent field theory of virus assembly.,"The ground state dominance approximation (GSDA) has been extensively used to study the assembly of viral shells. In this work we employ the self-consistent field theory (SCFT) to investigate the adsorption of RNA onto positively charged spherical viral shells and examine the conditions when GSDA does not apply and SCFT has to be used to obtain a reliable solution. We find that there are two regimes in which GSDA does work. First, when the genomic RNA length is long enough compared to the capsid radius, and second, when the interaction between the genome and capsid is so strong that the genome is basically localized next to the wall. We find that for the case in which RNA is more or less distributed uniformly in the shell, regardless of the length of RNA, GSDA is not a good approximation. We observe that as the polymer-shell interaction becomes stronger, the energy gap between the ground state and first excited state increases and thus GSDA becomes a better approximation. We also present our results corresponding to the genome persistence length obtained through the tangent-tangent correlation length and show that it is zero in case of GSDA but is equal to the inverse of the energy gap when using SCFT.",3
Calculations of spin-polarized Goos-Hanchen displacement in magnetically confined GaAs/Al x Ga1-x As nanostructure modulated by spin-orbit couplings.,"We theoretically investigate Goos-Hanchen (GH) displacement by modelling the spin transport in an archetypal device structure-a magnetically confined GaAs/Al x Ga1-x As nanostructure modulated by spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Both Rashba and Dresselhaus SOCs are taken into account. The degree of spin-polarized GH displacement can be tuned by Rashba or Dresselhaus SOC, i.e. interfacial confining electric field or strain engineering. Based on such a semiconductor nanostructure, a controllable spatial spin splitter can be proposed for spintronics applications.",3
Quantum phase transition and non-Fermi liquid behavior in Fe1-x Co x Si (x 0.7).,"We report on the nature of electron correlations in Fe1-x Co x Si ([Formula: see text]) using combined results of magnetization, specific heat and transport properties. Doping driven quantum critical point is observed to occur at [Formula: see text]. The magnetically unstable regime is identified to be centered around [Formula: see text] [[Formula: see text]]. The emergence of non-Fermi liquid behaviors in x = 0.8 (near to ferromagnetic quantum critical point) and x = 0.9 (disorder-induced) compositions are discussed on the basis of the power-law dependence of susceptibility [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text] for x = 0.8 and 0.55 for x = 0.9), specific heat [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text] for x = 0.8 and 0.9) and resistivity [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text] for x = 0.8 and 1.38 for x = 0.9). Further, a comprehensive classification of doping dependent physical properties of Fe1-x Co x Si is presented in the revisited temperature-composition (T-x) phase diagram.",3
Local order and crystallization of dense polydisperse hard spheres.,"Computer simulations give precious insight into the microscopic behavior of supercooled liquids and glasses, but their typical time scales are orders of magnitude shorter than the experimentally relevant ones. We recently closed this gap for a class of models of size polydisperse fluids, which we successfully equilibrate beyond laboratory time scales by means of the swap Monte Carlo algorithm. In this contribution, we study the interplay between compositional and geometric local orders in a model of polydisperse hard spheres equilibrated with this algorithm. Local compositional order has a weak state dependence, while local geometric order associated to icosahedral arrangements grows more markedly but only at very high density. We quantify the correlation lengths and the degree of sphericity associated to icosahedral structures and compare these results to those for the Wahnstrom Lennard-Jones mixture. Finally, we analyze the structure of very dense samples that partially crystallized following a pattern incompatible with conventional fractionation scenarios. The crystal structure has the symmetry of aluminum diboride and involves a subset of small and large particles with size ratio approximately equal to 0.5.",3
Thermal expansion of quaternary nitride coatings.,"The thermal expansion coefficient of technologically relevant multicomponent cubic nitride alloys are predicted using the Debye model with ab initio elastic constants calculated at 0 K and an isotropic approximation for the Gruneisen parameter. Our method is benchmarked against measured thermal expansion of TiN and Ti(1-x)Al x N as well as against results of molecular dynamics simulations. We show that the thermal expansion coefficients of Ti(1-x-y)X y Al x N (X = Zr, Hf, Nb, V, Ta) solid solutions monotonously increase with the amount of alloying element X at all temperatures except for Zr and Hf, for which they instead decrease for [Formula: see text].",3
Theoretical investigation of excitonic magnetism in LaSrCoO4.,"We use the LDA+U approach to search for possible ordered ground states of LaSrCoO4. We find a staggered arrangement of magnetic multipoles to be stable over a broad range of Co 3d interaction parameters. This ordered state can be described as a spin-density-wave-type condensate of [Formula: see text] excitons carrying spin S = 1. Further, we construct an effective strong-coupling model, calculate the exciton dispersion and investigate closing of the exciton gap, which marks the exciton condensation instability. Comparing the layered LaSrCoO4 with its pseudo cubic analog LaCoO3, we find that for the same interaction parameters the excitonic gap is smaller (possibly vanishing) in the layered cobaltite.",3
Breakdown of the coherence effects and Fermi liquid behavior in YbAl3 nanoparticles.,"A change in the Kondo lattice behavior of bulk YbAl3 has been observed when the alloy is shaped into nanoparticles ( approximately 12 nm). Measurements of the electrical resistivity show inhibited coherence effects and deviation from the standard Fermi liquid behavior (T (2)-dependence). These results are interpreted as being due to the effect of the disruption of the periodicity of the array of Kondo ions provoked by the size reduction process. Additionally, the ensemble of randomly placed nanoparticles also triggers an extra source of electronic scattering at very low temperatures ( approximately 15 K) due to quantum interference effects.",3
Origin of distorted 1T-phase ReS2: first-principles study.,"Group-VIIB transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are known to be stabilized solely in a distorted 1T phase termed as 1T'' phase, which is compared to many stable or metastable phases in other TMDCs. Using first-principles calculations, we study the structural origin of 1T'' phase group-VIIB TMDCs. We find that quasi 1D Peierls-like instability is responsible for the transition to the 1T'' phase ReS2 monolayer from the 1T' phase, another distorted 1T phase. Two half-filled bands in 1T'-ReS2 make sharp peaks in the Lindhard function that prompt the charge density wave (CDW) phase with large band gap opening. Our calculations show that overlapping of the two bands in a broad energy range leads to robust CDW phase or stable 1T'' phase in group-VIIB TMDCs against compositional variation, which is in stark contrast to typical Peierls instability driven by a single band. Calculated total energy curve near the critical point exhibits the feature of the first-order Landau transition due to local chemical bonding. The structural stability of the 1T'' phase in group-VIIB TMDCs is thus guaranteed by two half-filled bands and local chemical bonding.",3
Suppression of material transfer at contacting surfaces: the effect of adsorbates on Al/TiN and Cu/diamond interfaces from first-principles calculations.,"The effect of monolayers of oxygen (O) and hydrogen (H) on the possibility of material transfer at aluminium/titanium nitride (Al/TiN) and copper/diamond (Cu/Cdia) interfaces, respectively, were investigated within the framework of density functional theory (DFT). To this end the approach, contact, and subsequent separation of two atomically flat surfaces consisting of the aforementioned pairs of materials were simulated. These calculations were performed for the clean as well as oxygenated and hydrogenated Al and Cdia surfaces, respectively. Various contact configurations were considered by studying several lateral arrangements of the involved surfaces at the interface. Material transfer is typically possible at interfaces between the investigated clean surfaces; however, the addition of O to the Al and H to the Cdia surfaces was found to hinder material transfer. This passivation occurs because of a significant reduction of the adhesion energy at the examined interfaces, which can be explained by the distinct bonding situations.",3
"Determination of Debye temperatures and Lamb-Mossbauer factors for LnFeO3 orthoferrite perovskites (Ln = La, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd).","Lanthanide orthoferrites have wide-ranging industrial uses including solar, catalytic and electronic applications. Here a series of lanthanide orthoferrite perovskites, LnFeO3 (Ln = La; Nd; Sm; Eu; Gd), prepared through a standard stoichiometric wet ball milling route using oxide precursors, has been studied. Characterisation through x-ray diffraction and x-ray fluorescence confirmed the synthesis of phase-pure or near-pure LnFeO3 compounds. (57)Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy was performed over a temperature range of 10 K-293 K to observe hyperfine structure and to enable calculation of the recoil-free fraction and Debye temperature (theta D) of each orthoferrite. Debye temperatures (Ln = La 474 K; Nd 459 K; Sm 457 K; Eu 452 K; Gd 473 K) and recoil-free fractions (Ln = La 0.827; Nd 0.817; Sm 0.816; Eu 0.812; Gd 0.826) were approximated through minimising the difference in the temperature dependent experimental centre shift and theoretical isomer shift, by allowing the Debye temperature and isomer shift values to vary. This method of minimising the difference between theoretical and actual values yields Debye temperatures consistent with results from other studies determined through thermal analysis methods. This displays the ability of variable-temperature Mossbauer spectroscopy to approximate Debye temperatures and recoil-free fractions, whilst observing temperature induced transitions over the temperature range observed. X-ray diffraction and Rietveld refinement show an inverse relationship between FeO6 octahedral volume and approximated Debye temperatures. Raman spectroscopy show an increase in the band positions attributed to soft modes of Ag symmetry, Ag(3) and Ag(5) from La to GdFeO3 corresponding to octahedral rotations and tilts in the [0 1 0] and [1 0 1] planes respectively.",3
High mobility In0.75Ga0.25As quantum wells in an InAs phonon lattice.,"InGaAs based devices are great complements to silicon for CMOS, as they provide an increased carrier saturation velocity, lower operating voltage and reduced power dissipation (International technology roadmap for semiconductors (www.itrs2.net)). In this work we show that In0.75Ga0.25As quantum wells with a high mobility, 15 000 to 20 000 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) at ambient temperature, show an InAs-like phonon with an energy of 28.8 meV, frequency of 232 cm(-1) that dominates the polar-optical mode scattering from approximately 70 K to 300 K. The measured optical phonon frequency is insensitive to the carrier density modulated with a surface gate or LED illumination. We model the electron scattering mechanisms as a function of temperature and identify mechanisms that limit the electron mobility in In0.75Ga0.25As quantum wells. Background impurity scattering starts to dominate for temperatures <100 K. In the high mobility In0.75Ga0.25As quantum well, GaAs-like phonons do not couple to the electron gas unlike the case of In0.53Ga0.47As quantum wells.",3
Current fluctuations across a nano-pore.,"The frequency-dependent spectrum of current fluctuations through nano-scale channels is studied using analytical and computational techniques. Using a stochastic Nernst-Planck description and neglecting the interactions between the ions inside the channel, an expression is derived for the current fluctuations, assuming that the geometry of the channel can be incorporated through the lower limits for various wave-vector modes. Since the resulting expression turns out to be quite complex, a number of further approximations are discussed such that relatively simple expressions can be used for practical purposes. The analytical results are validated using Langevin dynamics simulations.",3
Analytical bond order potential for simulations of BeO 1D and 2D nanostructures and plasma-surface interactions.,"An analytical interatomic bond order potential for the Be-O system is presented. The potential is fitted and compared to a large database of bulk BeO and point defect properties obtained using density functional theory. Its main applications include simulations of plasma-surface interactions involving oxygen or oxide layers on beryllium, as well as simulations of BeO nanotubes and nanosheets. We apply the potential in a study of oxygen irradiation of Be surfaces, and observe the early stages of an oxide layer forming on the Be surface. Predicted thermal and elastic properties of BeO nanotubes and nanosheets are simulated and compared with published ab initio data.",3
Spin crossover and high spin filtering behavior in Co-Pyridine and Co-Pyrimidine molecules.,"We present a theoretical study on a series of cobalt complexes, which are constructed with cobalt atoms and pyridine/pyrimidine rings, using density functional theory. We investigate the structural and electric transport properties of spin crossover (SCO) Co complex with two spin states, namely low-spin configuration [LS] and high-spin configuration [HS]. Energy analyses of the two spin states imply that the SCO Co-Pyridine2 and Co-Pyrimidine2 complexes may display a spin transition process accompanied by a geometric modification driven by external stimuli. A nearly perfect spin filtering effect is observed in the Co-Pyrimidine2 complex with [HS] state. In addition, we also discover the contact-dependent transmission properties of Co-Pyridine2. These findings indicate that SCO Co complexes are promising materials for molecular spintronic devices.",3
Quasiparticle scattering in type-II Weyl semimetal MoTe2.,"The electronic structure of type-II Weyl semimetal molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2) is studied by using scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory calculations. Through measuring energy-dependent quasiparticle interference (QPI) patterns with a cryogenic scanning tunneling microscope, several characteristic features are found in the QPI patterns. Two of them arise from the Weyl semimetal nature; one is the topological Fermi arc surface state and the other can be assigned to be a Weyl point. The remaining structures are derived from the scatterings relevant to the bulk electronic states. The findings lead to further understanding of the topological electronic structure of type-II Weyl semimetal MoTe2.",3
Image charge models for accurate construction of the electrostatic self-energy of 3D layered nanostructure devices.,"Efficient analytical image charge models are derived for the full spatial variation of the electrostatic self-energy of electrons in semiconductor nanostructures that arises from dielectric mismatch using semi-classical analysis. The methodology provides a fast, compact and physically transparent computation for advanced device modeling. The underlying semi-classical model for the self-energy has been established and validated during recent years and depends on a slight modification of the macroscopic static dielectric constants for individual homogeneous dielectric regions. The model has been validated for point charges as close as one interatomic spacing to a sharp interface. A brief introduction to image charge methodology is followed by a discussion and demonstration of the traditional failure of the methodology to derive the electrostatic potential at arbitrary distances from a source charge. However, the self-energy involves the local limit of the difference between the electrostatic Green functions for the full dielectric heterostructure and the homogeneous equivalent. It is shown that high convergence may be achieved for the image charge method for this local limit. A simple re-normalisation technique is introduced to reduce the number of image terms to a minimum. A number of progressively complex 3D models are evaluated analytically and compared with high precision numerical computations. Accuracies of 1% are demonstrated. Introducing a simple technique for modeling the transition of the self-energy between disparate dielectric structures we generate an analytical model that describes the self-energy as a function of position within the source, drain and gated channel of a silicon wrap round gate field effect transistor on a scale of a few nanometers cross-section. At such scales the self-energies become large (typically up to ~100 meV) close to the interfaces as well as along the channel. The screening of a gated structure is shown to reduce the self-energy relative to un-gated nanowires.",3
Phase transition of intermetallic TbPt at high temperature and high pressure.,"Here we present synchrotron-based x-ray diffraction experiments combined with diamond anvil cell and laser heating techniques on the intermetallic rare earth compound TbPt (Pnma and Z = 4) up to 32.5 GPa and ~1800 K. The lattice parameters of TbPt exhibit continuous compression behavior up to 18.2 GPa without any evidence of phase transformation. Pressure-volume data were fitted to a third-order Birch-Murnaghan equation of state with V 0 = 175.5(2) A(3), [Formula: see text] = 110(5) GPa and [Formula: see text] = 3.8(7). TbPt exhibits anisotropic compression with beta a > beta b > beta c and the ratio of axial compressibility is 2.50:1.26:1.00. A new monoclinic phase of TbPt assigned to the Pc or P2/c space group was observed at 32.5 GPa after laser heating at ~1800 K. This new phase is stable at high pressure and presented a quenchable property on decompression to ambient conditions. The pressure-volume relationship is well described by the second-order Birch-Murnaghan equation of state, which yields V 0 = 672(4) A(3), [Formula: see text] = 123(6) GPa, which is about ~14% more compressible than the orthorhombic TbPt. Our results provide more information on the structure and elastic property view, and thus a better understanding of the physical properties related to magnetic structure in some intermetallic rare earth alloys.",3
Stability enhancement of Cu2S against Cu vacancy formation by Ag alloying.,"As a potential solar absorber material, Cu2S has proved its importance in the field of renewable energy. However, almost all the known minerals of Cu2S suffer from spontaneous Cu vacancy formation in the structure. The Cu vacancy formation causes the structure to possess very high p-type doping that leads the material to behave as a degenerate semiconductor. This vacancy formation tendency is a major obstacle for this material in this regard. A relatively new predicted phase of Cu2S which has an acanthite-like structure was found to be preferable than the well-known low chalcocite Cu2S. However, the Cu-vacancy formation tendency in this phase remained similar. We have found that alloying silver with this structure can help to reduce Cu vacancy formation tendency without altering its electronic property. The band gap of silver alloyed structure is higher than pristine acanthite Cu2S. In addition, Cu diffusion in the structure can be reduced with Ag doped in Cu sites. In this study, a systematic approach is presented within the density functional theory framework to study Cu vacancy formation tendency and diffusion in silver alloyed acanthite Cu2S, and proposed a possible route to stabilize Cu2S against Cu vacancy formations by alloying it with Ag.",3
"Dynamics, thermodynamics and structure of liquids and supercritical fluids: crossover at the Frenkel line.","We review recent work aimed at understanding dynamical and thermodynamic properties of liquids and supercritical fluids. The focus of our discussion is on solid-like transverse collective modes, whose evolution in the supercritical fluids enables one to discuss the main properties of the Frenkel line separating rigid liquid-like and non-rigid gas-like supercritical states. We subsequently present recent experimental evidence of the Frenkel line showing that structural and dynamical crossovers are seen at a pressure and temperature corresponding to the line as predicted by theory and modelling. Finally, we link dynamical and thermodynamic properties of liquids and supercritical fluids by the new calculation of liquid energy governed by the evolution of solid-like transverse modes. The disappearance of those modes at high temperature results in the observed decrease of heat capacity.",3
Entanglement entropy and entanglement spectrum of Bi<sub>1-x</sub>Sb<sub>x</sub> (111) bilayers.,"We study topological properties of Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$ bilayers in the (111) plane using entanglement measures. Electronic structures are investigated within multi-orbital tight-binding model and structural stability is confirmed through first-principles calculations. Topologically non-trivial nature of bismuth bilayer is proved by the presence of spectral flow in the entanglement spectrum. We consider topological phase transitions driven by a composition change x, an applied external electric field in Bi bilayer and strain in Sb bilayer. Composition- and strain-induced phase transitions reveal a finite discontinuity in the entanglement entropy. This quantity remains a continuous function of the electric field strength, but shows a finite discontinuity in the first derivative. We relate the difference in behavior of the entanglement entropy to the breaking of inversion symmetry in the last case.",3
Magnetic order of Nd5Pb3 single crystals.,"We report millimeter-sized Nd5Pb3 single crystals grown out of a Nd-Co flux. We experimentally study the magnetic order of Nd5Pb3 single crystals by measuring the anisotropic magnetic properties, electrical resistivity under high pressure up to 8 GPa, specific heat, and neutron single crystal diffraction. Two successive magnetic orders are observed at T N1 = 44 K and T N2 = 8 K. The magnetic cells can be described with a propagation vector [Formula: see text]. Cooling below T N1, Nd1 and Nd3 order forming ferromagnetic stripes along the b-axis, and the ferromagnetic stripes are coupled antiferromagnetically along the a-axis for the [Formula: see text] magnetic domain. Cooling below T N2, Nd2 orders antiferromagnetically to nearby Nd3 ions. All ordered moments align along the crystallographic c-axis. The magnetic order at T N1 is accompanied by a quick drop of electrical resistivity upon cooling and a lambda-type anomaly in the temperature dependence of specific heat. At T N2, no anomaly was observed in electrical resistivity but there is a weak feature in specific heat. The resistivity measurements under hydrostatic pressures up to 8 GPa suggest a possible phase transition around 6 GPa. Our first-principles band structure calculations show that Nd5Pb3 has the same electronic structure as does Y5Si3 which has been reported to be a one-dimensional electride with anionic electrons that do not belong to any atom. Our study suggests that R 5Pb3 (R = rare earth) can be a materials playground for the study of magnetic electrides. This deserves further study after experimental confirmation of the presence of anionic electrons.",3
Towards understanding of magnetization reversal in Nd-Fe-B nanocomposites: analysis by high-throughput micromagnetic simulations.,"We demonstrate how micromagnetic simulations can be employed in order to characterize and analyze the magnetic microstructure of nanocomposites. For the example of nanocrystalline Nd-Fe-B, which is a potential material for future permanent-magnet applications, we have compared three different models for the micromagnetic analysis of this material class: (i) a description of the nanocomposite microstructure in terms of Stoner-Wohlfarth particles with and without the magnetodipolar interaction; (ii) a model based on the core-shell representation of the nanograins; (iii) the latter model including a contribution of superparamagnetic clusters. The relevant parameter spaces have been systematically scanned with the aim to establish which micromagnetic approach can most adequately describe experimental data for this material. According to our results, only the last, most sophisticated model is able to provide an excellent agreement with the measured hysteresis loop. The presented methodology is generally applicable to multiphase magnetic nanocomposites and it highligths the complex interrelationship between the microstructure, magnetic interactions, and the macroscopic magnetic properties.",3
Short and medium range structures of 80GeSe2-20Ga2Se3 chalcogenide glasses.,"The short and medium range structures of 80GeSe2-20Ga2Se3 (or Ge23.5Ga11.8Se64.7) chalcogenide glasses have been studied by combining ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and experimental neutron diffraction studies. The structure factor and total correlation function were calculated from glass structures generated from AIMD simulations and compared with neutron diffraction experiments showing reasonable agreement. The atomic structures of ternary chalcogenide glasses were analyzed in detail, and it was found that gallium atoms are four-fold coordinated by selenium (Se) and form [GaSe4] tetrahedra. Germanium atoms on average also have four-fold coordination, among which Se is 3.5 with the remaining being Ge-Ge homo-nuclear bonds. Ga and Ge tetrahedra link together mainly through corner-sharing and some edge-sharing of Se. No homo-nuclear bonds were observed among Ga atoms or between Ge and Ga. In addition, Se-Se homo-nuclear bonds and Se chains with various lengths were observed. A small fraction of Se atom triclusters that bond to three cations of Ge and Ga were also observed, confirming earlier proposals from (77)Se solid state nuclear magnetic resonance studies. Furthermore, the electronic structures of ternary chalcogenide glasses were studied in terms of atomic charge and electronic density of states in order to gain insights into the chemical bonding and electronic properties, as well as to provide an explanation of the observed atomic structures in these ternary chalcogenide glasses.",3
"Novel elastic, lattice dynamics and thermodynamic properties of metallic single-layer transition metal phosphides: 2H-M 2P (Mo2P, W2P, Nb2P and Ta2P).","Recently, there has been a surge of interest in the research of two-dimensional (2D) phosphides due to their unique physical properties and wide applications. Transition metal phosphides 2H-M 2Ps (Mo2P, W2P, Nb2P and Ta2P) show considerable catalytic activity and energy storage potential. However, the electronic structure and mechanical properties of 2D 2H-M 2Ps are still unrevealed. Here, first-principles calculations are employed to investigate the lattice dynamics, elasticity and thermodynamic properties of 2H-M 2Ps. Results show that M 2Ps with lower stiffness exhibit remarkable lateral deformation under unidirectional loads. Due to the largest average Gruneisen parameter, single-layer Nb2P has the strongest anharmonic vibrations, resulting in the highest thermal expansion coefficient. The lattice thermal conductivities of Ta2P, W2P and Nb2P contradict classical theory, which would predict a smaller thermal conductivity due to the much heavier atom mass. Moreover, the calculations also demonstrate that the thermal conductivity of Ta2P is the highest as well as the lowest thermal expansion, owing to its weak anharmonic phonon scattering and the lowest average Gruneisen parameter. The insight provided by this study may be useful for future experimental and theoretical studies concerning 2D transition metal phosphide materials.",3
Flow induced crystallisation of penetrable particles.,"For a system of Brownian particles interacting via a soft exponential potential we investigate the interaction between equilibrium crystallisation and spatially varying shear flow. For thermodynamic state points within the liquid part of the phase diagram, but close to the crystallisation phase boundary, we observe that imposing a Poiseuille flow can induce nonequilibrium crystalline ordering in regions of low shear gradient. The physical mechanism responsible for this phenomenon is shear-induced particle migration, which causes particles to drift preferentially towards the center of the flow channel, thus increasing the local density in the channel center. The method employed is classical dynamical density functional theory.",3
Superconductivity in tantalum self-intercalated 4Ha-Ta1.03Se2.,"TaSe2 has several different polytypes and abundant physical properties, such as superconductivity and charge density waves (CDW), which have been investigated in the past few decades. However, there has been no report on the physical properties of the 4Ha polytype up to now. Here we report the crystal growth and discovery of superconductivity in the tantalum self-intercalated 4Ha-Ta1.03Se2 single crystal with a superconducting transition onset temperature of [Formula: see text] K, which is the first observation of superconductivity in the 4Ha polytype of TaSe2. A slightly suppressed CDW transition is found around 106 K. A large [Formula: see text] value of about 4.48 is found when a magnetic field is applied in the ab-plane, which probably results from the enhanced spin-orbit coupling. Special stacking faults are observed, which further enhance the anisotropy. Although the density of states at the Fermi level is lower than that of other polytypes, T c remains the same, indicating that the stack mode of the 4Ha polytype may be beneficial to superconductivity in TaSe2.",3
Exotic superconducting states in the extended attractive Hubbard model.,"We show that the extended attractive Hubbard model on a square lattice allows for a variety of superconducting phases, including exotic mixed-symmetry phases with [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] symmetries, and a novel [Formula: see text] state. The calculations are performed within the Hartree-Fock Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer framework. The ground states of the mean-field Hamiltonian are obtained via a minimization scheme that relaxes the symmetry constraints on the superconducting solutions, hence allowing for a mixing of s-, p- and d-wave order parameters. The results are obtained within the assumption of uniform-density states. Our results show that extended attractive Hubbard model can serve as an effective model for investigating properties of exotic superconductors.",3
Relaxation dynamics of magnetization transitions in synthetic antiferromagnet with perpendicular anisotropy.,"Two synthetic antiferromagnet bilayer systems with strong perpendicular anisotropy CoFeB/Ta/CoFeB and Pt/Co/Ir/Co/Pt have been grown using sputtering techniques. For both systems two types of magnetization transitions have been studied. The first one concerns transitions from a state where magnetizations of the two magnetic layers are parallel (P state) to a state where magnetizations of the two layers are aligned antiparallel (AP state). The second one concerns transitions between the two possible antiparallel alignments (AP+ to AP-). For both systems and both transitions after-effect measurements can be understood in the frame of nucleation-propagation model. Time derivative analysis of magnetic relaxation curves and mapping of the first order reversal curves at different temperature allowed us to demonstrate the presence of different pinning centers, which number can be controlled by magnetic field and temperature.",3
Micro-structure and motion of two-dimensional dense short spherocylinder liquids.,"We numerically investigate the micro-structure and motion of 2D liquids composed of dense short spherocylinders, by reducing the shape aspect ratio from 3. It is found that reducing shape aspect ratio from 3 causes a smooth transition from heterogeneous structures composed of crystalline ordered domains with good tetratic alignment order to those with good hexagonal bond-orientational order at an aspect ratio equaling 1.35. In the intermediate regime, both structural orders are strongly deteriorated, and the translational hopping rate reaches a maximum due to the poor particle interlocking of the disordered structure. Shortening rod length allows easier rotation, induces monotonic increase of rotational hopping rates, and resumes the separation of rotational and translational hopping time scales at the small aspect ratio end, after the crossover of their rates in the intermediate regime. At the large shape aspect ratio end, the poor local tetratic order has the same positive effects on facilitating local rotational and translational hopping. In contrast, at the small shape aspect ratio end, the poor local bond orientational order has the opposite effects on facilitating local rotational and translational hopping.",3
Study of crystal-field excitations and infrared active phonons in TbMnO3.,"The Tb(3+) (4f (8)) crystal-field (CF) excitations and the infrared phonons in TbMnO3 are studied as a function of temperature and under an applied magnetic field. The phonon energy shifts reflect local displacement of the oxygen ions that contribute to the CF energy level shifts below 120 K and under magnetic field. The CF polarized transmission spectra provide interesting information about the debated nature of the excitations at 41, 65, 130 cm(-1). We also evaluate the contribution of the charge transfer mechanism to the magnetoelectric process in TbMnO3 under magnetic field.",3
Thermoelectric properties of Co4Sb12 with Bi2Te3 nanoinclusions.,"The figure of merit (zT) of a thermoelectric material can be enhanced by incorporation of nanoinclusions into bulk material. The presence of bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3) nanoinclusions in Co4Sb12 leads to lower phonon thermal conductivity by introducing interfaces and defects; it enhances the average zT between 300-700 K. In the current study, Bi2Te3 nanoparticles were dispersed into bulk Co4Sb12 by ball-milling. The bulk was fabricated by spark plasma sintering. The presence of Bi2Te3 dispersion in Co4Sb12 was confirmed by x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and electron back scattered diffraction technique. Energy dispersive spectroscopy showed antimony (Sb) as an impurity phase for higher contents of Bi2Te3 in the sample. The Seebeck coefficient (S) and electrical conductivity (sigma) were measured in the temperature range of 350-673 K. The negative value of S indicates that most of the charge carriers were electrons. A decrease in S and increase in sigma with Bi2Te3 content are due to the increased carrier concentration, as confirmed by Hall measurement. The thermal conductivity, measured between 423-673 K, decreased due to the increased phonon scattering at interfaces. A maximum zT of 0.17 was achieved at 523 K and it did not vary much throughout the temperature range. The experimental results of composites were compared by using effective medium theories.",3
Franck Condon shift assessment in 2D MoS2.,"Optical spectroscopy (OS) techniques are often coupled with first-principles density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations for determining the precise influence of defects on the electronic and structural properties of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides. Such calculations are carried out presuming there is little or no effect of vibrational transitions on the observed electronic spectrum. However, if the effect of change in vibrational energy (Franck Condon (FC) shift) associated with such a transition is large, it could possibly lead to a different origin for the observed peak. One such instance is the attribution of the 0.75 eV cathodoluminescence peak by Fabbri et al (2016 Nat. Commun. 7 13044) to an optical transition from an S vacancy level in the band gap, under the assumption that the FC shift is negligible. Here, by first principles constrained DFT calculations using hybrid HSE06 functional we show that this combined prediction of OS and DFT calculations is valid for 2D MoS2 since the FC shift associated with electronic transitions from a sulfur vacancy is indeed small ~28 meV. Based on our calculations we conclude that it is reasonable to make a direct connection between DFT calculations and optical spectroscopy techniques in this material, hence, establishing a one to one relation between defect related emission bands and electronic transitions from the defect levels.",3
Hydrodynamic shrinkage of liquid CO2 Taylor drops in a straight microchannel.,"Hydrodynamic shrinkage of liquid CO2 drops in water under a Taylor flow regime is studied using a straight microchannel (length/width ~100). A general form of a mathematical model of the solvent-side mass transfer coefficient (k s) is developed first. Based on formulations of the surface area (A) and the volume (V) of a general Taylor drop in a rectangular microchannel, a specific form of k s is derived. Drop length and speed are experimentally measured at three specified positions of the straight channel, namely, immediately after drop generation (position 1), the midpoint of the channel (position 2) and the end of the channel (position 3). The reductions of drop length (L x , x = 1, 2, 3) from position 1 to 2 and down to 3 are used to quantify the drop shrinkage. Using the specific model, k s is calculated mainly based on L x and drop flowing time (t). Results show that smaller CO2 drops produced by lower flow rate ratios ([Formula: see text]) are generally characterized by higher (nearly three times) k s and Sherwood numbers than those produced by higher [Formula: see text], which is essentially attributed to the larger effective portion of the smaller drop contributing in the mass transfer under same levels of the flowing time and the surface-to-volume ratio (~10(4) m(-1)) of all drops. Based on calculated pressure drops of the segmented flow in microchannel, the Peng-Robinson equation of state and initial pressures of drops at the T-junction in experiments, overall pressure drop (DeltaP t) in the straight channel as well as the resulted drop volume change are quantified. DeltaP t from position 1-3 is by average 3.175 kPa with a ~1.6% standard error, which only leads to relative drop volume changes of 0.3 per thousand to 0.52 per thousand.",3
Evidence for negative thermal expansion in the superconducting precursor phase SmFeAsO.,"The fluorine-doped rare-earth iron oxypnictide series SmFeAsO1-x F x (0 [Formula: see text] 0.10) was investigated with high resolution powder x-ray scattering. In agreement with previous studies (Margadonna et al 2009 Phys. Rev. B. 79 014503), the parent compound SmFeAsO exhibits a tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural distortion at [Formula: see text] = 130 K which is rapidly suppressed by [Formula: see text] 0.10 deep within the superconducting dome. The change in unit cell symmetry is followed by a previously unreported magnetoelastic distortion at 120 K. The temperature dependence of the thermal expansion coefficient [Formula: see text] reveals a rich phase diagram for SmFeAsO: (i) a global minimum at 125 K corresponds to the opening of a spin-density wave instability as measured by pump-probe femtosecond spectroscopy (Mertelj et al 2010 Phys. Rev. B 81 224504) whilst (ii) a global maximum at 110 K corresponds to magnetic ordering of the Sm and Fe sublattices as measured by magnetic x-ray scattering (Nandi et al 2011 Phys. Rev. B 84 055419). At much lower temperatures than [Formula: see text], SmFeAsO exhibits a significant negative thermal expansion on the order of -40 ppm . K(-1) in contrast to the behaviour of other rare-earth oxypnictides such as PrFeAsO (Kimber et al 2008 Phys. Rev. B 78 140503) and the actinide oxypnictide NpFeAsO (Klimczuk et al 2012 Phys. Rev. B 85 174506) where the onset of [Formula: see text] 0 only appears in the vicinity of magnetic ordering. Correlating this feature with the temperature and doping dependence of the resistivity and the unit cell parameters, we interpret the negative thermal expansion as being indicative of the possible condensation of itinerant electrons accompanying the opening of a SDW gap, consistent with transport measurements (Tropeano et al 2009 Supercond. Sci. Technol. 22 034004).",3
Charge screening-controlled Verwey phase transition in Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SrTiO<sub>3</sub> heterostructure.,"Despite intensive investigations on the Verwey phase transition of Fe3O4 over half a century, the mechanism of this phase transition remains controversial and needs further research. In this work, we build the Fe3O4/SrTiO3 multiferroic heterostructure and investigate its temperature dependence of saturation magnetization under various electric fields. It is found that the charge-screening effect not only influences the magnetization but also induces the temperature of Verwey phase transition shifting ~13 K. It suggests that the Verwey phase transition has certain correlations with the electron distribution and the change of the number of minority spin electrons in the trimerons plays a dominant role in the temperature shift of phase transition.",3
Role of Graph Architecture in Controlling Dynamical Networks with Applications to Neural Systems.,"Networked systems display complex patterns of interactions between components. In physical networks, these interactions often occur along structural connections that link components in a hard-wired connection topology, supporting a variety of system-wide dynamical behaviors such as synchronization. While descriptions of these behaviors are important, they are only a first step towards understanding and harnessing the relationship between network topology and system behavior. Here, we use linear network control theory to derive accurate closed-form expressions that relate the connectivity of a subset of structural connections (those linking driver nodes to non-driver nodes) to the minimum energy required to control networked systems. To illustrate the utility of the mathematics, we apply this approach to high-resolution connectomes recently reconstructed from Drosophila, mouse, and human brains. We use these principles to suggest an advantage of the human brain in supporting diverse network dynamics with small energetic costs while remaining robust to perturbations, and to perform clinically accessible targeted manipulation of the brain's control performance by removing single edges in the network. Generally, our results ground the expectation of a control system's behavior in its network architecture, and directly inspire new directions in network analysis and design via distributed control.",3
Electronic transport property in Weyl semimetal with local Weyl cone tilt.,"In realistic materials of Weyl semimetal (WSM), the Weyl cone tilt (WCT) is allowed due to the absence of Lorentz invariance in condensed matter physics. In this context, we theoretically study the electronic transport property in WSM with the local WCT as the scattering mechanism. In so doing, we establish an electronic transport structure of WSM with the WCT occurring only in the central region sandwiched between two pieces of semi-infinite WSM without the WCT. By means of two complementary theoretical approaches, i.e. the continuum-model method and the lattice-model method, the electronic transmission probability, the conductivity and the Fano factor as functions of the incident electron energy are calculated respectively. We find that the WCT can give rise to nontrivial intervalley scattering, as a result, the Klein tunneling is notably suppressed. More importantly, the minimal conductivity of a WSM shifts in energy from the Weyl nodal point. The Fano factor of the shot noise deviates obviously from the sub-Poissonian value in a two dimensional WSM with the WCT.",3
Depth dependant element analysis of PbMg<sub>1/3</sub>Nb<sub>2/3</sub>O<sub>3</sub> using muonic X-rays.,"The relaxor PbMg&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Nb&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&g t; (PMN) has received attention due to its potential applications as a piezoelectric when doped with PbTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (PT). Previous results have found that there are two phases existing in the system, one linked to the near-surface regions of the sample, the other in the bulk. However, the exact origin of these two phases is unclear. In this paper, depth dependant analysis results from negative muon implantation experiments are presented. It is shown that the Pb content is constant throughout all depths probed in the sample, but the Mg and Nb content changes in the near-surface region below 100mum. At a implantation depth of 60mum, it is found that there is a 25% increase in Mg content, with a simultaneous 5% decrease in Nb content in order to maintain charge neutrality. These results show that the previously observed skin effects in PMN are due to a change in concentration and unit cell.",3
Completely flat 2D Zn3O2 monolayer with triangle and pentangle coordinated networks.,"Two-dimensional (2D) materials with strictly planar hyper-coordinated motifs are of great importance in fundamental science and potential applications but extremely rare. Here we theoretically design a novel 2D IIB-VIA inorganic system, namely Zn3O2 monolayer, by comprehensive first-principles computations. This Zn3O2 monolayer is composed from highly symmetrical tri-coordinated oxygen and tetra-coordinated zinc, featuring planar and peculiar triangle and pentangle combined bonded network. The newly predicted Zn3O2 monolayer possesses excellent dynamic and thermal stabilities and is also the lowest-energy structure of its 2D space indicated by particle swarm search, supporting its experimentally synthetic viability. A relatively wide band gap of 4.46 eV means it has potential applications in electronics and optoelectronics. The present findings provide a new field of hyper-coordinated 2D nanomaterials for study.",3
Transport theory for femtosecond laser-induced spin-transfer torques.,"Ultrafast demagnetization of magnetic layers pumped by a femtosecond laser pulse is accompanied by a nonthermal spin-polarized current of hot electrons. These spin currents are studied here theoretically in a spin valve with noncollinear magnetizations. To this end, we introduce an extended model of superdiffusive spin transport that enables the treatment of noncollinear magnetic configurations, and apply it to the perpendicular spin valve geometry. We show how spin-transfer torques arise due to this mechanism and calculate their action on the magnetization present, as well as how the latter depends on the thicknesses of the layers and other transport parameters. We demonstrate that there exists a certain optimum thickness of the out-of-plane magnetized spin-current polarizer such that the torque acting on the second magnetic layer is maximal. Moreover, we study the magnetization dynamics excited by the superdiffusive spin-transfer torque due to the flow of hot electrons employing the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. Thereby we show that a femtosecond laser pulse applied to one magnetic layer can excite small-angle precessions of the magnetization in the second magnetic layer. We compare our calculations with recent experimental results.",3
"Stability, elastic and electronic properties of a novel BN2 sheet with extended hexagons with N-N bonds.",A new B-N monolayer material (BN2) consisting of a network of extended hexagons is predicted using density functional theory. The distinguishable nature of this 2D material is found to be the presence of the bonded N atoms (N-N) in the lattice. Analysis of the phonon dispersion curves show this phase of BN2 to be stable. The calculated elastic properties exhibit anisotropic mechanical properties that surpass graphene in the armchair direction. The BN2 monolayer is metallic with in-plane p states dominating the Fermi level. Novel applications resulting from a strong anisotropic mechanical strength together with the metallic properties of the BN2 sheet with the extended hexagons with N-N bonds may enable future innovation at the nanoscale.,3
Straightforward measurement of anisotropic thermal properties of a Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> single crystal.,"We demonstrate here a simple measurement protocol which allows the thermal properties of anisotropic crystalline materials to be determined. This protocol is validated by the measurement of Bi2Se3, a layered material consisting of covalently bonded sheets with weak van-der-Waals bonds between each layer, which has highly anisotropic thermal properties. Thermoreflectance microscopy measurements were carried out on a single-crystal Bi2Se3 sample, firstly on the bare sample and then after capping wih a 100 nm thick gold layer. Whereas on the bare sample lateral heat diffusion is dominated by the in-plane thermal diffusivity, on the metal-capped substrate heat diffusion perpendicular to the sample surface dominates. Using a simple theoretical model, we show how this double measurement protocol allows the anisotropic thermal conductivity coefficients of bulk Bi2Se3 to be evaluated.",3
Relaxation of strongly coupled electron and phonon fields after photoemission and high-energy part of ARPES spectra of cuprates.,An approach to considering systems with a high concentration of correlated carriers and strong long-range electron-phonon interaction and to calculating the high-energy part of the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) spectra of such systems is suggested. Joint relaxation of strongly coupled fields-a field of correlated electrons and phonon field-after photoemission is studied to clarify the nature of characteristic features observed in the high-energy part of the ARPES spectra of cuprate superconductors. Such relaxation occurs in systems with strong predominantly long-range electron-phonon interaction at sufficiently high carrier concentration due to the coexistence of autolocalized and delocalized carriers. A simple method to calculate analytically a high-energy part of the ARPES spectrum arising is proposed. It takes advantage of using the coherent states basis for the phonon field in the polaron and bipolaron states. The approach suggested yields all the high-energy spectral features like broad Gaussian band and regions of 'vertical dispersion' being in good quantitative agreement with the experiments on cuprates at any doping with both types of carriers. Demonstrated coexistence of autolocalized and delocalized carriers in superconducting cuprates changes the idea about their ground state above the superconducting transition temperature that is important for understanding transport and magnetic properties. High density of large-radius autolocalized carriers revealed may be a key to the explanation of charge ordering in doped cuprates.,3
Transmission/reflection behaviors of surface plasmons at an interface between two plasmonic systems.,"Although surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) have been intensively studied in past years, the transmission/reflection properties of SPPs at an interface between two plasmonic media are still not fully understood. In this article, we employ a mode expansion method (MEM) to systematically study such a problem based on a model system jointing two superlattices, each consisting of a periodic stacking of dielectric and plasmonic slabs with different material properties. Such a generic model can represent two widely used plasmonic structures (i.e. interfaces between two single dielectric/metal systems or between two metal-insulator-metal waveguides) under certain conditions. Our MEM calculations, in excellent agreement with full-wave simulations, uncover the rich physics behind the SPP reflections at generic plasmonic interfaces. In particular, we successfully derive from the MEM several analytical formulas that can quantitatively describe the SPP reflections at different plasmonic interfaces, and show that our formulas exhibit wider applicable regions than previously proposed empirical ones.",3
Spin-flop and magnetodielectric reversal in Yb substituted GdMnO<sub>3</sub>.,"The evolution of various spin structures in Yb doped GdMnO&lt;sub&gt;3 &lt;/sub&gt;distorted orthorhombic perovskite system was investigated from their magnetic, dielectric and magnetodielectric characteristics. The Gd&lt;sub&gt;1-&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;Yb&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;& lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (0 </= &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; </= 0.15) revealed an enhanced magnetodielectric coupling when their magnetic structure is guided from &lt;i&gt;ab&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;bc&lt;/i&gt;-cycloidal spin structure upon Yb doping. The compounds exhibit magnetic field and temperature controlled spin-flop from &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;-axis. Additionally, magnetodielectric reversal is observed for &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; = 0.1 sample which depends on both magnetic field and temperature. The resultant correlation between magnetic and electric orderings is discussed in the frame of symmetric and antisymmetric exchange interaction models. These findings provide further insight in understanding the magnetoelectric materials and importantly show a way to tune the magnetic and magnetodielectric properties towards better application potential.",3
The elusive role of Nb<sub>Li</sub> bound polaron energy in hopping charge transport in Fe : LiNbO<sub>3</sub>.,"Charge transport due to small polarons hopping among defective (bound polarons) and regular (free polarons) sites is shown to depend in a non-trivial way from the value of the stabilization energy provided by the lattice distortion surrounding the charge carriers. This energy, normally not directly accessible for bound polarons by spectroscopic techniques, is here determined by a combination of experimental and numerical methods for the important case of small electron polarons bound to \mathrm{Nb}_{\mathrm{Li}} defects in the prototype ferroelectric oxide lithium niobate. Our findings provide an estimation of the \mathrm{Nb}_{\mathrm{Li}} polaron stabilization energy E_{GP}=\unit[(0.75\pm0.05)]{eV} and point out that in lithium niobate both free and bound polarons contributes to charge transport already at room temperature, explaining the fast decays of the light-induced bound polaron population observed by transient absorption spectroscopy.",3
Effect of sulphur vacancy and interlayer interaction on the electronic structure and spin splitting of bilayer MoS<sub>2</sub>.,"Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is one of candidate materials for nanoelectronics and optoelectronics devices in future. The electronic and magnetic properties of MoS2 can be regulated by interlayer interaction and vacancy effect. Nevertheless, the combined effect of these two factors on MoS2 is not clearly understood. In this study, we have investigated the impact of single S vacancy combined with interlayer interaction on the properties of bilayer MoS2. Our calculated results show that S vacancy brings impurity states in the band structure of bilayer MoS2, and the energy level of the impurity states can be affected by interlayer distance, which finally disappears in bulk state when the layer distance is relatively small. Moreover, during the compressing of bilayer MoS2, the bottom layer, where S vacancy stays, gets additional charge due to interlayer charge transfer, which first increases, and then decreases due to gradually forming the interlayer S-S covalent bond, as interlayer distance decreases. The change of the additional charge is consistent with the change of the total magnetic moment of bottom layers, no magnetic moment has been found in top layer. The distribution of magnetic moment mainly concentrates on the three Mo atoms around S vacancy, each of whose magnetic moment is very much related to the Mo-Mo length. Our conclusion is that the interlayer charge transfer and S vacancy codetermine the magnetic properties of this system, which maybe a useful way to regulate the electronic and magnetic properties of MoS2 for potential applications.",3
First principles study of LiAlO2: new dense monoclinic phase under high pressure.,"In this work, we have systematically explored the crystal structures of LiAlO2 at high pressures using crystal structure prediction method in combination with the density functional theory calculations. Besides the reported alpha, beta, gamma, delta and epsilon-phases, here we propose a new monoclinic zeta-LiAlO2 (C2/m) structure, which becomes thermodynamically and dynamically stable above 27 GPa. It is found that the cation coordination number increases from 4 to 6 under compression. Consisting of the compact {LiO6} and {AlO6} octahedrons, the newly-discovered zeta-phase possesses a very high density. Further electronic calculations show that LiAlO2 is still an insulator up to 60 GPa, and its bandgap increases upon compression. The present study advances our understanding on the crystal structures and high-pressure phase transitions of LiAlO2 that may trigger applications in multiple areas of industry and provoke more related basic science research.",3
Phase transition studies of Na<sub>3</sub>Bi system under uniaxial strain.,"We investigated the electronic properties and phase transitions of Na3Bi in four structural phases (space groups P63/mmc, P3(_)c1, Fm3(_)m and Cmcm) under constant-volume uniaxial strain using first-principles method. For P63/mmc and P3(_)c1-Na3Bi, an important phase transition from a topological Dirac semimetal (TDS) to a topological insulator (TI) appears under compression strain around 4.5%. The insulating gap increases with the increasing compressive strain and up to around 0.1eV at strain 10%. However, both P63/mmc and P3(_)c1-Na3Bi still keep the properties of TDS within tensile strain 0~10%, although the Dirac points move away from the point along -A in reciprocal space as tensile strain increases. The Na3Bi with space group Fm3(_)m is identified as a topological semimetal (TS) with the inverted bands between Na-3s and Bi-6p and parabolic dispersion in the vicinity of point. Interestingly, for Fm3(_)m-Na3Bi, both compression and tensile strain leads to a TDS which are identified by calculating surface Fermi arcs and topological invariants at time-reversal planes (kz=0 and kz=/c) in reciprocal space. Additionally, we confirmed the high pressure phase Cmcm-Na3Bi is an ordinary insulator with a gap about 0.62eV. It is noteworthy that its gap almost keeps a constant around 0.60eV within compression strain 0~10%. In contrast, a remarkable phase transition from an insulator to a metal phase appears under tensile strain. Moreover, this phase transition is highly sensitive to tensile strain and takes place only strain 1.0%. These strain-induced electronic structures and phase transitions of Na3Bi system in various phase are important due to their possible applications under high pressure in future electronic devices.",3
"Dwell time, Hartman effect and transport properties in a ferromagnetic phosphorene monolayer.","In this paper, spin-dependent dwell time, spin Hartman effect and spin-dependent conductance were theoretically investigated through a rectangular barrier in the presence of an exchange field by depositing a ferromagnetic insulator on the phosphorene layer in the barrier region. The existence of the spin Hartman effect was shown for all energies (energies lower than barrier height) and all incident angles in phosphorene. We also compared our results of the dwell time in the phosphorene structure with similar research performed on graphene. We reported a significant difference between the tunneling time values of incident quasiparticles with spin-up and spin-down. We found that the barrier was almost transparent for incident quasiparticles with a wide range of incident angles and energies higher than the barrier height in phosphorene. We also found that the maximum spin-dependent transmission probability for energies higher than barrier height does not necessarily occur in the zero incident angle. In addition, we showed that the spin conductance for energies higher (lower) than barrier height fluctuates (decays) in terms of barrier thickness. We discovered that, in contrast to graphene, the Klein paradox does not occur in the normal incident in the phosphorene structure. Furthermore, the results demonstrated the achievement of good total conductance at certain thicknesses of the barrier for energies higher than the barrier height. This study could serve as a basis for investigations of the basic physics of tunneling mechanisms and also for using phosphorene as a spin polarizer in designing nanoelectronic devices.",3
Lattice response to the relaxation of electronic pressure of ultrafast laser-irradiated copper and nickel nanofilms.,"The impact of electronic pressure and electronic pressure gradient induced by laser excitation on the dynamic response of metals (Cu and Ni) has been numerically investigated using two complementary approaches. In the framework of DFPT, for electronic temperatures up to 6 eV, we demonstrate that electronic pressure results in a higher lattice stability. In other words, the electronic pressure has a negative influence on the phonon entropy and induces an increase in the shear modulus, which improves the melting temperature and lattice vibration frequency. Given the relaxation of electronic pressure during an extreme non-equilibrium state, we adopt a modified 2T-MD model to identify the contribution of the electronic pressure gradient to the atomic dynamics during fs laser excitation. Our results indicate the presence of rapid destabilization of the structure of Cu and Ni nano-films along the electronic pressure gradients. Specifically, the nucleation of the voids and heterogeneous nucleation occur at the surface layer, at a depth of several nanometers, for Cu and Ni, respectively. With the coexistence of a-thermal and thermal effects on scales, two different ultrafast destructuring processes of Cu and Ni both interrelate a hot electronic blast force and classical electron-ion dynamics.",3
Asymmetric transmission of a planar metamaterial induced by symmetry breaking.,"Asymmetric transmission (AT) is widely used in polarization transformers and polarization-controlled devices. In this paper, a planar metamaterial nanostructure with connected gammadion-shaped nanostructure (CGN) is proposed to achieve AT effect for forward and backward propagations of circular polarized light. The CGN arrays can produce magnetic moment oscillation that is normal to the metamaterial plane, which is weakly coupled to free space and generates transmission valleys. The introduction of symmetry breaking exerts a strong influence on the AT effects, and these effects can be tuned by the structural parameters. Our planar metamaterials may have potential for application in the future design of polarization-controlling devices.",3
Water at surfaces with tunable surface chemistries.,"Aqueous interfaces are ubiquitous in natural environments, spanning atmospheric, geological, oceanographic, and biological systems, as well as in technical applications, such as fuel cells and membrane filtration. Where liquid water terminates at a surface, an interfacial region is formed, which exhibits distinct properties from the bulk aqueous phase. The unique properties of water are governed by the hydrogen-bonded network. The chemical and physical properties of the surface dictate the boundary conditions of the bulk hydrogen-bonded network and thus the interfacial properties of the water and any molecules in that region. Understanding the properties of interfacial water requires systematically characterizing the structure and dynamics of interfacial water as a function of the surface chemistry. In this review, we focus on the use of experimental surface-specific spectroscopic methods to understand the properties of interfacial water as a function of surface chemistry. Investigations of the air-water interface, as well as efforts in tuning the properties of the air-water interface by adding solutes or surfactants, are briefly discussed. Buried aqueous interfaces can be accessed with careful selection of spectroscopic technique and sample configuration, further expanding the range of chemical environments that can be probed, including solid inorganic materials, polymers, and water immiscible liquids. Solid substrates can be finely tuned by functionalization with self-assembled monolayers, polymers, or biomolecules. These variables provide a platform for systematically tuning the chemical nature of the interface and examining the resulting water structure. Finally, time-resolved methods to probe the dynamics of interfacial water are briefly summarized before discussing the current status and future directions in studying the structure and dynamics of interfacial water.",3
"Introducing correlations into carrier transport simulations of disordered materials through seeded nucleation: impact on density of states, carrier mobility, and carrier statistics.","Disorder in organic semiconductors has made it challenging to achieve performance gains; this is a result of the many competing and often nuanced mechanisms effecting charge transport. In this article, we attempt to illuminate one of these mechanisms in the hopes of aiding experimentalists in exceeding current performance thresholds. Using a heuristic exponential function, energetic correlation has been added to the Gaussian disorder model (GDM). The new model is grounded in the concept that energetic correlations can arise in materials without strong dipoles or dopants, but may be a result of an incomplete crystal formation process. The proposed correlation has been used to explain the exponential tail states often observed in these materials; it is also better able to capture the carrier mobility field dependence, commonly known as the Poole-Frenkel dependence, when compared to the GDM. Investigation of simulated current transients shows that the exponential tail states do not necessitate Montroll and Scher fits. Montroll and Scher fits occur in the form of two distinct power law curves that share a common constant in their exponent; they are clearly observed as linear lines when the current transient is plotted using a log-log scale. Typically, these fits have been found appropriate for describing amorphous silicon and other disordered materials which display exponential tail states. Furthermore, we observe the proposed correlation function leads to domains of energetically similar sites separated by boundaries where the site energies exhibit stochastic deviation. These boundary sites are found to be the source of the extended exponential tail states, and are responsible for high charge visitation frequency, which may be associated with the molecular turnover number and ultimately the material stability.",3
The melting points of MgO up to 4 TPa predicted based on ab initio thermodynamic integration molecular dynamics.,"The melting curve of MgO is extended up to 4 TPa, corresponding to the Jovian core pressure, based on the one-step thermodynamic integration method implemented on ab initio molecular dynamics. The calculated melting temperatures are 3100 and 16 000 K at 0 and 500 GPa, respectively, which are consistent with previous experimental results, and 20 600 K at 3900 GPa, which is inconsistent with a recent experimental extrapolation, which implies the molten Jovian core. A quite small Clapeyron slope ([Formula: see text]) of [Formula: see text] is found at 3900 GPa due to comparable densities of the liquid and B2 phases under extreme compression. The Mg-O coordination number in the liquid phase is saturated at around 7.5 above 1 TPa and remains smaller than that in the B2 phase (8) even at 4 TPa, suggesting no density crossover between liquid and crystal and thus no further denser crystalline phases. Dynamical properties (atomic diffusivity and viscosity) are also investigated along the melting curve to understand these behaviors in greater detail.",3
Spin filter effect of hBN/Co detector electrodes in a 3D topological insulator spin valve.,"Topological insulators emerge as promising components of spintronic devices, in particular for applications where all-electrical spin control is essential. While the capability of these materials to generate spin-polarized currents is well established, only very little is known about the spin injection/extraction into/out of them. Here, we explore the switching behavior of lateral spin valves comprising the 3D topological insulator Bi2Te2Se as channel, which is separated from ferromagnetic Cobalt detector contacts by an ultrathin hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) tunnel barrier. The corresponding contact resistance displays a notable variation, which is correlated with a change of the switching characteristics of the spin valve. For contact resistances below ~5 kOmega, the hysteresis in the switching curve reverses upon reversing the applied current, as expected for spin-polarized currents carried by the helical surface states. By contrast, for higher contact resistances an opposite polarity of the hysteresis loop is observed, which is independent of the current direction, a behavior signifying negative spin detection efficiency of the multilayer hBN/Co contacts combined with bias-induced spin signal inversion. Our findings suggest the possibility to tune the spin exchange across the interface between a ferromagnetic metal and a topological insulator through the number of intervening hBN layers.",3
Universal features underlying the magnetism in diluted magnetic semiconductors.,"Investigation of a diverse variety of wide band gap semiconductors and metal oxides that exhibit magnetism on substitutional doping has revealed the existence of universal features that relate the magnetic moment of the dopant to a number of physical properties inherent to the dopants and the hosts. The investigated materials consist of ZnO, GaN, GaP, TiO2, SnO2, Sn3N4, MoS2, ZnS and CdS doped with 3d-transition metal atoms. The primary physical properties contributing to magnetism include the orbital hybridization and charge distribution, the d-band filling, d-band center, crystal field splitting, electron pairing energy and electronegativity. These features specify the strength of the spin-polarization induced by the dopants on their first nearest neighboring anions which in turn specify the long range magnetic coupling among the dopants through successively induced spin polarizations (SSP) on neighboring dopants. The proposed local SSP process for the establishment of the magnetic coupling among the TM-dopants appears as a competitor to other classical processes (superexchange, double exchange, etc). Furthermore, these properties can be used as a set of descriptors suitable for developing statistical predictive theories for a much larger class of magnetic materials.",3
On dynamical properties of electrons in Anderson-Mott insulators.,"Properties of electrons in non-crystalline (alias disordered) systems has been a very active research topic for over half a century, since Anderson's ground breaking paper on localization. In strongly disordered systems electrons become Anderson and Mott localized. Interactions become important because screening by localized electrons is ineffective. Dynamical theories for such systems have long been controversial. Nevertheless one theory came to prominence in the literature and is often invoked and/or used. It is shown here that that theory is unsatisfactory in several aspects. It is based on the one-particle density of states, which turns out to be irrelevant to the problem it addresses. Another shortcoming is an implicit conjecture that interacting electrons move independently of each other. The theory is also in questionable agreement with experiment. It is shown that two other theories are free of those problems. They are useful for different types of studies, are compatible with each other and in agreement with experiment.",3
Topological insulation in a ladder model with particle-hole and reflection symmetries.,"A two-legged ladder model, one dimensional, exhibiting the parity anomaly is constructed. The model belongs to the C and CI symmetry classes, depending on the parameters, but, due to reflection, it exhibits topological insulation. The model consists of two superimposed Creutz models with onsite potentials. The topological invariants of each Creutz model sum to give the mirror winding number, with winding numbers which are nonzero individually but equal and opposite in the topological phase, and both zero in the trivial phase. We demonstrate the presence of edge states and quantized Hall response in the topological region. Our model exhibits two distinct topological regions, distinguished by the different types of reflection symmetries.",3
Magnetotransport study of topological superconductor Cu<sub>0.10</sub>Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> single crystal.,"We report a magnetotransport study of vortex-pinning in Cu&lt;sub&gt;0.10&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; single crystal. The sample is demonstrated to be in clean limit and absent of Pauli spin-limiting effect. Interestingly, the resistivity versus magnetic field shows an anomalously pronounced increase when approaching the superconducting-normal state boundary for both B parallelab and B parallelc configurations. We have investigated the flux-flowing behavior under various magnetic field and temperatures, enabling us to establish its anisotropic vortex phase diagram. Our results suggest the Cu&lt;sub&gt;0.10&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be served as one unique material for exploring exotic surface vortex states in topological superconductors.",3
Origin of distorted 1<i>T</i>-phase ReS<sub>2</sub>: first-principles study.,"Group-VIIB transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are known to be stabilized solely in a distorted 1T phase termed as 1T'' phase, which is compared to many stable or metastable phases in other TMDCs. Using first-principles calculations, we study the structural origin of 1T'' phase group-VIIB TMDCs. We find that quasi one-dimensional Peierls-like instability is responsible for the transition to the 1T'' phase ReS2 monolayer from the 1T' phase, another distorted 1T phase. Two half-filled bands in 1T'-ReS2 make sharp peaks in the Lindhard function that prompt the charge density wave (CDW) phase with large band gap opening. Our calculations show that overlapping of the two bands in a broad energy range leads to robust CDW phase or stable 1T'' phase in group-VIIB TMDCs against compositional variation, which is in stark contrast to typical Peierls instability driven by a single band. Calculated total energy curve near the critical point exhibits the feature of the first-order Landau transition due to local chemical bonding. The structural stability of the 1T'' phase in group-VIIB TMDCs is thus guaranteed by two half-filled bands and local chemical bonding.",3
Emergence of a new valence-ordered structure and collapse of the magnetic order under high pressure in EuPtP.,"The layered hexagonal EuPtP is a rare substance that exhibits two successive valence transitions occurring simultaneously with valence ordering transitions and an antiferromagnetic order. Anticipating that the application of pressure to this sample would induce a new valence-ordered structure and/or a new phenomenon associated with valence fluctuation, we examined the electrical resistivity rho, the Eu L3-edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy, and the powder x-ray diffraction under high pressure. We found a new valence transition at around P = 2.5 GPa. After the transition, a new valence-ordered structure is realized at the lowest temperature. The valence-ordered structure is inferred to be stacking of [Formula: see text] (2+: Eu(2+) layer, 3+: Eu(3+) layer) along the c-axis. Upon further increases in pressure, the valence-ordered structure is suppressed and another valance-ordered phase is realized up to P = 6 GPa. The antiferromagnetic order collapses in the pressure range between 6 GPa and 8 GPa.",3
Fermi-level tuning of the Dirac surface state in (Bi1-x Sb x )2Se3 thin films.,"We report on the electronic states and the transport properties of three-dimensional topological insulator (Bi1-x Sb x )2Se3 ternary alloy thin films grown on an isostructural Bi2Se3 buffer layer on InP substrates. By angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we clearly detected Dirac surface states with a large bulk band gap of 0.2-0.3 eV in the (Bi1-x Sb x )2Se3 film with x = 0.70. In addition, we observed by Hall effect measurements that the dominant charge carrier converts from electron (n-type) to hole (p-type) at around x = 0.7, indicating that the Fermi level can be controlled across the Dirac point. Indeed, the carrier transport was shown to be governed by Dirac surface state in 0.63 x 0.75. These features suggest that Fermi-level tunable (Bi1-x Sb x )2Se3-based heterostructures provide a platform for extracting exotic topological phenomena.",3
Electronic properties of Pu19Os simulating beta-Pu: the strongly correlated Pu phase.,"We established the basic electronic properties of zeta-Pu19Os, which is a close analogue to beta-Pu, and its low-temperature variety, eta-Pu19Os. Their magnetic susceptibility is 15% higher than for delta-Pu. A specific heat study of zeta-Pu19Os shows a soft lattice similar to delta-Pu, leading to a low Debye temperature Theta D = 101 K. The linear electronic coefficient gamma related to the quasiparticle density of states at the Fermi level points to a higher value, 55 +/- 2 mJ (mol Pu K(2))(-1), compared to 40 mJ (mol K(2))(-1) for delta-Pu. The results confirm that beta-Pu is probably the most strongly correlated Pu phase, as had been indicated by resistivity measurements. The volume and related Pu-Pu spacing is clearly not the primary tuning parameter for Pu metal, as the beta-Pu density stands close to the ground-state alpha-phase and is much higher than that for delta-Pu. The eta-Pu19Os phase has a record gamma-value of 74 +/- 2 mJ (mol Pu K(2))(-1). The enhancement is not reproduced by LDA+DMFT calculations in the fcc structure, which suggests that multiple diverse sites can be the key to the understanding of beta-Pu.",3
Anomalous DC Hall response in noncentrosymmetric tilted Weyl semimetals.,"Weyl nodes come in pairs of opposite chirality. For broken time reversal symmetry (TR) they are displaced in momentum space by [Formula: see text] and the anomalous DC Hall conductivity [Formula: see text] is proportional to [Formula: see text] at charge neutrality. For finite doping there are additive corrections to [Formula: see text] which depend on the chemical potential as well as on the tilt ([Formula: see text]) of the Dirac cones and on their relative orientation. If inversion symmetry (I) is also broken the Weyl nodes are shifted in energy by an amount [Formula: see text]. This introduces further changes in [Formula: see text] and we provide simple analytic formulas for these modifications for both type I ([Formula: see text]) and type II ([Formula: see text], overtilted) Weyl. For type I when the Weyl nodes have equal magnitude but oppositely directed tilts, the correction to [Formula: see text] is proportional to the chemical potential mu and completely independent of the energy shift [Formula: see text]. When instead the tilts are parallel, the correction is linear in [Formula: see text] and mu drops out. For type II the corrections involve both mu and [Formula: see text], are nonlinear and also involve a momentum cut off. We discuss the implied changes to the Nernst coefficient and to the thermal Hall effect of a finite [Formula: see text].",3
Semiclassical transport properties of IrGa3: a promising thermoelectric material.,"IrGa3 is an intermetallic compound which is expected to be a metal, but a study on the electronic properties of this material to confirm its metallic character is not available in the literature. In this work, we report for the first time a first-principles density functional theory and semiclassical Boltzmann theory study of the structural, electronic and transport properties of this material. The inclusion of the spin-orbit coupling term is crucial to calculate accurately the electronic properties of this compound. We have established that IrGa3 is an indirect semiconductor with a narrow gap of 0.07 eV. From semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory, it is inferred that this material, with the appropriate hole concentration, could have a thermoelectric figure of merit at room temperature comparable to other intermetallic compounds such as FeGa3, though the transport properties of IrGa3 are highly anisotropic.",3
Bismuth oxide film: a promising room-temperature quantum spin Hall insulator.,"Two-dimensional (2D) bismuth films have attracted extensive attention due to their nontrivial band topology and tunable electronic properties for achieving dissipationless transport devices. The experimental observation of quantum transport properties, however, are rather challenging, limiting their potential application in nanodevices. Here, we predict, based on first-principles calculations, an alternative 2D bismuth oxide, BiO, as an excellent topological insulator (TI), whose intrinsic bulk gap reaches up to 0.28 eV. Its nontrivial topology is confirmed by topological invariant Z 2 and time-reversal symmetry protected helical edge states. The appearance of topological phase is robust against mechanical strain and different levels of oxygen coverage in BiO. Since the BiO is naturally stable against surface oxidization and degradation, these results enrich the topological materials and present an alternative way to design topotronics devices at room temperature.",3
Self-organised fractional quantisation in a hole quantum wire.,"We have investigated hole transport in quantum wires formed by electrostatic confinement in strained germanium two-dimensional layers. The ballistic conductance characteristics show the regular staircase of quantum levels with plateaux at n2e (2)/h, where n is an integer, e is the fundamental unit of charge and h is Planck's constant. However as the carrier concentration is reduced, the quantised levels show a behaviour that is indicative of the formation of a zig-zag structure and new quantised plateaux appear at low temperatures. In units of 2e (2)/h the new quantised levels correspond to values of n = 1/4 reducing to 1/8 in the presence of a strong parallel magnetic field which lifts the spin degeneracy but does not quantise the wavefunction. A further plateau is observed corresponding to n = 1/32 which does not change in the presence of a parallel magnetic field. These values indicate that the system is behaving as if charge was fractionalised with values e/2 and e/4, possible mechanisms are discussed.",3
Exploring the validity and limitations of the Mott-Gurney law for charge-carrier mobility determination of semiconducting thin-films.,"Using drift-diffusion simulations, we investigate the voltage dependence of the dark current in single carrier devices typically used to determine charge-carrier mobilities. For both low and high voltages, the current increases linearly with the applied voltage. Whereas the linear current at low voltages is mainly due to space charge in the middle of the device, the linear current at high voltage is caused by charge-carrier saturation due to a high degree of injection. As a consequence, the current density at these voltages does not follow the classical square law derived by Mott and Gurney, and we show that for trap-free devices, only for intermediate voltages, a space-charge-limited drift current can be observed with a slope that approaches a value of two. We show that, depending on the thickness of the semiconductor layer and the size of the injection barriers, the two linear current-voltage regimes can dominate the whole voltage range, and the intermediate Mott-Gurney regime can shrink or disappear. In this case, which will especially occur for thicknesses and injection barriers typical of single-carrier devices used to probe organic semiconductors, a meaningful analysis using the Mott-Gurney law will become unachievable, because a square-law fit can no longer be achieved, resulting in the mobility being substantially underestimated. General criteria for when to expect deviations from the Mott-Gurney law when used for analysis of intrinsic semiconductors are discussed.",3
Quasiparticle Scattering in Type-II Weyl semimetal MoTe<sub>2</sub>.,"The electronic structure of type-II Weyl semimetal molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is studied by using scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory calculations. Through measuring energy-dependent quasiparticle interference (QPI) patterns with a cryogenic scanning tunneling microscope, several characteristic features are found in the QPI patterns. Two of them arise from the Weyl semimetal nature; one is the topological Fermi arc surface state and the other can be assigned to be a Weyl point. The remaining structures are derived from the scatterings relevant to the bulk electronic states. The findings lead to thorough understanding of the topological electronic structure of type-II Weyl semimetal MoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.",3
Studies on the high-temperature ferroelectric transition of multiferroic hexagonal manganite RMnO3.,"Hexagonal manganites are multiferroic materials with two highly-dissimilar phase transitions: a ferroelectric transition (from P63/mmc to P63cm) at a temperature higher than 1000 K and an antiferromagnetic transition at T N = 65-130 K. Despite its critical relevance to the intriguing ferroelectric domain physics, the details of the ferroelectric transition are not well known to date primarily because of the ultra-high transition temperature. Using high-temperature x-ray diffraction experiments, we show that the ferroelectric transition is a single transition of abrupt order and R-Op displacement is the primary order parameter. This structural transition is then simultaneously accompanied by MnO5 tilting and the subsequent development of electric polarization.",3
Quantum anomalous Hall phase in a one-dimensional optical lattice.,"We propose to simulate and detect quantum anomalous Hall phase with ultracold atoms in a one-dimensional optical lattice, with the other synthetic dimension being realized by modulating spin-orbit coupling. We show that the system manifests a topologically nontrivial phase with two chiral edge states which can be readily detected in this synthetic two-dimensional system. Moreover, it is interesting that at the phase transition point there is a flat energy band and this system can also be in a topologically nontrivial phase with two Fermi zero modes existing at the boundaries by considering the synthetic dimension as a modulated parameter. We also show how to measure these topological phases experimentally in ultracold atoms. Another model with a random Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling strength is also found to exhibit topological nontrivial phase, and the impact of the disorder to the system is revealed.",3
Thermo-solutal growth of an anisotropic dendrite with six-fold symmetry.,"A stable growth of dendritic crystal with the six-fold crystalline anisotropy is analyzed in a binary nonisothermal mixture. A selection criterion representing a relationship between the dendrite tip velocity and its tip diameter is derived on the basis of morphological stability analysis and solvability theory. A complete set of nonlinear equations, consisting of the selection criterion and undercooling balance condition, which determines implicit dependencies of the dendrite tip velocity and tip diameter as functions of the total undercooling, is formulated. Exact analytical solutions of these nonlinear equations are found in a parametric form. Asymptotic solutions describing the crystal growth at small Peclet numbers are determined. Theoretical predictions are compared with experimental data obtained for ice dendrites growing in binary water-ethylenglycol solutions as well as in pure water.",3
Pass-band reconfigurable spoof surface plasmon polaritons.,"In this paper, we introduce a new scheme to construct the band-pass tunable filter based on the band-pass reconfigurable spoof surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), whose cut-off frequencies at both sides of the passband can be tuned through changing the direct current (DC) bias of varactors. Compared to traditional technology (e.g. microstrip filters), the spoof SPP structure can provide more tight field confinement and more significant field enhancement, which is extremely valuable for many system applications. In order to achieve this scheme, we proposed a specially designed SPP filter integrated with varactors and DC bias feeding structure to support the spoof SPP passband reconfiguration. Furthermore, the full-wave simulated result verifies the outstanding performance on both efficiency and reconfiguration, which has the potential to be widely used in advanced intelligent systems.",3
"Determination of Debye Temperatures and Lamb-Mossbauer Factors for LnFeO<sub>3</sub> Orthoferrite Perovskites (Ln = La, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd).","Lanthanide orthoferrites have wide-ranging industrial uses including solar, catalytic and electronic applications. Here a series of lanthanide orthoferrite perovskites, LnFeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (Ln = La; Nd; Sm; Eu; Gd), prepared through a standard stoichiometric wet ball milling route using oxide precursors, has been studied. Characterisation through X-ray diffraction and X-ray fluorescence confirmed the synthesis of phase-pure or near-pure LnFeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; compounds. &lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sub&gt;Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy was performed over a temperature range of 10 K to 293 K to observe hyperfine structure and to enable calculation of the recoil-free fraction and Debye temperature (thetaD) of each orthoferrite. Debye temperatures (Ln = La 474 K; Nd 459 K; Sm 457 K; Eu 452 K; Gd 473 K) and recoil-free fractions (Ln = La 0.827; Nd 0.817; Sm 0.816; Eu 0.812; Gd 0.826) were approximated through minimising the difference in the temperature dependent experimental Centre Shift (CS) and theoretical Isomer Shift (IS), by allowing the Debye temperature and Isomer Shift values to vary. This method of minimising the difference between theoretical and actual values yields Debye temperatures consistent with results from other studies determined through thermal analysis methods. This displays the ability of variable-temperature Mossbauer spectroscopy to approximate Debye temperatures and recoil-free fractions, whilst observing temperature induced transitions over the temperature range observed. X-ray diffraction and Rietveld refinement show an inverse relationship between FeO6 octahedral volume and approximated Debye temperatures. Raman spectroscopy show an increase in the band positions attributed to soft modes of Ag symmetry, A&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;(3) and A&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;(5) from La to GdFeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; corresponding to octahedral rotations and tilts in the [010] and [101] planes respectively.",3
Unidirectional emission in an all-dielectric nanoantenna.,"All-dielectric nanoantennas are a promising alternative to plasmonic optical antennas for engineering light emission because of their low-loss nature in the optical spectrum. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to manipulate directional light emission with subwavelength all-dielectric nanoantennas. Here, we propose and numerically demonstrate that a hollow silicon nanodisk can serve as a versatile antenna for directing and enhancing the emission from either an electric or magnetic dipole emitter. When primarily coupled to both electric and magnetic dipole modes of a nanoantenna, broadband nearly-unidirectional emission can be realized by the interference of two modes, which can be spectrally tuned via the geometric parameters in an easy way. More importantly, the emission directions for the magnetic and electric dipole emitters are shown as opposite to each other through control of the phase difference between the induced magnetic and electric dipole modes of the antenna. Meanwhile, the Purcell factors can be enhanced by more than one order of magnitude and high quantum efficiencies can be maintained at the visible spectrum for both kinds of dipole emitters. We further show that these unidirectional emission phenomena can withstand small disorder effects of in-plane dipole orientation and location. Our study provides a simple yet versatile platform that can shape the emission of both magnetic and electric dipole emitters.",3
Distinguishing quantum dot-like localized states from quantum well-like extended states across the exciton emission line in a quantum well.,We have closely examined the emission spectrum at the heavy-hole exciton resonance in a high-quality GaAs multi-quantum well sample using picosecond excitation-correlation photoluminescence (ECPL) spectroscopy. Dynamics of the ECPL signal at low and high energy sides of the excitonic photoluminescence (PL) peak show complementary behavior. The ECPL signal is positive (negative) below (above) the PL peak and it changes sign within a narrow band of energy lying between the excitonic absorption and emission peaks. The energy at which this sign change takes place is interpreted as the excitonic mobility edge as it separates localized excitons in quantum dot-like states from mobile excitons in quantum well-like states.,3
Micrometer-sized TPM emulsion droplets with surface-mobile binding groups.,"Colloids coated with lipid membranes have been widely employed for fundamental studies of lipid membrane processes, biotechnological applications such as drug delivery and biosensing, and more recently, for self-assembly. The latter has been made possible by inserting DNA oligomers with covalently linked hydrophobic anchors into the membrane. The lateral mobility of the DNA linkers on micrometer-sized droplets and solid particles has opened the door to creating structures with unprecedented structural flexibility. Here, we investigate micro-emulsions of TPM (3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate) as a platform for lipid monolayers and further functionalization with proteins and DNA oligonucleotides. TPM droplets can be produced with a narrow size distribution and are polymerizable, thus providing supports for model lipid membranes with controlled size and curvature. With fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, we observed that droplet-attached lipids, NeutrAvidin proteins, as well as DNA oligonucleotides all show mobility on the surface. We explored the assembly of micron-sized particles on TPM-droplets by exploiting either avidin-biotin interactions or double-stranded DNA with complementary single-stranded end groups. While the single molecules are mobile, the particles that are attached to them are not. We propose that this is caused by the heterogeneous nature of emulsified TPM, which forms an oligomer network that limits the collective motion of linkers, but allows the surface mobility of individual molecules.",3
Ultrahigh lattice thermal conductivity in topological semimetal TaN caused by a large acoustic-optical gap.,"Topological semimetals may have potential applications such as in topological qubits, spintronics and quantum computations. Efficient heat dissipation is a key factor for the reliability and stability of topological semimetal-based nano-electronics devices, which is closely related to high thermal conductivity. In this work, the elastic properties and lattice thermal conductivity of TaN are investigated using first-principles calculations and the linearized phonon Boltzmann equation within the single-mode relaxation time approximation. According to the calculated bulk modulus, shear modulus and C 44, TaN can be regarded as a potential incompressible and hard material. The room-temperature lattice thermal conductivity is predicted to be 838.62 [Formula: see text] along the a axis and 1080.40 [Formula: see text] along the c axis, showing very strong anisotropy. It is found that the lattice thermal conductivity of TaN is several tens of times higher than other topological semimetals, such as TaAs, MoP and ZrTe, which is due to the very longer phonon lifetimes for TaN than other topological semimetals. The very different atomic masses of Ta and N atoms lead to a very large acoustic-optical band gap, and then prohibit the scattering between acoustic and optical phonon modes, which gives rise to very long phonon lifetimes. Calculated results show that isotope scattering has little effect on lattice thermal conductivity, and that phonons with mean free paths larger than 20 (80) [Formula: see text] along the c direction at 300 K have little contribution to the total lattice thermal conductivity. This work implies that TaN-based nano-electronics devices may be more stable and reliable due to efficient heat dissipation, and motivates further experimental works to study lattice thermal conductivity of TaN.",3
Surface charge method for molecular surfaces with curved areal elements I. Spherical triangles.,"Parametrizing a curved surface with flat triangles in electrostatics problems creates a diverging electric field. One way to avoid this is to have curved areal elements. However, charge density integration over curved patches appears difficult. This paper, dealing with spherical triangles, is the first in a series aiming to solve this problem. Here, we lay the ground work for employing curved patches for applying the surface charge method to electrostatics. We show analytically how one may control the accuracy by expanding in powers of the the arc length (multiplied by the curvature). To accommodate not extremely small curved areal elements, we have provided enough details to include higher order corrections that are needed for better accuracy when slightly larger surface elements are used.",3
Topologically-protected one-way leaky waves in nonreciprocal plasmonic structures.,"We investigate topologically-protected unidirectional leaky waves on magnetized plasmonic structures acting as homogeneous photonic topological insulators. Our theoretical analyses and numerical experiments aim at unveiling the general properties of these exotic surface waves, and their nonreciprocal and topological nature. In particular, we study the behavior of topological leaky modes in stratified structures composed of a magnetized plasma at the interface with isotropic conventional media, and we show how to engineer their propagation and radiation properties, leading to topologically-protected backscattering-immune wave propagation, and highly directive and tunable radiation. Taking advantage of the non-trivial topological properties of these leaky modes, we also theoretically demonstrate advanced functionalities, including arbitrary re-routing of leaky waves on the surface of bodies with complex shapes, as well as the realization of topological leaky-wave (nano)antennas with isolated channels of radiation that are completely independent and separately tunable. Our findings help shedding light on the behavior of topologically-protected modes in open wave-guiding structures, and may open intriguing directions for future antenna generations based on topological structures, at microwaves and optical frequencies.",3
Bond-orientational order and Frank's constant in two-dimensional colloidal hard spheres.,"Recently, the full phase behaviour of 2D colloidal hard spheres was experimentally established, and found to involve a first order liquid to hexatic transition and a continuous hexatic to crystal transition (Thorneywork et al 2017 Phys. Rev. Lett. 118 158001). Here, we expand upon this work by considering the behaviour of the bond-orientational correlation time and Frank's constant in the region of these phase transitions. We also consider the excess entropy, as calculated from the radial distribution functions, for a wide range of area fractions covering the liquid, hexatic and crystal phases. In all cases, the behaviour of these quantities further corroborates the previously reported melting scenario of 2D colloidal hard spheres.",3
Reaction paths of alane dissociation on the Si(0 0 1) surface.,"Building on our earlier study, we examine the kinetic barriers to decomposition of alane, AlH3, on the Si(0 0 1) surface, using the nudged elastic band approach within density functional theory. We find that the initial decomposition to AlH with two H atoms on the surface proceeds without a significant barrier. There are several pathways available to lose the final hydrogen, though these present barriers of up to 1 eV. Incorporation is more challenging, with the initial structures less stable in several cases than the starting structures, just as was found for phosphorus. We identify a stable route for Al incorporation following selective surface hydrogen desorption (e.g. by scanning tunneling microscope tip). The overall process parallels PH3, and indicates that atomically precise acceptor doping should be possible.",3
Superconductivity in tantalum self-intercalated 4<i>Ha</i>-Ta<sub>1.03</sub>Se<sub>2</sub>.,"TaSe$_2$ has several different polytypes and abundant physical properties such as superconductivity and charge density waves (CDW), which had been investigated in the past few decades. However, there is no report on the physical properties of 4$Ha$&#13; polytype up to now. Here we report the crystal growth and discovery of superconductivity in tantalum self-intercalated&#13; 4$Ha$-Ta$_{1.03}$Se$_2$ single crystal with a superconducting transition onset temperature $T_{\rm c}$ $\approx$ 2.7 K, which&#13; is the first observation of superconductivity in 4$Ha$ polytype of TaSe$_2$. A slightly suppressed CDW transition is found around 106&#13; K. A large $\mu_0H_{\rm c2}/T_{\rm c}$ value of about 4.48 is found when magnetic field is applied in the $ab$ plane, which probably results from the enhanced spin-orbit coupling(SOC). Special stacking faults are observed, which further enhance the anisotropy. Although the density of states at the Fermi level is lower than that of other polytypes, $T_{\rm c}$ remains the same, indicating the stack mode of 4$Ha$ polytype may be beneficial to superconductivity in TaSe$_2$.",3
Improving carrier transport in Cu2O thin films by rapid thermal annealing.,"Cuprous oxide (Cu2O) is a promising material for large scale photovoltaic applications. The efficiencies of thin film structures are, however, currently lower than those for structures based on Cu2O sheets, possibly due to their poorer transport properties. This study shows that post-deposition rapid thermal annealing (RTA) of Cu2O films is an effective approach for improving carrier transport in films prepared by reactive magnetron sputtering. The as-deposited Cu2O films were poly-crystalline, p-type, with weak near band edge (NBE) emission in photoluminescence spectra, a grain size of ~100 nm and a hole mobility of 2-18 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1). Subsequent RTA (3 min) at a pressure of 50 Pa and temperatures of 600-1000 degrees C enhanced the NBE by 2-3 orders of magnitude, evidencing improved crystalline quality and reduction of non-radiative carrier recombination. Both grain size and hole mobility were increased considerably upon RTA, reaching values above 1 microm and up to 58 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1), respectively, for films annealed at 900-1000 degrees C. These films also exhibited a resistivity of ~50-200 Omega cm, a hole concentration of ~10(15) cm(-3) at room temperature, and a transmittance above 80%.",3
Electronic structure and magnetic properties of Pr-Co intermetallics: ab initio FP-LAPW calculations and correlation with experiments.,"First-principle calculations combining density functional theory and the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) method are performed to investigate the electronic and magnetic structure of Pr2Co7 in its two polymorphic forms, (2:7 H) and (2:7 R), for the first time. This type of calculation was also performed for PrCo5 and PrCo2 intermetallics. We have computed the valence density of states separately for spin-up and spin-down states in order to investigate the electronic band structure. This is governed by the strong contribution of the partial DOS of 3d-Co bands compared to the partial DOS of the 4f-Pr bands. Such a high ferromagnetic state is discussed in terms of the strong spin polarization observed in the total DOS. The magnetic moments carried by the Co and Pr atoms located in several sites for all compounds are computed. These results mainly indicate that cobalt atoms make a dominant contribution to the magnetic moments. The notable difference in the atomic moments of Pr and Co atoms between different structural slabs is explained in terms of the magnetic characteristics of the PrCo2 and PrCo5 compounds and the local chemical environments of the Pr and Co atoms in different structural slabs of Pr2Co7. From spin-polarized calculations we have simulated the 3d and 4f band population to estimate the local magnetic moments. These results are in accordance with the magnetic moments calculated using the FP-LAPW method. In addition, the exchange interactions J ij are calculated and used as input for M(T) simulations. Involving the data obtained from the electronic structure calculations, the appropriate Pade Table is applied to simulate the magnetization M(T) and to estimate the mean-field Curie temperature. We report a fairly good agreement between the ab initio calculation of magnetization and Curie temperature with the experimental data.",3
Field-induced magnetic phase transitions and memory effect in bilayer ruthenate Ca3Ru2O7 with Fe substitution.,"Bilayer ruthenate Ca3(Ru1-x Fe x )2O7 (x = 0.05) exhibits an incommensurate magnetic soliton lattice driven by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Here we report complex field-induced magnetic phase transitions and memory effect in this system via single-crystal neutron diffraction and magnetotransport measurements. We observe first-order incommensurate-to-commensurate magnetic transitions upon applying the magnetic field both along and perpendicular to the propagation axis of the incommensurate spin structure. Furthermore, we find that the metastable states formed upon decreasing the magnetic field depend on the temperature and the applied field orientation. We suggest that the observed field-induced metastability may be ascribable to the quenched kinetics at low temperature.",3
Comparison of surface structures of corundum Cr2O3(0 0 0 1) and V2O3(0 0 0 1) ultrathin films by x-ray photoelectron diffraction.,"Thin Cr2O3(0 0 0 1) layers are formed by oxidation of a Cr(1 1 0) single crystal. This surface is further modified by growing an epitaxial ultrathin V2O3(0 0 0 1) film by reactive vapor deposition. Synchrotron based soft-x-ray photoemission spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron diffraction are used to characterize the surface layers of these two corundum-structured oxides. By comparison of experimental XPD patterns with simulated electron multiple scattering calculations, two distinctively different surface terminations are extracted for the two oxides. While for V2O3 we confirm the previously proposed vanadyl-terminated surface structure, we propose a new surface structure for Cr2O3 that consists of excess chromium atoms occupying interstitial sub-surface sites.",3
Charge and orbital orders and structural instability in high-pressure quadruple perovskite CeCuMn6O12.,"We prepared a quadruple perovskite CeCuMn6O12 under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions at 6 GPa and about 1670 K and investigated its structural, magnetic and transport properties. CeCuMn6O12 crystallizes in space group Im-3 above T CO = 297 K; below this temperature, it adopts space group R-3 with the 1:3 (Mn(4+):Mn(3+)) charge and orbital orders. Unusual compressed Mn(3+)O6 octahedra are realized in CeCuMn6O12 similar to CaMn7O12 with the -Q 3 Jahn-Teller distortion mode. Below about 90 K, structural instability takes place with phase separation and the appearance of competing phases; and below 70 K, two R-3 phases coexist. CeCuMn6O12 exhibits a ferromagnetic-like transition below T C = 140 K, and it is a semiconductor with the magnetoresistance reaching about -40% at 140 K and 70 kOe. We argued that the valence of Ce is +3 in CeCuMn6O12 with the Ce(3+)([Formula: see text])([Formula: see text])O12 charge distribution in the charge-ordered R-3 phase and Ce(3+)([Formula: see text])([Formula: see text])O12 in the charge-disordered Im-3 phase.",3
"Electronic phase separation in insulating (Ga, Mn) As with low compensation: super-paramagnetism and hopping conduction.","In the present work, low compensated insulating (Ga,Mn)As with 0.7% Mn is obtained by ion implantation combined with pulsed laser melting. The sample shows variable-range hopping transport behavior with a Coulomb gap in the vicinity of the Fermi energy, and the activation energy is reduced by an external magnetic field. A blocking super-paramagnetism is observed rather than ferromagnetism. Below the blocking temperature, the sample exhibits a colossal negative magnetoresistance. Our studies confirm that the disorder-induced electronic phase separation occurs in (Ga,Mn)As samples with a Mn concentration in the insulator-metal transition regime, and it can account for the observed superparamagnetism and the colossal magnetoresistance.",3
Dynamics of a quasiparticle in the alpha-T3 model: role of pseudospin polarization and transverse magnetic field on zitterbewegung.,"We consider the alpha-T 3 model which provides a smooth crossover between the honeycomb lattice with pseudospin 1/2 and the dice lattice with pseudospin 1 through the variation of a parameter alpha. We study the dynamics of a wave packet representing a quasiparticle in the alpha-T3 model with zero and finite transverse magnetic field. For zero field, it is shown that the wave packet undergoes a transient zitterbewegung (ZB). Various features of ZB depending on the initial pseudospin polarization of the wave packet have been revealed. For an intermediate value of the parameter alpha i.e. for [Formula: see text] the resulting ZB consists of two distinct frequencies when the wave packet was located initially in rim site. However, the wave packet exhibits single frequency ZB for [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]. It is also unveiled that the frequency of ZB corresponding to [Formula: see text] gets exactly half of that corresponding to the [Formula: see text] case. On the other hand, when the initial wave packet was in hub site, the ZB consists of only one frequency for all values of alpha. Using stationary phase approximation, we find analytical expression of velocity average which can be used to extract the associated timescale over which the transient nature of ZB persists. On the contrary, the wave packet undergoes permanent ZB in presence of a transverse magnetic field. Due to the presence of a large number of Landau energy levels, the oscillations in ZB appear to be much more complicated. The oscillation pattern depends significantly on the initial pseudospin polarization of the wave packet. Furthermore, it is revealed that the number of the frequency components involved in ZB depends on the parameter alpha.",3
Superconducting properties and muSR study of the noncentrosymmetric superconductor Nb0.5Os0.5.,"The properties of the noncentrosymmetric superconductor (alpha-[Formula: see text] structure) Nb0.5Os0.5 have been investigated using resistivity, magnetization, specific heat, and muon spin relaxation and rotation (muSR) measurements. These measurements suggest that Nb0.5Os0.5 is a weakly coupled ([Formula: see text]) type-II superconductor ([Formula: see text]), having a bulk superconducting transition temperature T c = 3.07 K. The specific heat data fits well with the single-gap BCS model indicating nodeless s-wave superconductivity in Nb0.5Os0.5. The muSR measurements also confirm [Formula: see text]-wave superconductivity with the preserved time-reversal symmetry.",3
Magnetic and electronic properties of the Cu-substituted Weyl semimetal candidate ZrCo2Sn.,"We report that the partial substitution of Cu for Co has a significant impact on the magnetic properties of the Heusler-phase Weyl fermion candidate ZrCo2Sn. Polycrystalline samples of ZrCo2-x Cu x Sn (x = 0.0-1.0) exhibited a linearly decreasing ferromagnetic transition temperature and similarly decreasing saturated magnetic moment on increasing Cu substitution x. Materials with Cu contents near x = 1 and several other quaternary materials synthesized at the same x (ZrCoT'Sn (T' = Rh, Pd, Ni)) display what appears to be non-ferromagnetic magnetization behavior with spin glass characteristics. Electronic structure calculations suggest that the half-metallic nature of unsubstituted ZrCo2Sn is disrupted significantly by the Cu substitutions, leading to the breakdown of the magnetization versus electron count guidelines usually followed by Heusler phases, and a more typical metallic non-spin-polarized electronic structure at high x.",3
Competition and coexistence of polar and non-polar states in Sr1-x Ca x TiO3: an investigation using pressure dependent Raman spectroscopy.,"The competition and cooperation between ferroelectric and anti-ferro-distortion (AFD) instabilities are studied using pressure dependent Raman spectroscopy on polycrystalline powder samples of Sr1-x Ca x TiO3(x = 0.0, 0.06, 0.25, 0.35). For x = 0.0 composition, a broad polar mode is detected in the Raman spectra above 6 GPa, while for x = 0.06 composition, the polar modes appear well above 9 GPa where the AFD modes showed strong suppression. In x = 0.25 and 0.35 composition, the application of small pressure resulted in the appearance of strong AFD modes suppressing the polar modes. At elevated pressures, re-entrant polar modes are observed along with the broad AFD modes and some new peaks are also observed, signifying the lowering of local symmetry. The reappearance of polar modes is found to be related to pressure induced symmetry disorder at local level, suggesting its electronic origin. The re-entrant polar modes observed at higher pressure values are found to be significantly broad and asymmetric in nature, signifying the development of ferroelectric micro regions/nano domains coexisting with AFD. The lower symmetry at local length scale provides a conducive atmosphere for coexisting AFD and FE instabilities.",3
Franck Condon shift assessment in 2D MoS<sub>2</sub>.,"Optical spectroscopy (OS) techniques are often coupled with first-principles density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations for determining the precise influence of defects on the electronic and structural properties of two dimensional (2D) TMDs. Such calculations are carried out presuming there is little or no effect of vibrational transitions on the observed electronic spectrum. However, if the effect of change in vibrational energy [Franck Condon (FC) shift] associated with such a transition is large, it could possibly lead to a different origin for the observed peak. One such instance is the attribution of the 0.75 eV cathodoluminescence peak by Fabbri et. al. [Nat. Commun. 7, 13044 (2016)]. to an optical transition from an S vacancy level in the band gap, under the assumption that the FC shift is negligible. Here, by first principles constrained DFT calculations using hybrid HSE06 functional we show that this combined prediction of OS and DFT calculations is valid for 2D MoS2 since the FC shift associated with electronic transitions from a sulfur vacancy is, indeed, small ~28 meV. Based on our calculations we conclude that it is reasonable to make a direct connection between DFT calculations and optical spectroscopy techniques in this material, hence, establishing a one to one relation between defect related emission bands and electronic transitions from the defect levels.",3
High mobility In<sub>0.75</sub>Ga<sub>0.25</sub>As quantum wells in an InAs phonon lattice.,"InGaAs based devices are great complements to silicon for CMOS, as they provide an increased carrier saturation velocity, lower operating voltage and reduced power dissipation. In this work we show that&#13; In0.75Ga0.25As quantum wells with a high mobility, 15 000 to 20 000 cm2/V.s at ambient temperature, show&#13; an InAs-like phonon with an energy of 28.8 meV, frequency of 232 cm-1 that dominates the polar-optical mode scattering from approximately &#13; 70 K to 300 K. The optical phonon frequency is insensitive to the carrier density modulated with a surface&#13; gate or LED illumination. We model the electron scattering mechanisms as a function of temperature and&#13; identify mechanisms that limit the electron mobility in In0.75Ga0.25As quantum wells. Background impurity&#13; scattering starts to dominate for temperatures &lt;100 K. In the high mobility In0.75Ga0.25As quantum well,&#13; GaAs-like phonons do not couple to the electron gas unlike the case of In0.53Ga0.47As quantum wells.",3
Dynamically tunable interface states in 1D graphene-embedded photonic crystal heterostructure.,"Optical interface states exhibit promising applications in nonlinear photonics, low-threshold lasing, and surface-wave assisted sensing. However, the further application of interface states in configurable optics is hindered by their limited tunability. Here, we demonstrate a new approach to generate dynamically tunable and angle-resolved interface states using graphene-embedded photonic crystal (GPC) heterostructure device. By combining the GPC structure design with in situ electric doping of graphene, a continuously tunable interface state can be obtained and its tuning range is as wide as the full bandgap. Moreover, the exhibited tunable interface states offer a possibility to study the correspondence between space and time characteristics of light, which is beyond normal incident conditions. Our strategy provides a new way to design configurable devices with tunable optical states for various advanced optical applications such as beam splitter and dynamically tunable laser.",3
Exploring the role of genome and structural ions in preventing viral capsid collapse during dehydration.,"Even though viruses evolve mainly in liquid milieu, their horizontal transmission routes often include episodes of dry environment. Along their life cycle, some insect viruses, such as viruses from the Dicistroviridae family, withstand dehydrated conditions with presently unknown consequences to their structural stability. Here, we use atomic force microscopy to monitor the structural changes of viral particles of Triatoma virus (TrV) after desiccation. Our results demonstrate that TrV capsids preserve their genome inside, conserving their height after exposure to dehydrating conditions, which is in stark contrast with other viruses that expel their genome when desiccated. Moreover, empty capsids (without genome) resulted in collapsed particles after desiccation. We also explored the role of structural ions in the dehydration process of the virions (capsid containing genome) by chelating the accessible cations from the external solvent milieu. We observed that ion suppression helps to keep the virus height upon desiccation. Our results show that under drying conditions, the genome of TrV prevents the capsid from collapsing during dehydration, while the structural ions are responsible for promoting solvent exchange through the virion wall.",3
Growth and lattice dynamics of ultrathin BaO films on Pt(0 0 1).,"We report on the surface phonons of long-range ordered BaO thin films grown on Pt(0 0 1). In the thickness range between 4 and 28 ML, we find unstrained BaO(0 0 1)-([Formula: see text]) bulk-like terminated films which coincide with a Pt(0 0 1)-c([Formula: see text]) lattice periodicity. The dipole-active lattice vibrations were determined using high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy. For all BaO film thicknesses, a single Fuchs-Kliewer phonon-polariton is observed. Its intensity increases and its frequency softens with increasing film thickness. These thickness-dependent properties and the spectral shape are quantitatively discussed on the basis of dielectric theory, where a proper modeling requires three components: the dielectric response of the BaO film itself, the plasmonic response of the metallic substrate, and a weak damping due to a defect-induced doping within the oxide film. For a full description, also the quantization of the phonon wavevector due to the confinement within the film of finite thickness has to be taken into account.",3
Observation of low temperature metastable states in complex CaMn7O12.,"The low temperature magnetic behaviour of the multiferroic quadruple perovskite CaMn7O12 is investigated. The magneto-caloric effect in this material is presented for the first time. Along with the established magnetic transitions, T N1 ~ 90 K and T N2 ~ 45 K, an anomaly at 20 K is observed in our dc magnetization, ac susceptibility and dielectric measurements; below which, an inverse magnetocaloric effect is also observed in our -DeltaS M (T) plots. The neutron scattering measurements show minimal change between 10 K and 30 K in static correlations, but a clear change in energy and linewidth of the magnetic excitations is evident. The results suggest that only dynamic correlations change across T M ~ 20 K. The existence of multiple magnetic interactions below 45 K, with significant coupling between them, is demonstrated using an Arrott plot analysis of our magnetic data. Compatible conclusions are drawn from magnetocaloric plots. The peak change in isothermal magnetic entropy (-DeltaS M) is 1.3 JK(-1) kg(-1) and the value of refrigeration capacity in CaMn7O12 is 34.5 J . kg(-1) at 7 T.",3
Chirality in molecular collision dynamics.,"Chirality is a phenomenon that permeates the natural world, with implications for atomic and molecular physics, for fundamental forces and for the mechanisms at the origin of the early evolution of life and biomolecular homochirality. The manifestations of chirality in chemistry and biochemistry are numerous, the striking ones being chiral recognition and asymmetric synthesis with important applications in molecular sciences and in industrial and pharmaceutical chemistry. Chiral discrimination phenomena, due to the existence of two enantiomeric forms, very well known in the case of interaction with light, but still nearly disregarded in molecular collision studies. Here we review some ideas and recent advances about the role of chirality in molecular collisions, designing and illustrating molecular beam experiments for the demonstration of chiral effects and suggesting a scenario for a stereo-directional origin of chiral selection.",3
Role of four-fermion interaction and impurity in the states of two-dimensional semi-Dirac materials.,"We study the effects of four-fermion interaction and impurity on the low-energy states of 2D semi-Dirac materials by virtue of the unbiased renormalization group approach. The coupled flow equations that govern the energy-dependent evolutions of all correlated interaction parameters are derived after taking into account one-loop corrections from the interplay between four-fermion interaction and impurity. Whether and how four-fermion interaction and impurity influence the low-energy properties of 2D semi-Dirac materials are discreetly explored and addressed attentively. After carrying out the standard renormalization group analysis, we find that both trivial insulating and nontrivial semimetal states are qualitatively stable against all four kinds of four-fermion interactions. However, while switching on both four-fermion interaction and impurity, certain insulator-semimetal phase transitions and the distance of Dirac nodal points can be respectively induced and modified due to their strong interplay and intimate competition. Moreover, several non-Fermi liquid behaviors that deviate from the conventional Fermi liquids are exhibited at the lowest-energy limit.",3
Completely flat two-dimensional Zn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub> monolayer with triangle and pentangle coordinated networks.,"Two-dimensional (2D) materials with strictly planar hyper-coordinated motifs are of great importance in fundamental science and potential applications but extremely rare. Here we theoretically design a novel 2D IIB-VIA inorganic system, namely Zn3O2 monolayer, by comprehensive first-principles computations. This Zn3O2 monolayer is composed from highly symmetrical tri-coordinated oxygen and tetra-coordinated zinc, featuring planar and peculiar triangle and pentangle combined bonded network. The newly predicted Zn3O2 monolayer possesses excellent dynamic and thermal stabilities and is also the lowest-energy structure of its 2D space indicated by particle swarm search, supporting its experimentally synthetic viability. A relatively wide band gap of 4.46 eV endows it potential applications in electronics and optoelectronics. The present findings provide a new field of hyper-coordinated 2D nanomaterials for study.",3
Reversibility and intermediate steps as key tools for the growth of extended ordered polymers via on-surface synthesis.,"Surface-confined polymerization is a bottom-up strategy to create one- and two-dimensional covalent organic nanostructures with a pi-conjugated backbone, which are suitable to be employed in real-life electronic devices, due to their high mechanical resistance and electronic charge transport efficiency. This strategy makes it possible to change the properties of the final nanostructures by a careful choice of the monomer architecture (i.e. of its constituent atoms and their spatial arrangement). Several chemical reactions have been proven to form low-dimensional polymers on surfaces, exploiting a variety of precursors in combination with metal (e.g. Cu, Ag, Au) and insulating (e.g. NaCl, CaCO3) surfaces. One of the main challenges of such an approach is to obtain nanostructures with long-range order, to boost the conductance performances of these materials. Most of the exploited chemical reactions use irreversible coupling between the monomers and, as a consequence, the resulting structures often suffer from poor order and high defect density. This review focuses on the state-of-the-art surface-confined polymerization reactions, with particular attention paid to reversible coupling pathways and irreversible processes including intermediate states, which are key aspects to control to increase the order of the final nanostructure.",3
The role of H-bond in the high-pressure chemistry of model molecules.,"Pressure is an extraordinary tool to modify direction and strength of intermolecular interactions with important consequences on the chemical stability of molecular materials. The decrease of the distance among nearest neighbour molecules can give rise to reactive configurations reflecting the crystal arrangement and leading to association processes. In this context, the role of the H-bonds is very peculiar because their usual strengthening with rising pressure does not necessarily configure a decrease of the reaction activation energy but, on the contrary, can give rise to an anomalous stability of the system. In spite of this central role, the mechanisms by which a chemical reaction is favoured or prevented by H-bonding under high pressure conditions is a poorly explored field. Here we review a few studies where the chemical behaviour of simple molecular systems under static compression was related to the H-bonding evolution with pressure. These results are able to clarify a wealth of changes of the chemical and physical properties caused by the strengthening with pressure of the H-bonding network and provide additional tools to understand the mechanisms of high-pressure reactivity, a mandatory step to make these synthetic methods of potential interest for applicative purposes.",3
Affordable and accurate large-scale hybrid-functional calculations on GPU-accelerated supercomputers.,Performing high accuracy hybrid functional calculations for condensed matter systems containing a large number of atoms is at present computationally very demanding or even out of reach if high quality basis sets are used. We present a highly optimized multiple graphics processing unit implementation of the exact exchange operator which allows one to perform fast hybrid functional density-functional theory (DFT) calculations with systematic basis sets without additional approximations for up to a thousand atoms. With this method hybrid DFT calculations of high quality become accessible on state-of-the-art supercomputers within a time-to-solution that is of the same order of magnitude as traditional semilocal-GGA functionals. The method is implemented in a portable open-source library.,3
Isolating long-wavelength fluctuation from structural relaxation in two-dimensional glass: cage-relative displacement.,"It has recently been revealed that long-wavelength fluctuation exists in two-dimensional (2D) glassy systems, having the same origin as that given by the Mermin-Wagner theorem for 2D crystalline solids. In this paper, we discuss how to characterise quantitatively the long-wavelength fluctuation in a molecular dynamics simulation of a lightly supercooled liquid. We employ the cage-relative mean-square displacement (MSD), defined on relative displacement to its cage, to quantitatively separate the long-wavelength fluctuation from the original MSD. For increasing system size the amplitude of acoustic long wavelength fluctuations not only increases but shifts to later times causing a crossover with structural relaxation of caging particles. We further analyse the dynamic correlation length using the cage-relative quantities. It grows as the structural relaxation becomes slower with decreasing temperature, uncovering an overestimation by the four-point correlation function due to the long-wavelength fluctuation. These findings motivate the usage of cage-relative MSD as a starting point for analysis of 2D glassy dynamics.",3
Electronic and mechanical response of graphene on BaTiO3 at martensitic phase transitions.,"Graphene is extremely sensitive to optical, electrical and mechanical stimuli, which cause a significant variation of the band structure, thus the physiochemical properties. In our work, we report on changes of strain and doping in graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition on copper and transferred onto a BaTiO3(1 0 0) (BTO) single-crystal. The BTO is known as a ferroelectric material, which undergoes several thermoelastic martensitic phase transitions when it is cooled from 300 K to 10 K. In order to enhance the very weak Raman signal of the graphene monolayer (ML) on the BTO, a 15 nm thin gold layer was deposited on top of the graphene ML to benefit from the surface enhanced Raman scattering. Using temperature dependent Raman spectral mapping, the principal Raman modes (D, G and 2D) of the graphene ML were followed in situ. From a careful analysis of these Raman modes, we conclude that the induced strain and doping of the graphene ML follows the martensitic phase transitions of the BTO crystal. Our study suggests potential exploitation of the graphene as a highly sensitive opto-mechanical sensor or transducer.",3
Multiple tuning of magnetic biskyrmions using in situ L-TEM in centrosymmetric MnNiGa alloy.,"Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected spin configurations and have recently received growingly attention in magnetic materials. The existence of biskyrmions within a broad temperature range has been identified in our newly-discovered MnNiGa material, promising for potential application in physics and technological study. Here, the biskyrmion microscopic origination from the spin configuration evolution of stripe ground state is experimentally identified. The biskyrmion manipulations based on the influences of the basic microstructures and external factors such as grain boundary confinement, sample thickness, electric current, magnetic field and temperature have been systematically studied by using real-space Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. These multiple tuning options help to understand the essential properties of MnNiGa and predict a significant step forward for the realization of skyrmion-based spintronic devices.",3
Strain-induced bi-thermoelectricity in tapered carbon nanotubes.,"We show that carbon-based nanostructured materials are a novel testbed for controlling thermoelectricity and have the potential to underpin the development of new cost-effective environmentally-friendly thermoelectric materials. In single-molecule junctions, it is known that transport resonances associated with the discrete molecular levels play a key role in the thermoelectric performance, but such resonances have not been exploited in carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Here we study junctions formed from tapered CNTs and demonstrate that such structures possess transport resonances near the Fermi level, whose energetic location can be varied by applying strain, resulting in an ability to tune the sign of their Seebeck coefficient. These results reveal that tapered CNTs form a new class of bi-thermoelectric materials, exhibiting both positive and negative thermopower. This ability to change the sign of the Seebeck coefficient allows the thermovoltage in carbon-based thermoelectric devices to be boosted by placing CNTs with alternating-sign Seebeck coefficients in tandem.",3
Functional metasurfaces based on metallic and dielectric subwavelength slits and stripes array.,"Starting with the early works of extraordinary optical transmission and extraordinary Young's interference, researchers have been fascinated by the unusual optical properties displayed by metallic holes/slits and subsequently found similar abnormities in dielectric counterparts. Benefiting from the shrinking wavelength of surface plasmon polaritons excited in metallic slits and high refractive index of dielectric stripes, one can realize local phase modulation and approach desired dispersion by engineering the geometries of a slits and stripes array. In this review, we review recent developments in functional metasurfaces composed of various metallic and dielectric subwavelength slits and stripes arrays, with special emphasis on achromatic, ultra-broadband, quasi-continuous, multifunctional and reconfigurable metasurfaces. Particular attention is paid to provide insight into the design strategies for these devices. Finally, we give an outlook of the development in this fascinating area.",3
Experimental determination of configurational entropy in a two-dimensional liquid under random pinning.,"A quasi two-dimensional colloidal suspension is studied under the influence of immobilisation (pinning) of a random fraction of its particles. We introduce a novel experimental method to perform random pinning and, with the support of numerical simulation, we find that increasing the pinning concentration smoothly arrests the system, with a cross-over from a regime of high mobility and high entropy to a regime of low mobility and low entropy. At the local level, we study fluctuations in area fraction and concentration of pins and map them to entropic structural signatures and local mobility, obtaining a measure for the local entropic fluctuations of the experimental system.",3
Fe and Co NMR studies of magnetoelectric Co2 Y-type hexaferrite BSCFAO.,"The Fe(3+) and Co(2+) NMR spectra for Ba0.3Sr1.7Co2(Fe0.96Al0.04)12O22 (BSCFAO) and Ba0.3Sr1.7Co2Fe12O22 (BSCFO) were obtained in a zero magnetic field at a low temperature. We observed change in the enhancement effect of the NMR signals depending on the setting field, which was varied when applied along the b-axis and then turned off before the measurement was taken. The experimental results indicate that the magnetic structure changes from an alternating longitudinal cone to a transverse cone when the setting field is 250 mT. They also show that the spins of Co(2+) ions together with those of Fe(3+) ions constitute a part of the overall magnetic structure and that the substitution of Al(3+) for Fe(3+) weakens the magnetic anisotropy within the easy plane. From a comparison of the enhancement factors of the Fe(3+) NMR obtained with the RF pulse applied along the a-axis and the c-axis, we found that the magnetic easy plane anisotropy is approximately 16 times greater than the anisotropy within the easy plane. No changes of the NMR spectra were observed under an electric field of 1.2 MV m(-1).",3
Enhanced second harmonic generation from a plasmonic Fano structure subjected to an azimuthally polarized light beam.,"We show that an azimuthally polarized beam (APB) excitation of a plasmonic Fano structure made by coupling a split-ring resonator (SRR) to a nanoarc can enhance second harmonic generation (SHG). Strikingly, an almost 30 times enhancement in SHG peak intensity can be achieved when the excitation is switched from a linearly polarized beam (LPB) to an APB. We attribute this significant enhancement of SHG to the corresponding increase in the local field intensity at the fundamental frequency of SHG, resulting from the improved conversion efficiency between the APB excitation and the plasmonic modes of the Fano structure. We also show that unlike LPB, APB excitation creates a symmetric SHG radiation pattern. This effect can be understood by considering an interference model in which the APB can change the total SHG far-field radiation by modifying the amplitudes and phases of two waves originating from the individual SRR and nanoarc of the Fano structure.",3
"High-pressure structural and vibrational properties of monazite-type BiPO4, LaPO4, CePO4, and PrPO4.","Monazite-type BiPO4, LaPO4, CePO4, and PrPO4 have been studied under high pressure by ab initio simulations and Raman spectroscopy measurements in the pressure range of stability of the monazite structure. A good agreement between experimental and theoretical Raman-active mode frequencies and pressure coefficients has been found which has allowed us to discuss the nature of the Raman-active modes. Besides, calculations have provided us with information on how the crystal structure is modified by pressure. This information has allowed us to determine the equation of state and the isothermal compressibility tensor of the four studied compounds. In addition, the information obtained on the polyhedral compressibility has been used to explain the anisotropic axial compressibility and the bulk compressibility of monazite phosphates. Finally, we have carried out a systematic discussion on the high-pressure behavior of the four studied phosphates in comparison to results of previous studies.",3
Magnetic and structural depth profiles of Heusler alloy Co2FeAl0.5Si0.5 epitaxial films on Si(1 1 1).,"The depth-resolved chemical structure and magnetic moment of [Formula: see text], thin films grown on Si(1 1 1) have been determined using x-ray and polarized neutron reflectometry. Bulk-like magnetization is retained across the majority of the film, but reduced moments are observed within 45[Formula: see text] of the surface and in a 25[Formula: see text] substrate-interface region. The reduced moment is related to compositional changes due to oxidation and diffusion, which are further quantified by elemental profiling using electron microscopy with electron energy loss spectroscopy. The accuracy of structural and magnetic depth-profiles obtained from simultaneous modeling is discussed using different approaches with different degree of constraints on the parameters. Our approach illustrates the challenges in fitting reflectometry data from these multi-component quaternary Heusler alloy thin films.",3
Hydrodynamic shrinkage of liquid CO<sub>2</sub> Taylor drops in a straight microchannel.,"Hydrodynamic shrinkage of liquid CO2 drops in water under a Taylor flow regime is studied using a straight microchannel (length/width ~ 100). A general form of a mathematical model of the solvent-side mass transfer coefficient (ks) is developed first. Based on formulations of the surface area (A) and the volume (V) of a general Taylor drop in a rectangular microchannel, a specific form of ks is derived. Drop length and speed are experimentally measured at three specified positions of the straight channel, namely, immediately after drop generation (position 1), the midpoint of the channel (position 2) and the end of the channel (position 3). The reductions of drop length (Lx, x = 1, 2, 3) from position 1 to 2 and down to 3 are used to quantify the drop shrinkage. Using the specific model, ks is calculated mainly based on Lx and drop flowing time (t). Results show that smaller CO2 drops produced by lower flow rate ratios (QLCO2/QH2O) are generally characterized by higher (nearly three times) ks and Sherwood numbers than those produced by higher QLCO2/QH2O, which is essentially attributed to the larger effective portion of the smaller drop contributing in the mass transfer under same levels of the flowing time and the surface-to-volume ratio (~ 104 m-1) of all drops. Based on calculated pressure drops of the segmented flow in microchannel, the Peng-Robinson equation of state (EOS) and initial pressures of drops at the T-junction in experiments, overall pressure drop (DeltaPt) in the straight channel as well as the resulted drop volume change are quantified. DeltaPt from position 1 to 3 is by average 3.175 kPa with a ~1.6% standard error, which only leads to relative drop volume changes of 0.3 per thousand to 0.52 per thousand.",3
Nanodoping: a route for enhancing electro-optic performance of bent core nematic system.,"We report the effect of dispersion of barium titanate (BaTiO3) nanoparticles (BNPs) in a four ring bent core nematic (BCN) liquid crystal. Polarizing optical microscopy reveals the presence of a single nematic phase in pure and doped states. Polar switching has been observed in the bent core system and the value of spontaneous polarization (P s) increases with increase in doping concentration of BNPs in BCN. Dielectric study shows a lower frequency mode, which can be ascribed to the formation of cybotactic clusters. These clusters are also responsible for the observed polar switching in pure, as well as, in doped BCNs. Another higher frequency mode, observed only in pure BCN, indicates the rotation of molecules about their long molecular axis. The conductivity of doped samples is also found to decrease as compared to the pure BCN. This reduction helps in the minimization of negative effects caused by free ions in liquid crystal based devices. This study demonstrates that the interaction between BNPs and BCN molecules improves the P s, dielectric behaviour, viscosity and reduces the conductivity of pure BCN. Hence, nanodoping in a BCN is an effective method for the enhancement of electro-optic performances and will lead to the development of faster electro-optic devices.",3
Electromigration and morphological changes in Ag nanostructures.,"Electromigration (EM) as a structuring tool was investigated in Ag nanowires (width 300 nm, thickness 25 nm) and partly in notched and bow-tie Ag structures on a Si(1 0 0) substrate in ultra-high vacuum using a four-tip scanning tunneling microscope in combination with a scanning electron microscope. From simulations of Ag nanowires we got estimates of temperature profiles, current density profiles, EM and thermal migration (TM) mass flux distributions within the nanowire induced by critical current densities of 10(8) A cm(-2). At room temperature, the electron wind force at these current densities by far dominates over thermal diffusion, and is responsible for formation of voids at the cathode and hillocks at the anode side. For current densities that exceed the critical current densities necessary for EM, a new type of wire-like structure formation was found both at room temperature and at 100 K for notched and bow-tie structures. This suggests that the simultaneous action of EM and TM is structure forming, but with a very small influence of TM at low temperature.",3
Compactness of viral genomes: effect of disperse and localized random mutations.,"Genomes of single-stranded RNA viruses have evolved to optimize several concurrent properties. One of them is the architecture of their genomic folds, which must not only feature precise structural elements at specific positions, but also allow for overall spatial compactness. The latter was shown to be disrupted by random synonymous mutations, a disruption which can consequently negatively affect genome encapsidation. In this study, we use three mutation schemes with different degrees of locality to mutate the genomes of phage MS2 and Brome Mosaic virus in order to understand the observed sensitivity of the global compactness of their folds. We find that mutating local stretches of their genomes' sequence or structure is less disruptive to their compactness compared to inducing randomly-distributed mutations. Our findings are indicative of a mechanism for the conservation of compactness acting on a global scale of the genomes, and have several implications for understanding the interplay between local and global architecture of viral RNA genomes.",3
Investigation of resistance switching in SiO x RRAM cells using a 3D multi-scale kinetic Monte Carlo simulator.,"We employ an advanced three-dimensional (3D) electro-thermal simulator to explore the physics and potential of oxide-based resistive random-access memory (RRAM) cells. The physical simulation model has been developed recently, and couples a kinetic Monte Carlo study of electron and ionic transport to the self-heating phenomenon while accounting carefully for the physics of vacancy generation and recombination, and trapping mechanisms. The simulation framework successfully captures resistance switching, including the electroforming, set and reset processes, by modeling the dynamics of conductive filaments in the 3D space. This work focuses on the promising yet less studied RRAM structures based on silicon-rich silica (SiO x ) RRAMs. We explain the intrinsic nature of resistance switching of the SiO x layer, analyze the effect of self-heating on device performance, highlight the role of the initial vacancy distributions acting as precursors for switching, and also stress the importance of using 3D physics-based models to capture accurately the switching processes. The simulation work is backed by experimental studies. The simulator is useful for improving our understanding of the little-known physics of SiO x resistive memory devices, as well as other oxide-based RRAM systems (e.g. transition metal oxide RRAMs), offering design and optimization capabilities with regard to the reliability and variability of memory cells.",3
Engineering the spin polarization of one-dimensional electrons.,"We present results of magneto-focusing on the controlled monitoring of spin polarization within a one-dimensional (1D) channel, and its subsequent effect on modulating the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) in a 2D GaAs electron gas. We demonstrate that electrons within a 1D channel can be partially spin polarized as the effective length of the 1D channel is varied in agreement with the theoretical prediction. Such polarized 1D electrons when injected into a 2D region result in a split in the odd-focusing peaks, whereas the even peaks remain unaffected (single peak). On the other hand, the unpolarized electrons do not affect the focusing spectrum and the odd and even peaks remain as single peaks, respectively. The split in odd-focusing peaks is evidence of direct measurement of spin polarization within a 1D channel, where each sub-peak represents the population of a particular spin state. Confirmation of the spin splitting is determined by a selective modulation of the focusing peaks due to the Zeeman energy in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. We suggest that the SOI in the 2D regime is enhanced by a stream of polarized 1D electrons. The spatial control of spin states of injected 1D electrons and the possibility of tuning the SOI may open up a new regime of spin-engineering with application in future quantum information schemes.",3
Self-consistent description of local density dynamics in simple liquids. The case of molten lithium.,"The dynamic structure factor is the quantity, which can be measured by means of Brillouin light-scattering as well as by means of inelastic scattering of neutrons and x-rays. The spectral (or frequency) moments of the dynamic structure factor define directly the sum rules of the scattering law. The theoretical scheme formulated in this study allows one to describe the dynamics of local density fluctuations in simple liquids and to obtain the expression of the dynamic structure factor in terms of the spectral moments. The theory satisfies all the sum rules, and the obtained expression for the dynamic structure factor yields correct extrapolations into the hydrodynamic limit as well as into the free-particle dynamics limit. We discuss correspondence of this theory with the generalized hydrodynamics and with the viscoelastic models, which are commonly used to analyze the data of inelastic neutron and x-ray scattering in liquids. In particular, we reveal that the postulated condition of the viscoelastic model for the memory function can be directly obtained within the presented theory. The dynamic structure factor of liquid lithium is computed on the basis of the presented theory, and various features of the scattering spectra are evaluated. It is found that the theoretical results are in agreement with inelastic x-ray scattering data.",3
Electronic and optical properties of spinel zinc ferrite: ab initio hybrid functional calculations.,"Spinel ferrites in general show a rich interplay of structural, electronic, and magnetic properties. Here, we particularly focus on zinc ferrite (ZFO), which has been observed experimentally to crystallise in the cubic normal spinel structure. However, its magnetic ground state is still under dispute. In addition, some unusual magnetic properties in ZFO thin films or nanostructures have been explained by a possible partial cation inversion and a different magnetic interaction between the two cation sublattices of the spinel structure compared to the crystalline bulk material. Here, density functional theory has been applied to investigate the influence of different inversion degrees and magnetic couplings among the cation sublattices on the structural, electronic, magnetic, and optical properties. Effects of exchange and correlation have been modelled using the generalised gradient approximation (GGA) together with the Hubbard '+U' parameter, and the more elaborate hybrid functional PBE0. While the GGA+U calculations yield an antiferromagnetically coupled normal spinel structure as the ground state, in the PBE0 calculations the ferromagnetically coupled normal spinel is energetically slightly favoured, and the hybrid functional calculations perform much better with respect to structural, electronic and optical properties.",3
Fingerprints of a position-dependent Fermi velocity on scanning tunnelling spectra of strained graphene.,"Nonuniform strain in graphene induces a position dependence of the Fermi velocity, as recently demonstrated by scanning tunnelling spectroscopy experiments. In this work, we study the effects of a position-dependent Fermi velocity on the local density of states (LDOS) of strained graphene, with and without the presence of a uniform magnetic field. The variation of LDOS obtained from tight-binding calculations is successfully explained by analytical expressions derived within the Dirac approach. These expressions also rectify a rough Fermi velocity substitution used in the literature that neglects the strain-induced anisotropy. The reported analytical results could be useful for understanding the nonuniform strain effects on scanning tunnelling spectra of graphene, as well as when it is exposed to an external magnetic field.",3
Magnitude of the current in 2D interlayer tunneling devices.,"Using the Bardeen tunneling method with first-principles wave functions, computations are made of the tunneling current in graphene/hexagonal-boron-nitride/graphene (G/h-BN/G) vertical structures. Detailed comparison with prior experimental results is made, focusing on the magnitude of the achievable tunnel current. With inclusion of the effects of translational and rotational misalignment of the graphene and the h-BN, predicted currents are found to be about 15x larger than experimental values. A reduction in this discrepancy, to a factor of 2.5x, is achieved by utilizing a realistic size for the band gap of the h-BN, hence affecting the exponential decay constant for the tunneling.",3
Behaviour of niobium during early Earth's differentiation: insights from its local structure and oxidation state in silicate melts at high pressure.,"Niobium (Nb) is one of the key trace elements used to understand Earth's formation and differentiation, and is remarkable for its deficiency relative to tantalum in terrestrial rocks compared to the building chondritic blocks. In this context, the local environment of Nb in silica-rich melts and glasses is studied by in situ x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at high pressure (P) up to 9.3 GPa and 1350 K using resistive-heating diamond-anvil cells. Nb is slightly less oxidized in the melt (intermediate valence between +4 and +5) than in the glass (+5), an effect evidenced from the shift of the Nb-edge towards lower energies. Changes in the pre-edge features are also observed between melt and glass states, consistently with the observed changes in oxidation state although likely enhanced by temperature (T) effects. The oxidation state of Nb is not affected by pressure neither in the molten nor glassy states, and remains constant in the investigated P-range. The Nb-O coordination number is constant and equal to [Formula: see text] below 5 GPa, and only progressively increases up to [Formula: see text] at 9.3 GPa, the maximum P investigated. If these findings were to similarly apply to basaltic melts, that would rule out the hypothesis of Nb/Ta fractionation during early silicate Earth's differentiation, thus reinforcing the alternative hypothesis of fractionation during core formation on reduced pre-planetary bodies.",3
Electron-phonon coupling from finite differences.,"The interaction between electrons and phonons underlies multiple phenomena in physics, chemistry, and materials science. Examples include superconductivity, electronic transport, and the temperature dependence of optical spectra. A first-principles description of electron-phonon coupling enables the study of the above phenomena with accuracy and material specificity, which can be used to understand experiments and to predict novel effects and functionality. In this topical review, we describe the first-principles calculation of electron-phonon coupling from finite differences. The finite differences approach provides several advantages compared to alternative methods, in particular (i) any underlying electronic structure method can be used, and (ii) terms beyond the lowest order in the electron-phonon interaction can be readily incorporated. But these advantages are associated with a large computational cost that has until recently prevented the widespread adoption of this method. We describe some recent advances, including nondiagonal supercells and thermal lines, that resolve these difficulties, and make the calculation of electron-phonon coupling from finite differences a powerful tool. We review multiple applications of the calculation of electron-phonon coupling from finite differences, including the temperature dependence of optical spectra, superconductivity, charge transport, and the role of defects in semiconductors. These examples illustrate the advantages of finite differences, with cases where semilocal density functional theory is not appropriate for the calculation of electron-phonon coupling and many-body methods such as the GW approximation are required, as well as examples in which higher-order terms in the electron-phonon interaction are essential for an accurate description of the relevant phenomena. We expect that the finite difference approach will play a central role in future studies of the electron-phonon interaction.",3
Symmetric spin-orbit interaction in triple quantum dot and minimisation of spin-orbit leakage in CNOT gate.,"We analyse spin-orbit interaction in triple quantum dots and show that a symmetric spin-orbit Hamiltonian does not follow the standard form used in double quantum dots, as a consequence of the presence of the third dot in the setup. Furthermore, CNOT implementation schemes based on the exchange interaction were studied. It was shown that an antisymmetric Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya term is the dominant source of spin-orbit leakage from the computational space. We present a simple scheme for the minimisation of leakage that can be implemented in cases where interacting spins enclose parallelogram or equilateral triangle loops.",3
Electronic structure of Fe1.08Te bulk crystals and epitaxial FeTe thin films on Bi2Te3.,"The electronic structure of thin films of FeTe grown on Bi2Te3 is investigated using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy and first principles calculations. As a comparison, data from cleaved bulk Fe1.08Te taken under the same experimental conditions is also presented. Due to the substrate and thin film symmetry, FeTe thin films grow on Bi2Te3 in three domains, rotated by 0 degrees , 120 degrees , and 240 degrees . This results in a superposition of photoemission intensity from the domains, complicating the analysis. However, by combining bulk and thin film data, it is possible to partly disentangle the contributions from three domains. We find a close similarity between thin film and bulk electronic structure and an overall good agreement with first principles calculations, assuming a p-doping shift of 65 meV for the bulk and a renormalization factor of around two. By tracking the change of substrate electronic structure upon film growth, we find indications of an electron transfer from the FeTe film to the substrate. No significant change of the film's electronic structure or doping is observed when alkali atoms are dosed onto the surface. This is ascribed to the film's high density of states at the Fermi energy. This behavior is also supported by the ab initio calculations.",3
Fermi-level tuning of the Dirac surface state in (Bi<sub>1-<i>x</i></sub>Sb<sub><i>x</i></sub>)<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> thin films.,"We report on the electronic states and the transport properties of three-dimensional topological insulator (Bi&lt;sub&gt;1-&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ternary alloy thin films grown on an isostructural Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; buffer layer on InP substrates. By angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we clearly detected Dirac surface states with a large bulk band gap of 0.2 - 0.3 eV in the (Bi&lt;sub&gt;1-&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; film with &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; = 0.70. In addition, we observed by Hall effect measurements that the dominant charge carrier converts from electron (n-type) to hole (p-type) at around &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; = 0.7, indicating that the Fermi level can be controlled across the Dirac point. Indeed, the carrier transport was shown to be governed by Dirac surface state in 0.63 </= &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; </= 0.75.These features suggest that Fermi-level tunable (Bi&lt;sub&gt;1-&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based heterostructures provide a platform for extracting exotic topological phenomena.",3
Empirical optimization of DFT + U and HSE for the band structure of ZnO.,"ZnO is a well-known wide band gap semiconductor with promising potential for applications in optoelectronics, transparent electronics, and spintronics. Computational simulations based on the density functional theory (DFT) play an important role in the research of ZnO, but the standard functionals, like Perdew-Burke-Erzenhof, result in largely underestimated values of the band gap and the binding energies of the Zn3d electrons. Methods like DFT + U and hybrid functionals are meant to remedy the weaknesses of plain DFT. However, both methods are not parameter-free. Direct comparison with experimental data is the best way to optimize the computational parameters. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) is commonly considered as a benchmark for the computed electronic densities of states. In this work, both DFT + U and HSE methods were parametrized to fit almost exactly the binding energies of electrons in ZnO obtained by XPS. The optimized parameterizations of DFT + U and HSE lead to significantly worse results in reproducing the ion-clamped static dielectric tensor, compared to standard high-level calculations, including GW, which in turn yield a perfect match for the dielectric tensor. The failure of our XPS-based optimization reveals the fact that XPS does not report the ground state electronic structure for ZnO and should not be used for benchmarking ground state electronic structure calculations.",3
Intermediate-valence state of the Sm and Eu in SmB6 and EuCu2Si2: neutron spectroscopy data and analysis.,"Magnetic neutron scattering data for Sm (SmB6, Sm(Y)S) and Eu (EuCu2Si2-x Ge x ) intermediate-valence compounds have been analysed in terms of a generalized model of the intermediate-radius exciton. Special attention is paid to the correlation between the average ion's valence and parameters of the low-energy excitation in the neutron spectra, such as the resonance mode, including its magnetic form factor. Along with specific features of the formation of the intermediate-valence state for Sm and Eu ions, common physical mechanisms have been revealed for systems based on these elements from the middle of the rare-earth series. A consistent description of the existing experimental data has been obtained by using the concept of a loosely bound hole for the Eu f-electron shell in the intermediate-valence state, in analogy with the previously established loosely bound electron model for the Sm ion.",3
Room temperature synthesis of ReS2 through aqueous perrhenate sulfidation.,"In this study, a direct sulfidation reaction of ammonium perrhenate (NH4ReO4) leading to a synthesis of rhenium disulfide (ReS2) is demonstrated. These findings reveal the first example of a simplistic bottom-up approach to the chemical synthesis of crystalline ReS2. The reaction presented here takes place at room temperature, in an ambient and solvent-free environment and without the necessity of a catalyst. The atomic composition and structure of the as-synthesized product were characterized using several analysis techniques including energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. The results indicated the formation of a lower symmetry (1T') ReS2 with a low degree of layer stacking.",3
Optoelectronic figure of merit of a metal nanoparticle-quantum dot (MNP-QD) hybrid molecule for assessing its suitability for sensing applications.,"Recently, many have studied various configurations of metal nanoparticle-quantum dot (MNP-QD) hybrid molecules based on different metals and tunable parameters. In this paper, we aim to incite the interest in using MNP-QD nanohybrids, which possess sensing capabilities superior to those of the individual constituents, for sensing applications that rely on scattered light. When assessing whether a given MNP-QD configuration is suited for an application, sometimes it is hard to assess the pros and cons of a given configuration against other candidates. Here we propose a simple, elegant relative figure of merit (RFoM), which focuses on maximizing the scattered intensity and the refractive index sensitivity of the nanohybrid, to rank the suitability of viable MNP-QD configurations for a particular sensing application. We use the proposed RFoM to analyse the optical spectra of noble, transition, post transition and alkali metal based MNP-QD nanohybrids using the representative metals Au, Ag, Cu, Al and Na, adopting a generalized nonlocal optical response (GNOR) method based cavity QED approach. Based on our observations, we suggest how the usage of MNP-QD nanohybrids could improve the conventionally studied tumour targeting applications. Moreover, we propose potential substitutes for noble metals conventionally considered for MNP-QD nanohybrids.",3
"Production, deformation and mechanical investigation of magnetic alginate capsules.","In this article we investigated the deformation of alginate capsules in magnetic fields. The sensitivity to magnetic forces was realised by encapsulating an oil in water emulsion, where the oil droplets contained dispersed magnetic nanoparticles. We solved calcium ions in the aqueous emulsion phase, which act as crosslinking compounds for forming thin layers of alginate membranes. This encapsulating technique allows the production of flexible capsules with an emulsion as the capsule core. It is important to mention that the magnetic nanoparticles were stable and dispersed throughout the complete process, which is an important difference to most magnetic alginate-based materials. In a series of experiments, we used spinning drop techniques, capsule squeezing experiments and interfacial shear rheology in order to determine the surface Young moduli, the surface Poisson ratios and the surface shear moduli of the magnetically sensitive alginate capsules. In additional experiments, we analysed the capsule deformation in magnetic fields. In spinning drop and capsule squeezing experiments, water droplets were pressed out of the capsules at elevated values of the mechanical load. This phenomenon might be used for the mechanically triggered release of water-soluble ingredients. After drying the emulsion-filled capsules, we produced capsules, which only contained a homogeneous oil phase with stable suspended magnetic nanoparticles (organic ferrofluid). In the dried state, the thin alginate membranes of these particles were rather rigid. These dehydrated capsules could be stored at ambient conditions for several months without changing their properties. After exposure to water, the alginate membranes rehydrated and became flexible and deformable again. During this swelling process, water diffused back in the capsule. This long-term stability and rehydration offers a great spectrum of different applications as sensors, soft actuators, artificial muscles or drug delivery systems.",3
Evidence for nodal superconductivity in a layered compound Ta4Pd3Te16.,"We report an investigation of the London penetration depth [Formula: see text] on single crystals of the layered superconductor Ta4Pd3Te16, where the crystal structure has quasi-one-dimensional characteristics. A linear temperature dependence of [Formula: see text] is observed for [Formula: see text], in contrast to the exponential behavior of fully gapped superconductors. This indicates the existence of line nodes in the superconducting energy gap. A detailed analysis shows that the normalized superfluid density [Formula: see text], which is converted from [Formula: see text], can be well described by a multigap scenario, with nodes in one of the superconducting gaps, providing clear evidence for nodal superconductivity in Ta4Pd3Te16.",3
Casimir repulsion in superparamagnetic metamaterial constructed by non-monodisperse nanoparticles.,"The electromagnetic properties of interfaces in microelectromechanical systems directly determine the Casimir force between them, therefore the construction of the electromagnetic surface is particularly significant. We theoretically utilize non-monodisperse magnetic nanoparticles to construct a meta-metamaterial (MMM) surface to obtain a repulsive force, which can be adjusted by an external magnetic field. According to Lifshitz's theory, we have discovered that influence of the distribution of particle size on the Casimir force is related to the expectation of particle size, and Casimir repulsion will decrease when taking into account the anisotropy of electromagnetic parameters for MMM plate. This study provides feasible solutions to achieve Casimir repulsion using electromagnetic surfaces.",3
Weak antilocalization effect in exfoliated black phosphorus revealed by temperature- and angle-dependent magnetoconductivity.,"Recently, there have increasingly been debates on whether there exists a surface resonance state (SRS) in black phosphorus (BP), as suggested by recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy results. To resolve this issue, we have performed temperature- and angle-dependent magnetoconductivity measurements on exfoliated, high-quality BP single crystals. A pronounced weak-antilocalization (WAL) effect was observed within a narrow temperature range of 8-16 K, with the electrical current flowing parallel to the cleaved ac-plane (along the a- or c-axis) and the magnetic field along the b-axis. The angle-dependent magnetoconductivity and the Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka model-fitted results have revealed that the observed WAL effect shows surface-bulk coherent features, which supports the existence of SRS in BP.",3
Mechanisms of optical orientation of an individual Mn(2+) ion spin in a II-VI quantum dot.,"We provide a theoretical description of the optical orientation of a single Mn(2+) ion spin under quasi-resonant excitation demonstrated experimentally by Goryca et al (2009 Phys. Rev. Lett. 103 087401). We build and analyze a hierarchy of models by starting with the simplest assumptions (transfer of perfectly spin-polarized excitons from Mn-free dot to the other dot containing a single Mn(2+) spin, followed by radiative recombination) and subsequently adding more features, such as spin relaxation of electrons and holes. Particular attention is paid to the role of the influx of the dark excitons and the process of biexciton formation, which are shown to contribute significantly to the orientation process in the quasi-resonant excitation case. Analyzed scenarios show how multiple features of the excitonic complexes in magnetically-doped quantum dots, such as the values of exchange integrals, spin relaxation times, etc, lead to a plethora of optical orientation processes, characterized by distinct dependencies on light polarization and laser intensity, and occurring on distinct timescales. Comparison with experimental data shows that the correct description of the optical orientation mechanism requires taking into account Mn(2+) spin-flip processes occurring not only when the exciton is already in the orbital ground state of the light-emitting dot, but also those that happen during the exciton transfer from high-energy states to the ground state. Inspired by the experimental results on energy relaxation of electrons and holes in nonmagnetic dots, we focus on the process of biexciton creation allowed by mutual spin-flip of an electron and the Mn(2+) spin, and we show that by including it in the model, we obtain good qualitative and quantitative agreement with the experimental data on quasi-resonantly driven Mn(2+) spin orientation.",3
Ultrafast magnetodynamics with free-electron lasers.,"The study of ultrafast magnetodynamics has entered a new era thanks to the groundbreaking technological advances in free-electron laser (FEL) light sources. The advent of these light sources has made possible unprecedented experimental schemes for time-resolved x-ray magneto-optic spectroscopies, which are now paving the road for exploring the ultimate limits of out-of-equilibrium magnetic phenomena. In particular, these studies will provide insights into elementary mechanisms governing spin and orbital dynamics, therefore contributing to the development of ultrafast devices for relevant magnetic technologies. This topical review focuses on recent advancement in the study of non-equilibrium magnetic phenomena from the perspective of time-resolved extreme ultra violet (EUV) and soft x-ray spectroscopies at FELs with highlights of some important experimental results.",3
Elastic moduli of a smectic membrane: a rod-level scaling analysis.,"Chiral rodlike colloids exposed to strong depletion attraction may self-assemble into chiral membranes whose twisted director field differs from that of a 3D bulk chiral nematic. We formulate a simple microscopic variational theory to determine the elastic moduli of rods assembled into a bidimensional smectic membrane. The approach is based on a simple Onsager-Straley theory for a non-uniform director field that we apply to describe rod twist within the membrane. A microscopic approach enables a detailed estimate of the individual Frank elastic moduli (splay, twist and bend) as well as the twist penetration depth of the smectic membrane in relation to the rod density and shape. We find that the elastic moduli are distinctly different from those of a bulk nematic fluid, with the splay elasticity being much stronger and the curvature elasticity much weaker than for rods assembled in a three-dimensional nematic fluid. We argue that the use of the simplistic one-constant approximation in which all moduli are assumed to be of equal magnitude is not appropriate for modelling the structure-property relation of smectic membranes.",3
Corrigendum: ``On the performance of natural orbital functional approximations in the Hubbard model'' [J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 29 (2017) 425602].,There was an error when collecting the data in the results corresponding to PNOF7 for the homogeneous 4 sites square and 6 sites hexagone Hubbard models reported in the article. And also for MBB and CGA for the 10 sites Hubbard model including an Aubry-Andre potential.,3
Semiclassical transport properties of IrGa<sub>3</sub>: a promising thermoelectric material.,"IrGa3 is an intermetallic compound which is expected to be a metal, but a study on the electronic properties of this material to confirm its metallic character is not available in the literature. In this work, we report for the first time a first-principles Density Functional Theory and semiclassical Boltzmann theory study of the structural, electronic and transport properties of this material. The inclusion of the spin-orbit coupling term is crucial to calculate accurately the electronic properties of this compound. We have established that IrGa3 is an indirect semiconductor with a narrow gap of 0.07 eV. From semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory, it is inferred that this material,&#13; with the appropriate hole concentration, could have a thermoelectric figure of merit at room temperature comparable to other intermetallic compounds such as FeGa3, though the transport properties of IrGa3 are highly anisotropic.&#13.",3
Lattice response to relaxation of electronic pressure of ultrafast laser-irradiated copper and nickel nanofilms.,"The impact of electronic pressure and electronic pressure gradient induced by laser excitation on dynamic response of metals (Cu and Ni) has been numerically investigated using two complementary approaches. In the framework of DFPT, for electronic temperature up to 6 eV , we demonstrate that the electronic pressure results in a higher lattice stability. In other words, the electronic pressure has a negative influence on the phonon entropy and induces an increase in the shear modulus, which improves the melting temperature and lattice vibration frequency. Given the relaxation of electronic pressure during extreme non-equilibrium state, we adopt modified 2T-MD model to identify the contribution of electronic pressure gradient to the atomic dynamics during fs laser excitation. Our results indicate the presence of rapid destabilization of the structure of Cu and Ni nano-films along electronic pressure gradients. Specifically, the nucleation of the voids and heterogeneous nucleation occur at the surface layer, at a depth of several nanometers, for Cu and Ni, respectively. With the coexistence of a-thermal and thermal effects on scales, the two different ultrafast destructuring process of Cu and Ni both inter-relate hot electronic blast force and classical electron-ion dynamics.",3
Giant amplification of terahertz plasmons in a double-layer graphene.,"The amplification of terahertz plasmons in a pair of parallel active graphene monolayers is studied theoretically. The plasmon wave in a symmetric double-layer graphene structure splits into two branches with a symmetric and an antisymmetric distribution of tangential to graphene component of the electric field across the plane of symmetry of the structure. It is shown that, normalized to the wavelength, the terahertz plasmon amplification factor of the symmetric mode in the double-layer graphene structure could be greater than that in a single graphene layer by four orders of magnitude.",3
Field-induced magnetic phase transitions and memory effect in bilayer ruthenate Ca<sub>3</sub>Ru<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> with Fe substitution.,"Bilayer ruthenate Ca3(Ru1-xFex)2O7 (x = 0.05) exhibits an incommensurate magnetic soliton lattice driven by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Here we report complex field-induced magnetic phase transitions and memory effect in this system via single-crystal neutron diffraction and magnetotransport measurements. We observe first-order incommensurate-to-commensurate magnetic transitions upon applying the magnetic field both along and perpendicular to the propagation axis of the incommensurate spin structure. Furthermore, we find that the metastable states formed upon decreasing the magnetic field depend on temperature and the applied field orientation. We suggest that the observed field-induced metastability may be ascribable to the quenched kinetics at low temperature.",3
Dynamics of a quasiparticle in the alpha-T<sub>3</sub> model: Role of pseudospin polarization and transverse magnetic field on <i>zitterbewegung</i>.,"We consider the $\alpha$-$T_3$ model which provides a smooth crossover between the honeycomb lattice with pseudospin $1/2$ &#13; and the dice lattice with pseudospin $1$ through the variation of a parameter $\alpha$.&#13; We study the dynamics of a wave packet representing a quasiparticle in the $\alpha$-T$_3$&#13; model with zero and finite transverse magnetic field. For zero field, it is shown that the wave packet undergoes a&#13; transient $zitterbewegung$ (ZB). Various features of ZB&#13; depending on the initial pseudospin polarization of the wave packet have been revealed.&#13; For an intermediate value of the parameter $\alpha$ i.e. for $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$ the resulting ZB consists of two distinct&#13; frequencies when the wave packet was located initially&#13; in $rim$ site. However, the wave packet exhibits single frequency ZB for $\alpha=0$ and $\alpha=1$. It is &#13; also unveiled that the frequency of ZB corresponding to $\alpha=1$ gets exactly half of that corresponding to &#13; the $\alpha=0$ case. On the other hand, when the initial wave packet was in $hub$ site, the ZB consists &#13; of only one frequency for all values of $\alpha$. Using stationary phase approximation we find analytical expression&#13; of velocity average which can be used to extract the associated timescale over which the transient nature of&#13; ZB persists. On the contrary the wave packet undergoes permanent ZB in presence of a transverse magnetic field.&#13; Due to the presence of large number of Landau energy levels the oscillations in ZB appear to be much more complicated. The &#13; oscillation pattern depends significantly on the initial pseudospin polarization of the wave packet. Furthermore,&#13; it is revealed that the number of the frequency components involved in ZB depends on the parameter $\alpha$.",3
Improving carrier transport in Cu<sub>2</sub>O thin films by rapid thermal annealing.,"Cuprous oxide (Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) is a promising material for large scale photovoltaic applications. The efficiencies of thin film structures are, however, currently lower than those for structures based on Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O sheets, possibly due to their poorer transport properties. This study shows that post-deposition rapid thermal annealing (RTA) of Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O films is an effective approach for improving carrier transport in films prepared by reactive magnetron sputtering. The as-deposited Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O films were poly-crystalline, p-type, with weak near band edge (NBE) emission in photoluminescence spectra, a grain size of ~100 nm and a hole mobility of 2 - 18 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/Vs. Subsequent RTA (3 min) at a pressure of 50 Pa and temperatures of 600 - 1000 degrees C enhanced the NBE by 2-3 orders of magnitude, evidencing improved crystalline quality and reduction of non-radiative carrier recombination. Both grain size and hole mobility were increased considerably upon RTA, reaching values above 1microm and up to 58 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/Vs, respectively, for films annealed at 900 - 1000 degrees C. These films also exhibited a resistivity of ~50 - 200 Omega cm, a hole concentration of ~ 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperature, and a transmittance above 80.",3
Comparison of surface structures of corundum Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>(0001) and V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>(0001) ultrathin films by x-ray photoelectron diffraction.,"Thin Cr2O3(0001) layers are formed by oxidation of a Cr(110) single crystal. This surface is further modified by growing an epitaxial ultrathin V2O3(0001) film by reactive vapor deposition. Synchrotron based soft-x ray photoemission spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron diffraction are used to characterize the surface layers of these two corundum-structured oxides. By comparison of experimental XPD patterns with simulated electron multiple scattering calculations, two distinctively different surface terminations are extracted for the two oxides. While for V2O3 we confirm the previously proposed vanadyl-terminated surface structure, we propose a new surface structure for Cr2O3 that consists of excess chromium atoms occupying interstitial sub-surface sites.",3
Thermoelectric properties of Co<sub>4</sub>Sb<sub>12</sub> with Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> nanoinclusions.,"The figure of merit (zT) of a thermoelectric material can be enhanced by incorporation of nanoinclusions into bulk material. The presence of bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3) nanoinclusions in Co4Sb12 leads to lower phonon thermal conductivity by introducing interfaces and defects; it enhances the average zT between 300-700 K. In the current study, Bi2Te3 nanoparticles were dispersed into bulk Co4Sb12 by ball-milling. The bulk was fabricated by spark plasma sintering (SPS). The presence of Bi2Te3 dispersion in Co4Sb12 was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron back scattered diffraction (EBSD) technique. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) showed antimony (Sb) as an impurity phase for higher contents of Bi2Te3 in the sample. The Seebeck coefficient (S) and electrical conductivity () were measured in the temperature range of 350 - 673 K. The negative value of S indicates that most of the charge carriers were electrons. A decrease in S and increase in with Bi2Te3 content are due to the increased carrier concentration, as confirmed by Hall measurement. The thermal conductivity, measured between 423 - 673 K, decreased due to the increased phonon scattering at interfaces. A maximum zT of 0.17 was achieved at 523 K and it did not vary much throughout the temperature range. The experimental results of composites were compared by using effective medium theories.",3
A variable pole magnet.,The off-stoichiometric antiferromagnetic Heusler alloy Fe50Mn45Ga5 decomposes and forms ferromagnetic Fe50Mn25Ga25 precipitates embedded in an antiferromagnetic Fe50Mn50 matrix when temper-annealed at temperatures T > 550 K. The ferromagnetism of the precipitates is soft so that the magnetization direction of the non-interacting precipitates in a macroscopic material can be manipulated by locally applied fields so that even two similar poles can form at the ends of a centimeter-long bar. The cause for the soft magnetic behavior is due to the weak AF exchange anisotropy of the cubic Fe50Mn50 matrix and the precipitate.,3
Micro-flock patterns and macro-clusters in chiral active Brownian disks.,"Chiral active particles (or self-propelled circle swimmers) feature a rich collective behavior, comprising rotating macro-clusters and micro-flock patterns which consist of phase-synchronized rotating clusters with a characteristic self-limited size. These patterns emerge from the competition of alignment interactions and rotations suggesting that they might occur generically in many chiral active matter systems. However, although excluded volume interactions occur naturally among typical circle swimmers, it is not yet clear if macro-clusters and micro-flock patterns survive their presence. The present work shows that both types of pattern do survive but feature strongly enhance fluctuations regarding the size and shape of the individual clusters. Despite these fluctuations, we find that the average micro-flock size still follows the same characteristic scaling law as in the absence of excluded volume interactions, i.e. micro-flock sizes scale linearly with the single-swimmer radius.",3
Charge and orbital orders and structural instability in high-pressure quadruple perovskite CeCuMn<sub>6</sub>O<sub>12</sub>.,"We prepared a quadruple perovskite CeCuMn6O12 under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions at 6 GPa and about 1670 K and investigated its structural, magnetic and transport properties. CeCuMn6O12 crystallizes in space group Im-3 above TCO = 297 K; below this temperature, it adopts space group R-3 with the 1:3 (Mn4+:Mn3+) charge and orbital orders. Unusual compressed Mn3+O6 octahedra are realized in CeCuMn6O12 similar to CaMn7O12 with the -Q3 Jahn-Teller distortion mode. Below about 90 K, structural instability takes place with phase separation and the appearance of competing phases; and below 70 K, two R-3 phases coexist. CeCuMn6O12 exhibits a ferromagnetic-like transition below TC = 140 K, and it is a semiconductor with the magnetoresistance reaching about -40 % at 140 K and 70 kOe. We argued that the valence of Ce is +3 in CeCuMn6O12 with the Ce3+(Cu2+Mn3+2)(Mn3+3Mn4+)O12 charge distribution in the charge-ordered R-3 phase and Ce3+(Cu2+Mn3+2)(Mn3.25+4)O12 in the charge-disordered Im-3 phase.",3
Revealing the interfaces of the hybrid system MgO/Co/GaAs(0 0 1): a structural and chemical investigation with XPS and XPD.,"Bcc metals and MgO are used in technological research for building magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), because they yield a high tunnel magnetoresistance. Thin insulating barriers are of great importance in realizing MTJs. Combined with electrons spin-injected into GaAs, tunneled electrons can be detected and manipulated. We report on a synchrotron radiation based x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron diffraction study on the system MgO/Co(bcc)/GaAs(0 0 1) for ultra-low Co and MgO coverages ([Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]). As a result, we obtain a Co3Ga alloy at the Co/GaAs interface in the rare D03 structure. This structure is only 6.07 A thick, and serves as a template for the metastable Co(bcc) structure. Co(bcc) itself grows heavily distorted in the (0 0 1) direction for the first two unit cells, due to the D03 template. The MgO/Co interface reveals a weak bonding between MgO and Co(bcc) without Co oxidation, since no compound formation was observed. Additionally, MgO grows in an amorphous phase for a thickness of [Formula: see text]. At [Formula: see text], it crystallizes in a compressed unit cell where every second layer is shifted toward the (0 0 1) direction compared to the bulk halite structure.",3
Ultrafast dynamics of differently aligned COOH-DTE-BODIPY conjugates linked to the surface of TiO2.,"The photoinduced dynamics of two DTE-BODIPY conjugates A, B with carboxylic acid anchoring groups coupled to the surface of TiO2 were studied by ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. For compound A, with an orthogonal orientation of the BODIPY chromophore and the photoswitchable DTE unit, a charge separated state could not be reliably detected. Nevertheless, besides the energy transfer from the BODIPY to the ring-closed DTE-c, indications for an electron transfer reaction were found by analyzing fluorescence quenching on TiO2 in steady state fluorescence measurements. For compound B with a parallel orientation of chromophore and photoswitch, a charge separated state was conclusively identified for the coupled dyad (TiO2) via the observation of a positive absorption signal (at lambda pr > 610 nm) at later delay times. An electron transfer rate of 7 x 10(10) s(-1) can be extracted, indicating slower processes in the dyads in comparison to previously published electron transfer reactions of DTE compounds coupled to TiO2.",3
Laser-induced changes of nonlinear electronic transport properties in La0.75Ba0.25MnO3 and (La0.6Pr0.4)0.67Ca0.33MnO3.,"We report photoinduced effects in nonlinear third harmonic ac electric transport-which is a measure for the density of correlated polarons-in thin films of [Formula: see text] (LBMO) and [Formula: see text] (LPCMO) manganites. Both materials show an enhancement of third harmonic voltage in the vicinity of the metal-to-insulator transition, indicating strong electron-lattice correlations within a phase-separated state. Relatively low laser excitation with a pulse fluence of [Formula: see text] leads to an increase (decrease) in nonlinearity in LBMO (LPCMO). With a high pulse fluence of 8mJ cm(-2), we were also able to suppress the correlations in LBMO, which is accompanied by a decrease of third harmonic voltage by [Formula: see text] in our time-averaging measurement technique.",3
Long range of indirect exchange interaction on the edges of MoS2 flakes.,"We study the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction between two magnetic impurities connected to the edges of zigzag-terminated MoS2 flakes. When the impurities lie on the edges of the flake, the effective exchange interaction exhibits sizable noncollinear Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya character that competes with a strong Ising coupling. We analyze the characteristic decay exponent for doping levels inside the band gap of the infinite layer, corresponding to edge states of the flake at the Fermi level. The characteristic exponents show sub-two-dimensional behavior for these band fillings, with decays much slower than quadratic. The Ising interaction has effectively one-dimensional long range, while the noncollinear component that grows for short impurity separation becomes comparable in magnitude. The resulting tunable exchange interaction on these systems opens the way for the study of interesting phases of impurity arrays with long-range stable helical order.",3
"Solid, liquid, and interfacial properties of TiAl alloys: parameterization of a new modified embedded atom method model.","New interatomic potentials for pure Ti and Al, and binary TiAl were developed utilizing the second nearest neighbour modified embedded-atom method (MEAM) formalism. The potentials were parameterized to reproduce multiple properties spanning bulk solids, solid surfaces, solid/liquid phase changes, and liquid interfacial properties. This was carried out using a newly developed optimization procedure that combined the simple minimization of a fitness function with a genetic algorithm to efficiently span the parameter space. The resulting MEAM potentials gave good agreement with experimental and DFT solid and liquid properties, and reproduced the melting points for Ti, Al, and TiAl. However, the surface tensions from the model consistently underestimated experimental values. Liquid TiAl's surface was found to be mostly covered with Al atoms, showing that Al has a significant propensity for the liquid/air interface.",3
A maximally particle-hole asymmetric spectrum emanating from a semi-Dirac point.,"Tight binding models have proven an effective means of revealing Dirac (massless) dispersion, flat bands (infinite mass), and intermediate cases such as the semi-Dirac (sD) dispersion. This approach is extended to a three band model that yields, with chosen parameters in a two-band limit, a closed line with maximally asymmetric particle-hole dispersion: infinite mass holes, zero mass particles. The model retains the sD points for a general set of parameters. Adjacent to this limiting case, hole Fermi surfaces are tiny and needle-like. A pair of large electron Fermi surfaces at low doping merge and collapse at half filling to a flat (zero energy) closed contour with infinite mass along the contour and enclosing no carriers on either side, while the hole Fermi surface has shrunk to a point at zero energy, also containing no carriers. The tight binding model is used to study several characteristics of the dispersion and density of states. The model inspired generalization of sD dispersion to a general +/-[Formula: see text] form, for which analysis reveals that both n and m must be odd to provide a diabolical point with topological character. Evolution of the Hofstadter spectrum of this three band system with interband coupling strength is presented and discussed.",3
Photostriction and elasto-optic response in multiferroics and ferroelectrics from first principles.,"The present work reviews a series of recent first-principles studies devoted to the description of the interaction of light and strain in ferroelectric and multiferroic materials. Specifically, the modelling schemes used in these works to describe the so-called photostriction and elasto-optic effects are presented, in addition to the results and analysis provided by these ab initio calculations. In particular, the large importance of the piezoelectric effect in the polar direction in the photostriction of ferroelectric materials is stressed. Similarly, the occurrence of low-symmetry phases in lead titanate thin films under tensile strain is demonstrated to result in large elasto-optic constants. In addition, first-principle calculations allow to gain microscopic knowledge of subtle effects, for instance in the case of photostriction, where the deformation potential effect in directions perpendicular to the polar axis is shown to be almost as significant as the piezoelectric effect. As a result, the numerical methods presented here could propel the design of efficient opto-mechanical devices.",3
Fermi surfaces in Kondo insulators.,"We report magnetic quantum oscillations measured using torque magnetisation in the Kondo insulator YbB12 and discuss the potential origin of the underlying Fermi surface. Observed quantum oscillations as well as complementary quantities such as a finite linear specific heat capacity in YbB12 exhibit similarities with the Kondo insulator SmB6, yet also crucial differences. Small heavy Fermi sections are observed in YbB12 with similarities to the neighbouring heavy fermion semimetallic Fermi surface, in contrast to large light Fermi surface sections in SmB6 which are more similar to the conduction electron Fermi surface. A rich spectrum of theoretical models is suggested to explain the origin across different Kondo insulating families of a bulk Fermi surface potentially from novel itinerant quasiparticles that couple to magnetic fields, yet do not couple to weak DC electric fields.",3
Surface electronic states of Au-induced nanowires on Ge(0 0 1).,"The electronic states of Au-induced atomic nanowires on Ge(0 0 1) (Au/Ge(0 0 1) NWs) have been studied by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy with linearly polarized light. We have found three electron pockets around the [Formula: see text] line, where the Fermi surfaces are closed in a surface Brillouin zone (SBZ). The results indicate 2D Fermi surfaces of Au/Ge(0 0 1) NWs whereas the atomic structure is 1D. On the basis of the polarization-dependent spectra, the relation between SBZ and the direction of the atomic NW, and the symmetry of the surface state are clarified. These are very useful for further studies on the atomic structure of NWs.",3
Ionic liquid interface at an electrode: simulations of electrochemical properties using an asymmetric restricted primitive model.,"We use Monte Carlo simulations of a coarse-grained model to investigate structure and electrochemical behaviours at an electrode immersed in room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs). The simple RTIL model, which we denote the asymmetric restricted primitive model (ARPM), is composed of monovalent hard-sphere ions, all of the same size, in which the charge is asymmetrically placed. Not only the hard-sphere size (d), but also the charge displacement (b), is identical for all species, i.e. the monovalent RTIL ions are fully described by only two parameters (d, b). In earlier work, it was demonstrated that the ARPM can capture typical static RTIL properties in bulk solutions with remarkable accuracy. Here, we investigate its behaviour at an electrode surface. The electrode is assumed to be a perfect conductor and image charge methods are utilized to handle polarization effects. We find that the ARPM of the ionic liquid reproduces typical (static) electrochemical properties of RTILs. Our model predicts a declining differential capacitance with increasing temperature, which is expected from simple physical arguments. We also compare our ARPM, with the corresponding RPM description, at an elevated temperature (1000 K). We conclude that, even though ion pairing occurs in the ARPM system, reducing the concentration of 'free' ions, it is still better able to screen charge than a corresponding RPM melt. Finally, we evaluate the option to coarse-grain the model even further, by treating the fraction of the ions that form ion pairs implicitly, only through the contribution to the dielectric constant of the corresponding dipolar (ion pair) fluid. We conclude that this primitive representation of ion pairing is not able to reproduce the structures and differential capacitances of the system with explicit ion pairs. The main problem seems to be due to a limited dielectric screening in a layer near the electrode surface, resulting from a combination of orientational restrictions and a depleted dipole density.",3
Observation of low temperature metastable states in complex CaMn<sub>7</sub>O<sub>12</sub>.,"The low temperature magnetic behaviour of the multiferroic quadruple perovskite CaMn7O12 is investigated. The magneto-caloric effect in this material is presented for the first time. Along with the established magnetic transitions, TN1 ~ 90 K and TN2 ~ 45 K, an anomaly at 20 K is observed in our dc magnetization, ac susceptibility and dielectric measurements; below which, an inverse magnetocaloric effect (MCE) is also observed in our -DeltaSM (T) plots. The neutron scattering measurements show minimal change between 10 K and 30 K in static correlations, but a clear change in energy and linewidth of the magnetic excitations is evident. The results suggest that only dynamic correlations change across TM ~ 20 K. The existence of multiple magnetic interactions below 45 K, with significant coupling between them, is demonstrated using an Arrott plot analysis of our magnetic data. Compatible conclusions are drawn from magnetocaloric plots. The peak change in isothermal magnetic entropy (-DeltaSM) is 1.3 JK-1kg-1 and the value of refrigeration capacity in CaMn7O12 is 34.5 J.kg-1 at 7 T.",3
Magnetic and electronic properties of the Cu-substituted Weyl semimetal candidate ZrCo<sub>2</sub>Sn.,"We report that the partial substitution of Cu for Co has a significant impact on the magnetic properties of the Heusler-phase Weyl fermion candidate ZrCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sn. Polycrystalline samples of ZrCo&lt;sub&gt;2-&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt ;&lt;/sub&gt;Sn (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0 to 1.0) exhibited a linearly decreasing ferromagnetic transition temperature and similarly decreasing saturated magnetic moment on increasing Cu substitution x. Materials with Cu contents near &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; = 1 and several other quaternary materials synthesized at the same &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; (ZrCo&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;'Sn (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;' = Rh, Pd, Ni)) display what appears to be non-ferromagnetic magnetization behavior with spin glass characteristics. Electronic structure calculations suggest that the half-metallic nature of unsubstituted ZrCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sn is disrupted significantly by the Cu substitutions, leading to the breakdown of the magnetization vs. electron count guidelines usually followed by Heusler phases, and a more typical metallic non-spin-polarized electronic structure at high &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;.",3
Electronic properties of Pu<sub>19</sub>Os simulating beta-Pu: the strongly correlated Pu phase.,"We established basic electronic properties of zeta-Pu&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;Os, which is a close analogue to beta-Pu, and its low-temperature variety, eta-Pu&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;Os. Their magnetic susceptibility is by 15% higher than for delta-Pu. Specific heat study of zeta-Pu&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;Os shows a soft lattice similar to delta-Pu, leading to a low Debye temperature &lt;i&gt;Theta&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; = 101 K. The linear electronic coefficient &lt;i&gt;gamma&lt;/i&gt; related to the quasiparticle density of states at the Fermi level points to a higher value, 55+/-2 mJ/mol Pu K&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, compared to 40 mJ/mol K&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for delta-Pu. The results confirm that beta-Pu is probably the most strongly correlated Pu phase, as had been indicated by resistivity measurements. The volume and related Pu-Pu spacing is clearly not the primary tuning parameter for Pu metal, as the beta-Pu density stands close to the ground-state alpha-phase and is much higher than that for delta-Pu. The eta-Pu&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;Os phase has a record gamma&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;-value of 74+/-2 mJ/mol Pu K&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The enhancement is not reproduced by LDA+DMFT calculations in the &lt;i&gt;fcc&lt;/i&gt; structure, which suggests that the multiple diverse sites can be the key to the understanding of beta-Pu.",3
Flow-induced adhesion of shear-activated polymers to a substrate.,"Adhesion of polymers and proteins to substrates plays a crucial role in many technological applications and biological processes. A prominent example is the von Willebrand factor (VWF) protein, which is essential in blood clotting as it mediates adhesion of blood platelets to the site of injury at high shear rates. VWF is activated by flow and is able to bind efficiently to damaged vessel walls even under extreme flow-stress conditions; however, its adhesion is reversible when the flow strength is significantly reduced or the flow is ceased. Motivated by the properties and behavior of VWF in flow, we investigate adhesion of shear-activated polymers to a planar wall in flow and whether the adhesion is reversible under flow stasis. The main ingredients of the polymer model are cohesive inter-monomer interactions, a catch bond with the adhesive surface, and the shear activation/deactivation of polymer adhesion correlated with its stretching in flow. The cohesive interactions within the polymer maintain a globular conformation under low shear stresses and allow polymer stretching if a critical shear rate is exceeded, which is directly associated with its activation for adhesion. Our results show that polymer adhesion at high shear rates is significantly stabilized by catch bonds, while at the same time they also permit polymer dissociation from a surface at low or no flow stresses. In addition, the activation/deactivation mechanism for adhesion plays a crucial role in the reversibility of its adhesion. These observations help us better understand the adhesive behavior of VWF in flow and interpret its adhesion malfunctioning in VWF-related diseases.",3
The effects of ion adsorption on the potential of zero charge and the differential capacitance of charged aqueous interfaces.,"Using a box profile approximation for the non-electrostatic surface adsorption potentials of anions and cations, we calculate the differential capacitance of aqueous electrolyte interfaces from a numerical solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, including steric interactions between the ions and an inhomogeneous dielectric profile. Preferential adsorption of the positive (negative) ion shifts the minimum of the differential capacitance to positive (negative) surface potential values. The trends are similar for the potential of zero charge; however, the potential of zero charge does not correspond to the minimum of the differential capacitance in the case of asymmetric ion adsorption, contrary to the assumption commonly used to determine the potential of zero charge. Our model can be used to obtain more accurate estimates of ion adsorption properties from differential capacitance or electrocapillary measurements. Asymmetric ion adsorption also affects the relative heights of the characteristic maxima in the differential capacitance curves as a function of the surface potential, but even for strong adsorption potentials the effect is small, making it difficult to reliably determine the adsorption properties from the peak heights.",3
Magnetic and structural depth profiles of Heusler alloy Co<sub>2</sub>FeAl<sub>0.5</sub>Si<sub>0.5</sub> epitaxial films on Si(111).,"The depth-resolved chemical structure and magnetic moment of Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;FeAl&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub& gt; thin films grown on Si(111) have been determined using x-ray and polarized neutron reflectometry. Bulk-like magnetization is retained across the majority of the film, but reduced moments are observed within 45 A of the surface and in a 25 A substrate interface region. The reduced moment is related to with compositional changes due to oxidation and diffusion, which are further quantified by elemental profiling using electron microscopy with electron energy loss spectroscopy. The accuracy of structural and magnetic depth-profiles obtained from simultaneous modeling is discussed using different approaches with different degree of constraints on the parameters. Our approach illustrates the challenges in fitting reflectometry data from these multi-component quaternary Heusler alloy thin films.",3
Electron localisation in static and time-dependent one-dimensional model systems.,"The most direct signature of electron localisation is the tendency of an electron in a many-body system to exclude other same-spin electrons from its vicinity. By applying this concept directly to the exact many-body wavefunction, we find that localisation can vary considerably between different ground-state systems, and can also be strongly disrupted, as a function of time, when a system is driven by an applied electric field. We use this measure to assess the well-known electron localisation function (ELF), both in its approximate single-particle form (often applied within density-functional theory) and its full many-particle form. The full ELF always gives an excellent description of localisation, but the approximate ELF fails in time-dependent situations, even when the exact Kohn-Sham orbitals are employed.",3
Thermionic cooling devices based on resonant-tunneling AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructure.,"We study by means of full quantum simulations the operating principle and performance of a semiconductor heterostructure refrigerator combining resonant tunneling filtering and thermionic emission. Our model takes into account the coupling between the electric and thermal currents by self-consistently solving the transport equations within the non-equilibrium Green's function framework and the heat equation. We show that the device can achieve relatively high cooling power values, while in the considered implementation, the maximum lattice temperature drop is severely limited by the thermal conductivity of the constituting materials. In such an out-of-equilibrium structure, we then emphasize the significant deviation of the phonon temperature from its electronic counterpart which can vary over several hundred Kelvin. The interplay between those two temperatures and the impact on the electrochemical potential is also discussed. Finally, viable options toward an optimization of the device are proposed.",3
Magnitude of the Current in Two-Dimensional Interlayer Tunneling Devices.,"Using the Bardeen tunneling method with first-principles wave functions, computations are made of the tunneling current in graphene / hexagonal-boron-nitride / graphene (G/h-BN/G) vertical structures. Detailed comparison with prior experimental results is made, focusing on the magnitude of the achievable tunnel current. With inclusion of the effects of translational and rotational misalignment of the graphene and the h-BN, predicted currents are found to be about 15x larger than experimental values. A reduction in this discrepancy, to a factor of 2.5x, is achieved by utilizing a realistic size for the band gap of the h-BN, hence affecting the exponential decay constant for the tunneling.",3
Monolayer CS as a metal-free photocatalyst with high carrier mobility and tunable band structure: a first-principles study.,"Producing hydrogen fuel using suitable photocatalysts from water splitting is a feasible method to harvest solar energy. A desired photocatalyst is expected to have suitable band gap, moderate band edge position, and high carrier mobility. By employing first-principles calculations, we explore a alpha-CS monolayer as a metal-free efficient photocatalyst. The alpha-CS monolayer shows good energetic, dynamic, and thermal stabilities and is insoluble in water, suggesting its experimental practicability. Monolayer and bilayer alpha-CS present not only appropriate band gaps for visible and ultraviolet light absorption but also moderate band alignments with water redox potentials in pH neutral water. Remarkably, the alpha-CS monolayer exhibits high (up to 8453.19 cm(2) V(-1)s(-1) for hole) and anisotropic carrier mobility, which is favorable to the migration and separation of photogenerated carriers. In addition, monolayer alpha-CS experiences an interesting semiconductor-metal transition by applying uniaxial strain and external electric field. Moreover, alpha-CS under certain strain and electric field is still dynamically stable with the absence of imaginary frequencies. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the graphite (0 0 1) surface is a potential substrate for the alpha-CS growth with the intrinsic properties of alpha-CS maintaining. Therefore, our results could pave the way for the application of alpha-CS as a promising photocatalyst.",3
Frequency-domain modelling of gain in pump-probe experiment by an inhomogeneous medium.,"Introduction of a gain medium in lossy plasmonic metamaterials reduces and compensates losses or even amplifies an incident light often with nonlinear optical effect. Here, optical gain in a pump-probe experimental setup is effectively calculated in the frequency-domain by approximating a gain material as an inhomogeneous medium. Spatially varying local field amplitudes of the pump and probe beams are included in the model to reproduce the inhomogeneous gain effect, in which population inversion occurs most strongly near the surface and decays along the propagation direction. We demonstrate that transmission spectra calculated by this method agree well with finite-difference time-domain simulation results. This simplified approach of gain modelling offers an easy and reliable way to analyze wave propagation in a gain medium without nonlinear time-domain calculation.",3
Nonperturbative theory of atom-surface interaction: corrections at short separations.,"The nonperturbative expressions for the free energy and force of interaction between a ground-state atom and a real-material surface at any temperature are presented. The transition to the Matsubara representation is performed, whereupon the comparison is made with the commonly used perturbative results based on the standard Lifshitz theory. It is shown that the Lifshitz formulas for the free energy and force of an atom-surface interaction follow from the nonperturbative ones in the lowest order of the small parameter. Numerical computations of the free energy and force for the atoms of He[Formula: see text] and Na interacting with a surface of an Au plate have been performed using the frequency-dependent dielectric permittivity of Au and highly accurate dynamic atomic polarizabilities in the framework of both the nonperturbative and perturbative theories. According to our results, the maximum deviations between the two theories are reached at the shortest atom-surface separations of about 1 nm. Simple analytic expressions for the atom-surface free energy are derived in the classical limit and for an ideal-metal plane. In the lowest order of the small parameter, they are found in agreement with the perturbative ones following from the standard Lifshitz theory. Possible applications of the obtained results in the theory of van der Waals adsorption are discussed.",3
Accelerating the discovery of hidden two-dimensional magnets using machine learning and first principle calculations.,"Two-dimensional (2D) magnets are explored in terms of data science and first principle calculations. Machine learning determines four descriptors for predicting the magnetic moments of 2D materials within reported 216 2D materials data. With the trained machine, 254 2D materials are predicted to have high magnetic moments. First principle calculations are performed to evaluate the predicted 254 2D materials where eight undiscovered stable 2D materials with high magnetic moments are revealed. The approach taken in this work indicates that undiscovered materials can be surfaced by utilizing data science and materials data, leading to an innovative way of discovering hidden materials.",3
Room temperature synthesis of ReS<sub>2</sub> through aqueous perrhenate sulfidation.,"In this study, a direct sulfidation reaction of ammonium perrhenate (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;ReO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) leading to a synthesis of rhenium disulfide (ReS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is demonstrated. These finding reveal the first example of a simplistic bottom-up approach to the chemical synthesis of crystalline ReS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The reaction presented here takes place at room temperature, in an ambient and solvent-free environment and without the necessity of a catalyst. The atomic composition and structure of the as-synthesized product were characterized using several analysis techniques including energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scannig calorimetry (DSC). The results indicated the formation of a lower symmetry (1T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;) ReS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with a low degree of layer stacking.",3
Spatial and thickness dependence of coupling interaction of surface states and influence on transport and optical properties of few-layer Bi2Se3.,"Coupling interaction between the bottom and top surface electronic states and the influence on transport and optical properties of Bi2Se3 thin films with 1-8 quintuple layers (QLs) have been investigated by first principles calculations. Obvious spatial and thickness dependences of coupling interaction are found by analyzing hybridization of two surface states. In the thin film with a certain thickness, from the outer to inner atomic layers, the coupling interaction exhibits an increasing trend. On the other hand, as thickness increases, the coupling interaction shows a disproportionate decrease trend. Moreover, the system with 3 QLs exhibits stronger interaction than that with 2 QLs. The presence of coupling interaction would suppress destructive interference of surface states and enhance resistance in various degrees. In view of the inversely proportional relation to transport channel width, the resistance of thin films should show disproportionate thickness dependence. This prediction is qualitatively consistent with the transport measurements at low temperature. Furthermore, the optical properties also exhibit obvious thickness dependence. Especially as the thickness increases, the coupling interaction results in red and blue shifts of the multiple-peak structures in low and high energy regions of imaginary dielectric function, respectively. The red shift trend is in agreement with the recent experimental observation and the blue shift is firstly predicted by the present calculation. The present results give a concrete understanding of transport and optical properties in devices based on Bi2Se3 thin films with few QLs.",3
Optoelectronic fi gure of merit of a metal nanoparticle - quantum dot (MNP-QD) hybrid molecule for assessing its suitability for sensing applications.,"Recently, many have studied various con fi gurations of metal nanoparticle-quantum dot (MNP-QD) hybrid molecules based on di ff erent metals and tunable parameters. In this paper, we aim to incite the interest in using MNP-QD nanohybrids, which possess sensing capabilities superior to those of the individual constituents, for sensing applications that rely on scattered light. When assessing whether a given MNP-QD con fi guration is suited for an application, sometimes it is hard to assess the pros and cons of a given con fi guration against other candidates. Here we propose a simple, elegant relative fi gure of merit (RFoM), which focuses on maximizing the scattered intensity and the refractive index sensitivity of the nanohybrid, to rank the suitability of viable MNP-QD con fi gurations for a particular sensing application. We use the proposed RFoM to analyse the optical spectra of noble, transition, post transition and alkali metal based MNP-QD nanohybrids using the representative metals Au, Ag, Cu, Al and Na, adopting a generalized nonlocal optical response (GNOR) method based cavity QED approach. Based on our observations, we suggest how the usage of MNP-QD nanohybrids could improve the conventionally studied tumour targeting applications. Moreover, we propose potential substitutes for noble metals conventionally considered for MNP-QD nanohybrids.",3
An eigenvalue approach to quantum plasmonics based on a self-consistent hydrodynamics method.,"Plasmonics has attracted much attention not only because it has useful properties such as strong field enhancement, but also because it reveals the quantum nature of matter. To handle quantum plasmonics effects, ab initio packages or empirical Feibelman d-parameters have been used to explore the quantum correction of plasmonic resonances. However, most of these methods are formulated within the quasi-static framework. The self-consistent hydrodynamics model offers a reliable approach to study quantum plasmonics because it can incorporate the quantum effect of the electron gas into classical electrodynamics in a consistent manner. Instead of the standard scattering method, we formulate the self-consistent hydrodynamics method as an eigenvalue problem to study quantum plasmonics with electrons and photons treated on the same footing. We find that the eigenvalue approach must involve a global operator, which originates from the energy functional of the electron gas. This manifests the intrinsic nonlocality of the response of quantum plasmonic resonances. Our model gives the analytical forms of quantum corrections to plasmonic modes, incorporating quantum electron spill-out effects and electrodynamical retardation. We apply our method to study the quantum surface plasmon polariton for a single flat interface.",3
From amorphous to nanocrystalline: the effect of nanograins in an amorphous matrix on the thermal conductivity of hot-wire chemical-vapor deposited silicon films.,"We have measured the thermal conductivity of amorphous and nanocrystalline silicon films with varying crystalline content from 85 K to room temperature. The films were prepared by the hot-wire chemical-vapor deposition, where the crystalline volume fraction is determined by the hydrogen (H2) dilution ratio to the processing silane gas (SiH4), R = H2/SiH4. We varied R from 1 to 10, where the films transform from amorphous for R < 3 to mostly nanocrystalline for larger R. Structural analyses show that the nanograins, averaging from 2 to 9 nm in sizes with increasing R, are dispersed in the amorphous matrix. The crystalline volume fraction increases from 0 to 65% as R increases from 1 to 10. The thermal conductivities of the two amorphous silicon films are similar and consistent with the most previous reports with thicknesses no larger than a few mum deposited by a variety of techniques. The thermal conductivities of the three nanocrystalline silicon films are also similar, but are about 50-70% higher than those of their amorphous counterparts. The heat conduction in nanocrystalline silicon films can be understood as the combined contribution in both amorphous and nanocrystalline phases, where increased conduction through improved nanocrystalline percolation path outweighs increased interface scattering between silicon nanocrystals and the amorphous matrix.",3
Electronic Structure of Fe<sub>1.08</sub>Te bulk crystals and epitaxial FeTe thin films on Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>.,"The electronic structure of thin films of FeTe grown on Bi$_2$Te$_3$ is investigated using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy and first principles calculations. As a comparison, data from cleaved bulk \FeTe taken under the same experimental conditions is also presented. Due to the substrate and thin film symmetry, FeTe thin films grow on Bi$_2$Te$_3$ in three domains, rotated by 0$^{\circ}$, 120$^{\circ}$, and 240$^{\circ}$. This results in a superposition of photoemission intensity from the domains, complicating the analysis. However, by combining bulk and thin film data, it is possible to partly disentangle the contributions from three domains. We find a close similarity between thin film and bulk electronic structure and an overall good agreement with first principles calculations, assuming a p-doping shift of 65~meV for the bulk and a renormalization factor of around 2. By tracking the change of substrate electronic structure upon film growth, we find indications of an electron transfer from the FeTe film to the substrate. No significant change of the film's electronic structure or doping is observed when alkali atoms are dosed onto the surface. This is ascribed to the film's high density of states at the Fermi energy. This behavior is also supported by the ab-initio calculations.",3
Norovirus-like VP1 particles exhibit isolate dependent stability profiles.,"Noroviruses are the main cause of viral gastroenteritis with new variants emerging frequently. There are three norovirus genogroups infecting humans. These genogroups are divided based on the sequence of their major capsid protein, which is able to form virus-like particles (VLPs) when expressed recombinantly. VLPs of the prototypical GI.1 Norwalk virus are known to disassemble into specific capsid protein oligomers upon alkaline treatment. Here, native mass spectrometry and electron microscopy on variants of GI.1 and of GII.17 were performed, revealing differences in terms of stability between these groups. Beyond that, these experiments indicate differences even between variants within a genotype. The capsid stability was monitored in different ammonium acetate solutions varying both in ionic strength and pH. The investigated GI.1 West Chester isolate showed comparable disassembly profiles to the previously studied GI.1 Norwalk virus isolate. However, differences were observed with the West Chester being more sensitive to alkaline pH. In stark contrast to that, capsids of the variant belonging to the currently prevalent genogroup GII were stable in all tested conditions. Both variants formed smaller capsid particles already at neutral pH. Certain amino acid substitutions in the S domain of West Chester relative to the Norwalk virus potentially result in the formation of these T = 1 capsids.",3
Pressure-induced structural change in liquid GeI4.,"The similarity in the shape of the melting curve of GeI4 to that of SnI4 suggests that a liquid-liquid transition as observed in liquid SnI4 is also expected to occur in liquid GeI4. Because the slope of the melting curve of GeI4 abruptly changes at around 3 GPa, in situ synchrotron diffraction measurements were conducted to examine closely the structural changes upon compression at around 3 GPa. The reduced radial distribution functions of the high- and low-pressure liquid states of GeI4 share the same feature inherent in the high-pressure (high-density) and low-pressure (low-density) radial distribution functions of liquid SnI4. This feature allows us to introduce local order parameters that we may use to observe the transition. Unlike the transition in liquid SnI4, the transition from the low-pressure to the high-pressure structure seems sluggish. We speculate that the liquid-liquid critical point of GeI4 is no longer a thermodynamically stable state and is slightly located below the melting curve. As a result, the structural change is said to be a crossover rather than a transition. The behavior of the local-order parameters implies a metastable extension of the liquid-liquid phase boundary with a negative slope.",3
Flory-type theories of polymer chains under different external stimuli.,"In this Review, we present a critical analysis of various applications of the Flory-type theories to a theoretical description of the conformational behavior of single polymer chains in dilute polymer solutions under a few external stimuli. Different theoretical models of flexible polymer chains in the supercritical fluid are discussed and analysed. Different points of view on the conformational behavior of the polymer chain near the liquid-gas transition critical point of the solvent are presented. A theoretical description of the co-solvent-induced coil-globule transitions within the implicit-solvent-explicit-co-solvent models is discussed. Several explicit-solvent-explicit-co-solvent theoretical models of the coil-to-globule-to-coil transition of the polymer chain in a mixture of good solvents (co-nonsolvency) are analysed and compared with each other. Finally, a new theoretical model of the conformational behavior of the dielectric polymer chain under the external constant electric field in the dilute polymer solution with an explicit account for the many-body dipole correlations is discussed. The polymer chain collapse induced by many-body dipole correlations of monomers in the context of statistical thermodynamics of dielectric polymers is analysed.",3
Static structure of active Brownian hard disks.,"We explore the changes in static structure of a two-dimensional system of active Brownian particles (ABP) with hard-disk interactions, using event-driven Brownian dynamics simulations. In particular, the effect of the self-propulsion velocity and the rotational diffusivity on the orientationally-averaged fluid structure factor is discussed. Typically activity increases structural ordering and generates a structure factor peak at zero wave vector which is a precursor of motility-induced phase separation. Our results provide reference data to test future statistical theories for the fluid structure of active Brownian systems. This manuscript was submitted for the special issue of the Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter associated with the Liquid Matter Conference 2017.",3
Underscreening in ionic liquids: a first principles analysis.,"An attempt is made to understand the underscreening effect, observed in concentrated electrolyte solutions or melts, on the basis of simple, admittedly crude models involving charged (for the ions) and neutral (for the solvent molecules) hard spheres. The thermodynamic and structural properties of these 'primitive' and 'semi-primitive' models are calculated within mean spherical approximation, which provides the basic input required to determine the partial density response functions. The screening length [Formula: see text], which is unambiguously defined in terms of the wave-number-dependent response functions, exhibits a cross-over from a low density, Debye-like regime, to a regime where [Formula: see text] increases with density beyond a critical density at which the Debye length [Formula: see text] becomes comparable to the ion diameter. In this high density regime the ratio [Formula: see text] increases according to a power law, in qualitative agreement with experimental measurements, albeit at a much slower rate.",3
Negative thermal expansion in the superconducting precursor phase SmFeAsO.,"The fluorine-doped rare-earth iron oxypnictide series SmFeAsO&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; (0 </= x </= 0.10) was investigated with high resolution powder x-ray scattering. In agreement with previous studies, the parent compound SmFeAsO exhibits a tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural distortion at T&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;= 130 K which is rapidly suppressed by x approximately 0.10 deep within the superconducting dome. The change in unit cell symmetry is followed by a previously unreported magnetoelastic distortion at 120 K. The temperature dependence of the thermal expansion coefficient alpha&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; reveals a rich phase diagram for SmFeAsO: (i) a global minimum at 125 K corresponds to the opening of a spin-density wave instability as measured by pump-probe femtosecond spectroscopy whilst (ii) a global maximum at 110 K corresponds to magnetic ordering of the Sm and Fe sublattices as measured by magnetic x-ray scattering. At much lower temperatures than T&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;, SmFeAsO exhibits a significant negative thermal expansion on the order of -20 ppm.K&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in contrast to the behavior of other rare-earth oxypnictides such as PrFeAsO and the actinide oxypnictide NpFeAsO where the onset of alpha &lt; 0 only appears in the vicinity of magnetic ordering. Correlating this feature with the temperature and doping dependence of the resistivity and the unit cell parameters, we interpret this result as being due to the condensation of itinerant electrons caused by the opening of a SDW gap, consistent with transport measurements.",3
Spin dynamics of FeGa3-x Ge x studied by electron spin resonance.,"The intermetallic semiconductor FeGa3 acquires itinerant ferromagnetism upon electron doping by a partial replacement of Ga with Ge. We studied the electron spin resonance (ESR) of high-quality single crystals of FeGa3-x Ge x for x from 0 up to 0.162 where ferromagnetic order is observed. For x = 0 we observed a well-defined ESR signal, indicating the presence of pre-formed magnetic moments in the semiconducting phase. Upon Ge doping the occurrence of itinerant magnetism clearly affects the ESR properties below approximately 40 K, whereas at higher temperatures an ESR signal as seen in FeGa3 prevails independent on the Ge content. The present results show that the ESR of FeGa3-x Ge x is an appropriate and direct tool to investigate the evolution of 3d-based itinerant magnetism.",3
Stillinger-Weber potential for elastic and fracture properties in graphene and carbon nanotubes.,"This paper presents a new framework for determining the Stillinger-Weber (SW) potential parameters for modeling fracture in graphene and carbon nanotubes. In addition to fitting the equilibrium material properties, the approach allows fitting the potential to the forcing behavior as well as the mechanical strength of the solid, without requiring ad hoc modification of the nearest-neighbor interactions for avoiding artificial stiffening of the lattice at larger deformation. Consistent with the first-principles results, the potential shows the Young's modulus of graphene to be isotropic under symmetry-preserving and symmetry-breaking deformation conditions. It also shows the Young's modulus of carbon nanotubes to be diameter-dependent under symmetry-breaking loading conditions. The potential addresses the key deficiency of existing empirical potentials in reproducing experimentally observed glass-like brittle fracture in graphene and carbon nanotubes. In simulating the entire deformation process leading to fracture, the SW-potential costs several factors less computational time compared to the state-of-the-art interatomic potentials that enables exploration of the fracture processes in large atomistic systems which are inaccessible otherwise.",3
Evidence for nodal superconductivity in a layered compound Ta<sub>4</sub>Pd<sub>3</sub>Te<sub>16</sub>.,"We report an investigation of the London penetration depth Deltalambda(T) on single crystals of the layered superconductor Ta&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Pd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;, where the crystal structure has quasi-one-dimensional characteristics. A linear temperature dependence of Deltalambda(T) is observed for T&lt;&lt; T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, in contrast to the exponential behavior of fully gapped superconductors. This indicates the existence of line nodes in the superconducting energy gap. A detailed analysis shows that the normalized superfluid density rho&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;(T), which is converted from Deltalambda(T), can be well described by a multigap scenario, with nodes in one of the superconducting gaps, providing clear evidence for nodal superconductivity in Ta&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Pd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;.",3
Magnetic and structural changes in LaCo0.9Mn0.1O3 at high pressure.,"The structural and magnetic properties of LaCo0.9Mn0.1O3 have been studied as a function of pressure by neutron powder diffraction and DC magnetometry. The material is confirmed to exhibit rhombohedral R [Formula: see text] c symmetry between ambient pressure and 6 GPa. We have determined the bulk modulus B 0 of the sample using a second-order Birch-Murnaghan equation of state which yielded: B 0 = 140(9) GPa and V [Formula: see text]. We report a non-linear increase of the Curie temperature T C from an ambient pressure value of 224.7 K to approximately 236 K at a pressure of 4 GPa. Finally, we confirm the glassy-like nature of the magnetism in LaCo0.9Mn0.1O3, which is maintained throughout the pressure range explored.",3
Superconducting Properties and muSR Study of the Noncentrosymmetric Superconductor Nb<sub>0.5</sub>Os<sub>0.5</sub>.,"The properties of the noncentrosymmetric superconductor ($\alpha$-$\textit{Mn}$ structure) Nb$_{0.5}$Os$_{0.5}$ is investigated using resistivity, magnetization, specific heat, and muon spin relaxation and rotation ($\mu$SR) measurements. These measurements suggest that Nb$_{0.5}$Os$_{0.5}$ is a weakly coupled ($\lambda_{e-ph}$ $\sim$ 0.53) type-II superconductor ($\kappa_{GL}$ $\approx$ 61) having a bulk superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ = 3.07 K. The specific heat data in the superconductive regime fits well with the single-gap BCS model indicating nodeless s-wave superconductivity in Nb$_{0.5}$Os$_{0.5}$. The $\mu$SR measurements also confirm $\textit{s}$-wave superconductivity with the preserved time-reversal symmetry.",3
Polymer architecture of magnetic gels: a review.,"In this review article, we provide an introduction to ferrogels, i.e. polymeric gels with embedded magnetic particles. Due to the interplay between magnetic and elastic properties of these materials, they are promising candidates for engineering and biomedical applications such as actuation and controlled drug release. Particular emphasis will be put on the polymer architecture of magnetic gels since it controls the degrees of freedom of the magnetic particles in the gel, and it is important for the particle-polymer coupling determining the mechanisms available for the gel deformation in magnetic fields. We report on the different polymer architectures that have been realized so far, and provide an overview of synthesis strategies and experimental techniques for the characterization of these materials. We further focus on theoretical and simulational studies carried out on magnetic gels, and highlight their contributions towards understanding the influence of the gels' polymer architecture.",3
Phonon-driven electron scattering and magnetothermoelectric effect in two-dimensional tin selenide.,"The bulk tin selenide (SnSe) is the best thermoelectric material currently with the highest figure-of-merit due to strong phonon-phonon interactions. We investigate the effect of electron-phonon coupling (EPC) on the transport properties of a two-dimensional (2D) SnSe sheet. We demonstrate that EPC plays a key role in the scattering rate when the constant relaxation time approximation is deficient. The EPC strength is especially large in contrast to that of pristine graphene. The scattering rate depends sensitively on the system temperatures and the carrier densities when the Fermi energy approaches the band edge. We also investigate the magnetothermoelectric effect of the 2D SnSe. It is found that at low temperatures there is enormous magnetoelectrical resistivity and magnetothermal resistivity above 200%, suggesting possible potential applications in device design. Our results agree qualitatively well with the experimental data.",3
Fe and Co NMR studies of magnetoelectric Co<sub>2</sub> Y-type hexaferrite BSCFAO.,"The Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; NMR spectra for Ba&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;1.7&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt ; (Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.96&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;0.04&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub &gt;O&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt; (BSCFAO) and Ba&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;1.7&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt ;Fe&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt; (BSCFO) were obtained in a zero magnetic field at a low temperature. We observed change in the enhancement effect of the NMR signals depending on the setting field, which was varied when applied along the b-axis and then turned off before the measurement was taken. The experimental results indicate that the magnetic structure changes from an alternating longitudinal cone to a transverse cone when the setting field is 250 mT. They also show that the spins of Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions together with those of Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions constitute a part of the overall magnetic structure and that the substitution of Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; for Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; weakens the magnetic anisotropy within the easy plane. From a comparison of the enhancement factors of the Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; NMR obtained with the RF pulse applied along the a-axis and the c-axis, we realized that the magnetic easy plane anisotropy is approximately 16 times greater than the anisotropy within the easy plane. No changes of the NMR spectra were observed under an electric field of 1.2 MV/m.",3
Four-point probe measurements using current probes with voltage feedback to measure electric potentials.,"We present a four-point probe resistance measurement technique which uses four equivalent current measuring units, resulting in minimal hardware requirements and corresponding sources of noise. Local sample potentials are measured by a software feedback loop which adjusts the corresponding tip voltage such that no current flows to the sample. The resulting tip voltage is then equivalent to the sample potential at the tip position. We implement this measurement method into a multi-tip scanning tunneling microscope setup such that potentials can also be measured in tunneling contact, allowing in principle truly non-invasive four-probe measurements. The resulting measurement capabilities are demonstrated for [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] samples.",3
Role of special cross-links in structure formation of bacterial DNA polymer.,"Using data from contact maps of the DNA-polymer of Escherichia coli (E. Coli) (at kilobase pair resolution) as an input to our model, we introduce cross-links between monomers in a bead-spring model of a ring polymer at very specific points along the chain. Via suitable Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the presence of these cross-links leads to a particular organization of the chain at large (micron) length scales of the DNA. We also investigate the structure of a ring polymer with an equal number of cross-links at random positions along the chain. We find that though the polymer does get organized at the large length scales, the nature of the organization is quite different from the organization observed with cross-links at specific biologically determined positions. We used the contact map of E. Coli bacteria which has around 4.6 million base pairs in a single circular chromosome. In our coarse-grained flexible ring polymer model, we used 4642 monomer beads and observed that around 80 cross-links are enough to induce the large-scale organization of the molecule accounting for statistical fluctuations caused by thermal energy. The length of a DNA chain even of a simple bacterial cell such as E. Coli is much longer than typical proteins, hence we avoided methods used to tackle protein folding problems. We define new suitable quantities to identify the large scale structure of a polymer chain with a few cross-links.",3
Contrasting properties of hydrogenated and protonated single-layer h-BN from first-principles.,"Hydrogenation is an efficient approach to tune the electronic, magnetic and chemical properties of single-layer hexagon boron nitride (h-BN). The relative stabilities and electronic properties of hydrogenated and protonated h-BN sheets are studied by means of density functional theory calculations. H and [Formula: see text] show very contrasting behaviors in chemisorption and clustering on h-BN, in which a single H atom prefers to adsorb on the top site of the boron (B) atom, and more H atoms tend to cluster on both sides of the h-BN layers in an alternating manner; while single [Formula: see text] prefers to stay on the nitrogen (N) atom, and protons are more likely to separate from each other on h-BN. The collective [Formula: see text] bonding feature of H-decorated h-BN lattice plays a key role in stabilizing the H clusters on the h-BN sheet. The non-magnetic H clusters with an even number of H atoms ([Formula: see text]) are energetically favored, compared with those with odd [Formula: see text]. Both the binding energy and band gap width vary in an oscillatory way as a function of [Formula: see text].",3
Theoretical study of nitride short period superlattices.,"Discussion of band gap behavior based on first principles calculations of electronic band structures for various short period nitride superlattices is presented. Binary superlattices, as InN/GaN and GaN/AlN as well as superlattices containing alloys, as InGaN/GaN, GaN/AlGaN, and GaN/InAlN are considered. Taking into account different crystallographic directions of growth (polar, semipolar and nonpolar) and different strain conditions (free-standing and pseudomorphic) all the factors influencing the band gap engineering are analyzed. Dependence on internal strain and lattice geometry is considered, but the main attention is devoted to the influence of the internal electric field and the hybridization of well and barrier wave functions. The contributions of these two important factors to band gap behavior are illustrated and estimated quantitatively. It appears that there are two interesting ranges of layer thicknesses; in one (few atomic monolayers in barriers and wells) the influence of the wave function hybridization is dominant, whereas in the other (layers thicker than roughly five to six monolayers) dependence of electric field on the band gaps is more important. The band gap behavior in superlattices is compared with the band gap dependence on composition in the corresponding ternary and quaternary alloys. It is shown that for superlattices it is possible to exceed by far the range of band gap values, which can be realized in ternary alloys. The calculated values of the band gaps are compared with the photoluminescence emission energies, when the corresponding data are available. Finally, similarities and differences between nitride and oxide polar superlattices are pointed out by comparison of wurtzite GaN/AlN and ZnO/MgO.",3
Compressive yield stress of depletion gels from stationary centrifugation profiles.,"We have investigated the stationary sedimentation profiles of colloidal gels obtained by an arrested phase-separation process driven by depletion forces, which have been compressed either by natural gravity or by a centrifugal acceleration ranging between 6g and 2300g. Our measurements show that the gel rheological properties display a drastic change when the gel particle volume fraction exceeds a value [Formula: see text], which barely depends on the strength of the interparticle attractive forces that consolidate the network. In particular, the gel compressive yield stress [Formula: see text], which increases as [Formula: see text] for [Formula: see text], displays a diverging behaviour for [Formula: see text], with an asymptotic value that is close to the random close packing value for hard spheres. The evidence we obtained suggests that [Formula: see text] basically coincides with the liquid (colloid-rich) branch of the metastable coexistence curve, rather than with the lower (and varphi-dependent) values expected for an attractive glass line penetrating inside the coexistence region.",3
"Adsorption of H2, O2, H2O, OH and H on monolayer MoS2.","Hydrogen and hydrogen-containing gases are commonly used as reductants in chemical vapor deposition growth of MoS2. Here, we consider the defects resulting from the presence of hydrogen during growth and the resulting electronically active defects. In particular, we find that the interstitial hydrogen defect is a negative-U center with amphoteric donor and acceptor properties. Additionally, we consider the effects of interaction with water and oxygen. The defects are analysed using density functional theory calculations.",3
Pressure-induced metallization in layered ReSe2.,"The evolution of the crystal structure and electrical transport properties of distorted layered transition metal dichalcogenide ReSe2 was studied under high pressure up to ~90 GPa by Raman spectroscopy and electrical resistivity measurements accompanied by ab initio electronic band structure calculations. Raman spectroscopy studies indicate an isostructural phase transition due to layer sliding at ~7 GPa, to the distorted 1T-phase which remains stable up to the highest pressures employed in these experiments. From a direct band gap semiconductor at ambient pressure, ReSe2 undergoes pressure-induced metallization at pressures ~35 GPa, in agreement with the ab initio calculations. Resistivity measurements performed with different loading conditions reveal the possible emergence of superconductivity, which is most likely not an intrinsic property of ReSe2, but is rather conditioned by internal stresses upon compression.",3
Boundary states in the chiral symmetric systems with a spatial symmetry.,"We study topological systems with both a chiral and a spatial symmetry which result in an additional spatial chiral symmetry. We distinguish the topologically nontrivial states according to the chiral symmetries protecting them and study several models in 1D and 3D systems. The perturbations breaking the spatial symmetry can break only one of the two chiral symmetries while the perturbations preserving the spatial symmetry always break or preserve both of them. In 3D systems, besides the 3D symmetries, the topologically nontrivial boundary modes may also be protected by the hidden lower dimensional symmetries. We then figure out the corresponding topological invariants and connect them with the 3D invariants.",3
Hydrodynamics of electrons in graphene.,"Generic interacting many-body quantum systems are believed to behave as classical fluids on long time and length scales. Due to rapid progress in growing exceptionally pure crystals, we are now able to experimentally observe this collective motion of electrons in solid-state systems, including graphene. We present a review of recent progress in understanding the hydrodynamic limit of electronic motion in graphene, written for physicists from diverse communities. We begin by discussing the 'phase diagram' of graphene, and the inevitable presence of impurities and phonons in experimental systems. We derive hydrodynamics, both from a phenomenological perspective and using kinetic theory. We then describe how hydrodynamic electron flow is visible in electronic transport measurements. Although we focus on graphene in this review, the broader framework naturally generalizes to other materials. We assume only basic knowledge of condensed matter physics, and no prior knowledge of hydrodynamics.",3
Static response of deformable microchannels: a comparative modelling study.,"We present a comparative modelling study of fluid-structure interactions in microchannels. Through a mathematical analysis based on plate theory and the lubrication approximation for low-Reynolds-number flow, we derive models for the flow rate-pressure drop relation for long shallow microchannels with both thin and thick deformable top walls. These relations are tested against full three-dimensional two-way-coupled fluid-structure interaction simulations. Three types of microchannels, representing different elasticity regimes and having been experimentally characterized previously, are chosen as benchmarks for our theory and simulations. Good agreement is found in most cases for the predicted, simulated and measured flow rate-pressure drop relationships. The numerical simulations performed allow us to also carefully examine the deformation profile of the top wall of the microchannel in any cross section, showing good agreement with the theory. Specifically, the prediction that span-wise displacement in a long shallow microchannel decouples from the flow-wise deformation is confirmed, and the predicted scaling of the maximum displacement with the hydrodynamic pressure and the various material and geometric parameters is validated.",3
Charge transfer in (PbSe)1+delta (NbSe2)2 and (SnSe)1+delta (NbSe2)2 ferecrystals investigated by photoelectron spectroscopy.,"Rotationally disordered, layered (PbSe)[Formula: see text](NbSe2)2 and (SnSe)[Formula: see text](NbSe2)2 ferecrystal heterostructures, consisting of stacked two-dimensional bilayers of either PbSe or SnSe alternating with two planes of NbSe2, were synthesized from modulated elemental reactants. The electronic structure of these ternary systems was investigated using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and compared to the binary bulk compounds PbSe, SnSe and NbSe2. The Pb and Sn core level spectra show a significant shift towards lower binding energies and the peak shape becomes asymmetric in the ferecrystals, while the electronic structure of the NbSe2 layers does not change compared to the bulk. This is interpreted in terms of an interlayer interaction in the form of a charge transfer of electrons from PbSe or SnSe into the NbSe2 layers, which is supported by valence band spectra and is consistent with prior results from transport measurements.",3
"High-pressure structural and vibrational properties of monazite-type BiPO<sub>4</sub>, LaPO<sub>4</sub>, CePO<sub>4</sub>, and PrPO<sub>4</sub>.","Monazite-type BiPO4, LaPO4, CePO4, and PrPO4 have been studied under high pressure by ab initio simulations and Raman spectroscopy measurements in the pressure range of stability of the monazite structure. A good agreement between experimental and theoretical Raman-active mode frequencies and pressure coefficients has been found which has allowed us to discuss the nature of the Raman-active modes. Besides, calculations have provided us information on how the crystal structure is modified by pressure. This information has allowed us to determine the equation of state and the isothermal compressibility tensor of the four studied compounds. In addition, the information obtained on the polyhedral compressibility has been used to explain the anisotropic axial compressibility and the bulk compressibility of monazite phosphates. Finally, we have carried out a systematic discussion on the high-pressure behavior of the four studied phosphates in comparison to results of previous studies.",3
Chemotactic droplet swimmers in complex geometries.,"Chemotaxis(1) and auto-chemotaxis are key mechanisms in the dynamics of micro-organisms, e.g. in the acquisition of nutrients and in the communication between individuals, influencing the collective behaviour. However, chemical signalling and the natural environment of biological swimmers are generally complex, making them hard to access analytically. We present a well-controlled, tunable artificial model to study chemotaxis and autochemotaxis in complex geometries, using microfluidic assays of self-propelling oil droplets in an aqueous surfactant solution (Herminghaus et al 2014 Soft Matter 10 7008-22; Kruger et al 2016 Phys. Rev. Lett. 117). Droplets propel via interfacial Marangoni stresses powered by micellar solubilisation. Moreover, filled micelles act as a chemical repellent by diffusive phoretic gradient forces. We have studied these chemotactic effects in a series of microfluidic geometries, as published in Jin et al (2017 Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. 114 5089-94): first, droplets are guided along the shortest path through a maze by surfactant diffusing into the maze from the exit. Second, we let auto-chemotactic droplet swimmers pass through bifurcating microfluidic channels and record anticorrelations between the branch choices of consecutive droplets. We present an analytical Langevin model matching the experimental data. In a previously unpublished experiment, pillar arrays of variable sizes and shapes provide a convex wall interacting with the swimmer and, in the case of attachment, bending its trajectory and forcing it to revert to its own trail. We observe different behaviours based on the interplay of wall curvature and negative autochemotaxis, i.e. no attachment for highly curved interfaces, stable trapping at large pillars, and a narrow transition region where negative autochemotaxis makes the swimmers detach after a single orbit.",3
Graphene-induced band gap renormalization in polythiophene: a many-body perturbation study.,"Density functional theory and many-body perturbation theory at the G0W0 level are employed to study the electronic properties of polythiophene (PT) adsorbed on the graphene surface. Analysis of the charge density difference shows that substrate-adsorbate interaction leads to a strong physisorption and interfacial electric dipole moment formation. The electrostatic potential displays a -0.19 eV shift in the graphene work function from its initial value of 4.53 eV, as the result of the interaction. The LDA band gap of the polymer does not show any change. However, the band structure exhibits weak orbital hybridizations resulting from slight overlapping between the polymer and graphene states wave functions. The interfacial polarization effects on the band gap and levels alignment are investigated at the G0W0 level and show a notable reduction of PT band gap compared to that of the isolated chain.",3
Long range of indirect exchange interaction on the edges of MoS<sub>2</sub> flakes.,"We study the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction between two magnetic impurities connected to the edges of zigzag-terminated MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; flakes. When the impurities lie on the edges of the flake, the effective exchange interaction exhibits sizable noncollinear Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya character that competes with a strong Ising coupling. We analyze the characteristic decay exponent for doping levels inside the band gap of the infinite layer, corresponding to edge states of the flake at the Fermi level. The characteristic exponents show sub-two-dimensional (sub-2D) behavior for these band fillings, with decays much slower than quadratic. The Ising interaction has effectively one-dimensional (1D) long range, while the noncollinear component that grows for short impurity separation becomes comparable in magnitude. The resulting tunable exchange interaction on these systems opens the way for the study of interesting phases of impurity arrays with long-range stable helical order.",3
Mechanisms of optical orientation of an individual Mn<sup>2+</sup> ion spin in a II-VI quantum dot.,"We provide a theoretical description of the optical orientation of a single Mn$^{2+}$ ion spin under quasi-resonant excitation demonstrated experimentally by Goryca \textit{et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{103}, 087401 (2009)]. We build and analyze a hierarchy of models by starting with the simplest assumptions (transfer of perfectly spin-polarized excitons from Mn-free dot to the other dot containing a single Mn$^{2+}$ spin, followed by radiative recombination) and subsequently adding more features, such as spin relaxation of electrons and holes. Particular attention is paid to the role of the influx of the dark excitons and the process of biexciton formation, which are shown to contribute significantly to the orientation process in the quasi-resonant excitation case. Analyzed scenarios show how multiple features of the excitonic complexes in magnetically-doped quantum dots, such as the values of exchange integrals, spin relaxation times, etc., lead to a plethora of optical orientation processes, characterized by distinct dependencies on light polarization and laser intensity, and occurring on distinct timescales. Comparison with experimental data shows that the correct description of the optical orientation mechanism requires taking into account Mn$^{2+}$ spin-flip processes occurring not only when the exciton is already in the orbital ground state of the light-emitting dot, but also those that happen during the exciton transfer from high-energy states to the ground state. Inspired by the experimental results on energy relaxation of electrons and holes in nonmagnetic dots, we focus on the process of biexciton creation allowed by mutual spin-flip of an electron and the Mn$^{2+}$ spin, and we show that by including it in the model, we obtain good qualitative and quantitative agreement with the experimental data on quasi-resonantly driven Mn$^{2+}$ spin orientation.",3
"Nematicity, magnetism and superconductivity in FeSe.","Iron-based superconductors are well known for their complex interplay between structure, magnetism and superconductivity. FeSe offers a particularly fascinating example. This material has been intensely discussed because of its extended nematic phase, whose relationship with magnetism is not obvious. Superconductivity in FeSe is highly tunable, with the superconducting transition temperature, T c, ranging from 8 K in bulk single crystals at ambient pressure to almost 40 K under pressure or in intercalated systems, and to even higher temperatures in thin films. In this topical review, we present an overview of nematicity, magnetism and superconductivity, and discuss the interplay of these phases in FeSe. We focus on bulk FeSe and the effects of physical pressure and chemical substitutions as tuning parameters. The experimental results are discussed in the context of the well-studied iron-pnictide superconductors and interpretations from theoretical approaches are presented.",3
Electronic properties of topological insulator candidate CaAgAs.,"The topological phases of matter provide the opportunity to observe many exotic properties, such as the existence of 2D topological surface states in the form of Dirac cones in topological insulators and chiral transport through the open Fermi arc in Weyl semimetals. However, these properties affect the transport characteristics and, therefore, may be useful for applications only if the topological phenomena occur near the Fermi level. CaAgAs is a promising candidate for which the ab initio calculations predict line-nodes at the Fermi energy. However, the compound transforms into a topological insulator on considering spin-orbit interaction. In this study, we investigated the electronic structure of CaAgAs with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), ab initio calculations, and transport measurements. The results from ARPES show that the bulk valence band crosses the Fermi energy at the Gamma-point. The measured band dispersion matches the ab initio calculations closely when shifting the Fermi energy in the calculations by -0.5 eV. The ARPES results are in good agreement with transport measurements, which show abundant p-type carriers.",3
Detecting coupling of Majorana bound states with an Aharonov-Bohm interferometer.,"We study the transport properties of an interferometer composed by a quantum dot (QD) coupled with two normal leads and two one-dimensional topological superconductor nanowires (TNWs) hosting Majorana bound states (MBS) at their ends. The geometry considered is such that one TNW has both ends connected with the QD, forming an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) interferometer threaded by an external magnetic flux, while the other TNW is placed near the interferometer TNW. This geometry can alternatively be seen as a long wire contacted across a local defect, with possible coupling between independent-MBS. We use the Green's function formalism to calculate the conductance across normal current leads on the QD. We find that the conductance exhibits a half-quantum value regardless of the AB phase and location of the dot energy level, whenever the interferometer configuration interacts with the neighboring TNW. These findings suggest that such a geometry could be used for a sensitive detection of MBS interactions across TNWs, exploiting the high sensitivity of conductance to the AB phase in the interferometer.",3
A mean-field approach to Kondo-attractive-Hubbard model.,"With the purpose of investigating coexistence between magnetic order and superconductivity, we consider a model in which conduction electrons interact with each other, via an attractive Hubbard on-site coupling U, and with local moments on every site, via a Kondo-like coupling, J. The model is solved on a simple cubic lattice through a Hartree-Fock approximation, within a 'semi-classical' framework which allows spiral magnetic modes to be stabilized. For a fixed electronic density, n c , the small J region of the ground state (T = 0) phase diagram displays spiral antiferromagnetic (SAFM) states for small U. Upon increasing U, a state with coexistence between superconductivity (SC) and SAFM sets in; further increase in U turns the spiral mode into a Neel antiferromagnet. The large J region is a (singlet) Kondo phase. At finite temperatures, and in the region of coexistence, thermal fluctuations suppress the different ordered phases in succession: the SAFM phase at lower temperatures and SC at higher temperatures; also, reentrant behaviour is found to be induced by temperature. Our results provide a qualitative description of the competition between local moment magnetism and superconductivity in the borocarbides family.",3
Ultrafast dynamics of differently aligned COOH-DTE-BODIPY conjugates linked to the surface of TiO<sub>2</sub>.,"The photoinduced dynamics of two DTE-BODIPY conjugates A, B with carboxylic acid anchoring groups coupled to the surface of TiO2 were studied by ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. For compound A, with an orthogonal orientation of the BODIPY chromophore and the photoswitchable DTE unit, a charge separated state could not be reliably detected. Nevertheless, besides the energy transfer from the BODIPY to the closed DTE, indications for an electron transfer reaction were found by analyzing fluorescence quenching on TiO2 in steady state fluorescence measurements. For compound B with a parallel orientation of chromophore and photoswitch, a charge separated state was conclusively identified via the observation of a positive absorption signal (at lambdapr &gt; 610 nm) at later delay times. An electron transfer rate of 7 x 1010 s-1 can be extracted, indicating slower processes in the dyads in comparison to previously published electron transfer reactions of DTE compounds coupled to TiO2.",3
Pressure dependence of Ce valence in CeRhIn5.,"We have studied the Ce valence as a function of pressure in CeRhIn5 at 300 K and at 22 K using x-ray absorption spectroscopy in partial fluorescent yield mode. At room temperature, we found no detectable change in Ce valence greater than 0.01 up to a pressure of 5.5 GPa. At 22 K, the valence remains robust against pressure below 6 GPa, in contrast to the predicted valence crossover at P = 2.35 GPa. This work yields an upper limit for the change in Ce-valence and suggests that the critical valence fluctuation scenario, in its current form, is unlikely.",3
Intermediate valence state of the Sm and Eu in SmB<sub>6</sub> and EuCu<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>: neutron spectroscopy data and analysis.,"The analysis of the magnetic neutron scattering data for Sm (SmB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, Sm(Y)S) and Eu (EuCu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2-x&lt;/sub&gt;Ge&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&g t;) intermediate valence compounds has been performed in terms of generalized model of the intermediate-radius exciton. A special attention is drawn to the correlation between average ion's valence and parameters of the low energy excitation in the neutron spectra, such as resonance mode, including its magnetic form factor. Along with specific features of the intermediate valence state formation for Sm and Eu ions, common physical mechanisms have been revealed for the systems based on these elements from the middle part of the rare-earth series. The consistent description of the existing experimental data has been obtained by using a loosely bound hole concept for Eu &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;-electron shell in the intermediate valence state, in analogy with previously established loosely bound electron model for Sm ion.",3
Hydrodynamic instabilities in miscible fluids.,"Hydrodynamic instabilities in miscible fluids are ubiquitous, from natural phenomena up to geological scales, to industrial and technological applications, where they represent the only way to control and promote mixing at low Reynolds numbers, well below the transition from laminar to turbulent flow. As for immiscible fluids, the onset of hydrodynamic instabilities in miscible fluids is directly related to the physics of their interfaces. The focus of this review is therefore on the general mechanisms driving the growth of disturbances at the boundary between miscible fluids, under a variety of forcing conditions. In the absence of a regularizing mechanism, these disturbances would grow indefinitely. For immiscible fluids, interfacial tension provides such a regularizing mechanism, because of the energy cost associated to the creation of new interface by a growing disturbance. For miscible fluids, however, the very existence of interfacial stresses that mimic an effective surface tension is debated. Other mechanisms, however, may also be relevant, such as viscous dissipation. We shall review the stabilizing mechanisms that control the most common hydrodynamic instabilities, highlighting those cases for which the lack of an effective interfacial tension poses deep conceptual problems in the mathematical formulation of a linear stability analysis. Finally, we provide a short overview on the ongoing research on the effective, out of equilibrium interfacial tension between miscible fluids.",3
Electrical resistivity and wave character of free electrons in amorphous and nanoglass Sc75Fe25.,"The residual electrical resistivity of metallic amorphous alloys, rho 0, is typically in the range 50 microOmega cm < rho 0 < 310 microOmega cm corresponding to a mean free path of conduction electrons of order a few interatomic distances. In crystalline metals with low defect levels such as Cu however, the residual electrical resistivity is about rho 0 approximately 1.54 x 10(-2) microOmega cm, leading to extensive progression of free electrons through the crystalline material, of typically up to 4 x 10(6) nm. The relatively 'high' values for the electrical resistivity of distorted Sc75Fe25 alloys are discussed here within the framework of the wave character of electrons. The present investigation of amorphous and nanoglass Sc75Fe25 over the temperature range 1.9-320 K, focuses on clarification of the temperature dependence of the resistivity, rho(T). These alloys systems, which show a range of behaviours for temperature dependent resistivity-including temperature independent residual resistivity, as well as positive and negative polarities for the slope drho(T)/dT-are examined in detail.",3
Spin dynamics of FeGa<sub>3-x</sub>Ge<sub>x</sub> studied by Electron Spin Resonance.,"The intermetallic semiconductor FeGa&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; acquires itinerant ferromagnetism upon electron doping by a partial replacement of Ga with Ge. We studied the electron spin resonance (ESR) of high-quality single crystals of FeGa&lt;sub&gt;3-x&lt;/sub&gt;Ge&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; for x from 0 up to 0.162 where ferromagnetic order is observed. For x = 0 we observed a well-defined ESR signal, indicating the presence of pre-formed magnetic moments in the semiconducting phase. Upon Ge doping the occurrence of itinerant magnetism clearly affects the ESR properties below approximately 40 K whereas at higher temperatures an ESR signal as seen in FeGa&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; prevails independent on the Ge-content. The present results show that the ESR of FeGa&lt;sub&gt;3-x&lt;/sub&gt;Ge&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; is an appropriate and direct tool to investigate the evolution of 3d-based itinerant magnetism.",3
Pressure-induced structural change in liquid GeI<sub>4</sub>.,"The similarity in the shape of the melting curve of GeI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to that of SnI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; suggests that a liquid-liquid transition as observed in liquid SnI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is also expected to occur in liquid GeI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Because the slope of the melting curve of GeI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; abruptly changes at around 3 GPa, in situ synchrotron diffraction measurements were conducted to examine closely the structural changes upon compression at around 3 GPa. The reduced radial distribution functions of the high- and low-pressure liquid states of GeI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; share the same feature inherent in the high-pressure (high-density) and low-pressure (low-density) radial distribution functions of liquid SnI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. This feature allows us to introduce local order parameters that we may use to observe the transition. Unlike the transition in liquid SnI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, the transition from the low-pressure to the high-pressure structure seems sluggish. We speculate that the liquid-liquid critical point of GeI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is no longer a thermodynamically stable state and is slightly located below the melting curve. As a result, the structural change is said to be a crossover rather than a transition. The behavior of the local-order parameters implies a metastable extension of the liquid-liquid phase boundary with a negative slope.&#13.",3
Electrical conductivity of In2O3 and Ga2O3 after low temperature ion irradiation; implications for instrinsic defect formation and charge neutrality level.,"The evolution of sheet resistance of n-type In2O3 and Ga2O3 exposed to bombardment with MeV (12)C and (28)Si ions at 35 K is studied in situ. While the sheet resistance of Ga2O3 increased by more than eight orders of magnitude as a result of ion irradiation, In2O3 showed a more complex defect evolution and became more conductive when irradiated at the highest doses. Heating up to room temperature reduced the sheet resistivity somewhat, but Ga2O3 remained highly resistive, while In2O3 showed a lower resistance than as deposited samples. Thermal admittance spectroscopy and deep level transient spectroscopy did not reveal new defect levels for irradiation up to [Formula: see text] cm(-2). A model where larger defect complexes preferentially produce donor like defects in In2O3 is proposed, and may reveal a microscopic view of a charge neutrality level within the conduction band, as previously proposed.",3
The effect of RNA stiffness on the self-assembly of virus particles.,"Under many in vitro conditions, some small viruses spontaneously encapsidate a single stranded (ss) RNA into a protein shell called the capsid. While viral RNAs are found to be compact and highly branched because of long distance base-pairing between nucleotides, recent experiments reveal that in a head-to-head competition between an ssRNA with no secondary or higher order structure and a viral RNA, the capsid proteins preferentially encapsulate the linear polymer! In this paper, we study the impact of genome stiffness on the encapsidation free energy of the complex of RNA and capsid proteins. We show that an increase in effective chain stiffness because of base-pairing could be the reason why under certain conditions linear chains have an advantage over branched chains when it comes to encapsidation efficiency. While branching makes the genome more compact, RNA base-pairing increases the effective Kuhn length of the RNA molecule, which could result in an increase of the free energy of RNA confinement, that is, the work required to encapsidate RNA, and thus less efficient packaging.",3
Thermoelectric properties of periodic quantum structures in the Wigner-Rode formalism.,"Improving the thermoelectric Seebeck coefficient, while simultaneously reducing thermal conductivity, is required in order to boost thermoelectric (TE) figure of merit (ZT). A common approach to improve the Seebeck coefficient is electron filtering where 'cold' (low energy) electrons are restricted from participating in transport by an energy barrier (Kim and Lundstrom 2011 J. Appl. Phys. 110 034511, Zide et al 2010 J. Appl. Phys. 108 123702). However, the impact of electron tunneling through thin barriers and resonant states on TE properties has been given less attention, despite the widespread use of quantum wells and superlattices (SLs) in TE applications. In our work, we develop a comprehensive transport model using the Wigner-Rode formalism. We include the full electronic bandstructure and all the relevant scattering mechanisms, allowing us to simulate both energy relaxation and quantum effects from periodic potential barriers. We study the impact of barrier shape on TE performance and find that tall, sharp barriers with small period lengths lead to the largest increase in both Seebeck coefficient and conductivity, thus boosting power factor and TE efficiency. Our findings are robust against additional elastic scattering such as atomic-scale roughness at side-walls of SL nanowires.",3
Effect of drop volume and surface statistics on the superhydrophobicity of randomly rough substrates.,"In this paper, a simple theoretical approach is developed with the aim of evaluating shape, interfacial pressure, apparent contact angle and contact area of liquid drops gently deposed on randomly rough surfaces. This method can be useful to characterize the superhydrophobic properties of rough substrates, and to investigate the contact behavior of impacting drops. We assume that (i) the size of the apparent liquid-solid contact area is much larger than the micromorphology of the substrate, and (ii) a composite interface is always formed at the microscale. Results show apparent contact angle and liquid-solid area fraction are slightly influenced by the drop volume only at relatively high values of the root mean square roughness h rms, whereas the effect of volume is practically negligible at small h rms. The main statistical quantity affecting the superhydrophobic properties is found to be the Wenzel roughness parameter r W, which depends on the average slope of the surface heights. Moreover, transition from the Cassie-Baxter state to the Wenzel one is observed when r W reduces below a certain critical value, and theoretical predictions are found to be in good agreement with experimental data. Finally, the present method can be conveniently exploited to evaluate the occurrence of pinning phenomena in the case of impacting drops, as the Wenzel critical pressure for liquid penetration gives an estimation of the maximum impact pressure tolerated by the surface without pinning occurring.",3
Internal structure and swelling behaviour of in silico microgel particles.,"Microgels are soft colloids that, by virtue of their polymeric nature, can react to external stimuli such as temperature or pH by changing their size. The resulting swelling/deswelling transition can be exploited in fundamental research as well as for many diverse practical applications, ranging from art restoration to medicine. Such an extraordinary versatility stems from the complex internal structure of the individual microgels, each of which is a crosslinked polymer network. Here we employ a recently-introduced computational method to generate realistic microgel configurations and look at their structural properties, both in real and Fourier space, for several temperatures across the volume phase transition as a function of the crosslinker concentration and of the confining radius employed during the 'in-silico' synthesis. We find that the chain-length distribution of the resulting networks can be analytically predicted by a simple theoretical argument. In addition, we find that our results are well-fitted to the fuzzy-sphere model, which correctly reproduces the density profile of the microgels under study.",3
TensorCalculator: exploring the evolution of mechanical stress in the CCMV capsid.,"A new computational methodology for the accurate numerical calculation of the Cauchy stress tensor, stress invariants, principal stress components, von Mises and Tresca tensors is developed. The methodology is based on the atomic stress approach which permits the calculation of stress tensors, widely used in continuum mechanics modeling of materials properties, using the output from the MD simulations of discrete atomic and [Formula: see text]-based coarse-grained structural models of biological particles. The methodology mapped into the software package TensorCalculator was successfully applied to the empty cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) shell to explore the evolution of mechanical stress in this mechanically-tested specific example of a soft virus capsid. We found an inhomogeneous stress distribution in various portions of the CCMV structure and stress transfer from one portion of the virus structure to another, which also points to the importance of entropic effects, often ignored in finite element analysis and elastic network modeling. We formulate a criterion for elastic deformation using the first principal stress components. Furthermore, we show that von Mises and Tresca stress tensors can be used to predict the onset of a viral capsid's mechanical failure, which leads to total structural collapse. TensorCalculator can be used to study stress evolution and dynamics of defects in viral capsids and other large-size protein assemblies.",3
Temperature dependent infrared nano-imaging of La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 thin film.,"We investigate the temperature dependence of infrared properties at nanometer length scales in La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO) thin film with a thickness of 47 unit cells grown on SrTiO3 substrate. The infrared nano-imaging experiments were performed using a near-field optical microscope in conjunction with a variable temperature heating stage. The near-field infrared data is consistent with the bulk of the LSMO film undergoing the thermally-driven non-percolative second-order transition from a metallic, ferromagnetic phase to an insulating, paramagnetic phase. We find persistent infrared contrast on the nanoscale that is independent of temperature and which we attribute to two novel phases with different conductivities coexisting in the vicinity of the film-substrate interface. These two coexisting phases at the film-substrate interface do not undergo the metal-insulator transition (MIT) and hence are different from the metallic, ferromagnetic and insulating, paramagnetic phases in the bulk of the film. At temperatures approaching the nominal MIT temperature, repeated scans of the same microscopic area at constant temperature reveal bimodal fluctuation of the near-field infrared amplitude. We interpret this phenomenon as slow, critical fluctuations of the conductivity in the bulk of the LSMO film.",3
"Synthesis, structure and magnetism of the new S = 1 kagome magnet NH4Ni2.5V2O7(OH)2H2O.","Kagome antiferromagnets (KAFMs) have long been known to host exotic electronic states due to their strong geometric frustration, including the quantum spin liquid state in [Formula: see text] systems. Away from that limit, S = 1 KAFMs are also predicted to host unconventional ground states such as spin nematic phases, but a paucity of studies on known model materials has restricted progress. Here, we present the crystal structure and preliminary magnetization measurements on the newly synthesized S = 1 KAFM, NH4Ni2.5V2O7(OH)[Formula: see text]H2O, which has the three-fold symmetry of the kagome lattice but significant site depletion, with approximately [Formula: see text] site occupancy. Bulk magnetic data show clear evidence of frustration and competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions. We propose that the magnetic Hamiltonian is frustrated and that anisotropic terms cause the formation of an unconventional ground state.",3
Surface plasmon of three-dimensional Dirac semimetals.,"The surface plasmon excitation spectrum is calculated for the semi-infinite 3D Dirac semimetal. We used the random phase approximation for the calculation of the surface dielectric function, from which we derived the dynamical structure factor. The surface excitation spectrum shows a well-defined strong surface plasmon peak due to the plasmon mode in the bulk, with a noticeable influence of electron-hole excitations at large wave vectors parallel to the surface. The obtained spectrum will be useful for experimentally exploring the surface spectral properties of 3D topological Dirac semimetals.",3
Magnetic and structural changes in LaCo<sub>0.9</sub>Mn<sub>0.1</sub>O<sub>3</sub> at high pressure.,"The structural and magnetic properties of LaCo&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&g t; have been studied as a function of pressure by neutron powder diffraction and DC magnetometry. The material is confirmed to exhibit rhombohedral R&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; 3c symmetry between ambient pressure and 6 GPa. We have determined the bulk modulus B&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of the sample using a second-order Birch-Murnaghan equation of state which yielded: B&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;= 140(9) GPa and V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 112.7(2)A&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. We report a non-linear increase of the Curie temperature T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; from an ambient pressure value of 224.7K to ~236 K at a pressure of 4 GPa. Finally, we confirm the glassy-like nature of the magnetism in LaCo&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&g t;, which is maintained throughout the pressure range explored.",3

Here, we consider the defects resulting from the presence of hydrogen during growth and the&#13; resulting electronically active defects. In particular, we find that the interstitial hydrogen defect is a&#13; negative-$U$ center with amphoteric donor and acceptor properties. Additionally, we consider the effects of the interaction with&#13; water and oxygen. The defects are analysed using density functional theory calculations.",3
Introducing a model of pairing based on base pair specific interactions between identical DNA sequences.,"At present, there have been suggested two types of physical mechanism that may facilitate preferential pairing between DNA molecules, with identical or similar base pair texts, without separation of base pairs. One mechanism solely relies on base pair specific patterns of helix distortion being the same on the two molecules, discussed extensively in the past. The other mechanism proposes that there are preferential interactions between base pairs of the same composition. We introduce a model, built on this second mechanism, where both thermal stretching and twisting fluctuations are included, as well as the base pair specific helix distortions. Firstly, we consider an approximation for weak pairing interactions, or short molecules. This yields a dependence of the energy on the square root of the molecular length, which could explain recent experimental data. However, analysis suggests that this approximation is no longer valid at large DNA lengths. In a second approximation, for long molecules, we define two adaptation lengths for twisting and stretching, over which the pairing interaction can limit the accumulation of helix disorder. When the pairing interaction is sufficiently strong, both adaptation lengths are finite; however, as we reduce pairing strength, the stretching adaptation length remains finite but the torsional one becomes infinite. This second state persists to arbitrarily weak values of the pairing strength; suggesting that, if the molecules are long enough, the pairing energy scales as length. To probe differences between the two pairing mechanisms, we also construct a model of similar form. However, now, pairing between identical sequences solely relies on the intrinsic helix distortion patterns. Between the two models, we see interesting qualitative differences. We discuss our findings, and suggest new work to distinguish between the two mechanisms.",3
Thermal annealing and pressure effects on BaFe2-x Co x As2 single crystals.,"We investigate the pressure and thermal annealing effects on BaFe2-x Co x As2 (Co-Ba122) single crystals with x = 0.1 and 0.17 via electrical transport measurements. The thermal annealing treatment not only enhances the superconducting transition temperature (T c) from 9.6 to 12.7 K for x = 0.1 and from 18.1 to 21.0 K for x = 0.17, but also increases the antiferromagnetic transition temperature (T N). Simultaneous enhancement of T c and T N by the thermal annealing treatment indicates that thermal annealing could substantially improve the quality of the Co-doped Ba122 samples. Interestingly, T c of the Co-Ba122 compounds shows a scaling behavior with a linear dependence on the resistivity value at 290 K, irrespective of tuning parameters such as chemical doping, pressure, and thermal annealing. These results not only provide an effective way to access the intrinsic properties of the BaFe2As2 system, but may also shed a light on designing new materials with higher superconducting transition temperature.",3
Locally preserved alpha --> beta phase transition in natural radiation-damaged titanite (CaTiSiO5): evidence from laser-induced photoluminescence and dielectric measurements.,"In situ temperature-dependent laser-induced photoluminescence and dielectric measurements provide new evidence for the local occurrence of the alpha --> beta phase transition near 500 K in the preserved crystalline parts of natural radiation-damaged titanite (sample E2335 with ~24% amorphous fraction, containing Fe and Al impurities). Photoluminescence spectroscopic measurements show an anomaly in the vicinity of 500 K. The temperature-dependent evolution of the real part of the electrical conductivity (sigma) and the real (epsilon') and the imaginary (epsilon'') part of the complex dielectric permittivity (epsilon (*)) of titanite have been measured at various AC frequencies (~1.2-96.8 kHz). Despite the masking and smearing effect of impurities and defects, the temperature-dependent behaviour of epsilon' and epsilon'' around the transition temperature of the investigated natural titanite E2335 shows a remarkable similarity to that of the synthetic end-member material (see Zhang et al (1995 Phys. Chem. Miner. 22 41-9)). This study indicates the suitability of photoluminescence and impedance spectroscopy for the detection of phase transitions, even in heavily disordered systems.",3
h-BN-layer-induced chiral decomposition in the electronic properties of multilayer graphene.,"We discuss the chiral decomposition of non-symmetric stacking structures. It is shown that the low-energy electronic structure of a Bernal stacked graphene multilayer deposited on h-BN consists of chiral pseudospin doublets. N-layer graphene stacks on the h-BN layer have N/2 effective bilayer graphene systems and one effective h-BN layer if N is even or [Formula: see text] effective graphene bilayers plus one graphene monolayer modified by an h-BN layer if N is odd. We present the decomposition procedure and derive the recurrence relations for the effective parameters characterizing the chiral subsystems. In this case, the effective parameters consist of interlayer couplings and on-site potentials in contrast to pure graphene multilayer systems where only interlayer couplings are modified. We apply this procedure to discuss the Klein tunnelling phenomena and quantitatively compare the results with pure graphene multilayer systems.",3
Insight on agglomerates of gold nanoparticles in glass based on surface plasmon resonance spectrum: study by multi-spheres T-matrix method.,"The formation of a localized surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectrum of randomly distributed gold nanoparticles in the surface layer of silicate float glass, generated and implanted by UV ArF-excimer laser irradiation of a thin gold layer sputter-coated on the glass surface, was studied by the T-matrix method, which enables particle agglomeration to be taken into account. The experimental technique used is promising for the production of submicron patterns of plasmonic nanoparticles (given by laser masks or gratings) without damage to the glass surface. Analysis of the applicability of the multi-spheres T-matrix (MSTM) method to the studied material was performed through calculations of SPR characteristics for differently arranged and structured gold nanoparticles (gold nanoparticles in solution, particles pairs, and core-shell silver-gold nanoparticles) for which either experimental data or results of the modeling by other methods are available. For the studied gold nanoparticles in glass, it was revealed that the theoretical description of their SPR spectrum requires consideration of the plasmon coupling between particles, which can be done effectively by MSTM calculations. The obtained statistical distributions over particle sizes and over interparticle distances demonstrated the saturation behavior with respect to the number of particles under consideration, which enabled us to determine the effective aggregate of particles, sufficient to form the SPR spectrum. The suggested technique for the fitting of an experimental SPR spectrum of gold nanoparticles in glass by varying the geometrical parameters of the particles aggregate in the recurring calculations of spectrum by MSTM method enabled us to determine statistical characteristics of the aggregate: the average distance between particles, average size, and size distribution of the particles. The fitting strategy of the SPR spectrum presented here can be applied to nanoparticles of any nature and in various substances, and, in principle, can be extended for particles with non-spherical shapes, like ellipsoids, rod-like and other T-matrix-solvable shapes.",3
Angular-dependent magnetoresistance study in Ca0.73La0.27FeAs2: a 'parent' compound of 112-type iron pnictide superconductors.,"We report a study of angular-dependent magnetoresistance (AMR) with the magnetic field rotated in the plane perpendicular to the current on a Ca0.73La0.27FeAs2 single crystal, which is regarded as a 'parent' compound of 112-type iron pnictide superconductors. A pronounced AMR with twofold symmetry is observed, signifying the highly anisotropic Fermi surface. By further analyzing the AMR data, we find that the Fermi surface above the structural/antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition (T s/T N) is quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D), as revealed by the 2D scaling behavior of the AMR, Deltarho/rho(0) (H, theta) = Deltarho/rho(0) (micro 0 Hcostheta), theta being the magnetic field angle with respect to the c axis. While such 2D scaling becomes invalid at temperatures below T s/T N, the three-dimensional (3D) scaling approach by inclusion of the anisotropy of the Fermi surface is efficient, indicating that the appearance of the 3D Fermi surface contributes to anisotropic electronic transport. Compared with other experimental observations, we suspect that the additional 3D hole pocket (generated by the Ca d orbital and As1 p z orbital) around the Gamma point in CaFeAs2 will disappear in the heavily electron doped regime, and moreover, the Fermi surface should be reconstructed across the structural/AFM transition. Besides, a quasi-linear in-plane magnetoresistance with H//ab is observed at low temperatures and its possible origins are also discussed. Our results provide more information to further understand the electronic structure of 112-type IBSs.",3
Possible half-metallicity and variable range hopping transport in Sb-substituted Fe2TiSn Heusler alloys.,"The investigation of the magnetotransport properties on [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text]Sb x with 0 [Formula: see text] 0.6 are presented in this paper. The substitution of Sb in place of Sn decreases the anti-site disorder as evident from x-ray diffraction patterns as well as from transport properties measurement. The much-disputed upturn in low temperature electrical resistivity of [Formula: see text]TiSn has been demonstrated to be a result of weak localization induced by anti-site disorder. With increased Sb substitution (25%) the metallic transport behavior of [Formula: see text]TiSn changes to semiconductor-like. At low temperature, carrier transport in such compositions occurs via the variable range hopping mechanism. Moreover, a systematic increase in the anomalous Hall voltage is observed with increasing Sb-content, attributable to a side jump or Berry phase curvature effect. Electrical resistivity in the entire temperature regime hints towards half metallicity of the system. Our ab initio electronic structure calculations using generalised gradient approximation formalism further supports the results of our magnetotransport study.",3

Pressure-induced metallization in layered ReSe<sub>2</sub>.,"The evolution of crystal structure and electrical transport properties of distorted layered transition metal dichalcogenide ReSe2 was studied under high pressure up to reverse similar 90 GPa by Raman spectroscopy and electrical resistivity measurements accompanied by ab initio electronic band structure calculations. Raman spectroscopy studies indicate isostructural phase transition due to layer sliding at approximately 7 GPa to the distorted 1T-phase which remains stable up to the highest in these experiments pressures. Direct band gap semiconductor at ambient conditions, ReSe2 undergoes pressure-induced metallization at pressure ~ 35 GPa in agreement with ab initio calculations. Resistivity measurements performed at different loading conditions reveal possible emergence of superconductivity which is most likely not intrinsic property of ReSe2 but it is rather conditioned by internal stresses upon compression.",3
Statistical thermodynamics and magnetic moments of Landau quantized group VI dichalcogenides.,"This work is focused on the determination of the Helmholtz free energy and the magnetic moments of the 'Dirac-like' group VI dichalcogenides subject to Landau quantization. We employ a technique described by Wilson to relate the free energy to the Green's function for the dichalcogenides in a high magnetic field, which was recently evaluated explicitly in terms of elementary functions. In the course of this analysis, the partition function is determined as a function of the magnetic field as well. The results exhibit the role of the quantizing magnetic field in the Helmholtz free energy at arbitrary temperature, and they are also employed to obtain the magnetic moments of the dichalcogenides. Explicit analytic formulas characteristic of de Haas-van Alphen oscillatory phenomenology are presented in the degenerate limit, and nondegenerate Landau quantization effects are also presented for the dichalcogenide magnetic moments.",3
Effect of chain stiffness on the structure of single-chain polymer nanoparticles.,"Polymeric single-chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) are soft nano-objects synthesized by purely intramolecular cross-linking of single polymer chains. By means of computer simulations, we investigate the conformational properties of SCNPs as a function of the bending stiffness of their linear polymer precursors. We investigate a broad range of characteristic ratios from the fully flexible case to those typical of bulky synthetic polymers. Increasing stiffness hinders bonding of groups separated by short contour distances and increases looping over longer distances, leading to more compact nanoparticles with a structure of highly interconnected loops. This feature is reflected in a crossover in the scaling behaviour of several structural observables. The scaling exponents change from those characteristic for Gaussian chains or rings in theta-solvents in the fully flexible limit, to values resembling fractal or 'crumpled' globular behaviour for very stiff SCNPs. We characterize domains in the SCNPs. These are weakly deformable regions that can be seen as disordered analogues of domains in disordered proteins. Increasing stiffness leads to bigger and less deformable domains. Surprisingly, the scaling behaviour of the domains is in all cases similar to that of Gaussian chains or rings, irrespective of the stiffness and degree of cross-linking. It is the spatial arrangement of the domains which determines the global structure of the SCNP (sparse Gaussian-like object or crumpled globule). Since intramolecular stiffness can be varied through the specific chemistry of the precursor or by introducing bulky side groups in its backbone, our results propose a new strategy to tune the global structure of SCNPs.",3
Anomalous water dynamics at surfaces and interfaces: synergistic effects of confinement and surface interactions.,"In nature, water is often found in contact with surfaces that are extended on the scale of molecule size but small on a macroscopic scale. Examples include lipid bilayers and reverse micelles as well as biomolecules like proteins, DNA and zeolites, to name a few. While the presence of surfaces and interfaces interrupts the continuous hydrogen bond network of liquid water, confinement on a mesoscopic scale introduces new features. Even when extended on a molecular scale, natural and biological surfaces often have features (like charge, hydrophobicity) that vary on the scale of the molecular diameter of water. As a result, many new and exotic features, which are not seen in the bulk, appear in the dynamics of water close to the surface. These different behaviors bear the signature of both water-surface interactions and of confinement. In other words, the altered properties are the result of the synergistic effects of surface-water interactions and confinement. Ultrafast spectroscopy, theoretical modeling and computer simulations together form powerful synergistic approaches towards an understanding of the properties of confined water in such systems as nanocavities, reverse micelles (RMs), water inside and outside biomolecules like proteins and DNA, and also between two hydrophobic walls. We shall review the experimental results and place them in the context of theory and simulations. For water confined within RMs, we discuss the possible interference effects propagating from opposite surfaces. Similar interference is found to give rise to an effective attractive force between two hydrophobic surfaces immersed and kept fixed at a separation of d, with the force showing an exponential dependence on this distance. For protein and DNA hydration, we shall examine a multitude of timescales that arise from frustration effects due to the inherent heterogeneity of these surfaces. We pay particular attention to the role of orientational correlations and modification of the same due to interaction with the surfaces.",3
45 degrees sign switching of effective exchange bias due to competing anisotropies in fully epitaxial Co3FeN/MnN bilayers.,"We report an unusual angular-dependent exchange bias effect in ferromagnet/antiferromagnet bilayers, where both ferromagnet and antiferromagnet are epitaxially grown. Numerical model calculations predict an approximately 45 degrees period for the sign switching of the exchange-bias field, depending on the ratio between magnetocrystalline anisotropy and exchange-coupling constant. The switching of the sign is indicative of a competition between a fourfold magnetocrystalline anisotropy of the ferromagnet and a unidirectional anisotropy field of the exchange coupling. This predicted unusual angular-dependent exchange bias and its magnetization switching process are confirmed by measurements on fully epitaxial Co3FeN/MnN bilayers by longitudinal and transverse magneto-optic Kerr effect magnetometry. These results provide a deeper understanding of the exchange coupling phenomena in fully epitaxial bilayers with tailored materials and open up a complex switching energy landscape engineering by anisotropies.",3
Hydration water dynamics around a protein surface: a first passage time approach.,"A stochastic noise-driven dynamic model is proposed to study the diffusion of water molecules around a protein surface, under the effect of thermal fluctuations that arise due to the collision of water molecules with the surrounding environment. The underlying dynamics of such a system may be described in the framework of the generalized Langevin equation, where the thermal fluctuations are assumed to be algebraically correlated in time, which governs the non-Markovian behavior of the system. Results of the calculations of mean-square displacement and the velocity autocorrelation function reveal that the hydration water around the protein surface follows subdiffusive dynamics at long times. Analytical expressions for the first passage time distribution, survival probability, mean residence time and mean first passage time of water molecules are derived for different boundary conditions, to analyze hydration water dynamics under the effect of thermally correlated noise. The results depict a unimodal distribution of the first passage time unlike Brownian motion. The survival probability of hydration water follows a stretched exponential decay for both boundary conditions. The mean residence time of the hydration water molecule for different initial positions increases with increase in the complexity/heterogeneity of the surrounding environment for both boundary conditions. The mean first passage time of the water molecule to reach the absorbing/reflecting boundary follows an asymptotic power law with respect to the thickness of the hydration layer, and increases with increase in the complexity/heterogeneity of the environment.",3
"Weakly spin-dependent band structures of antiferromagnetic perovskite LaMO3 (M = Cr, Mn, Fe).","We investigate the spin-dependent electronic states of antiferromagnetic (AFM) lanthanum chromite (LaCrO3), lanthanum manganite (LaMnO3), and lanthanum ferrite (LaFeO3) using spin-polarized first-principles density functional theory with Hubbard U correction. The band structures are calculated for 15 types of their different AFM structures. It is verified for these structures that there is a very simple rule to identify which wave number [Formula: see text] exhibits spin splitting or degeneracy in the band structure. This rule uses the symmetry operations that map the up-spin atoms onto the down-spin atoms. The resulting spin splitting is very small for the most stable spin configuration of the most stable experimental structure. We discuss a plausible benefit of this characteristic, i.e. the direction-independence of the spin current, in electrode applications.",3
High-density amorphous ice: nucleation of nanosized low-density amorphous ice.,"The pressure dependence of the crystallization temperature of different forms of expanded high-density amorphous ice (eHDA) was scrutinized. Crystallization at pressures 0.05-0.30 GPa was followed using volumetry and powder x-ray diffraction. eHDA samples were prepared via isothermal decompression of very high-density amorphous ice at 140 K to different end pressures between 0.07-0.30 GPa (eHDA(0.07-0.3)). At 0.05-0.17 GPa the crystallization line T x (p) of all eHDA variants is the same. At pressures >0.17 GPa, all eHDA samples decompressed to pressures <0.20 GPa exhibit significantly lower T x values than eHDA(0.2) and eHDA(0.3). We rationalize our findings with the presence of nanoscaled low-density amorphous ice (LDA) seeds that nucleate in eHDA when it is decompressed to pressures <0.20 GPa at 140 K. Below ~0.17 GPa, these nanosized LDA domains are latent within the HDA matrix, exhibiting no effect on T x of eHDA(<0.2). Upon heating at pressures 0.17 GPa, these nanosized LDA nuclei transform to ice IX nuclei. They are favored sites for crystallization and, hence, lower T x . By comparing crystallization experiments of bulk LDA with the ones involving nanosized LDA we are able to estimate the Laplace pressure and radius of ~0.3-0.8 nm for the nanodomains of LDA. The nucleation of LDA in eHDA revealed here is evidence for the first-order-like nature of the HDA --> LDA transition, supporting water's liquid-liquid transition scenarios.",3
Helical edge states in silicene and germanene nanorings in perpendicular magnetic field.,"Due to nonzero intrinsic spin-orbit interaction in buckled honeycomb crystal structures, silicene and germanene exhibit interesting topological properties, and are therefore candidates for the realization of the quantum spin Hall effect. We employ the Kane-Mele model to investigate the electron states in hexagonal silicene and germanene nanorings having either zigzag or armchair edges in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field. We present results for the energy spectra as function of magnetic field, the electron density of the spin-up and spin-down states in the ring plane, and the calculation of the probability current density. The quantum spin Hall phase is found at the edges between the nontrivial topological phase in silicene and germanene and vacuum. We demonstrate that the helical edge states in zigzag silicene and germanene nanorings can be qualitatively well understood by means of classical magnetic moments. However, this is not the case for comparable-sized armchair nanorings, where the eigenfunctions spread throughout the ring. Finally, we note that the energy spectra of silicene and germanene nanorings are similar and that the differences between the two are mainly related to the difference in magnitude of the spin-orbit coupling.",3
"(Tl, Au)/Si(1 1 1)[Formula: see text] 2D compound: an ordered array of identical Au clusters embedded in Tl matrix.","Formation of the highly-ordered [Formula: see text]-periodicity 2D compound has been detected in the (Tl, Au)/Si(1 1 1) system as a result of Au deposition onto the Tl/Si(1 1 1) surface, its composition, structure and electronic properties have been characterized using scanning tunneling microscopy, angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and density-functional-theory calculations. On the basis of these data, the structural model of the Tl-Au compound has been proposed, which adopts 12 Tl atoms and 10 Au atoms (in total, 22 atoms) per [Formula: see text] unit cell, i.e. approximately 1.71 ML of Tl and approximately 1.43 ML of Au (in total, approximately 3.14 ML). Qualitatively, the model can be visualized as consisting of truncated-pyramid-like Au clusters with a Tl atom on top, while the other Tl atoms form a double layer around the Au clusters. The (Tl, Au)/Si(1 1 1)[Formula: see text] compound has been found to exhibit pronounced metallic properties at least down to temperatures as low as approximately 25 K, which makes it a promising object for studying electrical transport phenomena in the 2D metallic systems.",3
Field-tuned superconductor-insulator transitions and Hall resistance in thin polycrystalline MoN films.,"We report on the superconductor-insulator transitions (SITs) of disordered molybdenum nitride (MoN) thin films on (1 0 0) MgO substrates as a function of the film thickness and magnetic fields. The T c of the superconducting MoN films, which exhibit a sharp superconducting transition, monotonically decreases as the normal state R sq increases with a decreasing film thickness. For several films with different thicknesses, we estimate the critical field H c and the product znu approximately 0.6 of the dynamical exponent z and the correlation length exponent nu using a finite scaling analysis. The value of this product can be explained by the (2 + 1) XY model. We found that the Hall resistance DeltaR xy (H) is maximized when the magnetic field satisfies H HP(T) [Formula: see text] |1 - T/T C0| in the superconducting state and also in the normal states owning to the superconducting fluctuation corresponding to the ghost critical magnetic field. We measured the Hall conductivity deltasigma xy (H) = sigma xy (H) - [Formula: see text] and fit the Gaussian approximation theory for deltasigma xy (H) to the experimental data. Agreement between the data and the theory beyond H c suggests the survival of the Cooper pair in the insulating region of the SIT.",3
Pressure dependence of Ce valence in CeRhIn<sub>5</sub>.,"We have studied the Ce valence as a function of pressure in CeRhIn&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; at 300 K and at 22 K using x-ray absorption spectroscopy in partial fluorescent yield mode. At room temperature, we found no detectable change in Ce valence greater than 0.01 up to a pressure of 5.5 GPa. At 22 K, the valence remains robust against pressure below 6GPa, in contrast to the predicted valence crossover at P=2.35 GPa. This work yields an upper limit for the change in Ce-valence and suggests that the critical valence fluctuation scenario, in its current form, is unlikely.",3
Magnetic behavior of metastable Fe films grown on Ir(1 1 1).,"We investigated the growth of ultra-thin Fe films on Ir(1 1 1) by means of in situ low energy electron diffraction and spin-resolved photoemission techniques. We observe a (1 x 1) diffraction pattern, characteristic of the fcc substrate, below four monolayers (ML). Then, a complex superstructure starts to develop, compatible with the formation of bcc-like Fe domains aligned with the substrate according to the Kourdjumov-Sachs orientation relationships. The analysis of the diffraction patterns reveals a progressive evolution towards a fully relaxed bcc lattice, characteristic of bulk Fe. Both photoemission (filled states) and inverse photoemission (empty states) results show characteristic features related to the contribution of the Fe layer, evolving towards those observed on the Fe (1 1 0) bcc surface. Spin resolution allows to detect a spectral polarization above 4 ML, corresponding to the formation of bcc Fe, which gradually increases indicating the formation of an in-plane magnetized ferromagnetic layer in thick films. No in-plane net magnetization is detected in thinner films, independent of the sample temperature down to 30 K. Following recent investigations on the Fe/Ir(1 1 1) system with microscopy techniques, we link this observation to the stabilization of a non collinear spin structure yielding an overall nil magnetization.",3
Spin Hall magnetoresistance in the non-collinear ferrimagnet GdIG close to the compensation temperature.,"We investigate the spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) in a gadolinium iron garnet (GdIG)/platinum (Pt) heterostructure by angular dependent magnetoresistance measurements. The magnetic structure of the ferromagnetic insulator GdIG is non-collinear near the compensation temperature, while it is collinear far from the compensation temperature. In the collinear regime, the SMR signal in GdIG is consistent with the usual [Formula: see text] relation well established in the collinear magnet yttrium iron garnet, with [Formula: see text] the angle between magnetization and spin Hall spin polarization direction. In the non-collinear regime, both an SMR signal with inverted sign and a more complex angular dependence with four maxima are observed within one sweep cycle. The number of maxima as well as the relative strength of different maxima depend strongly on temperature and field strength. Our results evidence a complex SMR behavior in the non-collinear magnetic regime that goes beyond the conventional formalism developed for collinear magnetic structures.",3
Dynamic electron-ion collisions and nuclear quantum effects in quantum simulation of warm dense matter.,"The structural, thermodynamic and transport properties of warm dense matter (WDM) are crucial to the fields of astrophysics and planet science, as well as inertial confinement fusion. WDM refers to the states of matter in a regime of temperature and density between cold condensed matter and hot ideal plasmas, where the density is from near-solid up to ten times solid density, and the temperature between 0.1 and 100 eV. In the WDM regime, matter exhibits moderately or strongly coupled, partially degenerate properties. Therefore, the methods used to deal with condensed matter and isolated atoms need to be properly validated for WDM. It is therefore a big challenge to understand WDM within a unified theoretical description with reliable accuracy. Here, we review the progress in the theoretical study of WDM with state-of-the-art simulations, i.e. quantum Langevin molecular dynamics and first principles path integral molecular dynamics. The related applications for WDM are also included.",3
Demagnetizing fields in all-optical switching.,"A model of demagnetizing fields and micromagnetic simulations are applied to examine the evolution of a demagnetized cylinder. In addition to three expected final magnetic structures, a fourth switched state is obtained over a range of magnetic energy densities. The switched state is absent when demagnetizing fields are neglected. The connection to all-optical switching of materials with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy is discussed.",3
Temperature dependent structural evolution in liquid Ag50Ga50 alloy.,"The temperature dependence of atomic structural evolution in liquid Ag50Ga50 alloy has been studied using an in situ high energy x-ray diffraction (XRD) experiment combined with first-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulations. The experimental data show a reversible structural crossover at the temperature of about 1050 K. Changes in both electrical resistivity and absolute thermoelectric power at about 1100 K strongly support the XRD results. Additionally, FPMD simulations reveal the abnormal temperature dependent behavior of partial coordination number and atomic diffusivity at about 1200 K, elucidating that the partition experimentally observed changes in structure and properties could be linked with the repartition between Ag and Ga atoms in the liquid at around 1050-1200 K. This finding will trigger more studies on the structural evolution of noble-polyvalent metals in particular and metallic liquids in general.",3
"Site occupancy, composition and magnetic structure dependencies of martensitic transformation in Mn2Ni1 + x Sn1-x.","A delicate balance between various factors such as site occupancy, composition and magnetic ordering seems to affect the stability of the martensitic phase in [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text]. Using first-principles DFT calculations, we explore the impacts of each one of these factors on the martensitic stability of this system. Our results on total energies, magnetic moments and electronic structures upon changes in the composition, the magnetic configurations and the site occupancies show that the occupancies at the 4d sites in the inverse Heusler crystal structure play the most crucial role. The presence of Mn at the 4d sites originally occupied by Sn and its interaction with the Mn atoms at other sites decide the stability of the martensitic phases. This explains the discrepancy between the experiments and earlier DFT calculations regarding phase stability in [Formula: see text]NiSn. Our results qualitatively explain the trends observed experimentally with regard to martensitic phase stability and the magnetisations in Ni-excess, Sn-deficient [Formula: see text]NiSn system.",3
Electrical conductivity of In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> after low temperature ion irradiation; implications for instrinsic defect formation and charge neutrality level.,"The evolution of sheet resistance of n-type In2O3 and Ga2O3 exposed to bombardment with MeV&#13; 12C and 28Si ions at 35 K is studied in situ. While the sheet resistance of Ga2O3 increased by&#13; more than 8 orders of magnitude as a result of ion irradiation, In2O3 showed a more complex defect&#13; evolution and became more conductive when irradiated at the highest doses. Heating up to room&#13; temperature reduced the sheet resistivity somewhat, but Ga2O3 remained highly resistive, while&#13; In2O3 showed a lower resistance than as deposited samples. Thermal admittance spectroscopy and&#13; deep level transient spectroscopy did not reveal new defect levels for irradiation up to 2 1012&#13; cm2. A model where larger defect complexes preferentially produce donor like defects in In2O3&#13; is proposed, and may reveal a microscopic view of a charge neutrality level within the conduction&#13; band, as previously proposed.",3
Varieties of charge distributions in coat proteins of ssRNA+ viruses.,"A major part of the interactions involved in the assembly and stability of icosahedral, positive-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA+) viruses is electrostatic in nature, as can be inferred from the strong pH- and salt-dependence of their assembly phase diagrams. Electrostatic interactions do not act only between the capsid coat proteins (CPs), but just as often provide a significant contribution to the interactions of the CPs with the genomic RNA, mediated to a large extent by positively charged, flexible N-terminal tails of the CPs. In this work, we provide two clear and complementary definitions of an N-terminal tail of a protein, and use them to extract the tail sequences of a large number of CPs of ssRNA+ viruses. We examine the pH-dependent interplay of charge on both tails and CPs alike, and show that-in contrast to the charge on the CPs-the net positive charge on the N-tails persists even to very basic pH values. In addition, we note a limit to the length of the wild-type genomes of those viruses which utilize positively charged tails, when compared to viruses without charged tails and similar capsid size. At the same time, we observe no clear connection between the charge on the N-tails and the genome lengths of the viruses included in our study.",3

Elastic moduli of a Brownian colloidal glass former.,"The static, dynamic and flow-dependent shear moduli of a binary mixture of Brownian hard disks are studied by an event-driven molecular dynamics simulation. Thereby, the emergence of rigidity close to the glass transition encoded in the static shear modulus [Formula: see text] is accessed by three methods. Results from shear stress auto-correlation functions, elastic dispersion relations, and the elastic response to strain deformations upon the start-up of shear flow are compared. This enables one to sample the time-dependent shear modulus [Formula: see text] consistently over several decades in time. By that a very precise specification of the glass transition point and of [Formula: see text] is feasible. Predictions by mode coupling theory of a finite shear modulus at the glass transition, of alpha-scaling in fluid states close to the transition, and of shear induced decay in yielding glass states are tested and broadly verified.",3
The electronic and optical properties of the sulvanite compounds: a many-body perturbation and time-dependent density functional theory study.,"We have studied, by means of first-principles calculations, the electronic and optical properties of the sulvanite family: Cu3MX4 (M = V, Nb, Ta and X = S, Se), which, due to its broad range of gaps and chemical stability, have emerged as promising materials for technological applications such as photovoltaics and transparent conductivity. To address the reliability of those properties we have used semi-local and hybrid functionals (PBEsol, HSE06), many-body perturbation theory (G0W0 approximation and Bethe-Salpeter equation), and time-dependent density functional theory (revised bootstrap kernel) to calculate the quasi-particle dispersion relation, band gaps, the imaginary part of the macroscopic dielectric function and the absorption coefficient. The calculated valence band maximum and the conduction band minimum are located at the R and X-points, respectively. The calculated gaps using PBEsol are between 0.81 and 1.88 eV, with HSE06 into 1.73 and 2.94 eV, whereas the G0W0 values fall into the 1.91-3.19 eV range. The calculated dielectric functions and absorption coefficients show that all these compounds present continuous excitonic features when the Bethe-Salpeter equation is used. Contrarily, the revised bootstrap kernel is incapable of describing the excitonic spectra. The calculated optical spectra show that Cu3VS4 and Cu3MSe4 have good absorption in the visible, whereas Cu3NbS4 and Cu3TaS4 have it on the near ultraviolet.",3
Thermodynamics of two-impurity Anderson model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.,"In this work, we use the numerical renormalization group (NRG) theory to study the thermodynamics of the two-impurity Anderson model. Two different methods are used to estimate the effect of Dzyaloshiskii-Moriya (DM) interaction on the variation of the Kondo temperature. When the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction is vanishing, the two different estimations give different tendencies. If we use the peak of the specific heat to identify the variation of the Kondo temperature versus the DM interaction, we get an almost linear function. However, if we use the low temperature universal curve of the impurity entropy, we get a quadratic function. These results indicate that previous debates about the influence of spin-orbit coupling on the Kondo temperature may come from the different definitions of the Kondo temperature. When the RKKY interaction is ferromagnetic, there are two stages of Kondo screening. Both estimations demonstrate that the second stage of the Kondo temperature is exponentially dependent on the DM interaction. There results are dramatically different from those calculated via perturbation theory.",3
Role of interbranch pumping on the quantum-statistical behavior of multi-mode magnons in ferromagnetic nanowires.,"Theoretical studies are reported for the quantum-statistical properties of microwave-driven multi-mode magnon systems as represented by ferromagnetic nanowires with a stripe geometry. Effects of both the exchange and the dipole-dipole interactions, as well as a Zeeman term for an external applied field, are included in the magnetic Hamiltonian. The model also contains the time-dependent nonlinear effects due to parallel pumping with an electromagnetic field. Using a coherent magnon state representation in terms of creation and annihilation operators, we investigate the effects of parallel pumping on the temporal evolution of various nonclassical properties of the system. A focus is on the interbranch mixing produced by the pumping field when there are three or more modes. In particular, the occupation magnon number and the multi-mode cross correlations between magnon modes are studied. Manipulation of the collapse and revival phenomena of the average magnon occupation number and the control of the cross correlation between the magnon modes are demonstrated through tuning of the parallel pumping field amplitude and appropriate choices for the coherent magnon states. The cross correlations are a direct consequence of the interbranch pumping effects and do not appear in the corresponding one- or two-mode magnon systems.",3
Retardation effects on the dispersion and propagation of plasmons in metallic nanoparticle chains.,"We consider a chain of regularly-spaced spherical metallic nanoparticles, where each particle supports three degenerate localized surface plasmons. Due to the dipolar interaction between the nanoparticles, the localized plasmons couple to form extended collective modes. Using an open quantum system approach in which the collective plasmons are interacting with vacuum electromagnetic modes and which, importantly, readily incorporates retardation via the light-matter coupling, we analytically evaluate the resulting radiative frequency shifts of the plasmonic bandstructure. For subwavelength-sized nanoparticles, our analytical treatment provides an excellent quantitative agreement with the results stemming from laborious numerical calculations based on fully-retarded solutions to Maxwell's equations. Indeed, the explicit expressions for the plasmonic spectrum which we provide showcase how including retardation gives rise to a logarithmic singularity in the bandstructure of transverse-polarized plasmons. We further study the impact of retardation effects on the propagation of plasmonic excitations along the chain. While for the longitudinal modes, retardation has a negligible effect, we find that the retarded dipolar interaction can significantly modify the plasmon propagation in the case of transverse-polarized modes. Moreover, our results elucidate the analogy between radiative effects in nanoplasmonic systems and the cooperative Lamb shift in atomic physics.",3
"Lanthanide stannate pyrochlores (Ln2Sn2O7; Ln = Nd, Gd, Er) at high pressure.","Lanthanide stannate pyrochlores (Ln2Sn2O7; Ln = Nd, Gd, and Er) were investigated in situ to 50 GPa in order to determine their structural response to compression and compare their response to that of lanthanide titanate, zirconate, and hafnate pyrochlores. The cation radius ratio of A(3+)/B(4+) in pyrochlore oxides (A2B2O7) is thought to be the dominant feature that influences their response on compression. The ionic radius of Sn(4+) is intermediate to that of Ti(4+), Zr(4+), and Hf(4+), but the <Sn-O> bond in stannate pyrochlore is more covalent than the <B-O> bonds in titanates, zirconate, and hafnates. In stannates, based on in situ Raman spectroscopy, pyrochlore cation and anion sublattices begin to disorder with the onset of compression, first measured at 0.3 GPa. The extent of sublattice disorder versus pressure is greater in stannates with a smaller Ln(3+) cation. Stannate pyrochlores (Fd-3m) begin a sluggish transformation to an orthorhombic, cotunnite-like structure at ~28 GPa; similar transitions have been observed in titanate, zirconate, and hafnate pyrochlores at varying pressures (18-40 GPa) with cation radius ratio. The extent of the phase transition versus pressure varies directly with the size of the Ln(3+) cation. Post-decompression from ~50 GPa, Er2Sn2O7 and Gd2Sn2O7 adopt a pyrochlore structure, rather than the multi-scale defect-fluorite + weberite-type structure adopted by Nd2Sn2O7 that is characteristic of titanate, zirconate, and hafnate pyrochlores under similar conditions. Like pyrochlore titanates, zirconates, and hafnates, the bulk modulus, B 0, of stannates varies linearly and inversely with cation radius ratio from 1 1 1 GPa (Nd2Sn2O7) to 251 GPa (Er2Sn2O7). The trends of bulk moduli in stannates in this study are in excellent agreement with previous experimental studies on stannates and suggest that the size of the Ln(3+) cation is the primary determining factor of B 0. Additionally, when normalized to r A/r B, the bulk moduli of stannates are comparable to those of zirconates and hafnates, which vary from titanates. Our results suggest that the cation radius ratio strongly influences the bulk moduli of stannates, as well as their overall compression response.",3
Thermal annealing and pressure effects on BaFe<sub>2-<i>x</i></sub>Co<sub><i>x</i></sub>As<sub>2</sub> single crystals.,"We investigate the pressure and thermal annealing effects on BaFe&lt;sub&gt;2-&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt ;&lt;/sub&gt;As&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Co-Ba122) single crystals with &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; = 0.1 and 0.17 via electrical transport measurements. The thermal annealing treatment not only enhances the superconducting transition temperature (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) from 9.6 to 12.7 K for &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; = 0.1 and from 18.1 to 21.0 K for &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; = 0.17, but also increases the antiferromagnetic transition temperature (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;). Simultaneous enhancement of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; by the thermal annealing treatment indicates that thermal annealing could substantially improve the quality of the Co-doped Ba122 samples. Interestingly, &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; of the Co-Ba122 compounds shows a scaling behavior with a linear dependence on the resistivity value at 290 K, irrespective of tuning parameters, such as chemical doping, pressure, and thermal annealing. These results not only provide an effective way to access the intrinsic properties of the BaFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;As&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; system, but also may shed a light on designing new materials with higher superconducting transition temperature.",3
Surface development of a brazing alloy during heat treatment-a comparison between UHV and APXPS.,"In an attempt to bridge the pressure gap, APXPS was used to follow the surface development of an aluminum brazing sheet during heating in an ambient oxygen-pressure mimicking the environment of an industrial brazing furnace. The studied aluminum alloy brazing sheet is a composite material consisting of two aluminum alloy standards whose surface is covered with a native aluminum oxide film. To emphasize the necessity of studies of this system in ambient sample environments it is compared to measurements in UHV. Changes in thickness and composition of the surface oxide were followed after heating to 300 degrees C, 400 degrees C, and 500 degrees C. The two sets presented in this paper show that the surface development strongly depends on the environment the sample is heated in.",3
Perfect transmission of 3D massive Kane fermions in HgCdTe Veselago lenses.,"The transmission properties of three-dimensional (3D) massive Kane fermions in HgCdTe (MCT) heterojunctions have been studied using the simplified Kane-Mele model. Based on our theoretical calculations, we propose the design of an electronic device, called a mass inverter, which consists of the junction of a narrow-gap semiconductor and semimetal. Such a device can be used in electron optics applications, since it operates as a Veselago lens and presents Klein tunneling (KT) of 3D massive Kane fermions under normal incidence. We found that KT and Veselago lensing can also be observed for general MCT heterojunctions with a specific value of doping level. We show that non-resonant perfect transmission of massive Kane fermions persists in a potential barrier for heterojunctions formed by a semimetal between two standard semiconductors. This effect is quite robust when the ideal conditions of a possible experimental test are deviated. Our findings may have important implications in the development of nano-electronic devices using 3D massive Kane fermions, where transmission features of massless particles are recovered.",3
Indium selenide monolayer: strain-enhanced optoelectronic response and dielectric environment-tunable 2D exciton features.,"Electronic and optical performances of the beta-InSe monolayer (ML) are considerably boosted by tuning the corresponding band energies through lattice in-plane compressive strain engineering. First principles calculations show an indirect-direct gap transition with a large bandgap size. The crossover is due to different responses of the near-gap state energies with respect to strain. This is explained by the variation of In-Se bond length, the bond nature of near-band-edge electronic orbital and of the momentum angular contribution versus in-plane compressive strain. The effective masses of charge carriers are also found to be highly modulated and significantly light at the indirect-direct-gap transition. The tuned optical response of the resulting direct-gap ML beta-InSe is evaluated versus applied energy to infer the allowed optical transitions, dielectric constants, semiconductor-metal behavior and refractive index. The environmental dielectric engineering of exciton behavior of the resulting direct-gap ML beta-InSe is handled within the effective mass Wannier-Mott model and is expected to be important. Our results highlight the increase of binding energy and red-shifted exciton energy with decreasing screening substrates, resulting in a stable exciton at room temperature. The intensity and energy of the ground-state exciton emission are expected to be strongly influenced under substrate screening effect. According to our findings, the direct-gap ML beta-InSe assures tremendous 2D optoelectronic and nanoelectronic merits that could overcome several limitations of unstrained ML beta-InSe.",3
"Collapse in two good solvents, swelling in two poor solvents: defying the laws of polymer solubility?","In this work we discuss two mirror but distinct phenomena of polymer paradoxical properties in mixed solvents: co-non-solvency and co-solvency. When a polymer collapses in a mixture of two miscible good solvents the phenomenon is known as co-non-solvency, while co-solvency is a phenomenon that is associated with the swelling of a polymer in poor solvent mixtures. A typical example of co-non-solvency is provided by poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) in aqueous alcohol, while poly(methyl methacrylate) in aqueous alcohol shows co-solvency. We discuss these two phenomena to compare their microscopic origins and show that both can be understood within generic universal concepts. A broad range of polymers is therefore expected to exhibit these phenomena where specific chemical details play a lesser role than the appropriate combination of interactions between the trio of molecular components.",3
Negative differential mobility and trapping in active matter systems.,"Using simulations, we examine the average velocity as a function of applied drift force for active matter particles moving through a random obstacle array. We find that for low drift force, there is an initial flow regime where the mobility increases linearly with drive, while for higher drift forces a regime of negative differential mobility appears in which the velocity decreases with increasing drive due to the trapping of active particles behind obstacles. A fully clogged regime exists at very high drift forces when all the particles are permanently trapped behind obstacles. We find for increasing activity that the overall mobility is nonmonotonic, with an enhancement of the mobility for small levels of activity and a decrease in mobility for large activity levels. We show how these effects evolve as a function of disk and obstacle density, active run length, drift force, and motor force.",3
Interfacial rheology of model particles at liquid interfaces and its relation to (bicontinuous) Pickering emulsions.,"Interface-dominated materials are commonly encountered in both science and technology, and typical examples include foams and emulsions. Conventionally stabilised by surfactants, emulsions can also be stabilised by micron-sized particles. These so-called Pickering-Ramsden (PR) emulsions have received substantial interest, as they are model arrested systems, rather ubiquitous in industry and promising templates for advanced materials. The mechanical properties of the particle-laden liquid-liquid interface, probed via interfacial rheology, have been shown to play an important role in the formation and stability of PR emulsions. However, the morphological processes which control the formation of emulsions and foams in mixing devices, such as deformation, break-up, and coalescence, are complex and diverse, making it difficult to identify the precise role of the interfacial rheological properties. Interestingly, the role of interfacial rheology in the stability of bicontinuous PR emulsions (bijels) has been virtually unexplored, even though the phase separation process which leads to the formation of these systems is relatively simple and the interfacial deformation processes can be better conceptualised. Hence, the aims of this topical review are twofold. First, we review the existing literature on the interfacial rheology of particle-laden liquid interfaces in rheometrical flows, focussing mainly on model latex suspensions consisting of polystyrene particles carrying sulfate groups, which have been most extensively studied to date. The goal of this part of the review is to identify the generic features of the rheology of such systems. Secondly, we will discuss the relevance of these results to the formation and stability of PR emulsions and bijels.",3
Cascaded longitudinal stimulated Raman scattering and the frequency doubling process of potassium dihydrogen phosphate crystals.,"Cascaded longitudinal stimulated Raman scattering (LSRS) and the frequency doubling process are reported for the first time. When potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP) crystals are used as the type I and type II frequency doublers of picosecond, focused 1064 nm laser pulses, strong LSRS effects are observed. Three new laser spectrum lines appeared successively, i.e. at 558.9, 588.9 and 622.1 nm, and were excited by the frequency doubling laser at 532 nm. Second- and third-order nonlinear optical frequency conversions were achieved in a single KDP crystal. The near-infrared light was thus converted into a new spectra laser spanning the green-to-red spectral range.",3
"Angular-dependent magnetoresistance study in Ca<sub>0.73</sub>La<sub>0.27</sub>FeAs<sub>2</sub>: a ""<i>parent</i>"" compound of 112-type iron pnictide superconductors.","We report a study of angular-dependent magnetoresistance (AMR) with the magnetic field rotated in the plane perpendicular to the current on a Ca&lt;sub&gt;0.73&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;0.27&lt;/sub&gt;FeAs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/su b&gt; single crystal, which is regarded as a ""&lt;i&gt;parent&lt;/i&gt;"" compound of 112-type iron pnictide superconductors. A pronounced AMR with twofold symmetry is observed, signifying the highly anisotropic Fermi surface. By further analyzing the AMR data, we find that the Fermi surface above the structural/antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;N&lt ;/sub&gt;) is quasi-two-dimensional (2D), as revealed by the 2D scaling behavior of the AMR, Deltarho/rho(0) (&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;, theta)=Deltarho/rho(0) (mu&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;cos&lt;i&gt;theta&lt;/i&gt;), &lt;i&gt;theta&lt;/i&gt; being the magnetic field angle with respect to the c axis. While such a 2D scaling becomes invalid at temperatures below &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;N&lt; /sub&gt;, the three-dimensional (3D) scaling approach by inclusion of the anisotropy of Fermi surface is efficient, indicating that the appearance of 3D Fermi surface contributed to the anisotropic electronic transport. Compared with other experimental observations, we suspect that the additional 3D hole pocket (generated by the Ca &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; orbital and As1 &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; orbital) around the&lt;i&gt; Gamma&lt;/i&gt; point in CaFeAs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will disappear in the heavily electron doped regime, and moreover, the Fermi surface should be reconstructed across the structural/AFM transition. Besides, a quasi-linear in-plane magnetoresistance is observed at low temperatures and its possible origins are also discussed. Our results provide more information to further understand the electronic structure of 112-type IBSs.",3
Evidence for confinement induced phase separation in ethanol-water mixture: a positron annihilation study.,We report an experimental evidence for the phase separation of ethanol-water mixture confined in mesoporous silica with different pore size using positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS). A bulk-like liquid in the core of the pore and a distinct interfacial region near the pore surface have been identified based on ortho-positronium lifetime components. The lifetime corresponding to the core liquid shows similar behavior to the bulk liquid mixture while the interfacial lifetime shows an abrupt rise within a particular range of ethanol concentration depending on the pore size. This abrupt increase is attributed to the appearance of excess free-volume near the interfacial region. The excess free-volume is originated due to microphase separation of confined ethanol-water primarily at the vicinity of the pore wall. We envisage that probing free-volume changes at the interface using PALS is a sensitive way to investigate microphase separation under nanoconfinement.,3
Possibile half-metallicity and variable range hopping transport in Sb-substituted Fe<sub>2</sub>TiSn Heusler alloys.,"Investigation of magnetotransport properties on Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TiSn&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt ; with 0 </= x </= 0.6 are presented in this paper. The substitution of Sb in place of Sn decreases the antisite disorder as evident from X ray diffraction patterns as well as from transport properties measurement. The much-disputed upturn in low temperature electrical resistivity of Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TiSn has been demonstrated to be a result of weak localization induced by antisite disorder. With increased Sb substitution (>/= 25%) the metallic transport behaviour of Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TiSn changes to semiconductor-like. At low temperature the carrier transport in such compositions occur via variable range hopping mechanism. Moreover, a systematic increase in the anomalous Hall voltage is observed with increasing Sb content, attributable to a side jump or Berry phase curvature effect. Electrical resistivity in the high temperature regime hints towards half metallicity of the system. Our Ab-initio electronic structure calculations using the GGA formalism further supports the results of our magnetotransport study.",3
Annealing cycles and the self-organization of functionalized colloids.,"The self-assembly of functionalized (patchy) particles with directional interactions into target structures is still a challenge, despite the significant experimental advances in their synthesis. Self-assembly pathways are typically characterized by high energy barriers that hinder access to stable (equilibrium) structures. A possible strategy to tackle this challenge is to perform annealing cycles. By periodically switching on and off the inter-particle bonds, one expects to smooth-out the kinetic pathways and favor the assembly of targeted structures. Preliminary results have shown that the efficiency of annealing cycles depends strongly on their frequency. Here, we study numerically how this frequency-dependence scales with the strength of the directional interactions (size of the patch sigma). We use analytical arguments to show that the scaling results from the statistics of a random walk in configurational space.",3
Phase diagrams of ferroelectric nanocrystals strained by an elastic matrix.,"Ferroelectric crystallites embedded into a dielectric matrix experience temperature-dependent elastic strains caused by differences in the thermal expansion of the crystallites and the matrix. Owing to the electrostriction, these lattice strains may affect polarization states of ferroelectric inclusions significantly, making them different from those of a stress-free bulk crystal. Here, using a nonlinear thermodynamic theory, we study the mechanical effect of elastic matrix on the phase states of embedded single-domain ferroelectric nanocrystals. Their equilibrium polarization states are determined by minimizing a special thermodynamic potential that describes the energetics of an ellipsoidal ferroelectric inclusion surrounded by a linear elastic medium. To demonstrate the stability ranges of such states for a given material combination, we construct a phase diagram, where the inclusion's shape anisotropy and temperature are used as two parameters. The 'shape-temperature' phase diagrams are calculated numerically for PbTiO3 and BaTiO3 nanocrystals embedded into representative dielectric matrices generating tensile (silica glass) or compressive (potassium silicate glass) thermal stresses inside ferroelectric inclusions. The developed phase maps demonstrate that the joint effect of thermal stresses and matrix-induced elastic clamping of ferroelectric inclusions gives rise to several important features in the polarization behavior of PbTiO3 and BaTiO3 nanocrystals. In particular, the Curie temperature displays a nonmonotonic variation with the ellipsoid's aspect ratio, being minimal for spherical inclusions. Furthermore, the diagrams show that the polarization orientation with respect to the ellipsoid's symmetry axis is controlled by the shape anisotropy and the sign of thermal stresses. Under certain conditions, the mechanical inclusion-matrix interaction qualitatively alters the evolution of ferroelectric states on cooling, inducing a structural transition in PbTiO3 nanocrystals and suppressing in BaTiO3 inclusions some transformations occurring in their bulk counterpart. The constructed phase maps open the possibility to calculate dielectric properties of strained PbTiO3 and BaTiO3 nanocrystals and ferroelectric nanocomposites comprising such crystallites.",3
Dark field differential dynamic microscopy enables accurate characterization of the roto-translational dynamics of bacteria and colloidal clusters.,"Micro- and nanoscale objects with anisotropic shape are key components of a variety of biological systems and inert complex materials, and represent fundamental building blocks of novel self-assembly strategies. The time scale of their thermal motion is set by their translational and rotational diffusion coefficients, whose measurement may become difficult for relatively large particles with small optical contrast. Here we show that dark field differential dynamic microscopy is the ideal tool for probing the roto-translational Brownian motion of anisotropic shaped particles. We demonstrate our approach by successful application to aqueous dispersions of non-motile bacteria and of colloidal aggregates of spherical particles.",3
Low-field induced large magnetocaloric effect in Tm2Ni0.93Si2.93: influence of short-range magnetic correlation.,"In this work, we report the successful synthesis of a new intermetallic compound Tm2 [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] that forms in single phase only in defect crystal structure. The compound does not show any long range magnetic ordering down to 2 K. The material exhibits a large magnetic entropy change ([Formula: see text] J [Formula: see text] K(-1)) and adiabatic temperature change ([Formula: see text] K) at 2.2 K for a field change of 20 kOe which can be realized by permanent magnets, thus being very beneficial for application purpose. In the absence of long-range magnetic ordering down to 2 K, the metastable nature of low-temperature spin dynamics and short-range magnetic correlations are considered to be responsible for such a large magnetocaloric effect over a wide temperature region.",3
45<sup>o</sup> sign switching of effective exchange bias due to competing anisotropies in fully epitaxial Co<sub>3</sub>FeN/MnN bilayers.,"We report an unusual angular-dependent exchange bias effect in ferromagnet/antiferromagnet bilayers, where both ferromagnet and antiferromagnet are epitaxially grown. &#13; Numerical model calculations predict an approximately 45$^\circ$ period for the sign switching of the exchange-bias field, depending on the ratio between magnetocrystalline anisotropy and exchange-coupling constant. &#13; The switching of the sign is indicative of a competition between a fourfold magnetocrystalline anisotropy of the ferromagnet and a unidirectional anisotropy field of the exchange coupling. &#13; This predicted unusual angular-dependent exchange bias and its magnetization switching process are confirmed by measurements on fully epitaxial Co$_3$FeN/MnN bilayers by longitudinal and transverse magneto-optic Kerr effect magnetometry. &#13; These results provide a deeper understanding of the exchange coupling phenomena in fully epitaxial bilayers with tailored materials and open up a complex switching energy landscape engineering by anisotropies.",3
Temperature dependent electron paramagnetic resonance study on magnetoelectric YCrO3.,"We report temperature dependent electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies on polycrystalline YCrO3 samples at X-band (9.46 GHz) in the temperature range of 120 K-298 K. The EPR spectra exhibit a single broad line across the whole temperature range, attributed to Cr(3+) ions. The variation of EPR spectra parameters (line width, integrated intensity, and g-factor) as a function of temperature was analyzed to understand the nature of spin-dynamics in the paramagnetic region of YCrO3. A peak in the g-factor suggests the presence of a new phase within the paramagnetic state at an intermediate point of temperature T IP ~ 230 K, attributed to the onset of short range canted antiferromagnetic correlations in the material much above 140 K, Neel temperature (T N) of YCrO3. The EPR intensity increases with a decrease in temperature up to T N due to the renormalization of the magnetic moments arising from the appearance of canted antiferromagnetic correlations. Further, temperature dependent dielectric measurements also exhibit an anomaly at ~230 K suggesting the presence of magnetodielectric coupling in YCrO3, with a possibility towards a relatively high temperature magnetodielectric system.",3
Engineered superlattices with crossover from decoupled to synthetic ferromagnetic behavior.,"The extent of interfacial charge transfer and the resulting impact on magnetic interactions were investigated as a function of sublayer thickness in La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/La0.7Sr0.3CoO3 ferromagnetic superlattices. Element-specific soft x-ray magnetic spectroscopy reveals that the electronic structure is altered within 5-6 unit cells of the chemical interface, and can lead to a synthetic ferromagnet with strong magnetic coupling between the sublayers. The saturation magnetization and coercivity depends sensitively on the sublayer thickness due to the length scale of this interfacial effect. For larger sublayer thicknesses, the La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 and La0.7Sr0.3CoO3 sublayers are magnetically decoupled, displaying two independent magnetic transitions with little sublayer thickness dependence. These results demonstrate how interfacial phenomena at perovskite oxide interfaces can be used to tailor their functional properties at the atomic scale.",3

Glassy magnetic ground state and Kondo-like behaviour in Mn10FeGe8 alloy.,"We report a detailed investigation of the ground-state magnetic properties of newly synthesized [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] alloy. The sample can be thought of being derived by substituting one Mn atom by Fe of the parent compound [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text]. Fe-substitution leads to a drastic change in the magnetic ground state as well as to the magneto-transport properties of the parent alloy. On cooling below 250 K, [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] undergoes a transition from paramagnetic phase to a state having significant ferromagnetic correlations. The ground state is found to be canonical spin glass (CSG) type in nature as evident from the dc magnetization and ac susceptibility measurements. Interestingly, the resistivity data shows an upturn at low temperature below about 30 K, mimicking Kondo-like behaviour. [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] turns out to be a rare example among 3d transition metal alloys, where a Kondo-like state coexists within a CSG phase.",3
Temperature and impurity effect on parallel field magnetoconductance of bulk insulating topological insulator (Bi1-x Sb x )2Te3.,"We have performed a systematic parallel field magnetotransport studies of (Bi1-x Sb x )2Te3 to understand the temperature and impurity effect on the interference of bulk conductance on the surface states of highly insulating topologically insulating compound Bi2Te3. The compound exhibits a weak antilocalization effect (WAL) at low temperature and low magnetic field. WAL weakens and a weak localization effect is observed to be developed in the compound with the increase in temperature due to the creation of topologically trivial 2D electron gas states. Strong interlayer interference and coupling of bulk carriers with surface states are observed at low temperature. A similar temperature effect is observed for all concentrations of Sb. Topologically protected surface states enhance with the increase in Sb contents up to x = 0.3; however, a further increase in Sb concentration leads to a decrease in surface states. The data has been analysed via the generalised Altshuler and Aronov model for parallel field transport anticipating weak antilocalization and interlayer interference.",3
Semiconductor of spinons: from Ising band insulator to orthogonal band insulator.,"We use the ionic Hubbard model to study the effects of strong correlations on a two-dimensional semiconductor. The spectral gap in the limit where on-site interactions are zero is set by the staggered ionic potential, while in the strong interaction limit it is set by the Hubbard U. Combining mean field solutions of the slave spin and slave rotor methods, we propose two interesting gapped phases in between: (i) the insulating phase before the Mott phase can be viewed as gapping a non-Fermi liquid state of spinons by the staggered ionic potential. The quasi-particles of underlying spinons are orthogonal to physical electrons, giving rise to the 'ARPES-dark' state where the ARPES gap will be larger than the optical and thermal gap. (ii) The Ising insulator corresponding to ordered phase of the Ising variable is characterized by single-particle excitations whose dispersion is controlled by Ising-like temperature and field dependences. The temperature can be conveniently employed to drive a phase transition between these two insulating phases where Ising exponents become measurable by ARPES and cyclotron resonance. The rare earth monochalcogenide semiconductors where the magneto-resistance is anomalously large can be a candidate system for the Ising band insulator. We argue that the Ising and orthogonal insulating phases require strong enough ionic potential to survive the downward renormalization of the ionic potential caused by Hubbard U.",3
Electrical resistivity and wave character of free electrons in amorphous and nanoglass Sc<sub>75</sub>Fe<sub>25</sub>.,"The residual electrical resistivity of metallic amorphous alloys, rho0, is typically in the range 50 muOmega cm &lt; rho0 &lt; 310 muOmega cm corresponding to a mean free path of conduction electrons of order a few interatomic distances. In crystalline metals with low defect levels such as Cu however, the residual electrical resistivity is about rho0 approximately 1.54 x 10-2 muOmega cm, leading to extensive progression of free electrons through the crystalline material, of typically up to 4 x 106 nm. The relatively ""high"" values for the electrical resistivity of distorted Sc75Fe25 alloys are discussed here within the framework of the wave character of electrons. The present investigation of amorphous and nanoglass Sc75Fe25 over the temperature range 1.9 - 320 K, focuses on clarification of the temperature dependence of the resistivity, rho(T). These alloys systems, which show a range of behaviours for temperature dependent resistivity - including temperature independent residual resistivity, as well as positive and negative polarities for the slope drho(T)/dT - are examined in detail.",3
Crystal growth and transport properties of Weyl semimetal TaAs.,"We report the single crystal growth and transport properties of a Weyl semimetal TaAs. Unsaturated large magnetoresistance of about 22 100% at 2 K and 9 T is observed. From the Hall measurement, carrier concentrations n = 4.608 x 10(24) m(-3) and p = 3.099 x 10(24) m(-3), and mobilities micro p = 2.502 m(2) V(-1) s(-1) and micro n = 16.785 m(2) V(-1) s(-1) at 2 K are extracted. The de Haas-van Alphen oscillations at 2 K and 9 T suggest the presence of a Fermi surface, and the quantum electronic parameters such as effective cyclotron mass and Dingle temperature were obtained using Lifshitz-Kosevich fitting. Temperature dependent resistivity measurements at different static magnetic fields suggest the formation of an insulating gap in the Weyl semimetal TaAs. An angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy study reveals Fermi arc surface states with different shaped features such as a long elliptical contour around each [Formula: see text] point, a bowtie-shaped contour around each [Formula: see text] point, and a crescent-shaped feature near the midpoint of each [Formula: see text] line.",3
Planar screening by charge polydisperse counterions.,"We study how a neutralising cloud of counterions screens the electric field of a uniformly charged planar membrane (plate), when the counterions are characterised by a distribution of charges (or valence), [Formula: see text]. We work out analytically the one-plate and two-plate cases, at the level of non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann theory. The (essentially asymptotic) predictions are successfully compared to numerical solutions of the full Poisson-Boltzmann theory, but also to Monte Carlo simulations. The counterions with smallest valence control the long-distance features of interactions, and may qualitatively change the results pertaining to the classic monodisperse case where all counterions have the same charge. Emphasis is put on continuous distributions [Formula: see text], for which new power-laws can be evidenced, be it for the ionic density or the pressure, in the one- and two-plates situations respectively. We show that for discrete distributions, more relevant for experiments, these scaling laws persist in an intermediate but yet observable range. Furthermore, it appears that from a practical point of view, hallmarks of the continuous [Formula: see text] behaviour are already featured by discrete mixtures with a relatively small number of constituents.",3
All-spinel oxide Josephson junctions for high-efficiency spin filtering.,Obtaining high efficiency spin filtering at room temperature using spinel ferromagnetic tunnel barriers has been hampered by the formation of antiphase boundaries due to their difference in lattice parameters between barrier and electrodes. In this work we demonstrate the use of LiTi2O4 thin films as electrodes in an all-spinel oxide CoFe2O4-based spin filter devices. These structures show nearly perfect epitaxy maintained throughout the structure and so minimise the potential for APBs formation. The LiTi2O4 in these devices is superconducting and so measurements at low temperature have been used to explore details of the tunnelling and Josephson junction behaviour.,3
"Site occupancy, composition and magnetic structure dependencies of martensitic transformation in Mn<sub>2</sub>Ni<sub>1+x</sub>Sn<sub>1-x</sub>.","A delicate balance between various factors such as site occupancy, composition and magnetic ordering seems to affect the stability of the martensitic phase in Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;1+x&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt ;. Using first-principles DFT calculations, we explore the impacts of each one of these factors on the martensitic stability of this system. Our results on total energies, magnetic moments and electronic structures upon changes in the composition, the magnetic configurations and the site occupancies show that the occupancies at the 4d sites in the Inverse Heusler crystal structure play the most crucial role. The presence of Mn at the 4d sites originally occupied by Sn and its interaction with the Mn atoms at other sites decide the stability of the martensitic phases. This explains the discrepancy between the experiments and earlier DFT calculations regarding phase stability in Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NiSn. Our results qualitatively explain the trends observed experimentally with regard to martensitic phase stability and the magnetisations in Ni-excess, Sn-deficient Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NiSn system.",3
"Structural, magnetic and electronic properties of pulsed-laser-deposition grown SrFeO3-delta thin films and SrFeO3-delta /La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 multilayers.","We studied the structural, magnetic and electronic properties of [Formula: see text] (SFO) thin films and [Formula: see text]/[Formula: see text] [Formula: see text]MnO3 (LCMO) superlattices that have been grown with pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] (LSAT) substrates. X-ray reflectometry and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) confirm the high structural quality of the films and flat and atomically sharp interfaces of the superlattices. The STEM data also reveal a difference in the interfacial layer stacking with a SrO layer at the LCMO/SFO and a LaO layer at the SFO/LCMO interfaces along the PLD growth direction. The x-ray diffraction (XRD) data suggest that the as grown SFO films and SFO/LCMO superlattices have an oxygen-deficient [Formula: see text] structure with I4/ mmm space group symmetry ([Formula: see text]). Subsequent ozone annealed SFO films are consistent with an almost oxygen stoichiometric structure ([Formula: see text]). The electronic and magnetic properties of these SFO films are similar to the ones of corresponding single crystals. In particular, the as grown [Formula: see text] films are insulating whereas the ozone annealed films are metallic. The magneto-resistance effects of the as grown SFO films have a similar magnitude as in the single crystals, but extend over a much wider temperature range. Last but not least, for the SFO/LCMO superlattices we observe a rather large exchange bias effect that varies as a function of the cooling field.",3
Prediction of phonon-mediated superconductivity in hole-doped black phosphorus.,"We study the conventional electron-phonon mediated superconducting properties of hole-doped black phosphorus by density functional calculations and get quite a large electron-phonon coupling (EPC) constant lambda ~ 1.0 with transition temperature T C ~ 10 K, which is comparable to MgB2 when holes are doped into the degenerate and nearly flat energy bands around the Fermi level. We predict that the softening of low-frequency [Formula: see text] optical mode and its phonon displacement, which breaks the lattice nonsymmorphic symmetry of gliding plane and lifts the band double degeneracy, lead to a large EPC. These factors are favorable for BCS superconductivity.",3
"Aggregate frequency width, nuclear hyperfine coupling and Jahn-Teller effect of Cu(2+) impurity ion ESR in SrLaAlO4 dielectric resonator at 20 millikelvin.","The impurity paramagnetic ion, [Formula: see text] substitutes Al in the [Formula: see text] single crystal lattice, this results in a [Formula: see text] elongated octahedron, and the resulting measured g-factors satisfy four-fold axes variation condition. The aggregate frequency width of the electron spin resonance with the required minimum level of impurity concentration has been evaluated in this single crystal [Formula: see text] at 20 millikelvin. Measured parallel hyperfine constants, [Formula: see text], were determined to be [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] at [Formula: see text] for the nuclear magnetic quantum number [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text] respectively. The anisotropy of the hyperfine structure reveals the characteristics of the static Jahn-Teller effect. The second-order-anisotropy term, [Formula: see text], is significant and cannot be disregarded, with the local strain dominating over the observed Zeeman-anisotropy-energy difference. The Bohr electron magneton, [Formula: see text], (within [Formula: see text] so-called experimental error) has been found using the measured spin-Hamiltonian parameters. Measured nuclear dipolar hyperfine structure parameter [Formula: see text] shows that the mean inverse third power of the electron distance from the nucleus is [Formula: see text] a.u. for [Formula: see text] ion in the substituted [Formula: see text] ion site assuming nuclear electric quadruple moment [Formula: see text] barn.",3
Nonlinear modeling of crystal system transition of black phosphorus using continuum-DFT model.,"In this paper, the nonlinear behavior of black phosphorus crystals is investigated in tandem with dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D) analysis under uniaxial loadings. From the identified anisotropic behavior of black phosphorus due to its morphological anisotropy, a hyperelastic anisotropic (HA) model named continuum-DFT is established to predict the nonlinear behavior of the material. In this respect, uniaxial Cauchy stresses are employed on both the DFT-D and HA models along the zig-zag and armchair directions. Simultaneously, the transition of the crystal system is recognized at about 4.5 GPa of the applied uniaxial tensile stress along the zig-zag direction on the DFT-D simulation in the nonlinear region. In order to develop the nonlinear continuum model, unknown constants are surveyed with the optimized least square technique. In this regard, the continuum model is obtained to reproduce the Cauchy stress-stretch and density of strain-stretch results of the DFT-D simulation. Consequently, the modified HA model is introduced to characterize the nonlinear behavior of black phosphorus along the zig-zag direction. More importantly, the specific transition of the crystal system is successfully predicted in the new modified continuum-DFT model. The results reveal that the multiscale continuum-DFT model is well defined to replicate the nonlinear behavior of black phosphorus along the zig-zag and armchair directions.",3
Electron trap states at InGaAs/oxide interfaces under inversion through constant Fermi-level ab initio molecular dynamics.,"We employ constant-Fermi-level ab initio molecular dynamics to investigate defects at the InGaAs/oxide interface upon inversion. We adopt a substoichiometric amorphous model for modelling the structure at the interface and investigate the formation of defect structures upon setting the Fermi-level above the conduction band minimum. The defect formation is detected through both an analysis of the atomic structure and a Wannier-decomposition of the electronic structure. This computer driven approach is able to retrieve In and Ga lone-pair defects and As-As dimer/dangling bond defects, in agreement with previous studies based on physical intuition. In addition, the present simulation reveals hitherto unidentified defect structures consisting of metallic In-In, In-Ga, and Ga-Ga bonds. The defect charge transition levels of such metallic bonds in Al2O3 are then determined through a hybrid functional scheme and found to be consistent with the defect density measured at InGaAs/Al2O3 interfaces. Hence, we conclude that both In and Ga lone pairs dangling bonds and metallic In-In bonds are valid candidate defects for charge trapping at InGaAs/oxide interfaces upon charge carier inversion. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of constant-Fermi-level ab initio molecular dynamics in revealing and identifying defects at InGaAs/oxide interfaces.",3
Strain coupling of oxygen non-stoichiometry in perovskite thin films.,"The effects of strain and oxygen vacancies on perovskite thin films have been studied in great detail over the past decades and have been treated separately from each other. While epitaxial strain has been realized as a tuning knob to tailor the functional properties of correlated oxides, oxygen vacancies are usually regarded as undesirable and detrimental. In transition metal oxides, oxygen defects strongly modify the properties and functionalities via changes in oxidation states of the transition metals. However, such coupling is not well understood in epitaxial films, but rather deemed as cumbersome or experimental artifact. Only recently it has been recognized that lattice strain and oxygen non-stoichiometry are strongly correlated in a vast number of perovskite systems and that this coupling can be beneficial for information and energy technologies. Recent experimental and theoretical studies have focused on understanding the correlated phenomena between strain and oxygen vacancies for a wide range of perovskite systems. These correlations not only include the direct relationship between elastic strain and the formation energy of oxygen vacancies, but also comprise highly complex interactions such as strain-induced phase transitions due to oxygen vacancy ordering. Therefore, we aim in this review to give a comprehensive overview on the coupling between strain and oxygen vacancies in perovskite oxides and point out the potential applications of the emergent functionalities strongly coupled to oxygen vacancies.",3
"Structure, magnetism and electronic properties in 3d-5d based double perovskite ([Formula: see text]Y x )2FeIrO6.","The 3d-5d based double perovskites are of current interest as they provide model systems to study the interplay between electronic correlation (U) and spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Here, we report detailed structural, magnetic and transport properties of doped double perovskite material ([Formula: see text]Y x )2FeIrO6 with [Formula: see text]. With substitution of Y, the system retains its original crystal structure but structural parameters change with x in nonmonotonic fashion. The magnetization data for Sr2FeIrO6 show antiferromagnetic type magnetic transition around 45 K; however, a close inspection of the data indicates a weak magnetic phase transition around 120 K. No change of structural symmetry has been observed down to low temperature, although the lattice parameters show sudden changes around the magnetic transitions. Sr2FeIrO6 shows an insulating behavior over the whole temperature range, which nevertheless does not change with Y substitution. The nature of charge conduction is found to follow thermally activated Mott's variable range hopping and power law behavior for parent and doped samples, respectively. Interestingly, evolution of structural, magnetic and transport behavior in ([Formula: see text]Y x )2FeIrO6 is observed to reverse with [Formula: see text], which is believed to arise due to a change in the transition metal ionic state.",3
Recent trends in spin-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy.,"Since the discovery of the Rashba effect on crystal surfaces and also the discovery of topological insulators, spin- and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (SARPES) has become more and more important, as the technique can measure directly the electronic band structure of materials with spin resolution. In the same way that the discovery of high-Tc superconductors promoted the development of high-resolution angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, the discovery of this new class of materials has stimulated the development of new SARPES apparatus with new functions and higher resolution, such as spin vector analysis, ten times higher energy and angular resolution than conventional SARPES, multichannel spin detection, and so on. In addition, the utilization of vacuum ultra violet lasers also opens a pathway to the realization of novel SARPES measurements. In this review, such recent trends in SARPES techniques and measurements will be overviewed.",3
Control of active turbulence through addressable soft interfaces.,"We present an experimental study of a kinesin/tubulin active nematic formed at different oil interfaces. By tuning the interfacial rheology of the contacting oil, we have been able to condition and control the seemingly chaotic motion that characterizes the self-sustained active flows in our preparations. The active nematic is inherently unstable and spontaneously develops defects from an initial homogeneous state. We show that the steady state and, in particular, the density and dynamics of the defects strongly depends on the rheology of the contacting oil. Using a smectic-A thermotropic liquid crystal as the oil phase, we pattern the interface thanks to the anisotropy of the shear viscosity in this material. The geometry of the active nematic adapts to the boundary conditions at the interface by changing from the so-called active turbulent regime to laminar flows along the easy flow directions. The latter can be either a lattice of self-assembled circular paths or reconfigurable homogeneous orientations that can be addressed by means of an external magnetic field. We show that, under all confinement conditions, the spatiotemporal modes exhibited by the active liquid are consistent with a single intrinsic length scale, which can be tuned by the material parameters, and obey basic topological requirements imposed on the defects that drive the active flows. Future control strategies, including a tunable depleting agent, are discussed.",3
Indirect K-edge bimagnon resonant inelastic x-ray scattering spectrum of alpha-FeTe.,"We calculate the K-edge indirect bimagnon resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) intensity spectra of the bicollinear antiferromagnetic order known to occur in the alpha-FeTe chalcogenide system. Utilizing linear spin wave theory for this large-S spin system we find that the bimagnon spectrum contains four scattering channels (two intraband and two interband). We find from our calculations that for suitable energy-momentum combination the RIXS spectra can exhibit a one-, two- or three- peak structure. The number of peaks provides a clue on the various bimagnon excitation processes that can be supported both in and within the acoustic and optical magnon branches of the bicollinear antiferromagnet. Unlike the RIXS response of the antiferromagnetic or the collinear antiferromagnetic spin ordering, the RIXS intensity spectrum of the bicollinear antiferromagnet does not vanish at the magnetic ordering wave vector [Formula: see text]. It is also sensitive to next-next nearest neighbor and biquadratic coupling interactions. Our predicted RIXS spectrum can be utilized to understand the role of multi-channel bimagnon spin excitations present in the alpha-FeTe chalcogenide.",3
Membrane vesiculation induced by proteins of the dengue virus envelope studied by molecular dynamics simulations.,"Biological membranes are continuously remodeled in the cell by specific membrane-shaping machineries to form, for example, tubes and vesicles. We examine fundamental mechanisms involved in the vesiculation processes induced by a cluster of envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins of the dengue virus (DENV) using molecular dynamics simulations and a coarse-grained model. We show that an arrangement of three E-M heterotetramers (EM3) works as a bending unit and an ordered cluster of five such units generates a closed vesicle, reminiscent of the virus budding process. In silico mutagenesis of two charged residues of the anchor helices of the envelope proteins of DENV shows that Arg-471 and Arg-60 are fundamental to produce bending stress on the membrane. The fine-tuning between the size of the EM3 unit and its specific bending action suggests this protein unit is an important factor in determining the viral particle size.",3
Magnetic behavior of metastable Fe films grown on Ir(111).,"We investigated the growth of ultra-thin Fe films on Ir(111) by means of &lt;i&gt;in-situ&lt;/i&gt; low energy electron diffraction and spin-resolved photoemission techniques. We observe a (1x1) diffraction pattern, characteristic of the &lt;i&gt;fcc&lt;/i&gt; substrate, below 4 monolayers (ML). Then, a complex superstructure starts to develop, compatible with the formation of &lt;i&gt;bcc&lt;/i&gt;-like Fe domains aligned with the substrate according to the Kourdjumov-Sachs orientation relationships. The analysis of the diffraction patterns reveals a progressive evolution towards a fully relaxed &lt;i&gt;bcc&lt;/i&gt; lattice, characteristic of bulk Fe. Both photoemission (filled states) and inverse photoemission (empty states) results show characteristic features related to the contribution of the Fe layer, evolving towards those observed on the Fe (110) &lt;i&gt;bcc&lt;/i&gt; surface. Spin resolution allows to detect a spectral polarization above 4 ML corresponding to the formation of bcc Fe, which gradually increases indicating the formation of an in-plane magnetized ferromagnetic layer in thick films. No in-plane net magnetization is detected in thinner films, independent of the sample temperature down to 30 K. Following recent investigations on the Fe/Ir(111) system with microscopy techniques, we link this observation to the stabilization of a non collinear spin structure yielding an overall nil magnetization.",3
A coarse-grained polarizable force field for the ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate.,"We present a coarse-grained polarizable molecular dynamics force field for the ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([BMIm][PF6]). For the treatment of electronic polarizability, we employ the Drude model. Our results show that the new explicitly polarizable force field reproduces important static and dynamic properties such as mass density, enthalpy of vaporization, diffusion coefficients, or electrical conductivity in the relevant temperature range. In situations where an explicit treatment of electronic polarizability might be crucial, we expect the force field to be an improvement over non-polarizable models, while still profiting from the reduction of computational cost due to the coarse-grained representation.",3
Density functional study of carbon vacancies in titanium carbide.,"It is well established that TiC contains carbon vacancies not only in carbon-deficient environments but also in carbon-rich environments. We have performed density functional calculations of the vacancy formation energy in TiC for C- as well as Ti-rich conditions using several different approximations to the exchange-correlation functional, and also carefully considering the nature and thermodynamics of the carbon reference state, as well as the effect of varying growth conditions. We find that the formation of carbon vacancies is clearly favorable under Ti-rich conditions, whereas it is slightly energetically unfavorable under C-rich conditions. Furthermore, we find that the relaxations of the atoms close to the vacancy site are rather long-ranged, and that these relaxations contribute significantly to the stabilization of the vacancy. Since carbon vacancies in TiC are also experimentally observed in carbon-rich environments, we conclude that kinetics may play an important role. This conclusion is consistent with the experimentally observed high activation energies and sluggish diffusion of vacancies in TiC, effectively causing a freezing in of the vacancies.",3
On atomic mechanisms governing the oxidation of Bi2Te3.,"Oxidation of Bi2Te3 (space group R [Formula: see text] m) has been investigated using experimental and theoretical means. Based on calorimetry, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and thermodynamic modelling, Bi2Te3 is at equilibrium with Bi2O3 and TeO2, whereby the most stable compound is Bi2Te3, followed by Bi2O3. The reactivity of Bi towards oxygen is expected to be higher than that of Te. This notion is supported by density functional theory. The strongest bond is formed between Bi and Te, followed by Bi-O. This gives rise to unanticipated atomic processes. Dissociatively adsorbed oxygen diffuses through Bi and Te basal planes of Bi2Te3(0 0 0 1) and preferably interacts with Bi. The Te termination considerably retards this process. These findings may clarify conflicting literature data. Any basal plane off-cut or Bi terminations trigger oxidation, but a perfect basal cleavage, where only Te terminations are exposed to air, may be stable for a longer period of time. These results are of relevance for applications in which surfaces are of key importance, such as nanostructured Bi2Te3 thermoelectric devices.",3
"Crystal, magnetic, calorimetric and electronic structure investigation of GdScGe1-x Sb x compounds.","Experimental investigations of crystal structure, magnetism and heat capacity of compounds in the pseudoternary GdScGe-GdScSb system combined with density functional theory projections have been employed to clarify the interplay between the crystal structure and magnetism in this series of RTX materials (R = rare-earth, [Formula: see text] = transition metal and X = p-block element). We demonstrate that the CeScSi-type structure adopted by GdScGe and CeFeSi-type structure adopted by GdScSb coexist over a limited range of compositions [Formula: see text]. Antimony for Ge substitutions in GdScGe result in an anisotropic expansion of the unit cell of the parent that is most pronounced along the c axis. We believe that such expansion acts as the driving force for the instability of the double layer CeScSi-type structure of the parent germanide. Extensive, yet limited Sb substitutions [Formula: see text] lead to a strong reduction of the Curie temperature compared to the GdScGe parent, but without affecting the saturation magnetization. With a further increase in Sb content, the first compositions showing the presence of the CeFeSi-type structure of the antimonide, [Formula: see text], coincide with the appearance of an antiferromagnetic phase. The application of a finite magnetic field reveals a jump in magnetization toward a fully saturated ferromagnetic state. This antiferro-ferromagnetic transformation is not associated with a sizeable latent heat, as confirmed by heat capacity measurements. The electronic structure calculations for [Formula: see text] indicate that the key factor in the conversion from the ferromagnetic CeScSi-type to the antiferromagnetic CeFeSi-type structure is the disappearance of the induced magnetic moments on Sc. For the parent antimonide, heat capacity measurements indicate an additional transition below the main antiferromagnetic transition.",3
