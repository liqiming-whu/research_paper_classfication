Dennis Slamon's early interest in understanding genes that viruses co-opt to become powerful proliferative agents ultimately led him and his colleagues and collaborators to the development of trastuzumab (Herceptin) for the treatment of HER-2-positive breast cancer. His work set the stage for current "givens" like genetic stratification of patients for treatment and using antibodies as therapeutics. Cell editor Lara Szewczak spoke with Dennis, the recipient of the 2019 Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award, to discuss the research leading to trastuzumab and his views on how current progress in treating cancers may impact the US health care system. Excerpts from this conversation are presented below, and the full conversation is available with the article online.
