The engineering of catalysts with desirable properties can be accelerated by
computer-aided design. To achieve this aim, features of molecular catalysts can
be condensed into numerical descriptors that can then be used to correlate
reactivity and structure. Based on such descriptors, we have introduced
topographic steric maps that provide a three-dimensional image of the catalytic
pocket-the region of the catalyst where the substrate binds and reacts-enabling
it to be visualized and also reshaped by changing various parameters. These
topographic steric maps, especially when used in conjunction with density
functional theory calculations, enable catalyst structural modifications to be
explored quickly, making the online design of new catalysts accessible to the
wide chemical community. In this Perspective, we discuss the application of
topographic steric maps either to rationalize the behaviour of known
catalysts-from synthetic molecular species to metalloenzymes-or to design
improved catalysts.

Polyacetylene (PA) comprises one-dimensional chains of sp2-hybridized carbon
atoms that may take a cis or trans configuration. Owing to its simple chemical
structure and exceptional electronic properties, PA is an ideal system to
understand the nature of charge transport in conducting polymers. Here, we report
the on-surface synthesis of both cis- and trans-PA chains and their atomic-scale 
characterization. The structure of individual PA chains was imaged by non-contact
atomic force microscopy, which confirmed the formation of PA by resolving single 
chemical bond units. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy suggests a
semiconductor-to-metal transition through doping-induced suppression of the
Peierls bond alternation of trans-PA on Cu(110). Electronically decoupled
trans-PAs exhibit a band gap of 2.4 eV following copper oxide intercalation. Our 
study provides a platform for studying individual PA chains in real and
reciprocal space, which may be further extended to study the intrinsic properties
of non-linear excitons in conducting polymers.

The ability to functionalize hydrocarbons with CO2 could create opportunities for
high-volume CO2 utilization. However, current methods to form carbon-carbon bonds
between hydrocarbons and CO2 require stoichiometric consumption of very
resource-intensive reagents to overcome the low reactivity of these substrates.
Here, we report a simple semi-continuous cycle that converts aromatic
hydrocarbons, CO2 and alcohol into aromatic esters without consumption of
stoichiometric reagents. Our strategy centres on the use of solid bases composed 
of an alkali carbonate (M2CO3, where M+ = K+ or Cs+) dispersed over a mesoporous 
support. Nanoscale confinement disrupts the crystallinity of M2CO3 and engenders 
strong base reactivity at intermediate temperatures. The overall cycle involves
two distinct steps: (1) CO32--promoted C-H carboxylation, in which the
hydrocarbon substrate is deprotonated by the supported M2CO3 and reacts with CO2 
to form a supported carboxylate (RCO2M); and (2) methylation, in which RCO2M
reacts with methanol and CO2 to form an isolable methyl ester with concomitant
regeneration of M2CO3.

ortho-Aminomethylphenylboronic acids are used in receptors for carbohydrates and 
various other compounds containing vicinal diols. The presence of the
o-aminomethyl group enhances the affinity towards diols at neutral pH, and the
manner in which this group plays this role has been a topic of debate. Further,
the aminomethyl group is believed to be involved in the turn-on of the emission
properties of appended fluorophores upon diol binding. In this treatise, a
uniform picture emerges for the role of this group: it primarily acts as an
electron-withdrawing group that lowers the pKa of the neighbouring boronic acid
thereby facilitating diol binding at neutral pH. The amine appears to play no
role in the modulation of the fluorescence of appended fluorophores in the
protic-solvent-inserted form of the boronic acid/boronate ester. Instead,
fluorescence turn-on can be consistently tied to vibrational-coupled
excited-state relaxation (a loose-bolt effect). Overall, this Review unifies and 
discusses the existing data as of 2019 whilst also highlighting why o-aminomethyl
groups are so widely used, and the role they play in carbohydrate sensing using
phenylboronic acids.

The electroreduction of CO2 is a promising technology for carbon utilization.
Although electrolysis of CO2 or CO2-derived CO can generate important industrial 
multicarbon feedstocks such as ethylene, ethanol, n-propanol and acetate, most
efforts have been devoted to promoting C-C bond formation. Here, we demonstrate
that C-N bonds can be formed through co-electrolysis of CO and NH3 with acetamide
selectivity of nearly 40% at industrially relevant reaction rates. Full-solvent
quantum mechanical calculations show that acetamide forms through nucleophilic
addition of NH3 to a surface-bound ketene intermediate, a step that is in
competition with OH- addition, which leads to acetate. The C-N formation
mechanism was successfully extended to a series of amide products through amine
nucleophilic attack on the ketene intermediate. This strategy enables us to form 
carbon-heteroatom bonds through the electroreduction of CO, expanding the scope
of products available from CO2 reduction.

The regulation of cellular dynamics and responses to stimuli by genetic
regulatory networks suggests how in vitro chemical reaction networks might
analogously direct the dynamics of synthetic materials or chemistries. A key step
in developing genetic regulatory network analogues capable of this type of
sophisticated regulation is the integration of multiple coordinated functions
within a single network. Here, we demonstrate how such functional integration can
be achieved using in vitro transcriptional genelet circuits that emulate
essential features of cellular genetic regulatory networks. By successively
incorporating functional genelet modules into a bistable circuit, we construct an
integrated regulatory network that dynamically changes its state in response to
upstream stimuli and coordinates the timing of downstream signal expression. We
use quantitative models to guide module integration and develop strategies to
mitigate undesired interactions between network components that arise as the size
of the network increases. This approach could enable the construction of in vitro
networks capable of multifaceted chemical and material regulation.

The importance of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) for reversible operation
of Li-ion batteries has been well established, but the understanding of its
chemistry remains incomplete. The current consensus on the identity of the major 
organic SEI component is that it consists of lithium ethylene di-carbonate
(LEDC), which is thought to have high Li-ion conductivity, but low electronic
conductivity (to protect the Li/C electrode). Here, we report on the synthesis
and structural and spectroscopic characterizations of authentic LEDC and lithium 
ethylene mono-carbonate (LEMC). Direct comparisons of the SEI grown on graphite
anodes suggest that LEMC, instead of LEDC, is likely to be the major SEI
component. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies on LEMC and lithium methyl
carbonate (LMC) reveal unusual layered structures and Li+ coordination
environments. LEMC has Li+ conductivities of >1 × 10-6 S cm-1, while LEDC is
almost an ionic insulator. The complex interconversions and equilibria of LMC,
LEMC and LEDC in dimethyl sulfoxide solutions are also investigated.

A fundamental bonding model in coordination and organometallic chemistry is the
synergic, donor-acceptor interaction between a metal and a neutral π-acceptor
ligand, in which the ligand σ donates to the metal, which π back-bonds to the
ligand. This interaction typically involves a metal with an electron-rich, mid-, 
low- or even negative oxidation state and a ligand with a π* orbital. Here, we
report that treatment of a uranium-carbene complex with an organoazide produces a
uranium(V)-bis(imido)-dinitrogen complex, stabilized by a lithium counterion.
This complex, which was isolated in a crystalline form, involves an
electron-poor, high-oxidation-state uranium(V) 5f1 ion that is π back-bonded to
the poor π-acceptor ligand dinitrogen. We propose that this is made possible by a
combination of cooperative heterobimetallic uranium-lithium effects and the
presence of suitable ancillary ligands that render the uranium ion unusually
electron rich. This electron-poor back-bonding could have implications for the
field of dinitrogen activation.

Nanomaterials are known to display chemical and physical behaviours that are
different from those of their bulk counterparts, but assembly processes in the
sub-nanometre region are difficult to control. The early growth of nanomaterials 
is typically thought to involve two separate steps: nucleation and the growth
stage, as described by the LaMer model. Control of the shape and size of the
final structure is typically determined during the growth stage by interactions
between the nuclei and surrounding monomers. Here, we show that clusters with
well-defined structures, such as polyoxometalates, can intervene at the
nucleation stage of nickel oxysulfide and nickel-cobalt hydroxide by
co-assembling with nuclei to produce uniform binary assemblies. Those can, in
turn, incorporate a third, or also a fourth, type of nanocluster to form ternary 
or quaternary assemblies, respectively. Both binary and ternary assemblies are
shown to serve as efficient atomic-site catalysts for room-temperature gasoline
desulfurization and stereoselective catalytic reactions.

Singlet fission-that is, the generation of two triplets from a lone singlet
state-has recently resurfaced as a promising process for the generation of
multiexcitons in organic systems. Although advances in this area have led to the 
discovery of modular classes of chromophores, controlling the fate of the
multiexciton states has been a major challenge; for example, promoting fast
multiexciton generation while maintaining long triplet lifetimes. Unravelling the
dynamical evolution of the spin- and energy conversion processes from the
transition of singlet excitons to correlated triplet pairs and individual triplet
excitons is necessary to design materials that are optimized for translational
technologies. Here, we engineer molecules featuring a discrete energy gradient
that promotes the migration of strongly coupled triplet pairs to a spatially
separated, weakly coupled state that readily dissociates into free triplets. This
'energy cleft' concept allows us to combine the amplification and migration
processes within a single molecule, with rapid dissociation of tightly bound
triplet pairs into individual triplets that exhibit lifetimes of ~20 µs.

The well-established oxidative addition-reductive elimination pathway is the most
followed one in transition metal-catalysed cross-coupling reactions. While
readily occurring with a series of transition metals, gold(I) complexes have
shown some reluctance to undergo oxidative addition unless special sets of
ligands on gold(I), reagents or reaction conditions are used. Here we show that
under visible-light irradiation, an iridium photocatalyst triggers-via triplet
sensitization-the oxidative addition of an alkynyl iodide onto a vinylgold(I)
intermediate to deliver C(sp)2-C(sp) coupling products after reductive
elimination. Mechanistic and modelling studies support that an energy-transfer
event takes place, rather than a redox pathway. This particular mode of
activation in gold homogenous catalysis was applied in several dual catalytic

Non-equilibrium conditions must have been crucial for the assembly of the first
informational polymers of early life, by supporting their formation and
continuous enrichment in a long-lasting environment. Here, we explore how gas
bubbles in water subjected to a thermal gradient, a likely scenario within
crustal mafic rocks on the early Earth, drive a complex, continuous enrichment of
prebiotic molecules. RNA precursors, monomers, active ribozymes, oligonucleotides
and lipids are shown to (1) cycle between dry and wet states, enabling the
central step of RNA phosphorylation, (2) accumulate at the gas-water interface to
drastically increase ribozymatic activity, (3) condense into hydrogels, (4) form 
pure crystals and (5) encapsulate into protecting vesicle aggregates that
subsequently undergo fission. These effects occur within less than 30 min. The
findings unite, in one location, the physical conditions that were crucial for
the chemical emergence of biopolymers. They suggest that heated microbubbles
could have hosted the first cycles of molecular evolution.

Conversion of ammonia into dinitrogen has attracted broad scientific interest in 
relation to molecular models of the heterogeneous nitrogen fixation process,
environmental treatment for denitrification and utilization of ammonia as an
energy carrier. Here we show that some ruthenium complexes bearing
2,2'-bipyridyl-6,6'-dicarboxylate ligands work as catalysts for the ammonia
oxidation reaction. Production of dinitrogen is observed when ammonium salts are 
treated with a triarylaminium radical as an oxidant and 2,4,6-collidine as a base
in the presence of the ruthenium catalysts. Based on the characterization of some
intermediates, we propose a reaction pathway via a bimetallic nitride-nitride
coupling process. The proposed reaction pathway is supported by density
functional theory calculations. Further investigation of the ammonia oxidation
reaction under the electrochemical conditions revealed that the ruthenium complex
works as a new anode catalyst for ammonia oxidation.

The precise control of the morphology of inorganic materials during their
synthesis is important yet challenging. Here we report that the morphology of a
wide range of inorganic materials, grown by rapid precipitation from a metal
cation solution, can be tuned during their crystallization from one- to
three-dimensional (1D to 3D) structures without the need for capping agents or
templates. This control is achieved by adjusting the balance between the
electrolytic dissociation (α) of the reactants and the supersaturation (S) of the
solutions. Low-α, weak electrolytes promoted the growth of anisotropic (1D and
2D) samples, with 1D materials favoured in particular at low S. In contrast,
isotropic 3D polyhedral structures could only be prepared in the presence of
strong electrolyte reactants (α ≈ 1) with low S. Using this strategy, a wide
range of materials were prepared, including metal oxides, hydroxides, carbonates,
molybdates, oxalates, phosphates, fluorides and iodate with a variety of
morphologies.

LepI is an S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent pericyclase that catalyses the
formation of the 2-pyridone natural product leporin C. Biochemical
characterization has shown that LepI can catalyse stereoselective dehydration to 
yield a reactive (E)-quinone methide that can undergo bifurcating intramolecular 
Diels-Alder (IMDA) and hetero-Diels-Alder (HDA) cyclizations from an ambimodal
transition state, as well as a [3,3]-retro-Claisen rearrangement to recycle the
IMDA product into leporin C. Here, we solve the X-ray crystal structures of
SAM-bound LepI and in complex with a substrate analogue, the product leporin C,
and a retro-Claisen reaction transition-state analogue to understand the
structural basis for the multitude of reactions. Structural and mutational
analysis reveals how nature evolves a classic methyltransferase active site into 
one that can serve as a dehydratase and a multifunctional pericyclase. Catalysis 
of both sets of reactions employs H133 and R295, two active-site residues that
are not found in canonical methyltransferases. An alternative role of SAM, which 
is not found to be in direct contact with the substrate, is also proposed.

The carbon-fluorine bond engenders distinctive physicochemical properties and
significant changes to general reactivity. The development of catalytic,
enantioselective methods to set stereocentres that contain a benzylic C-F bond is
a rapidly evolving goal in synthetic chemistry. Although there have been notable 
advances that enable the construction of secondary stereocentres that contain
both a C-F and a C-H bond on the same carbon, significantly fewer strategies are 
defined to access stereocentres that incorporate a tertiary C-F bond, especially 
those remote from pre-existing activating groups. Here we report a general method
that establishes C-F tertiary benzylic stereocentres by forging a C-C bond via a 
Pd-catalysed enantioselective Heck reaction of acyclic alkenyl fluorides with
arylboronic acids. This method provides a platform to rapidly incorporate
significant functionality about the benzylic tertiary fluoride by virtue of the
diversity of both reaction partners, as well as the ability to install the
stereocentres remotely from pre-existing functional groups.

Two-dimensional materials show a variety of promising properties, and controlling
their growth is an important aspect for practical applications. To this end,
active species such as hydrogen and oxygen are commonly introduced into reactors 
to promote the synthesis of two-dimensional materials with specific
characteristics. Here, we demonstrate that fluorine can play a crucial role in
tuning the growth kinetics of three representative two-dimensional materials
(graphene, hexagonal boron nitride and WS2). When growing graphene by chemical
vapour deposition on a copper foil, fluorine released from the decomposition of a
metal fluoride placed near the copper foil greatly accelerates the growth of the 
graphene (up to a rate of ~200 μm s-1). Theoretical calculations show that it
does so by promoting decomposition of the methane feedstock, which converts the
endothermic growth process to an exothermic one. We further show that the
presence of fluorine also accelerates the growth of two-dimensional hexagonal
boron nitride and WS2.

The coherence and dephasing of vibrational motions of molecules constitute an
integral part of chemical dynamics, influence material properties and underpin
schemes to control chemical reactions. Considerable progress has been made in
understanding vibrational coherence through spectroscopic measurements, but
precise, direct measurement of the structure of a vibrating excited-state
polyatomic organic molecule has remained unworkable. Here, we measure the
time-evolving molecular structure of optically excited N-methylmorpholine through
scattering with ultrashort X-ray pulses. The scattering signals are corrected for
the differences in electron density in the excited electronic state of the
molecule in comparison to the ground state. The experiment maps the evolution of 
the molecular geometry with femtosecond resolution, showing coherent motion that 
survives electronic relaxation and seems to persist for longer than previously
seen using other methods.

Super-resolved fluorescence microscopy techniques have enabled substantial
advances in the chemical and biological sciences. However, they can only
interrogate entities that fluoresce, and most chemical or biological processes do
not involve fluorescent species. Here we report a competition-enabled imaging
technique with super-resolution (COMPEITS) that enables quantitative
super-resolution imaging of non-fluorescent processes. It is based on the
incorporation of competition into a single-molecule fluorescence-detection
scheme. We demonstrate COMPEITS by investigating a photoelectrocatalytic
reaction; we map, with nanometre precision, a non-fluorescent surface reaction
that is important for water decontamination on single photocatalyst particles.
The subparticle-level quantitative information of reactant adsorption affinities 
unambiguously decouples size- and shape-scaling laws on specific particle facets 
and uncovers a surprising biphasic shape dependence, leading to catalyst design
principles for optimal reactant adsorption efficacy. With its ability to provide 
spatially resolved information on the behaviours of unlabelled, non-fluorescent
entities under operando conditions, COMPEITS could interrogate a variety of
surface processes in fields ranging from heterogeneous catalysis and materials
engineering to nanotechnology and energy sciences.

Semisynthetic proteins engineered to contain non-coded elements such as
post-translational modifications (PTMs) represent a powerful class of tools for
interrogating biological processes. Here, we introduce a one-pot, chemoenzymatic 
method that allows broad access to chemically modified proteins. The approach
involves a tandem transamidation reaction cascade that integrates intein-mediated
protein splicing with enzyme-mediated peptide ligation. We show that this
approach can be used to introduce PTMs and biochemical probes into a range of
proteins including Cas9 nuclease and the transcriptional regulator MeCP2, which
causes Rett syndrome when mutated. The versatility of the approach is further
illustrated through the chemical tailoring of histone proteins within a native
chromatin setting. We expect our approach will extend the scope of semisynthesis 
in protein engineering.

Understanding gas-surface reaction dynamics, such as the rupture and formation of
bonds in vibrationally and translationally excited ('hot') molecules, is
important to provide mechanistic insight into heterogeneous catalytic processes. 
Although it has been established that such excitation can affect the reactions
occurring via dissociative mechanisms, for associative mechanisms-in which the
gas-phase reactant collides directly with a surface-adsorbed species-only
translational excitation has been observed to affect reactivity. Here we report a
bond-formation reaction that is driven by the vibrational energy of reactant
molecules and occurs via an (associative) Eley-Rideal-type mechanism, in which
the reaction takes place in a single collision. Hot CO2 in a molecular beam is
found to react with pre-adsorbed hydrogen atoms directly on cold Cu(111) and
Cu(100) surfaces to form formate adspecies. The vibrational energy of CO2 is more
effective at promoting the reaction than translational energy, the reaction rate 
is independent of the surface temperature and the experimental results are
consistent with density functional theory calculations.

Chemical reactions are important in the evolution of low-temperature interstellar
clouds, where the quantum tunnelling effect becomes significant. The
F + para-H2 → HF + H reaction, which has a significant barrier of 1.8 kcal mol-1,
is an important source of HF in interstellar clouds; however, the dynamics of
this quantum-tunnelling-induced reactivity at low temperature is unknown. Here,
we show that this quantum tunnelling is caused by a post-barrier resonance state.
Quantum-state-resolved crossed-beam scattering measurements reveal that this
resonance state has a collision energy of ~5 meV and a lifetime of ~80 fs, which 
are in excellent agreement with a recent anion photoelectron spectroscopic study.
Accurate quantum reactive scattering calculations on the new iCSZ-LWAL potential 
energy surfaces provides a detailed explanation of the experimental results. The 
reaction rate for this system was also theoretically determined accurately at
temperatures as low as 1 K.

In DNA, the loss of a nucleobase by hydrolysis generates an abasic site. Formed
as a result of DNA damage, as well as a key intermediate during the base excision
repair pathway, abasic sites are frequent DNA lesions that can lead to mutations 
and strand breaks. Here we present snAP-seq, a chemical approach that selectively
exploits the reactive aldehyde moiety at abasic sites to reveal their location
within DNA at single-nucleotide resolution. Importantly, the approach resolves
abasic sites from other aldehyde functionalities known to exist in genomic DNA.
snAP-seq was validated on synthetic DNA and then applied to two separate genomes.
We studied the distribution of thymine modifications in the Leishmania major
genome by enzymatically converting these modifications into abasic sites followed
by abasic site mapping. We also applied snAP-seq directly to HeLa DNA to provide 
a map of endogenous abasic sites in the human genome.

Fractal topologies, which are statistically self-similar over multiple length
scales, are pervasive in nature. The recurrence of patterns in fractal-shaped
branched objects, such as trees, lungs and sponges, results in a high surface
area to volume ratio, which provides key functional advantages including
molecular trapping and exchange. Mimicking these topologies in designed
protein-based assemblies could provide access to functional biomaterials. Here we
describe a computational design approach for the reversible self-assembly of
proteins into tunable supramolecular fractal-like topologies in response to
phosphorylation. Guided by atomic-resolution models, we develop fusions of Src
homology 2 (SH2) domain or a phosphorylatable SH2-binding peptide, respectively, 
to two symmetric, homo-oligomeric proteins. Mixing the two designed components
resulted in a variety of dendritic, hyperbranched and sponge-like topologies that
are phosphorylation-dependent and self-similar over three decades (~10 nm-10 μm) 
of length scale, in agreement with models from multiscale computational
simulations. Designed assemblies perform efficient phosphorylation-dependent
capture and release of cargo proteins.

Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are giant enzyme machines that activate
amino acids in an assembly line fashion. As NRPSs are not restricted to the
incorporation of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids, their efficient manipulation
would enable microbial production of a diverse range of peptides; however, the
structural requirements for reprogramming NRPSs to facilitate the production of
new peptides are not clear. Here we describe a new fusion point inside the
condensation domains of NRPSs that results in the development of the exchange
unit condensation domain (XUC) concept, which enables the efficient production of
peptides, even containing non-natural amino acids, in yields up to 280 mg l-1.
This allows the generation of more specific NRPSs, reducing the number of
unwanted peptide derivatives, but also the generation of peptide libraries. The
XUC might therefore be suitable for the future optimization of peptide production
and the identification of bioactive peptide derivatives for pharmaceutical and
other applications.

A promising approach in cancer therapy is to find ligands that directly bind
ubiquitin (Ub) chains. However, finding molecules capable of tightly and
specifically binding Ub chains is challenging given the range of Ub polymer
lengths and linkages and their subtle structural differences. Here, we use total 
chemical synthesis of proteins to generate highly homogeneous Ub chains for
screening against trillion-member macrocyclic peptide libraries (RaPID system).
De novo cyclic peptides were found that can bind tightly and specifically to
K48-linked Ub chains, confirmed by NMR studies. These cyclic peptides protected
K48-linked Ub chains from deubiquitinating enzymes and prevented proteasomal
degradation of Ub-tagged proteins. The cyclic peptides could enter cells, inhibit
growth and induce programmed cell death, opening new opportunities for
therapeutic intervention. This highly synthetic approach, with both protein
target generation and cyclic peptide discovery performed in vitro, will make
other elaborate post-translationally modified targets accessible for drug
discovery.

All real processes, be they chemical, mechanical or electrical, are
thermodynamically irreversible and therefore suffer from thermodynamic losses.
Here, we report the design and operation of a chemical reactor capable of
approaching thermodynamically reversible operation. The reactor was employed for 
hydrogen production via the water-gas shift reaction, an important route to
'green' hydrogen. The reactor avoids mixing reactant gases by transferring oxygen
from the (oxidizing) water stream to the (reducing) carbon monoxide stream via a 
solid-state oxygen reservoir consisting of a perovskite phase (La0.6Sr0.4FeO3-δ).
This reservoir is able to remain close to equilibrium with the reacting gas
streams because of its variable degree of non-stoichiometry and thus develops a
'chemical memory' that we employ to approach reversibility. We demonstrate this
memory using operando, spatially resolved, real-time, high-resolution X-ray
powder diffraction on a working reactor. The design leads to a reactor
unconstrained by overall chemical equilibrium limitations, which can produce
essentially pure hydrogen and carbon dioxide as separate product streams.

In the realm of molecular collision dynamics, stereochemistry refers to the
dependence of the collision outcome on the mutual orientation of the colliding
partners. This may involve directed end-on collisions along a molecular bond axis
or encounters in which the partner approaches the bond of an oriented molecule
from the side. Using both experiment and theory, we show here that in the
simplest case of an inelastic collision between an atom and a nearly homonuclear 
diatom, in which the two atoms have almost the same mass, the scattering dynamics
are very distinct for impacts on either side of the molecule. By recording the
direction of the scattered particles after the collision, we demonstrate that the
intensity of products scattered in the forward direction, near parallel to the
initial motion, can be substantially controlled and even maximized by altering
the side-on orientation of the quantum state selected NO molecules that collide
with Ar atoms. In addition, our findings provide valuable information about the
preferred collision mechanism and reveal interesting quantum interference
effects.

Nature carefully selects specific metal ions for incorporation into the enzymes
that catalyse the chemical reactions necessary for life. Hydrogenases, enzymes
that activate molecular H2, exclusively utilize Ni and Fe in [NiFe]-, [FeFe]- and
[Fe]-hydrogeanses. However, other transition metals are known to activate or
catalyse the production of hydrogen in synthetic systems. Here, we report the
development of a biomimetic model complex of [Fe]-hydrogenase that incorporates a
Mn, as opposed to a Fe, metal centre. This Mn complex is able to heterolytically 
cleave H2 as well as catalyse hydrogenation reactions. The incorporation of the
model into an apoenzyme of [Fe]-hydrogenase results in a [Mn]-hydrogenase with an
enhanced occupancy-normalized activity over an analogous semi-synthetic
[Fe]-hydrogenase. These findings demonstrate a non-native metal hydrogenase that 
shows catalytic functionality and that hydrogenases based on a manganese active
site are viable.

Secondary-sphere interactions serve a fundamental role in controlling the
reactivity and selectivity of organometallic and enzymatic catalysts. However,
there is a dearth of studies that explicitly incorporate secondary-sphere
modifiers into organocatalytic systems. In this work, we introduce an approach
for the in situ systematic modification of organocatalysts in their secondary
sphere through dynamic covalent binding under the reaction conditions. As a
proof-of-concept, we applied boronic acids as secondary-sphere modifiers of
N-heterocyclic carbenes that contained a hydroxy handle. The bound system formed 
in the reaction mixture catalysed the enantioselective benzoin condensations of a
challenging substrate class that contains electron-withdrawing groups. Linear
regression coupled with data visualization served to pinpoint the divergent
origins of enantioselectivity for different substrates and decision tree
algorithms served to formulate selection criteria for the appropriate
secondary-sphere modifiers. The combination of this highly modular catalytic
approach with machine-learning techniques provided mechanistic insights and
guided the streamlined optimization process of a gram-scale reaction at low
organocatalyst loading.

The chemical diversification of natural products provides a robust and general
method for the creation of stereochemically rich and structurally diverse small
molecules. The resulting compounds have physicochemical traits different from
those in most screening collections, and as such are an excellent source for
biological discovery. Herein, we subject the diterpene natural product
pleuromutilin to reaction sequences focused on creating ring system diversity in 
few synthetic steps. This effort resulted in a collection of compounds with
previously unreported ring systems, providing a novel set of structurally diverse
and highly complex compounds suitable for screening in a variety of different
settings. Biological evaluation identified the novel compound ferroptocide, a
small molecule that rapidly and robustly induces ferroptotic death of cancer
cells. Target identification efforts and CRISPR knockout studies reveal that
ferroptocide is an inhibitor of thioredoxin, a key component of the antioxidant
system in the cell. Ferroptocide positively modulates the immune system in a
murine model of breast cancer and will be a useful tool to study the utility of
pro-ferroptotic agents for treatment of cancer.

Defect engineering of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) offers promising
opportunities for tailoring their properties to specific functions and
applications. However, determining the structures of defects in MOFs-either point
defects or extended ones-has proved challenging owing to the difficulty of
directly probing local structures in these typically fragile crystals. Here we
report the real-space observation, with sub-unit-cell resolution, of structural
defects in the catalytic MOF UiO-66 using a combination of low-dose transmission 
electron microscopy and electron crystallography. Ordered 'missing linker' and
'missing cluster' defects were found to coexist. The missing-linker defects,
reconstructed three-dimensionally with high precision, were attributed to
terminating formate groups. The crystallization of the MOF was found to undergo
an Ostwald ripening process, during which the defects also evolve: on prolonged
crystallization, only the missing-linker defects remained. These observations
were rationalized through density functional theory calculations. Finally, the
missing-cluster defects were shown to be more catalytically active than their
missing-linker counterparts for the isomerization of glucose to fructose.

Accurate measurements and assessments of gas adsorption isotherms are important
to characterize porous materials and develop their applications. Although these
isotherms provide knowledge of the overall gas uptake within a material, they do 
not directly give critical information concerning the adsorption behaviour of
adsorbates in each individual pore, especially in porous materials in which
multiple types of pore are present. Here we show how gas adsorption isotherms can
be accurately decomposed into multiple sub-isotherms that correspond to each type
of pore within a material. Specifically, two metal-organic frameworks, PCN-224
and ZIF-412, which contain two and three different types of pore, respectively,
were used to generate isotherms of individual pores by combining gas adsorption
measurements with in situ X-ray diffraction. This isotherm decomposition approach
gives access to information about the gas uptake capacity, surface area and
accessible pore volume of each individual pore, as well as the impact of pore
geometry on the uptake and distribution of different adsorbates within the pores.

Recent advances have enabled studies of atom-ion chemistry at unprecedentedly low
temperatures, allowing precision observation of chemical reactions and novel
chemical dynamics. So far, these studies have primarily involved reactions
between atoms and atomic ions or non-polar molecular ions, often in their
electronic ground state. Here, we extend this work by studying an excited
atom-polar-molecular-ion chemical reaction (Ca* + BaCl+) at low temperature in a 
hybrid atom-ion trapping system. The reaction rate and product branching
fractions are measured and compared to model calculations as a function of both
atomic quantum state and collision energy. At the lowest collision energy we find
that the chemical dynamics differ dramatically from capture theory predictions
and are primarily dictated by the radiative lifetime of the atomic quantum state 
instead of the underlying excited-state interaction potential. This reaction
blockading effect, which greatly suppresses the reactivity of short-lived excited
states, provides a means for directly probing the reaction range and also
naturally suppresses unwanted chemical reactions in hybrid trapping experiments.

Staphylococci secrete autoinducing peptides (AIPs) as signalling molecules to
regulate population-wide behaviour. AIPs from non-Staphylococcus aureus
staphylococci have received attention as potential antivirulence agents to
inhibit quorum sensing and virulence gene expression in the human pathogen
Staphylococcus aureus. However, only a limited number of AIP structures from
non-S. aureus staphylococci have been identified to date, as the minute amounts
secreted in complex media render it difficult. Here, we report a method for the
identification of AIPs by exploiting their thiolactone functionality for
chemoselective trapping and enrichment of the compounds from the bacterial
supernatant. Standard liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis, guided by
genome sequencing data, then readily provides the AIP identities. Using this
approach, we confirm the identity of five known AIPs and identify the AIPs of
eleven non-S. aureus species, and we expect that the method should be extendable 
to AIP-expressing Gram-positive bacteria beyond the Staphylococcus genus.

The formation of carbon-nitrogen bonds for the preparation of aromatic amines is 
among the top five reactions carried out globally for the production of
high-value materials, ranging from from bulk chemicals to pharmaceuticals and
polymers. As a result of this ubiquity and diversity, methods for their
preparation impact the full spectrum of chemical syntheses in academia and
industry. In general, these molecules are assembled through the stepwise
introduction of a reactivity handle in place of an aromatic C-H bond (that is, a 
nitro group, halogen or boronic acid) and a subsequent functionalization or
cross-coupling. Here we show that aromatic amines can be constructed by direct
reaction of arenes and alkyl amines using photocatalysis, without the need for
pre-functionalization. The process enables the easy preparation of advanced
building blocks, tolerates a broad range of functionalities, and multigram scale 
can be achieved via a batch-to-flow protocol. The merit of this strategy as a
late-stage functionalization platform has been demonstrated by the modification
of several drugs, agrochemicals, peptides, chiral catalysts, polymers and
organometallic complexes.

The physicochemical properties of nucleic acids are dominated by their highly
charged phosphodiester backbone chemistry. This polyelectrolyte structure
decouples information content (base sequence) from bulk properties, such as
solubility, and has been proposed as a defining trait of all informational
polymers. However, this conjecture has not been tested experimentally. Here, we
describe the encoded synthesis of a genetic polymer with an uncharged backbone
chemistry: alkyl phosphonate nucleic acids (phNAs) in which the canonical,
negatively charged phosphodiester is replaced by an uncharged P-alkyl
phosphonodiester backbone. Using synthetic chemistry and polymerase engineering, 
we describe the enzymatic, DNA-templated synthesis of P-methyl and P-ethyl phNAs,
and the directed evolution of specific streptavidin-binding phNA aptamer ligands 
directly from random-sequence mixed P-methyl/P-ethyl phNA repertoires. Our
results establish an example of the DNA-templated enzymatic synthesis and
evolution of an uncharged genetic polymer and provide a foundational methodology 
for their exploration as a source of novel functional molecules.

Biological cells routinely reconfigure their shape using dynamic signalling and
regulatory networks that direct self-assembly processes in time and space,
through molecular components that sense, process and transmit information from
the environment. A similar strategy could be used to enable life-like behaviours 
in synthetic materials. Nucleic acid nanotechnology offers a promising route
towards this goal through a variety of sensors, logic and dynamic components and 
self-assembling structures. Here, by harnessing both dynamic and structural DNA
nanotechnology, we demonstrate dynamic control of the self-assembly of DNA
nanotubes-a well-known class of programmable DNA nanostructures. Nanotube
assembly and disassembly is controlled with minimal synthetic gene systems,
including an autonomous molecular oscillator. We use a coarse-grained
computational model to capture nanotube length distribution dynamics in response 
to inputs from nucleic acid circuits. We hope that these results may find use for
the development of responsive nucleic acid materials, with potential applications
in biomaterials science, nanofabrication and drug delivery.

Recycled plastics are low-value commodities due to residual impurities and the
degradation of polymer properties with each cycle of re-use. Plastics that
undergo reversible polymerization allow high-value monomers to be recovered and
re-manufactured into pristine materials, which should incentivize recycling in
closed-loop life cycles. However, monomer recovery is often costly, incompatible 
with complex mixtures and energy-intensive. Here, we show that next-generation
plastics-polymerized using dynamic covalent diketoenamine bonds-allow the
recovery of monomers from common additives, even in mixed waste streams.
Poly(diketoenamine)s 'click' together from a wide variety of triketones and
aromatic or aliphatic amines, yielding only water as a by-product. Recovered
monomers can be re-manufactured into the same polymer formulation, without loss
of performance, as well as other polymer formulations with differentiated
properties. The ease with which poly(diketoenamine)s can be manufactured, used,
recycled and re-used-without losing value-points to new directions in designing
sustainable polymers with minimal environmental impact.

One of the core barriers to developing C-H activation reactions is the ability to
distinguish between multiple C-H bonds that are nearly identical in terms of
electronic properties and bond strengths. Through recognition of distance and
molecular geometry, remote C(sp2)-H bonds have been selectively activated in the 
presence of proximate ones. Yet achieving such unconventional site selectivity
with C(sp3)-H bonds remains a paramount challenge. Here we report a combination
of a simple pyruvic acid-derived directing group and a 2-pyridone ligand that
enables the preferential activation of the distal γ-C(sp3)-H bond over the
proximate β-C(sp3)-H bonds for a wide range of alcohol-derived substrates. A
competition experiment between the five- and six-membered cyclopalladation step, 
as well as kinetic experiments, demonstrate the feasibility of using geometric
strain to reverse the conventional site selectivity in C(sp3)-H activation.

Small molecule effectors are essential for drug discovery. Specific molecular
recognition, reversible binding and dose-dependency are usually key requirements 
to ensure utility of a novel chemical entity. However, artefactual
frequent-hitter and assay interference compounds may divert lead optimization and
screening programmes towards attrition-prone chemical matter. Colloidal
aggregates are the prime source of false positive readouts, either through
protein sequestration or protein-scaffold mimicry. Nevertheless, assessment of
colloidal aggregation remains somewhat overlooked and under-appreciated. In this 
Review, we discuss the impact of aggregation in drug discovery by analysing
select examples from the literature and publicly-available datasets. We also
examine and comment on technologies used to experimentally identify these
potentially problematic entities. We focus on evidence-based computational
filters and machine learning algorithms that may be swiftly deployed to flag
chemical matter and mitigate the impact of aggregates in discovery programmes. We
highlight the tools that can be used to scrutinize libraries, and identify and
eliminate these problematic compounds.

Magic-number gold nanoclusters are atomically precise nanomaterials that have
enabled unprecedented insight into structure-property relationships in
nanoscience. Thiolates are the most common ligand, binding to the cluster via a
staple motif in which only central gold atoms are in the metallic state. The lack
of other strongly bound ligands for nanoclusters with different bonding modes has
been a significant limitation in the field. Here, we report a previously unknown 
ligand for gold(0) nanoclusters-N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs)-which feature a
robust metal-carbon single bond and impart high stability to the corresponding
gold cluster. The addition of a single NHC to gold nanoclusters results in
significantly improved stability and catalytic properties in the electrocatalytic
reduction of CO2. By varying the conditions, nature and number of equivalents of 
the NHC, predominantly or exclusively monosubstituted NHC-functionalized clusters
result. Clusters can also be obtained with up to five NHCs, as a mixture of
species.

The ultrafast photoinduced ring-opening of 1,3-cyclohexadiene constitutes a
textbook example of electrocyclic reactions in organic chemistry and a model for 
photobiological reactions in vitamin D synthesis. Although the relaxation from
the photoexcited electronic state during the ring-opening has been investigated
in numerous studies, the accompanying changes in atomic distance have not been
resolved. Here we present a direct and unambiguous observation of the
ring-opening reaction path on the femtosecond timescale and subångström length
scale using megaelectronvolt ultrafast electron diffraction. We followed the
carbon-carbon bond dissociation and the structural opening of the
1,3-cyclohexadiene ring by the direct measurement of time-dependent changes in
the distribution of interatomic distances. We observed a substantial acceleration
of the ring-opening motion after internal conversion to the ground state due to a
steepening of the electronic potential gradient towards the product minima. The
ring-opening motion transforms into rotation of the terminal ethylene groups in
the photoproduct 1,3,5-hexatriene on the subpicosecond timescale.

Polymerization reactions conducted inside cells must be compatible with the
complex intracellular environment, which contains numerous molecules and
functional groups that could potentially prevent or quench polymerization
reactions. Here we report a strategy for directly synthesizing unnatural polymers
in cells through free radical photopolymerization using a number of biocompatible
acrylic and methacrylic monomers. This offers a platform to manipulate, track and
control cellular behaviour by the in cellulo generation of macromolecules that
have the ability to alter cellular motility, label cells by the generation of
fluorescent polymers for long-term tracking studies, as well as generate a
variety of nanostructures within cells. It is remarkable that free radical
polymerization chemistry can take place within such complex cellular
environments. This demonstration opens up a multitude of new possibilities for
how chemists can modulate cellular function and behaviour and for understanding
cellular behaviour in response to the generation of free radicals.

In a conventional living ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), an equal 
number of ruthenium complexes to the number of polymer chains synthesized are
required. This can lead to high loadings of ruthenium complexes when aiming for
shorter polymers. Here, a reversible chain-transfer agent was used to produce
living ROMP polymers from norbornene derivatives using catalytic amounts of
Grubbs' ruthenium complexes. The polymers obtained by this method showed all of
the characteristics of a living polymerization (that is, good molecular weight
control, narrow molecular weight dispersities and the ability to form block
copolymers). Monomers carrying functional moieties such as ferrocene, coumarin or
a triisopropylsilyl-protected primary alcohol could also be catalytically
polymerized in a living fashion. The method presented follows a degenerative
chain-transfer process and is more economical and environmentally friendly
compared with previous living ROMP procedures as it utilizes only catalytic
amounts of costly and toxic ruthenium complexes.

The development of crystalline porous materials with high chemical stability is
of paramount importance for their practical application. Here, we report the
synthesis of polyarylether-based covalent organic frameworks (PAE-COFs) with high
crystallinity, porosity and chemical stability, including towards water, owing to
the inert nature of their polyarylether-based building blocks. The PAE-COFs are
synthesized through nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions between
ortho-difluoro benzene and catechol building units, which form ether linkages.
The resulting materials are shown to be stable against harsh chemical
environments including boiling water, strong acids and bases, and oxidation and
reduction conditions. Their stability surpasses the performance of other known
crystalline porous materials such as zeolites, metal-organic frameworks and
covalent organic frameworks. We also demonstrate the post-synthetic
functionalization of these materials with carboxyl or amino functional groups.
The functionalized PAE-COFs combine porosity, high stability and recyclability. A
preliminary application of these materials is demonstrated with the removal of
antibiotics from water over a wide pH range.

Predicting the optimal structure for a catalytic material has been a
long-standing goal, but typically an arbitrary active site on a uniform surface
is modelled. Identification of the most-active facet structure for
structure-sensitive chemistries, such as the oxygen reduction reaction, is
lacking. Here we develop an approach to predict the optimal structure of a
catalytic material by identifying the active site and identifying the density and
spatial arrangement of such sites while minimizing the surface energy. We find
that the theoretical peak performance predicted by linear scaling relations is
unattainable because of the lack of suitable active sites on low-index planes, as
well as geometric and stability constraints. A random array of vacancies results 
in a modest performance enhancement compared to ideal facets, whereas defect
sites with a maximum density in disordered structures significantly increase the 
catalyst performance. We applied this methodology to the oxygen reduction
reaction on defected Pt(111), Pt(100), Au(111) and Au(100) surfaces.

Nitriles are found in many bioactive compounds, and are among the most versatile 
functional groups in organic chemistry. Despite many notable recent advances,
however, there are no approaches that may be used for the preparation of di- or
tri-substituted alkenyl nitriles. Related approaches that are broad in scope and 
can deliver the desired products in high stereoisomeric purity are especially
scarce. Here, we describe the development of several efficient catalytic
cross-metathesis strategies, which provide direct access to a considerable range 
of Z- or E-di-substituted cyano-substituted alkenes or their corresponding
tri-substituted variants. Depending on the reaction type, a molybdenum-based
monoaryloxide pyrrolide or chloride (MAC) complex may be the optimal choice. The 
utility of the approach, enhanced by an easy to apply protocol for utilization of
substrates bearing an alcohol or a carboxylic acid moiety, is highlighted in the 
context of applications to the synthesis of biologically active compounds.

Breakthroughs in the study of the origin of life have demonstrated how some of
the building blocks essential to biology could have been formed under various
primordial scenarios, and could therefore have contributed to the chemical
evolution of life. Missing building blocks are then sometimes inferred to be
products of primitive biosynthesis, which can stretch the limits of plausibility.
Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of 2'-deoxy-2-thiouridine, and subsequently
2'-deoxyadenosine and 2-deoxyribose, under prebiotic conditions.
2'-Deoxy-2-thiouridine is produced by photoreduction of
2,2'-anhydro-2-thiouridine, which is in turn formed by phosphorylation of
2-thiouridine-an intermediate of prebiotic RNA synthesis. 2'-Deoxy-2-thiouridine 
is an effective deoxyribosylating agent and may have functioned as such in either
abiotic or proto-enzyme-catalysed pathways to DNA, as demonstrated by its
conversion to 2'-deoxyadenosine by reaction with adenine, and 2-deoxyribose by
hydrolysis. An alternative prebiotic phosphorylation of 2-thiouridine leads to
the formation of its 5'-phosphate, showing that hypotheses in which 2-thiouridine
was a key component of early RNA sequences are within the bounds of synthetic
credibility.

Dissipative self-assembly is common in biological systems, where it serves to
maintain a far-from-equilibrium functional state through fuel consumption.
Synthetic dissipative systems have been prepared that can mimic some of the
properties of biological systems, but they often show poor mechanical
performance. Here, we report a shear-induced transient hydrogel that is highly
stretchable. The system is constructed by adding Cu(II) into the aqueous solution
of a pseudopolyrotaxane, which is itself formed by threading molecular tubes on
polyethylene glycol chains. Vigorous shaking transforms the solution into a gel, 
which gradually relaxes back to the sol state over time. This cycle can be
repeated at least five times. A mechanism is proposed that relies on a
shear-induced transition from intrachain to interchain coordination and
subsequent thermal relaxation. The far-from-equilibrium hydrogel is highly
stretchable, which is probably due to 'frictional' sliding of the molecular tubes
on the polyethylene glycol chains. On shaking, the hydrogel undergoes fast
self-healing.

Post-translational farnesylation or geranylgeranylation at a C-terminal cysteine 
residue regulates the localization and function of over 100 proteins, including
the Ras isoforms, and is a therapeutic target in diseases including cancer and
infection. Here, we report global and selective profiling of prenylated proteins 
in living cells enabled by the development of isoprenoid analogues YnF and YnGG
in combination with quantitative chemical proteomics. Eighty prenylated proteins 
were identified in a single human cell line, 64 for the first time at endogenous 
abundance without metabolic perturbation. We further demonstrate that YnF and
YnGG enable direct identification of post-translationally processed prenylated
peptides, proteome-wide quantitative analysis of prenylation dynamics and
alternative prenylation in response to four different prenyltransferase
inhibitors, and quantification of defective Rab prenylation in a model of the
retinal degenerative disease choroideremia.

The architecture and bioactivity of natural products frequently serve as
embarkation points for the exploration of biologically relevant chemical space.
Total synthesis followed by derivative synthesis has historically enabled a
deeper understanding of structure-activity relationships. However, synthetic
strategies towards a natural product are not always guided by hypotheses
regarding the structural features required for bioactivity. Here, we report an
approach to natural product total synthesis that we term 'pharmacophore-directed 
retrosynthesis'. A hypothesized, pharmacophore of a natural product is selected
as an early synthetic target and this dictates the retrosynthetic analysis. In an
ideal application, sequential increases in the structural complexity of this
minimal structure enable development of a structure-activity relationship profile
throughout the course of the total synthesis effort. This approach enables the
identification of simpler congeners retaining bioactivity at a much earlier stage
of a synthetic effort, as demonstrated here for the spongiane diterpenoid,
gracilin A, leading to simplified derivatives with potent neuroprotective and
immunosuppressive activity.

Spins in solids or in molecules possess discrete energy levels, and the
associated quantum states can be tuned and coherently manipulated by means of
external electromagnetic fields. Spins therefore provide one of the simplest
platforms to encode a quantum bit (qubit), the elementary unit of future quantum 
computers. Performing any useful computation demands much more than realizing a
robust qubit-one also needs a large number of qubits and a reliable manner with
which to integrate them into a complex circuitry that can store and process
information and implement quantum algorithms. This 'scalability' is arguably one 
of the challenges for which a chemistry-based bottom-up approach is best-suited. 
Molecules, being much more versatile than atoms, and yet microscopic, are the
quantum objects with the highest capacity to form non-trivial ordered states at
the nanoscale and to be replicated in large numbers using chemical tools.

Gold-thiol contacts are ubiquitous across the physical and biological sciences in
connecting organic molecules to surfaces. When thiols bind to gold in
self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) the fate of the hydrogen remains a subject of
profound debate-with implications for our understanding of their physical
properties, spectroscopic features and formation mechanism(s). Exploiting
measurements of the transmission through a molecular junction, which is highly
sensitive to the nature of the molecule-electrode contact, we demonstrate here
that the nature of the gold-sulfur bond in SAMs can be probed via single-molecule
conductance measurements. Critically, we find that SAM measurements of
dithiol-terminated molecular junctions yield a significantly lower conductance
than solution measurements of the same molecule. Through numerous control
experiments, conductance noise analysis and transport calculations based on
density functional theory, we show that the gold-sulfur bond in SAMs prepared
from the solution deposition of dithiols does not have chemisorbed character,
which strongly suggests that under these widely used preparation conditions the
hydrogen is retained.

Given the unique properties of fluorine, and the ability of fluorination to
change the properties of organic molecules, there is significant interest from
medicinal chemists in innovative methodologies that enable the synthesis of new
fluorinated motifs. State-of-the-art syntheses of α-fluorinated carbonyl
compounds invariably rely on electrophilic fluorinating agents, which can be
strongly oxidizing and difficult to handle. Here we show that reversing the
polarity of the enolate partner to that of an enolonium enables nucleophilic
fluorinating agents to be used for direct chemoselective α-C-H-fluorination of
amides. Reduction of these products enables facile access to β-fluorinated amines
and the value of this methodology is shown by the easy preparation of a number of
fluorinated analogues of drugs and agrochemicals. A fluorinated analogue of
citalopram, a marketed antidepressant drug, is presented as an example of the
preserved biological activity after fluorination.

Helical nanofibres play key roles in many biological processes. Entanglements
between helices can aid gelation by producing thick, interconnected fibres, but
the details of this process are poorly understood. Here, we describe the assembly
of an achiral oligo(urea) peptidomimetic compound into supramolecular helices.
Aggregation of adjacent helices leads to the formation of fibrils, which further 
intertwine to produce high-fidelity braids with periodic crossing patterns. A
braid theory analysis suggests that braiding is governed by rigid topological
constraints, and that branching occurs due to crossing defects in the developing 
braids. Mixed-chirality helices assemble into relatively complex, odd-stranded
braids, but can also form helical bundles by undergoing inversions of chirality. 
The oligo(urea) assemblies are also highly sensitive to chiral amplification,
proposed to occur through a majority-rules mechanism, whereby trace chiral
materials can promote the formation of gels containing only homochiral helices.

A microscopic picture of hydrogen-bond structure and dynamics in ion hydration
shells remains elusive. Small ion-dihydrate molecular complexes are ideal systems
with which to investigate the interplay and competition between ion-water and
water-water interactions. Here, state-of-the-art quantum dynamics simulations
provide evidence for tunnelling in hydrogen-bond rearrangements in the
iodide-dihydrate complex and show that it can be controlled through isotopic
substitutions. We find that the iodide ion weakens the neighbouring water-water
hydrogen bond, leading to faster water reorientation than in the analogous water 
trimer. These faster dynamics, which are apparently at odds with the slowdown
observed in the first hydration shell of iodide in solution, can be traced back
to the presence of a free OH bond in the iodide-dihydrate complex, which
effectively triggers the overall structural rearrangements within it. Besides
providing indirect support for cooperative hydrogen-bond dynamics in iodide
solutions, the analysis presented here suggests that iodide ions may accelerate
hydrogen-bond rearrangements at aqueous interfaces, where neighbouring water
molecules can be undercoordinated.

Peptidoglycan is an essential cell wall component that maintains the morphology
and viability of nearly all bacteria. Its biosynthesis requires periplasmic
transpeptidation reactions, which construct peptide crosslinkages between
polysaccharide chains to endow mechanical strength. However, tracking the
transpeptidation reaction in vivo and in vitro is challenging, mainly due to the 
lack of efficient, biocompatible probes. Here, we report the design, synthesis
and application of rotor-fluorogenic D-amino acids (RfDAAs), enabling real-time, 
continuous tracking of transpeptidation reactions. These probes allow
peptidoglycan biosynthesis to be monitored in real time by visualizing
transpeptidase reactions in live cells, as well as real-time activity assays of
D,D- and L,D-transpeptidases and sortases in vitro. The unique ability of RfDAAs 
to become fluorescent when incorporated into peptidoglycan provides a powerful
new tool to study peptidoglycan biosynthesis with high temporal resolution and
prospectively enable high-throughput screening for inhibitors of peptidoglycan
biosynthesis.

An automated platform that can synthesize a wide range of complex carbohydrates
will greatly increase their accessibility and should facilitate progress in
glycoscience. Here we report a fully automated process for enzyme-mediated
oligosaccharide synthesis that can give easy access to different classes of
complex glycans including poly-N-acetyllactosamine derivatives, human milk
oligosaccharides, gangliosides and N-glycans. Our automated platform uses a catch
and release approach in which glycosyltransferase-catalysed reactions are
performed in solution and product purification is accomplished by solid phase
extraction. We developed a sulfonate tag that can easily be installed and enables
highly efficient solid phase extraction and product release using a single set of
washing conditions, regardless of the complexity of the glycan. Using this
custom-built synthesizer, as many as 15 reaction cycles can be performed in an
automated fashion without a need for lyophilization or buffer exchange steps.

The bottom-up design and construction of functional metalloproteins remains a
formidable task in biomolecular design. Although numerous strategies have been
used to create new metalloproteins, pre-existing knowledge of the tertiary and
quaternary protein structure is often required to generate suitable platforms for
robust metal coordination and activity. Here we report an alternative and easily 
implemented approach (metal active sites by covalent tethering or MASCoT) in
which folded protein building blocks are linked by a single disulfide bond to
create diverse metal coordination environments within evolutionarily naive
protein-protein interfaces. Metalloproteins generated using this strategy
uniformly bind a wide array of first-row transition metal ions (MnII, FeII, CoII,
NiII, CuII, ZnII and vanadyl) with physiologically relevant thermodynamic
affinities (dissociation constants ranging from 700 nM for MnII to 50 fM for
CuII). MASCoT readily affords coordinatively unsaturated metal centres-including 
a penta-His-coordinated non-haem Fe site-and well-defined binding pockets that
can accommodate modifications and enable coordination of exogenous ligands such
as nitric oxide to the interfacial metal centre.

The self-assembly of amphiphilic molecules in solution is a ubiquitous process in
both natural and synthetic systems. The ability to effectively control the
structure and properties of these systems is essential for tuning the quality of 
their functionality, yet the underlying mechanisms governing the transition from 
molecules to assemblies have not been fully resolved. Here we describe how
amphiphilic self-assembly can be preceded by liquid-liquid phase separation. The 
assembly of a model block co-polymer system into vesicular structures was probed 
through a combination of liquid-phase electron microscopy, self-consistent field 
computations and Gibbs free energy calculations. This analysis shows the
formation of polymer-rich liquid droplets that act as a precursor in the
bottom-up formation of spherical micelles, which then evolve into vesicles. The
liquid-liquid phase separation plays a role in determining the resulting
vesicles' structural properties, such as their size and membrane thickness, and
the onset of kinetic traps during self-assembly.

Maleimide-thiol reactions are widely used to produce protein-polymer conjugates
for therapeutics. However, maleimide-thiol adducts are unstable in vivo or in the
presence of thiol-containing compounds because of the elimination of the
thiosuccinimide linkage through a retro-Michael reaction or thiol exchange. Here,
using single-molecule force spectroscopy, we show that applying an appropriate
stretching force to the thiosuccinimide linkage can considerably stabilize the
maleimide-thiol adducts, in effect using conventional mechanochemistry of
force-accelerated bond dissociation to unconventionally stabilize an adjacent
bond. Single-molecule kinetic analysis and bulk structural characterizations
suggest that hydrolysis of the succinimide ring is dominant over the
retro-Michael reaction through a force-dependent kinetic control mechanism, and
this leads to a product that is resistant to elimination. This unconventional
mechanochemical approach enabled us to produce stable polymer-protein conjugates 
by simply applying a mechanical force to the maleimide-thiol adducts through mild
ultrasonication. Our results demonstrate the great potential of mechanical force 
for stimulating important productive chemical transformations.

Heterometallic clusters are important in catalysis and small-molecule activation 
because of the multimetallic synergistic effects from different metals. However, 
multimetallic species that contain uranium-metal bonds remain very scarce due to 
the difficulties in their synthesis. Here we present a straightforward strategy
to construct a series of heterometallic clusters with multiple uranium-metal
bonds. These complexes were created by facile reactions of a uranium precursor
with Ni(COD)2 (COD, cyclooctadiene). The multimetallic clusters' cores are
supported by a heptadentate N4P3 scaffold. Theoretical investigations indicate
the formation of uranium-nickel bonds in a U2Ni2 and a U2Ni3 species, but also
show that they exhibit a uranium-uranium interaction; thus, the electronic
configuration of uranium in these species is U(III)-5f26d1. This study provides
further understanding of the bonding between f-block elements and transition
metals, which may allow the construction of d-f heterometallic clusters and the
investigation of their potential applications.

Conjugated polymers are attractive components for plastic electronics, but their 
structural defects, low solubility and batch-to-batch variation-mainly in terms
of molecular weight and dispersity-hinder practical applications. Here, we
demonstrate that these issues can be circumvented by using conjugated
mesopolymers, which have the advantages of both oligomers and polymers. A
diketopyrrolopyrrole monomer and a benzothiadiazole derivative react through
direct arylation polycondensation, promoted by sterically hindered adamantyl
ligand coordinated palladium catalysts, to form mesopolymers. The reaction is
facile, environmentally benign (it does not require tin or boron reagents) and
occurs in high yields. The resulting mesopolymers have a strictly alternating
donor-acceptor structure, without detectable homocoupling and β-arylation
defects, and exhibit number-averaged molecular weights (Mn) between 1 and 10 kDa.
They also show good solution processability and have significantly enhanced
electron mobilities, which makes them n-type and ambipolar semiconductors, with
advantages over their polymer counterparts.

Piperidines and fluorine substituents are both independently indispensable
components in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and materials. Logically, the
incorporation of fluorine atoms into piperidine scaffolds is therefore an area of
tremendous potential. However, synthetic approaches towards the formation of
these architectures are often impractical. The diastereoselective synthesis of
substituted monofluorinated piperidines often requires substrates with
pre-defined stereochemistry. That of multifluorinated piperidines is even more
challenging, and often needs to be carried out in multistep syntheses. In this
report, we describe a straightforward process for the one-pot rhodium-catalysed
dearomatization-hydrogenation of fluoropyridine precursors. This strategy enables
the formation of a plethora of substituted all-cis-(multi)fluorinated piperidines
in a highly diastereoselective fashion through pyridine dearomatization followed 
by complete saturation of the resulting intermediates by hydrogenation.
Fluorinated piperidines with defined axial/equatorial orientation of fluorine
substituents were successfully applied in the preparation of commercial drugs
analogues. Additionally, fluorinated PipPhos as well as fluorinated ionic liquids
were obtained by this dearomatization-hydrogenation process.

The electrochemical reduction of CO2 could play an important role in addressing
climate-change issues and global energy demands as part of a carbon-neutral
energy cycle. Single-atom catalysts can display outstanding electrocatalytic
performance; however, given their single-site nature they are usually only
amenable to reactions that involve single molecules. For processes that involve
multiple molecules, improved catalytic properties could be achieved through the
development of atomically dispersed catalysts with higher complexities. Here we
report a catalyst that features two adjacent copper atoms, which we call an
'atom-pair catalyst', that work together to carry out the critical bimolecular
step in CO2 reduction. The atom-pair catalyst features stable Cu10-Cu1x+ pair
structures, with Cu1x+ adsorbing H2O and the neighbouring Cu10 adsorbing CO2,
which thereby promotes CO2 activation. This results in a Faradaic efficiency for 
CO generation above 92%, with the competing hydrogen evolution reaction almost
completely suppressed. Experimental characterization and density functional
theory revealed that the adsorption configuration reduces the activation energy, 
which generates high selectivity, activity and stability under relatively low
potentials.

Transport at the molecular scale is a prerequisite for the development of future 
molecular factories. Here, we have designed oligoanionic molecular sliders on
polycationic tracks that exploit Brownian motion and diffusive binding to
transport cargo without using a chemical fuel. The presence of the polymer tracks
increases the rate of bimolecular reactions between modified sliders by over two 
orders of magnitude. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the sliders not
only diffuse, but also jump and hop surprisingly efficiently along polymer
tracks. Inspired by acetyl-coenzyme A transporting and delivering acetyl groups
in many essential biochemical processes, we developed a new and unconventional
type of catalytic transport involving sliders (including coenzyme A) picking up, 
transporting and selectively delivering molecular cargo. Furthermore, we show
that the concept of diffusive binding can also be utilized for the spatially
controlled transport of chemical groups across gels. This work represents a new
concept for designing functional nanosystems based on random Brownian motion.

Developing a viable metallic lithium anode is a prerequisite for next-generation 
batteries. However, the low redox potential of lithium metal renders it prone to 
corrosion, which must be thoroughly understood for it to be used in practical
energy-storage devices. Here we report a previously overlooked mechanism by which
lithium deposits can corrode on a copper surface. Voids are observed in the
corroded deposits and a Kirkendall-type mechanism is validated through
electrochemical analysis. Although it is a long-held view that lithium corrosion 
in electrolytes involves direct charge-transfer through the lithium-electrolyte
interphase, the corrosion observed here is found to be governed by a galvanic
process between lithium and the copper substrate-a pathway largely neglected by
previous battery corrosion studies. The observations are further rationalized by 
detailed analyses of the solid-electrolyte interphase formed on copper and
lithium, where the disparities in electrolyte reduction kinetics on the two
surfaces can account for the fast galvanic process.

Solid-state auride salts featuring the negatively charged Au- ion are known to be
stable in the presence of alkali metal counterions. While such electron-rich
species might be expected to be nucleophilic (in the same manner as I-, for
example), their instability in solution means that this has not been verified
experimentally. Here we report a two-coordinate gold complex (NON)AlAuPtBu3
(where NON is the chelating tridentate ligand
4,5-bis(2,6-diisopropylanilido)-2,7-di-tert-butyl-9,9-dimethylxanthene) that
features a strongly polarized bond, Auδ--Alδ+. This is synthesized by reaction of
the potassium aluminyl compound [K{Al(NON)}]2 with tBu3PAuI. Computational
studies of the complex, including quantum theory of atoms in molecules charge
analysis, imply a charge at gold (-0.82) that is in line with the relative
electronegativities of the two metals (Au: 2.54; Al: 1.61 on the Pauling scale). 
Consistently, the complex is found to act as a nucleophilic source of gold,
reacting with diisopropylcarbodiimide and CO2 to give the Au-C bonded insertion

Symmetrical protein oligomers are ubiquitous in biological systems and perform
key structural and regulatory functions. However, there are few methods for
constructing such oligomers. Here we have engineered completely synthetic,
symmetrical oligomers by combining pairs of oppositely supercharged variants of a
normally monomeric model protein through a strategy we term 'supercharged protein
assembly' (SuPrA). We show that supercharged variants of green fluorescent
protein can assemble into a variety of architectures including a well-defined
symmetrical 16-mer structure that we solved using cryo-electron microscopy at
3.47 Å resolution. The 16-mer is composed of two stacked rings of octamers, in
which the octamers contain supercharged proteins of alternating charges, and
interactions within and between the rings are mediated by a variety of specific
electrostatic contacts. The ready assembly of this structure suggests that
combining oppositely supercharged pairs of protein variants may provide broad
opportunities for generating novel architectures via otherwise unprogrammed
interactions.

In the version of this Article originally published, the authors inadvertently
cited ref. 10 in two places in the first paragraph. They would like to clarify
that it should not have been cited in the sentence that starts "Polymer chemists 
have employed strategies such as single monomer insertion..." as it mistakenly
implied that the IEG+ method described in ref. 10 could not produce unimolecular 
polymers; it can do so, as was demonstrated in ref. 10. The authors would also
like to clarify that ref. 10 should not have been cited in the sentence that
starts "Moreover, solid-phase synthesis is generally difficult to scale up...",
as it implied that ref. 10 uses solid-phase synthesis; it does not, and is a
purely liquid-phase process. The citation of ref. 10 has now been removed from
these two sentences, but has been included elsewhere in the first two paragraphs 
of the Article as follows. In the first paragraph, at the end of the sentence "In
iterative synthesis, specific monomers are added one at a time, or as multiples, 
to the end of a growing polymer chain, then reaction debris is separated from the
chain extended polymer, and the cycle is repeated using the next monomer in the
sequence10-12."; this sentence has been further amended to indicate multiple
monomers can also be added. The reference has also been added to the end of the
first sentence of the second paragraph, which starts "Consequently, liquid-phase 
iterative synthetic methods...", and in the third sentence of that paragraph,
which now starts "For example, Johnson10, Whiting....".

Despite significant progress in the development of site-selective aliphatic C-H
oxidations over the past decade, the ability to oxidize strong methylene C-H
bonds in the presence of more oxidatively labile aromatic functionalities remains
a major unsolved problem. Such chemoselective reactivity is highly desirable for 
enabling late-stage oxidative derivatizations of pharmaceuticals and medicinally 
important natural products that often contain such functionality. Here, we report
a simple manganese small-molecule catalyst Mn(CF3-PDP) system that achieves such 
chemoselectivity via an unexpected synergy of catalyst design and acid additive. 
Preparative remote methylene oxidation is obtained in 50 aromatic compounds
housing medicinally relevant halogen, oxygen, heterocyclic and biaryl moieties.
Late-stage methylene oxidation is demonstrated on four drug scaffolds, including 
the ethinylestradiol scaffold where other non-directed C-H oxidants that tolerate
aromatic groups effect oxidation at only activated tertiary benzylic sites. Rapid
generation of a known metabolite (piragliatin) from an advanced intermediate is
demonstrated.

Aromatic rings are ubiquitous in organic chemistry and form the basis of many
commercial products. Despite the numerous routes available for the preparation of
aromatic compounds, there remain few methods that allow their conversion into
synthetically useful partially saturated derivatives and even fewer that allow
new C-C bonds to be formed at the same time. Here we set out to address this
problem and uncover a unique catalytic partial reduction reaction that forms
partially saturated azaheterocycles from aromatic precursors. In this reaction,
methanol and formaldehyde are used for the reductive functionalization of
pyridines and quinolines using catalytic iridium; thus, inexpensive and renewable
feedstocks are utilized in the formation of complex N-heterocycles. By harnessing
the formation of a nucleophilic enamine intermediate, the C-C bond-forming
process reverses the normal pattern of reactivity and allows access to the C3
position of the arene. Mechanistic investigations using D-labelling experiments
reveal the source of hydride added to the ring and show the reversible nature of 
the iridium-hydride addition.

Intersystem crossing plays an important role in photochemistry. It is understood 
to be efficient when heavy atoms are present due to strong spin-orbit coupling,
or when strongly bound long-lived complexes are formed that increase the chance
of finding the singlet-triplet intersection seam. Here we present evidence for a 
different intersystem crossing mechanism in the bimolecular reaction of O(3P)
with alkylamines. In crossed-beam experiments, product velocity-flux maps are
measured for aminoalkyl radicals produced from H abstraction from the methyl
group, which also gives OH radicals as co-fragments. The low translational-energy
release and isotropic angular distributions of the products indicate that such
reactions undergo the formation of a complex before OH and aminoalkyl are
produced. However, there is no well on the triplet potential energy surface that 
could support such a complex. Multi-reference ab initio calculations suggest,
instead, that intersystem crossing occurs in the exit-channel region due to the
long-range dipole-dipole interaction between the nascent radical product pair
coupled with the vanishing singlet-triplet splitting at long range. Intersystem
crossing then leads to a deep hydroxylamine well before OH elimination.

Rapamycin and FK506 are macrocyclic natural products with an extraordinary mode
of action, in which they form binary complexes with FK506-binding protein (FKBP) 
through a shared FKBP-binding domain before forming ternary complexes with their 
respective targets, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and calcineurin,
respectively. Inspired by this, we sought to build a rapamycin-like macromolecule
library to target new cellular proteins by replacing the effector domain of
rapamycin with a combinatorial library of oligopeptides. We developed a robust
macrocyclization method using ring-closing metathesis and synthesized a
45,000-compound library of hybrid macrocycles (named rapafucins) using optimized 
FKBP-binding domains. Screening of the rapafucin library in human cells led to
the discovery of rapadocin, an inhibitor of nucleoside uptake. Rapadocin is a
potent, isoform-specific and FKBP-dependent inhibitor of the equilibrative
nucleoside transporter 1 and is efficacious in an animal model of kidney
ischaemia reperfusion injury. Together, these results demonstrate that rapafucins
are a new class of chemical probes and drug leads that can expand the repertoire 
of protein targets well beyond mTOR and calcineurin.

Contemporary chemoenzymatic approaches can provide highly complex multi-antennary
N-linked glycans. These procedures are, however, very demanding and typically
involve as many as 100 chemical steps to prepare advanced intermediates that can 
be diversified by glycosyltransferases in a branch-selective manner to give
asymmetrical structures commonly found in nature. Only highly specialized
laboratories can perform such syntheses, which greatly hampers progress in
glycoscience. Here we describe a biomimetic approach in which a readily available
bi-antennary glycopeptide can be converted in ten or fewer chemical and enzymatic
steps into multi-antennary N-glycans that at each arm can be uniquely extended by
glycosyltransferases to give access to highly complex asymmetrically branched
N-glycans. A key feature of our approach is the installation of additional
branching points using recombinant MGAT4 and MGAT5 in combination with unnatural 
sugar donors. At an appropriate point in the enzymatic synthesis, the unnatural
monosaccharides can be converted into their natural counterpart, allowing each
arm to be elaborated into a unique appendage.

Transition-metal-catalysed cross-coupling reactions, particularly those mediated 
by palladium, are some of the most broadly used chemical transformations. The
fundamental reaction steps of such cross-couplings typically include oxidative
addition, transmetallation, carbopalladation of a π-bond and/or reductive
elimination. Herein, we describe an unprecedented fundamental reaction step: a
C-C σ-bond carbopalladation. Specifically, an aryl palladium(II) complex
interacts with a σ-bond of a strained bicyclo[1.1.0]butyl boronate complex to
enable addition of the aryl palladium(II) species and an organoboronic ester
substituent across a C-C σ-bond. The overall process couples readily available
aryl triflates and organoboronic esters across a cyclobutane unit with total
diastereocontrol. The pharmaceutically relevant 1,1,3-trisubstituted cyclobutane 
products are decorated with an array of modular building blocks, including a
boronic ester that can be readily derivatized.

Synthetic chemists have devoted tremendous effort towards the production of
precision synthetic polymers with defined sequences and specific functions.
However, the creation of a general technology that enables precise control over
monomer sequence, with efficient isolation of the target polymers, is highly
challenging. Here, we report a robust strategy for the production of
sequence-defined synthetic polymers through a combination of liquid-phase
synthesis and selective molecular sieving. The polymer is assembled in solution
with real-time monitoring to ensure couplings proceed to completion, on a
three-armed star-shaped macromolecule to maximize efficiency during the molecular
sieving process. This approach is applied to the construction of sequence-defined
polyethers, with side-arms at precisely defined locations that can undergo
site-selective modification after polymerization. Using this versatile strategy, 
we have introduced structural and functional diversity into sequence-defined
polyethers, unlocking their potential for real-life applications in
nanotechnology, healthcare and information storage.

Chemists extensively use free radical reactivity for applications in organic
synthesis, materials science, and life science. Traditionally, generating
radicals requires strategies that exploit the bond dissociation energy or the
redox properties of the precursors. Here, we disclose a photochemical catalytic
approach that harnesses different physical properties of the substrate to form
carbon radicals. We use a nucleophilic dithiocarbamate anion catalyst, adorned
with a well-tailored chromophoric unit, to activate alkyl electrophiles via an
SN2 pathway. The resulting photon-absorbing intermediate affords radicals upon
homolytic cleavage induced by visible light. This catalytic SN2-based strategy,
which exploits a fundamental mechanistic process of ionic chemistry, grants
access to open-shell intermediates from a variety of substrates that would be
incompatible with or inert to classical radical-generating strategies. We also
describe how the method's mild reaction conditions and high functional group
tolerance could be advantageous for developing C-C bond-forming reactions, for
streamlining the preparation of a marketed drug, for the late-stage elaboration
of biorelevant compounds and for enantioselective radical catalysis.

The oxygen in Earth's atmosphere is there primarily because of water oxidation
performed by photosynthetic organisms using solar light and one specialized
protein complex, photosystem II (PSII). High-resolution imaging of the PSII
'core' complex shows the ideal co-localization of multi-chromophore
light-harvesting antennas with the functional reaction centre. Man-made systems
are still far from replicating the complexity of PSII, as the majority of PSII
mimetics have been limited to photocatalytic dyads based on a 1:1 ratio of a
light absorber, generally a Ru-polypyridine complex, with a water oxidation
catalyst. Here we report the self-assembly of multi-perylene-bisimide
chromophores (PBI) shaped to function by interaction with a polyoxometalate
water-oxidation catalyst (Ru4POM). The resulting [PBI]5Ru4POM complex shows a
robust amphiphilic structure and dynamic aggregation into large two-dimensional
paracrystalline domains, a redshifted light-harvesting efficiency of >40% and
favourable exciton accumulation, with a peak quantum efficiency using 'green'
photons (λ > 500 nm). The modularity of the building blocks and the simplicity of
the non-covalent chemistry offer opportunities for innovation in artificial
photosynthesis.

The ability of porous coordination polymers to undergo reversible structural
transformations in response to the presence of guest molecules has been
intensively investigated for applications such as molecular separation, storage, 
sensing and signalling processes. Here we report on the direct observation of the
highly guest-responsive nature of the surface of a single-crystalline porous
coordination polymer, which consists of paddlewheel zinc clusters and two types
of ligand, by in situ liquid-phase atomic force microscopy. Observations were
carried out in solution at constant temperature (28 °C) by high-speed atomic
force microscopy with lattice resolution. A sharp and reversible response to the 
presence or absence of biphenyl guest molecules was observed, under conditions
that can scarcely induce the transformation of the bulk crystal. Additionally, by
modulating the surface coordination equilibrium, layer-by-layer delamination
events were captured in real time at every ~13 s per frame.

Multicellularity enables the growth of complex life forms as it allows for the
specialization of cell types, differentiation and large-scale spatial
organization. In a similar way, modular construction of synthetic multicellular
systems will lead to dynamic biomimetic materials that can respond to their
environment in complex ways. To achieve this goal, artificial cellular
communication and developmental programs still have to be established. Here, we
create geometrically controlled spatial arrangements of emulsion-based artificial
cellular compartments containing synthetic in vitro gene circuitry, separated by 
lipid bilayer membranes. We quantitatively determine the membrane pore-dependent 
response of the circuits to artificial morphogen gradients, which are established
via diffusion from dedicated organizer cells. Utilizing different types of
feedforward and feedback in vitro gene circuits, we then implement artificial
signalling and differentiation processes, demonstrating the potential for the
realization of complex spatiotemporal dynamics in artificial multicellular
systems.

Heteromultivalency, which involves the simultaneous interactions of more than one
type of ligand with more than one type of receptor, is ubiquitous in living
systems and provides a powerful strategy to improve the binding efficiency of
heterotopic species such as proteins and membranes. However, the design and
development of artificial heteromultivalent receptors is still challenging owing 
to tedious synthesis processes and the need for precise control over the spatial 
arrangement of the binding sites. Here, we have designed a heteromultivalent
platform by co-assembling cyclodextrin and calixarene amphiphiles, so that two
orthogonal, non-covalent binding sites are distributed on the surface of the
co-assembly. Binding with model peptides shows a synergistic effect of the two
receptors, (hetero)multivalency and self-adaptability. The co-assembly shows
promise for inhibition of the fibrillation of amyloid-β peptides and the
dissolution of amyloid-β fibrils, substantially reducing amyloid cytotoxicity.
This self-assembled heteromultivalency concept is easily amenable to other
ensembles and targets, so that versatile biomedical applications can be
envisaged.

It remains difficult to understand the surface of solid acid catalysts at the
molecular level, despite their importance for industrial catalytic applications. 
A sulfated zirconium-based metal-organic framework, MOF-808-SO4, was previously
shown to be a strong solid Brønsted acid material. In this report, we probe the
origin of its acidity through an array of spectroscopic, crystallographic and
computational characterization techniques. The strongest Brønsted acid site is
shown to consist of a specific arrangement of adsorbed water and sulfate moieties
on the zirconium clusters. When a water molecule adsorbs to one zirconium atom,
it participates in a hydrogen bond with a sulfate moiety that is chelated to a
neighbouring zirconium atom; this motif, in turn, results in the presence of a
strongly acidic proton. On dehydration, the material loses its acidity. The
hydrated sulfated MOF exhibits a good catalytic performance for the dimerization 
of isobutene (2-methyl-1-propene), and achieves a 100% selectivity for C8
products with a good conversion efficiency.

The enantioselective construction of carbon-heteroatom and carbon-carbon bonds
that are alpha to ketones leads to the formation of substructures that are
ubiquitous in natural products, pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Traditional
methods to form such bonds have relied on combining ketone enolates with
electrophiles. Reactions with heteroatom-based electrophiles require special
reagents in which the heteroatom, which is typically nucleophilic, has been
rendered electrophilic by changes to the oxidation state. The resulting products 
usually require post-synthetic transformations to unveil the functional group in 
the final desired products. Moreover, different catalytic systems are typically
required for the reaction of different electrophiles. Here, we report a strategy 
for the formal enantioselective α-functionalization of ketones to form products
containing a diverse array of substituents at the alpha position with a single
catalyst. This strategy involves an unusual reversal of the role of the
nucleophile and electrophile to form C-N, C-O, C-S and C-C bonds from a series of
masked ketone electrophiles and a wide range of conventional heteroatom and
carbon nucleophiles catalysed by a metallacyclic iridium catalyst.

Although N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have demonstrated outstanding potential
for use as surface anchors, synthetic challenges have limited their application
to either large planar substrates or very small spherical nanoparticles. The
development of a strategy to graft NHCs onto non-spherical nanomaterials, such as
gold nanorods, would greatly expand their utility as surface ligands. Here, we
use a bidentate thiolate-NHC-gold(I) complex that is easily grafted onto
commercial cetyl trimethylammonium bromide-stabilized gold nanorods through
ligand exchange. On mild reduction of the resulting surface-tethered NHC-gold(I) 
complexes, the gold atom attached to the NHC complex is added to the surface as
an adatom, thereby precluding the need for reorganization of the underlying
surface lattice upon NHC binding. The resulting thiolate-NHC-stabilized gold
nanorods are stable towards excess glutathione for up to six days, and under
conditions with large variations in pH, high and low temperatures, high salt
concentrations, or in biological media and cell culture. We also demonstrate the 
utility of these nanorods for in vitro photothermal therapy.

Specific molecular recognition is routine for biology, but has proved difficult
to achieve in synthetic systems. Carbohydrate substrates are especially
challenging, because of their diversity and similarity to water, the biological
solvent. Here we report a synthetic receptor for glucose, which is biomimetic in 
both design and capabilities. The core structure is simple and symmetrical, yet
provides a cavity which almost perfectly complements the all-equatorial
β-pyranoside substrate. The receptor's affinity for glucose, at Ka ~ 18,000 M-1, 
compares well with natural receptor systems. Selectivities also reach biological 
levels. Most other saccharides are bound approximately 100 times more weakly,
while non-carbohydrate substrates are ignored. Glucose-binding molecules are
required for initiatives in diabetes treatment, such as continuous glucose
monitoring and glucose-responsive insulin. The performance and tunability of this
system augur well for such applications.

Rechargeable aprotic alkali metal (Li or Na)-O2 batteries are the subject of
great interest because of their high theoretical specific energy. However, the
growth of dendrites and cracks at the Li or Na anode, as well as their corrosive 
oxidation lead to poor cycling stability and safety issues. Understanding the
mechanism and improving Li/Na-ion plating and stripping electrochemistry are
therefore essential to realizing their technological potential. Here, we report
how the use of a Li-Na alloy anode and an electrolyte additive realizes an
aprotic bimetal Li-Na alloy-O2 battery with improved cycling stability.
Electrochemical investigations show that stripping and plating of Li and Na and
the robust and flexible passivation film formed in situ (by 1,3-dioxolane
additive reacting with the Li-Na alloy) suppress dendrite and buffer alloy anode 
volume expansion and thus prevent cracking, avoiding electrolyte consumption and 
ensuring high electron transport efficiency and continued electrochemical
reactions.

Cooperativity between metal centres is identified as a crucial step in dinitrogen
reduction both for the industrial Haber-Bosch process and for the natural
fixation of nitrogen by nitrogenase enzymes, but the mechanism of N2 reduction
remains poorly understood. This is in large part because multimetallic complexes 
that reduce and functionalize dinitrogen in the absence of strong alkali reducing
agents are crucial to establish a structure-activity relationship, but remain
extremely rare. Recently, we reported a multimetallic nitride-bridged
diuranium(III) complex capable of reducing and functionalizing dinitrogen. Here
we show that an analogous complex assembled with an oxo instead of a nitride
linker also effects the four-electron reduction of dinitrogen, but the reactivity
of the resulting oxo-(N2) complex differs significantly from that of the
nitride-(N2). Computational studies show a different bonding scheme for the
dinitrogen where the bridging nitride does participate in the binding and
consequent activation of N2, while the oxide does not.

The version of this Article originally published online did not include a caution
statement relating to safety concerns over some of the reagents used. All
versions of the Article now have the following text included at the start of the 
Methods section "Caution: Sodium azide (NaN3) is highly toxic and also a
potential explosion hazard; it can also react with organohalides to form
explosive organic azides. Under acidic conditions, sodium azide can form
hydrazoic acid (HN3) which is highly toxic. Considering these hazards,
appropriate safety precautions should be taken when undertaking the C-C amination
reactions reported in this Article." Furthermore, in Fig. 2a, in the reaction
conditions on the first equation it should have read DDQ not DDG; this has also
been amended.

Transition metal catalysis has emerged as an important means for C-C activation
that allows mild and selective transformations. However, the current scope of C-C
bonds that can be activated is primarily restricted to either highly strained
systems or more polarized C-C bonds. In contrast, the catalytic activation of
non-polar and unstrained C-C moieties remains an unmet challenge. Here we report 
a general approach for the catalytic activation of the unstrained C(aryl)-C(aryl)
bonds in 2,2'-biphenols. The key is to utilize the phenol moiety as a handle to
install phosphinites as a recyclable directing group. Using hydrogen gas as the
reductant, monophenols are obtained with a low catalyst loading and high
functional group tolerance. This approach is also applied to the synthesis of
2,3,4-trisubstituted phenols. A further mechanistic study suggests that the C-C
activation step is mediated by a rhodium(I) monohydride species. Finally, a
preliminary study on breaking the inert biphenolic moieties in lignin models is
illustrated.

Conjugates between proteins and small molecules enable access to a vast chemical 
space that is not achievable with either type of molecule alone; however, the
paucity of specific reactions capable of functionalizing proteins and natural
products presents a formidable challenge for preparing conjugates. Here we report
a strategy for conjugating electron-rich (hetero)arenes to polypeptides and
proteins. Our bioconjugation technique exploits the electrophilic reactivity of
an oxidized selenocysteine residue in polypeptides and proteins, and the
electron-rich character of certain small molecules to provide bioconjugates in
excellent yields under mild conditions. This conjugation chemistry enabled the
synthesis of peptide-vancomycin conjugates without the prefunctionalization of
vancomycin. These conjugates have an enhanced in vitro potency for resistant
Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. Additionally, we show that a 6 kDa
affibody protein and a 150 kDa immunoglobulin-G antibody could be modified
without diminishing bioactivity.

The performances of porous materials are closely related to the accessibility and
interconnectivity of their porous domains. Visualizing pore architecture and its 
role on functionality-for example, mass transport-has been a challenge so far,
and traditional bulk and often non-visual pore measurements have to suffice in
most cases. Here, we present an integrated, facile fluorescence microscopy
approach to visualize the pore accessibility and interconnectivity of
industrial-grade catalyst bodies, and link it unequivocally with their catalytic 
performance. Fluorescent nanoprobes of various sizes were imaged and correlated
with the molecular transport of fluorescent molecules formed during a separate
catalytic reaction. A direct visual relationship between the pore
architecture-which depends on the pore sizes and interconnectivity of the
material selected-and molecular transport was established. This approach can be
applied to other porous materials, and the insight gained may prove useful in the
design of more efficient heterogeneous catalysts.

Photosensitizers, which harness light energy to upgrade weak reductants to strong
reductants, are pivotal components of the natural and artificial photosynthesis
machineries. However, it has proved difficult to enhance and expand their
functions through genetic engineering. Here we report a genetically encoded,
27 kDa photosensitizer protein (PSP), which facilitates the rational design of
miniature photocatalytic CO2-reducing enzymes. Visible light drives PSP
efficiently into a long-lived triplet excited state (PSP*), which reacts rapidly 
with reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide to generate a super-reducing
radical (PSP•), which is strong enough to reduce many CO2-reducing catalysts. We 
determined the three-dimensional structure of PSP• at 1.8 Å resolution by X-ray
crystallography. Genetic engineering enabled the site-specific attachment of a
nickel-terpyridine complex and the modular optimization of the photochemical
properties of PSP, the chromophore/catalytic centre distance and the catalytic
centre microenvironment, which culminated in a miniature photocatalytic
CO2-reducing enzyme that has a CO2/CO conversion quantum efficiency of 2.6%.

Understanding the bonding, reactivity and electronic structure of actinides is
lagging behind that of the rest of the periodic table. This can be partly
explained by the challenges that one faces in experimental studies of such
radioactive compounds and also by the need to properly account for relativistic
effects in theoretical studies. A further challenge is the very complicated
electronic structures encountered in actinide chemistry, as vividly illustrated
by the naked diuranium molecule U2. Here we report a computational study of this 
emblematic molecule using state-of-the-art relativistic quantum chemical methods.
Notably, the variational inclusion of spin-orbit interactions leads not only to a
different electronic ground state, but also to a lower bond multiplicity compared
with those in previous studies.

Anilines are fundamental motifs in various chemical contexts, and are widely used
in the industrial production of fine chemicals, polymers, agrochemicals and
pharmaceuticals. A recent development for the synthesis of anilines uses the
primary amination of C-H bonds in electron-rich arenes. However, there are
limitations to this strategy: the amination of electron-deficient arenes remains 
a challenging task and the amination of electron-rich arenes has a limited
control over regioselectivity-the formation of meta-aminated products is
especially difficult. Here we report a site-directed C-C bond primary amination
of simple and readily available alkylarenes or benzyl alcohols for the direct and
efficient preparation of anilines. This chemistry involves a novel C-C bond
transformation and offers a versatile protocol for the synthesis of substituted
anilines. The use of O2 as an environmentally benign oxidant is demonstrated, and
studies on model compounds suggest that this method may also be used for the
depolymerization of lignin.

Nucleosomes are the basic unit of chromatin that help the packaging of genetic
material while controlling access to the genetic information. The underlying DNA 
sequence, together with transcription-associated proteins and chromatin
remodelling complexes, are important factors that influence the organization of
nucleosomes. Here, we show that the naturally occurring DNA modification,
5-formylcytosine (5fC) is linked to tissue-specific nucleosome organization. Our 
study reveals that 5fC is associated with increased nucleosome occupancy in vitro
and in vivo. We demonstrate that 5fC-associated nucleosomes at enhancers in the
mammalian hindbrain and heart are linked to elevated gene expression. Our study
also reveals the formation of a reversible-covalent Schiff base linkage between
lysines of histone proteins and 5fC within nucleosomes in a cellular environment.
We define their specific genomic loci in mouse embryonic stem cells and look into
the biological consequences of these DNA-histone Schiff base sites. Collectively,
our findings show that 5fC is a determinant of nucleosome organization and plays 
a role in establishing distinct regulatory regions that control transcription.

By flanking a carbene carbon with two substituents, it is possible to synthesize 
persistent triplet carbenes and isolable singlet carbenes. Isolable singlet
carbenes are among the most powerful tools in chemistry, and they have even found
medicinal and materials science applications. Between the rich chemistry of
disubstituted carbenes and the transient parent carbene are the monosubstituted
carbenes that, so far, have only been observed in matrices at very low
temperatures of just a few K. Herein, we describe the synthesis of a crystalline 
monosubstituted carbene. The key for isolating such a species was to design the
correct substituent, namely a benzo[c]pyrrolidino heterocycle, which can
single-handedly tame the intrinsic tendency of carbenes towards dimerization. The
π-donor ability of the nitrogen atom, coupled with the steric bulk of chemically 
inert substituents at the two adjacent quaternary carbons, make these scaffolds
very attractive for the isolation of a variety of other hitherto elusive
electron-deficient species.

A prerequisite to gain a complete understanding of the most basic aspects of
chemical reactions is the ability to perform experiments with complete control
over the reactant degrees of freedom. By controlling these, details of a reaction
mechanism can be investigated and ultimately manipulated. Here, we present a
study of chemi-ionization-a fundamental energy-transfer reaction-under completely
controlled conditions. The collision energy of the reagents was tuned from 0.02 K
to 1,000 K, with the orientation of the excited Ne atom relative to Ar fully
specified by an external magnetic field. Chemi-ionization of Ne(3P2) and Ar in
these conditions enables a detailed investigation of how the reaction proceeds,
and provides us with a means to control the branching ratio between the two
possible reaction outcomes. The merged-beam experimental technique used here
allows access to a low-energy regime in which the atoms dynamically reorient into
a favourable configuration for reaction, irrespective of their initial
orientations.

The accurate dissection of binding energies into their microscopic components is 
challenging, especially in solution. Here we study the binding of noble gases
(He-Xe) with the macrocyclic receptor cucurbit[5]uril in water by displacement of
methane and ethane as 1H NMR probes. We dissect the hydration free energies of
the noble gases into an attractive dispersive component and a repulsive one for
formation of a cavity in water. This allows us to identify the contributions to
host-guest binding and to conclude that the binding process is driven by
differential cavitation energies rather than dispersion interactions. The free
energy required to create a cavity to accept the noble gas inside the
cucurbit[5]uril is much lower than that to create a similarly sized cavity in
bulk water. The recovery of the latter cavitation energy drives the overall
process, which has implications for the refinement of gas-storage materials and
the understanding of biological receptors.

Pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) is an enzyme cofactor required for the chemical
transformation of biological amines in many central cellular processes.
PLP-dependent enzymes (PLP-DEs) are ubiquitous and evolutionarily diverse, making
their classification based on sequence homology challenging. Here we present a
chemical proteomic method for reporting on PLP-DEs using functionalized cofactor 
probes. We synthesized pyridoxal analogues modified at the 2'-position, which are
taken up by cells and metabolized in situ. These pyridoxal analogues are
phosphorylated to functional cofactor surrogates by cellular pyridoxal kinases
and bind to PLP-DEs via an aldimine bond which can be rendered irreversible by
NaBH4 reduction. Conjugation to a reporter tag enables the subsequent
identification of PLP-DEs using quantitative, label-free mass spectrometry. Using
these probes we accessed a significant portion of the Staphylococcus aureus
PLP-DE proteome (73%) and annotate uncharacterized proteins as novel PLP-DEs. We 
also show that this approach can be used to study structural tolerance within
PLP-DE active sites and to screen for off-targets of the PLP-DE inhibitor
D-cycloserine.

Alkenes are among the most versatile building blocks and are widely used for the 
production of polymers, detergents and synthetic lubricants. Currently, alkenes
are sourced from petroleum feedstocks such as naphtha. In light of the necessity 
to invent sustainable production methods, multiple approaches to making alkenes
from abundant fatty acids have been evaluated. However, all attempts so far have 
required at least one stoichiometric additive, which is an obstruction for
applications at larger scales. Here, we report an approach to making olefins from
carboxylic acids, in which every additional reaction constituent can be used as a
catalyst. We show how abundant fatty acids can be converted to alpha-olefins, and
expand the method to include structurally complex carboxylic acids, giving access
to synthetically versatile intermediates. Our approach is enabled by the
cooperative interplay between a cobalt catalyst, which functions as a proton
reduction catalyst, and a photoredox catalyst, which mediates oxidative
decarboxylation; coupling both processes enables catalytic conversion of
carboxylic acids to olefins.

Inhibiting the interaction between amyloid-β (Aβ) and a neuronal cell surface
receptor, LilrB2, has been suggested as a potential route for treating
Alzheimer's disease. Supporting this approach, Alzheimer's-like symptoms are
reduced in mouse models following genetic depletion of the LilrB2 homologue. In
its pathogenic, oligomeric state, Aβ binds to LilrB2, triggering a pathway to
synaptic loss. Here we identify the LilrB2 binding moieties of Aβ (16KLVFFA21)
and identify its binding site on LilrB2 from a crystal structure of LilrB2
immunoglobulin domains D1D2 complexed to small molecules that mimic phenylalanine
residues. In this structure, we observed two pockets that can accommodate the
phenylalanine side chains of KLVFFA. These pockets were confirmed to be
16KLVFFA21 binding sites by mutagenesis. Rosetta docking revealed a plausible
geometry for the Aβ-LilrB2 complex and assisted with the structure-guided
selection of small molecule inhibitors. These molecules inhibit Aβ-LilrB2
interactions in vitro and on the cell surface and reduce Aβ cytotoxicity, which
suggests these inhibitors are potential therapeutic leads against Alzheimer's
disease.

Nature uses organic molecules for light harvesting and photosynthesis, but most
man-made water splitting catalysts are inorganic semiconductors. Organic
photocatalysts, while attractive because of their synthetic tunability, tend to
have low quantum efficiencies for water splitting. Here we present a crystalline 
covalent organic framework (COF) based on a benzo-bis(benzothiophene sulfone)
moiety that shows a much higher activity for photochemical hydrogen evolution
than its amorphous or semicrystalline counterparts. The COF is stable under
long-term visible irradiation and shows steady photochemical hydrogen evolution
with a sacrificial electron donor for at least 50 hours. We attribute the high
quantum efficiency of fused-sulfone-COF to its crystallinity, its strong visible 
light absorption, and its wettable, hydrophilic 3.2 nm mesopores. These pores
allow the framework to be dye-sensitized, leading to a further 61% enhancement in
the hydrogen evolution rate up to 16.3 mmol g-1 h-1. The COF also retained its
photocatalytic activity when cast as a thin film onto a support.

Reactive oxygen species are integral to many physiological processes. Although
their roles are still being elucidated, they seem to be linked to a variety of
disorders and may represent promising drug targets. Mimics of superoxide
dismutases, which catalyse the decomposition of O2•- to H2O2 and O2, have
traditionally used redox-active metals, which are toxic outside of a tightly
coordinating ligand. Purely organic antioxidants have also been investigated but 
generally require stoichiometric, rather than catalytic, doses. Here, we show
that a complex of the redox-inactive metal zinc(II) with a hexadentate ligand
containing a redox-active quinol can catalytically degrade superoxide, as
demonstrated by both reactivity assays and stopped-flow kinetics studies of
direct reactions with O2•- and the zinc(II) complex. The observed superoxide
dismutase catalysis has an important advantage over previously reported work in
that it is hastened, rather than impeded, by the presence of phosphate, the
concentration of which is high under physiological conditions.

Many qualitative structure-property correlations between diradical character and 
emerging molecular properties are known. For example, the increase of diradical
character further decreases the singlet-triplet energy gap. Here we show that
inclusion of thiophenes within a quinoidal polycyclic hydrocarbon imparts
appreciable diradical character yet retains the large singlet-triplet energy gap,
a phenomenon that has no precedent in the literature. The low aromatic character 
of thiophene and its electron-rich nature are the key properties leading to these
unique findings. A new indenoindenodibenzothiophene scaffold has been prepared
and fully characterized by several spectroscopies, magnetic measurements,
solid-state X-ray and state-of-the-art quantum chemical calculations, all
corroborating this unique dichotomy between the diradical input and the emerging 
magnetic properties. New structure-property relationships such as these are not
only extremely important in the field of diradical chemistry and organic
electronics, but also provide new insights into the versatility of π-electron
chemical bonding.

Polysaccharide depolymerization is an essential step for valorizing
lignocellulosic biomass. In inexpensive systems such as pure water or dilute acid
mixtures, carbohydrate monomer degradation rates exceed hemicellulose-and
especially cellulose-depolymerization rates at most easily accessible
temperatures, limiting sugar yields. Here, we use a reversible stabilization of
xylose and glucose by acetal formation with formaldehyde to alter this kinetic
paradigm, preventing sugar dehydration to furans and their subsequent
degradation. During a harsh organosolv pretreatment in the presence of
formaldehyde, over 90% of xylan in beech wood was recovered as diformylxylose
(compared to 16% xylose recovery without formaldehyde). The subsequent
depolymerization of cellulose led to carbohydrate yields over 70% and a final
concentration of ~5 wt%, whereas the same conditions without formaldehyde gave a 
yield of 28%. This stabilization strategy pushes back the longstanding kinetic
limits of polysaccharide depolymerization and enables the recovery of
biomass-derived carbohydrates in high yields and concentrations.

The chemical inertness of the defect-free basal plane confers environmental
stability to MoS2 single layers, but it also limits their chemical versatility
and catalytic activity. The stability of pristine MoS2 basal plane against
oxidation under ambient conditions is a widely accepted assumption however, here 
we report single-atom-level structural investigations that reveal that oxygen
atoms spontaneously incorporate into the basal plane of MoS2 single layers during
ambient exposure. The use of scanning tunnelling microscopy reveals a slow
oxygen-substitution reaction, during which individual sulfur atoms are replaced
one by one by oxygen, giving rise to solid-solution-type 2D MoS2-xOx crystals.
Oxygen substitution sites present all over the basal plane act as single-atom
reaction centres, substantially increasing the catalytic activity of the entire
MoS2 basal plane for the electrochemical H2 evolution reaction.

The principles guiding the design and synthesis of bioactive compounds based on
natural product (NP) structure, such as biology-oriented synthesis (BIOS), are
limited by their partial coverage of the NP-like chemical space of existing NPs
and retainment of bioactivity in the corresponding compound collections. Here we 
propose and validate a concept to overcome these limitations by de novo
combination of NP-derived fragments to structurally unprecedented 'pseudo natural
products'. Pseudo NPs inherit characteristic elements of NP structure yet enable 
the efficient exploration of areas of chemical space not covered by NP-derived
chemotypes, and may possess novel bioactivities. We provide a proof of principle 
by designing, synthesizing and investigating the biological properties of
chromopynone pseudo NPs that combine biosynthetically unrelated chromane- and
tetrahydropyrimidinone NP fragments. We show that chromopynones define a glucose 
uptake inhibitor chemotype that selectively targets glucose transporters GLUT-1
and -3, inhibits cancer cell growth and promises to inspire new drug discovery
programmes aimed at tumour metabolism.

The unique properties of graphene, transition-metal dichalcogenides and other
two-dimensional (2D) materials have boosted interest in layered coordination
solids. In particular, 2D materials that behave as both conductors and magnets
could find applications in quantum magnetoelectronics and spintronics. Here, we
report the synthesis of CrCl2(pyrazine)2, an air-stable layered solid, by
reaction of CrCl2 with pyrazine (pyz). This compound displays a ferrimagnetic
order below ∼55 K, reflecting the presence of strong magnetic interactions.
Electrical conductivity measurements demonstrate that CrCl2(pyz)2 reaches a
conductivity of 32 mS cm-1 at room temperature, which operates through a 2D
hopping-based transport mechanism. These properties are induced by the
redox-activity of the pyrazine ligand, which leads to a smearing of the Cr 3d and
pyrazine π states. We suggest that the combination of redox-active ligands and
reducing paramagnetic metal ions represents a general approach towards tuneable
2D materials that consist of charge-neutral layers and exhibit both long-range
magnetic order and high electronic conductivity.

The simultaneous synthesis of a molecular nine-crossing composite knot that
contains three trefoil tangles of the same handedness and a [Formula: see text]
link (a type of cyclic [3]catenane topologically constrained to always have at
least three twists within the links) is reported. Both compounds contain high
degrees of topological writhe (w = 9), a structural feature of supercoiled DNA.
The entwined products are generated from the cyclization of a hexameric Fe(II)
circular helicate by ring-closing olefin metathesis, with the mixture of
topological isomers formed as a result of different ligand connectivity patterns.
The metal-coordinated composite knot was isolated by crystallization, the
topology unambiguously proven by tandem mass spectrometry, with X-ray
crystallography confirming that the 324-atom loop crosses itself nine times with 
matching handedness (all Δ or all Λ) at every metal centre within each molecule. 
Controlling the connectivity of the ligand end groups on circular metal helicate 
scaffolds provides an effective synthetic strategy for the stereoselective
synthesis of composite knots and other complex molecular topologies.

Carbohydrates (CH2O)n are the formal adducts of carbon (atoms) to water with a
repeating unit that structurally resembles H-C̈-OH (hydroxymethylene). Although
hydroxymethylene has been suggested as a building block for sugar formation, it
is a reactive species that had escaped detection until recently. Here we
demonstrate that formaldehyde reacts with its isomer hydroxymethylene to give
glycolaldehyde in a nearly barrierless reaction. This carbonyl-ene-type
transformation operates in the absence of base and solvent at cryogenic
temperatures similar to those found in extraterrestrial environments or
interstellar clouds. Hydroxymethylene acts as a building block for an iterative
sugar synthesis, as we demonstrate through the formation of the triose
glyceraldehyde. The thermodynamically preferred ketose dihydroxyacetone does not 
form, and the formation of further branched sugars in the iterative synthesis
presented here is unlikely. The results therefore provide a link between the
well-known formose (Butlerow) reaction and sugar formation under non-aqueous
conditions.

Dynamic covalent chemistry, with its ability to correct synthetic dead-ends,
allows for the synthesis of elaborate extended network materials in high yields. 
However, the limited number of reactions amenable to dynamic covalent chemistry
necessarily confines the scope and functionality of materials synthesized. Here, 
we explore the dynamic and self-correcting nature of nucleophilic aromatic
substitution (SNAr), using ortho-aryldithiols and ortho-aryldifluorides that
condense to produce redox-active thianthrene units. We demonstrate the facile
construction of two-, three- and four-point junctions by reaction between a
dithiol nucleophile and three different model electrophiles that produces
molecules with two, three and four thianthrene moieties, respectively, in
excellent yields. The regioselectivity observed is driven by thermodynamics;
other connections form under kinetic control. We also show that the same
chemistry can be extended to the synthesis of novel ladder macrocycles and porous
polymer networks with Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area of up to 813 m2 g-1.

The introduction of sp3 defects into single-walled carbon nanotubes through
covalent functionalization can generate new light-emitting states and thus
dramatically expand their optical functionality. This may open up routes to
enhanced imaging, photon upconversion, and room-temperature single-photon
emission at telecom wavelengths. However, a significant challenge in harnessing
this potential is that the nominally simple reaction chemistry of nanotube
functionalization introduces a broad diversity of emitting states. Precisely
defining a narrow band of emission energies necessitates constraining these
states, which requires extreme selectivity in molecular binding configuration on 
the nanotube surface. We show here that such selectivity can be obtained through 
aryl functionalization of so-called 'zigzag' nanotube structures to achieve a
threefold narrowing in emission bandwidth. Accompanying density functional theory
modelling reveals that, because of the associated structural symmetry, the defect
states become degenerate, thus limiting emission energies to a single narrow
band. We show that this behaviour can only result from a predominant selectivity 
for ortho binding configurations of the aryl groups on the nanotube lattice.

Cells and organelles are delimited by lipid bilayers in which high deformability 
is essential to many cell processes, including motility, endocytosis and cell
division. Membrane tension is therefore a major regulator of the cell processes
that remodel membranes, albeit one that is very hard to measure in vivo. Here we 
show that a planarizable push-pull fluorescent probe called FliptR (fluorescent
lipid tension reporter) can monitor changes in membrane tension by changing its
fluorescence lifetime as a function of the twist between its fluorescent groups. 
The fluorescence lifetime depends linearly on membrane tension within cells,
enabling an easy quantification of membrane tension by fluorescence lifetime
imaging microscopy. We further show, using model membranes, that this linear
dependency between lifetime of the probe and membrane tension relies on a
membrane-tension-dependent lipid phase separation. We also provide calibration
curves that enable accurate measurement of membrane tension using fluorescence
lifetime imaging microscopy.

Chemical functionalization is a powerful approach to tailor the physical and
chemical properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials, increase their
processability and stability, tune their functionalities and, even, create new 2D
materials. This is typically achieved through post-synthetic functionalization by
anchoring molecules on the surface of an exfoliated 2D crystal, but it inevitably
alters the long-range structural order of the material. Here we present a
pre-synthetic approach that allows the isolation of crystalline, robust and
magnetic functionalized monolayers of coordination polymers. A series of five
isostructural layered magnetic coordination polymers based on Fe(II) centres and 
different benzimidazole derivatives (bearing a Cl, H, CH3, Br or NH2 side group) 
were first prepared. On mechanical exfoliation, 2D materials are obtained that
retain their long-range structural order and exhibit good mechanical and magnetic
properties. This combination, together with the possibility to functionalize
their surface at will, makes them good candidates to explore magnetism in the 2D 
limit and to fabricate mechanical resonators for selective gas sensing.

Alloying provides a means by which to tune a metal catalyst's electronic
structure and thus tailor its performance; however, mean-field behaviour in
metals imposes limits. To access unprecedented catalytic behaviour, materials
must exhibit emergent properties that are not simply interpolations of the
constituent components' properties. Here we show an emergent electronic structure
in single-atom alloys, whereby weak wavefunction mixing between minority and
majority elements results in a free-atom-like electronic structure on the
minority element. This unusual electronic structure alters the minority element's
adsorption properties such that the bonding with adsorbates resembles the bonding
in molecular metal complexes. We demonstrate this phenomenon with AgCu alloys,
dilute in Cu, where the Cu d states are nearly unperturbed from their free-atom
state. In situ electron spectroscopy demonstrates that this unusual electronic
structure persists in reaction conditions and exhibits a 0.1 eV smaller
activation barrier than bulk Cu in methanol reforming. Theory predicts that
several other dilute alloys exhibit this phenomenon, which offers a design
approach that may lead to alloys with unprecedented catalytic properties.

On-surface polymerization is a promising technique to prepare organic functional 
nanomaterials that are challenging to synthesize in solution, but it is typically
used on metal substrates, which play a catalytic role. Previous examples on
insulating surfaces have involved intermediate self-assembled structures, which
face high barriers to diffusion, or annealing to higher temperatures, which
generally causes rapid dewetting and desorption of the monomers. Here we report
the photoinitiated radical polymerization, initiated from a two-dimensional gas
phase, of a dimaleimide monomer on an insulating KCl surface. Polymer fibres up
to 1 μm long are formed through chain-like rather than step-like growth.
Interactions between potassium cations and the dimaleimide's oxygen atoms
facilitate the propagation of the polymer fibres along a preferred axis of the
substrate over long distances. Density functional theory calculations,
non-contact atomic force microscopy imaging and manipulations at room temperature
were used to explore the initiation and propagation processes, as well as the
structure and stability of the resulting one-dimensional polymer fibres.

Synthetic organic strategies that enable the catalytic and rapid assembly of a
large array of organic compounds that possess multiple stereocentres in acyclic
systems are somewhat rare, especially when it comes to reaching today's high
standards of efficiency and selectivity. In particular, the catalytic preparation
of a three-dimensional molecular layout of a simple acyclic hydrocarbon skeleton 
that possesses several stereocentres from simple and readily available reagents
still represents a vastly uncharted domain. Here we report a rapid, modular,
stereodivergent and diversity-oriented unified strategy to construct acyclic
molecular frameworks that bear up to four contiguous and congested stereogenic
elements, with remarkably high levels of stereocontrol and in only three
catalytic steps from commercially available alkynes. A regio- and
diastereoselective catalytic Heck migratory insertion reaction of
alkenylcyclopropyl carbinols that merges selective C-C bond cleavage of a
cyclopropane represents the key step.

Stereodynamic descriptions of molecular collisions concern the angular
correlations that exist between vector properties of the motion of the
participating species, including their velocities and rotational angular momenta.
Measurements of vector correlations provide a unique view of the forces acting
during collisions, and are a stringent test of electronic-structure calculations 
of molecular interactions. Here, we present direct measurement of the four-vector
correlation between initial and final relative velocities and rotational angular 
momenta in a molecular collision. This property, which quantifies the extent to
which a molecule retains a memory of its initial sense of rotation, or
handedness, as a function of scattering angle, yields insight into the dynamics
of a molecular collision. We report non-intuitive changes in the handedness for
specific states and scattering angles, reproduced by classical and quantum
scattering calculations. Comparison to calculations on different ab initio
potential energy surfaces demonstrates this measurement's exquisite sensitivity
to the underlying intermolecular forces.

Chemists' ability to synthesize structurally complex, high-value organic
molecules from simple starting materials is limited by methods to selectively
activate and functionalize strong alkyl C(sp3) covalent bonds. Recent activity
has focused on the activation of abundant C-O, C-N and C-C bonds via a
mechanistic paradigm of oxidative addition of a low-valent, electron-rich
transition metal. This approach typically employs nickel(0), rhodium(I),
ruthenium(0) and iron catalysts under conditions finely tuned for specific,
electronically activated substrates, sometimes assisted by chelating functional
groups or ring strain. By adopting a redox-neutral strategy involving
palladium(II)-catalysed C-H activation followed by β-heteroatom/carbon
elimination, we describe here a catalytic method to activate alkyl C(sp3)-oxygen,
nitrogen, carbon, fluorine and sulfur bonds with high regioselectivity. Directed 
hydrofunctionalization of the resultant palladium(II)-bound alkene leads to
formal functional group metathesis. The method is applied to amino acid upgrading
with complete regioselectivity and moderate to high retention of enantiomeric
excess. Low-strain heterocycles undergo strong-bond activation and substitution, 
giving ring-opened products.

Reconstitution and simulation of cellular motility in microcompartmentalized
colloidal objects have important implications for microcapsule-based remote
sensing, environmentally induced signalling between artificial cell-like entities
and programming spatial migration in synthetic protocell consortia. Here we
describe the design and construction of catalase-containing organoclay/DNA
semipermeable microcapsules, which in the presence of hydrogen peroxide exhibit
enzyme-powered oxygen gas bubble-dependent buoyancy. We determine the optimum
conditions for single and/or multiple bubble generation per microcapsule, monitor
the protocell velocities and resilience, and use remote magnetic guidance to
establish reversible changes in the buoyancy. Co-encapsulation of catalase and
glucose oxidase is exploited to establish a spatiotemporal response to
antagonistic bubble generation and depletion to produce protocells capable of
sustained oscillatory vertical movement. We demonstrate that the motility of the 
microcapsules can be used for the flotation of macroscopic objects, self-sorting 
of mixed protocell communities and the delivery of a biocatalyst from an inert to
chemically active environment. These results highlight new opportunities to
constructing programmable microcompartmentalized colloids with buoyancy-derived
motility.

Bond formation between two molecular entities in a closed system strictly obeys
the principle of microscopic reversibility and occurs in favour of the
thermodynamically more stable product. Here, we demonstrate how light can bypass 
this fundamental limitation by driving and controlling the reversible bimolecular
reaction between an N-nucleophile and a photoswitchable carbonyl electrophile.
Light-driven tautomerization cycles reverse the reactivity of the
C=O/C=N-electrophiles ('umpolung') to activate substrates and remove products,
respectively, solely depending on the illumination wavelength. By applying either
red or blue light, selective and nearly quantitative intermolecular bond
formation/scission can be achieved, even if the underlying
condensation/hydrolysis equilibrium is thermodynamically disfavoured. Exploiting 
light-driven in situ C=N exchange, our approach can be used to externally
regulate a closed dynamic covalent system by actively and reversibly removing
specific components, resembling a molecular and bidirectional version of a
macroscopic Dean-Stark trap.

Highly porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which have undergone exciting
developments over the past few decades, show promise for a wide range of
applications. However, many studies indicate that they suffer from significant
stability issues, especially with respect to their interactions with water, which
severely limits their practical potential. Here we demonstrate how the presence
of 'sacrificial' bonds in the coordination environment of its metal centres
(referred to as hemilability) endows a dehydrated copper-based MOF with good
hydrolytic stability. On exposure to water, in contrast to the indiscriminate
breaking of coordination bonds that typically results in structure degradation,
it is non-structural weak interactions between the MOF's copper paddlewheel
clusters that are broken and the framework recovers its as-synthesized, hydrated 
structure. This MOF retained its structural integrity even after contact with
water for one year, whereas HKUST-1, a compositionally similar material that
lacks these sacrificial bonds, loses its crystallinity in less than a day under
the same conditions.

As our reliance on renewable energy sources grows, so too does our need to store 
this energy to mitigate against troughs in supply. Energy storage in batteries or
by conversion to chemical fuels are the two most flexible and scalable options,
but are normally considered mutually exclusive. Energy storage solutions that can
act as both batteries and fuel generation devices (depending on the requirements 
of the user) could therefore revolutionize the uptake and use of renewably
generated energy. Here, we present a polyoxoanion, [P2W18O62]6-, that can be
reversibly reduced and protonated by 18 electrons/H+ per anion in aqueous
solution, and that can act either as a high-performance redox flow battery
electrolyte (giving a practical discharged energy density of 225 Wh l-1 with a
theoretical energy density of more than 1,000 Wh l-1), or as a mediator in an
electrolytic cell for the on-demand generation of hydrogen.

Sulfur-containing molecules participate in many essential biological processes.
Of utmost importance is the methylthioether moiety, present in the proteinogenic 
amino acid methionine and installed in tRNA by radical-S-adenosylmethionine
methylthiotransferases. Although the thiol-ene reaction for carbon-sulfur bond
formation has found widespread applications in materials or medicinal science, a 
biocompatible chemo- and regioselective hydrothiolation of unactivated alkenes
and alkynes remains elusive. Here, we describe the design of a general
chemoselective anti-Markovnikov hydroalkyl/aryl thiolation of alkenes and
alkynes-also allowing the biologically important hydromethylthiolation-by
triplet-triplet energy transfer activation of disulfides. This fast disulfide-ene
reaction shows extraordinary functional group tolerance and biocompatibility.
Transient absorption spectroscopy was used to study the sensitization process in 
detail. The hereby gained mechanistic insights were successfully employed for
optimization of the catalytic system. This photosensitized transformation should 
stimulate bioimaging applications and carbon-sulfur bond-forming late-stage
functionalization chemistry, especially in the context of metabolic labelling.

C-H functionalization represents a promising approach for the synthesis of
complex molecules. Instead of relying on modifying the functional groups present 
in a molecule, the synthetic sequence is achieved by carrying out selective
reactions on the C-H bonds, which traditionally would have been considered to be 
the unreactive components of a molecule. A major challenge is to design catalysts
to control both the site- and stereoselectivity of the C-H functionalization. We 
have been developing dirhodium catalysts with different selectivity profiles in
C-H functionalization reactions with donor/acceptor carbenes as reactive
intermediates. Here we describe a new dirhodium catalyst capable of the
functionalization of non-activated primary C-H bonds with high levels of site
selectivity and enantioselectivity.

The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a fundamental reaction for energy storage 
and conversion. It has mainly relied on platinum-based electrocatalysts, but the 
chemical doping of carbon-based materials has proven to be a promising strategy
for preparing metal-free alternatives. Nitrogen doping in particular provides a
diverse range of nitrogen forms. Here, we introduce a new form of nitrogen doping
moieties -sp-hybridized nitrogen (sp-N) atoms into chemically defined sites of
ultrathin graphdiyne, through pericyclic replacement of the acetylene groups. The
as-prepared sp-N-doped graphdiyne catalyst exhibits overall good ORR performance,
in particular with regards to peak potential, half-wave potential and current
density. Under alkaline conditions it was comparable to commercial Pt/C, and
showed more rapid kinetics. And although its performances are a bit lower than
those of Pt/C in acidic media they surpass those of other metal-free materials.
Taken together, experimental data and density functional theory calculations
suggest that the high catalytic activity originates from the sp-N dopant, which
facilitates O2 adsorption and electron transfer on the surface of the catalyst.
This incorporation of chemically defined sp-N atoms provides a new synthetic
route to high-performance carbon-based and other metal-free catalysts.

Current methods for functional group interconversion have, for the most part,
relied on relatively strong driving forces which often require highly reactive
reagents to generate irreversibly a desired product in high yield and
selectivity. These approaches generally prevent the use of the same catalytic
strategy to perform the reverse reaction. Here we describe a catalytic functional
group metathesis approach to interconvert, under CO-free conditions, two
synthetically important classes of electrophiles that are often employed in the
preparation of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals-aroyl chlorides (ArCOCl) and
aryl iodides (ArI). Our reaction design relies on the implementation of a key
reversible ligand C-P bond cleavage event, which enables a non-innocent,
metathesis-active phosphine ligand to mediate a rapid aryl group transfer between
the two different electrophiles. Beyond enabling a practical and safer approach
to the interconversion of ArCOCl and ArI, this type of ligand non-innocence
provides a blueprint for the development of a broad range of functional group
metathesis reactions employing synthetically relevant aryl electrophiles.

Primary aliphatic amines are important building blocks in organic synthesis due
to the presence of a synthetically versatile NH2 group. N-functionalization of
primary amines is well established, but selective C-functionalization of
unprotected primary amines remains challenging. Here, we report the use of CO2 as
an activator for the direct transformation of abundant primary aliphatic amines
into valuable γ-lactams under photoredox and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT)
catalysis. Experimental and computational studies suggest that CO2 not only
inhibits undesired N-alkylation of primary amines, but also promotes selective
intermolecular HAT by an electrostatically accelerated interaction between the in
situ-generated negatively charged carbamate and the positively charged
quinuclidinium radical. This electrostatic attraction overwhelms the inherent
bond dissociation energies which suggest that HAT should occur unselectively. We 
anticipate that our findings will open up new avenues for amine
functionalizations as well as selectivity control in HAT reactions.

Molecular recognition plays a key role in enzyme-substrate specificity, the
regulation of genes, and the treatment of diseases. Inspired by the power of
molecular recognition in enzymatic processes, we sought to exploit its use in
organic synthesis. Here we demonstrate how a synthetic rhodium-based catalyst can
selectively bind a dehydroamino acid residue to initiate a sequential and
stereoselective synthesis of cyclic peptides. Our combined experimental and
theoretical study reveals the underpinnings of a cascade reduction that occurs
with high stereocontrol and in one direction around a macrocyclic ring. As the
catalyst can dissociate from the peptide, the C to N directionality of the
hydrogenation reactions is controlled by catalyst-substrate recognition rather
than a processive mechanism in which the catalyst remains bound to the
macrocycle. This mechanistic insight provides a foundation for the use of cascade
hydrogenations.

Tetracoordinate MIDA (N-methyliminodiacetic acid) boronates have found broad
utility in chemical synthesis. Here, we describe mechanistic insights into the
migratory aptitude of the MIDA boryl group in boron transfer processes, and show 
that the hemilability of the nitrogen atom on the MIDA ligand enables boron to
mechanistically resemble either a hydride or a proton. The first case involves a 
1,2-boryl shift, in which boron migrates as a nucleophile in its tetracoordinate 
form. The second case involves a neighbouring atom-promoted 1,4-boryl shift, in
which boron migrates as an electrophile in its pseudo-tricoordinate form. Density
functional theory studies and in situ NMR measurements all suggest that MIDA can 
act as a dynamic switch. These findings encouraged the development of novel
migration processes involving boron that exploit the chameleonic behaviour of
boron by acting as both a nucleophile and an electrophile, including the first
report of a compound with a boronate functionality bound to carbon in the
carboxylic acid oxidation state.

For over a century, the structures and reactivities of strained organic compounds
have captivated the chemical community. Whereas triple-bond-containing strained
intermediates have been well studied, cyclic allenes have received far less
attention. Additionally, studies of cyclic allenes that bear heteroatoms in the
ring are scarce. We report an experimental and computational study of azacyclic
allenes, which features syntheses of stable allene precursors, the mild
generation and Diels-Alder trapping of the desired cyclic allenes, and
explanations of the observed regio- and diastereoselectivities. Furthermore, we
show that stereochemical information can be transferred from an enantioenriched
silyl triflate starting material to a Diels-Alder cycloadduct by way of a
stereochemically defined azacyclic allene intermediate. These studies demonstrate
that heteroatom-containing cyclic allenes, despite previously being overlooked as
valuable synthetic intermediates, may be harnessed for the construction of
complex molecular scaffolds bearing multiple stereogenic centres.

Studies of secondary metabolites (natural products) that cover their isolation,
chemical synthesis and bioactivity investigation present myriad opportunities for
discovery. For example, the isolation of novel secondary metabolites can inspire 
advances in chemical synthesis strategies to achieve their practical preparation 
for biological evaluation. In the process, chemical synthesis can also provide
unambiguous structural characterization of the natural products. Although the
isolation, chemical synthesis and bioactivity studies of natural products are
mutually beneficial, they are often conducted independently. Here, we demonstrate
the benefits of a collaborative study of the phomactins, diterpenoid fungal
metabolites that serve as antagonists of the platelet activating factor receptor.
Our isolation of novel phomactins has spurred the development of a bioinspired,
unified approach that achieves the total syntheses of six congeners. We also
demonstrate in vitro the beneficial effects of several phomactins in suppressing 
the rate of repopulation of tumour cells following gamma radiation therapy.

Given the critical role of the aqueous excess proton in redox chemistry,
determining its structure and the mechanism of its transport in water are intense
areas of experimental and theoretical research. The ultrafast dynamics of the
proton's hydration structure has made it extremely challenging to study
experimentally. Using ultrafast broadband two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy, 
we show that the vibrational spectrum of the aqueous proton is fully consistent
with a protonated water complex broadly defined as a Zundel-like H5O2+ motif.
Analysis of the inhomogeneously broadened proton stretch two-dimensional
lineshape indicates an intrinsically asymmetric, low-barrier O-H+-O potential
that exhibits surprisingly persistent distributions in both its asymmetry and O-O
distance. This structural characterization has direct implications for the extent
of delocalization exhibited by a proton's excess charge and for the possible
mechanisms of proton transport in water.

Conventional technology for the purification of organic solvents requires massive
energy consumption, and to reduce such expending calls for efficient filtration
membranes capable of high retention of large molecular solutes and high permeance
for solvents. Herein, we report a surface-initiated polymerization strategy
through C-C coupling reactions for preparing conjugated microporous polymer (CMP)
membranes. The backbone of the membranes consists of all-rigid conjugated systems
and shows high resistance to organic solvents. We show that 42-nm-thick CMP
membranes supported on polyacrylonitrile substrates provide excellent retention
of solutes and broad-spectrum nanofiltration in both non-polar hexane and polar
methanol, the permeance for which reaches 32 and 22 l m-2 h-1 bar-1,
respectively. Both experiments and simulations suggest that the performance of
CMP membranes originates from substantially open and interconnected voids formed 
in the highly rigid networks.

The seeming contradiction that K+ channels conduct K+ ions at maximal throughput 
rates while not permeating slightly smaller Na+ ions has perplexed scientists for
decades. Although numerous models have addressed selective permeation in K+
channels, the combination of conduction efficiency and ion selectivity has not
yet been linked through a unified functional model. Here, we investigate the
mechanism of ion selectivity through atomistic simulations totalling more than
400 μs in length, which include over 7,000 permeation events. Together with
free-energy calculations, our simulations show that both rapid permeation of K+
and ion selectivity are ultimately based on a single principle: the direct
knock-on of completely desolvated ions in the channels' selectivity filter.
Herein, the strong interactions between multiple 'naked' ions in the four filter 
binding sites give rise to a natural exclusion of any competing ions. Our results
are in excellent agreement with experimental selectivity data, measured ion
interaction energies and recent two-dimensional infrared spectra of filter ion
configurations.

Gene editing is an important genetic engineering technique that enables gene
manipulation at the molecular level. It mainly relies on engineered nucleases of 
biological origin, whose precise functions cannot be replicated in any currently 
known abiotic artificial material. Here, we show that chiral cysteine-modified
CdTe nanoparticles can specifically recognize and, following photonic excitation,
cut at the restriction site GAT'ATC (' indicates the cut site) in double-stranded
DNA exceeding 90 base pairs, mimicking a restriction endonuclease. Although
photoinduced reactive oxygen species are found to be responsible for the cleavage
activity, the sequence selectivity arises from the affinity between cysteine and 
the conformation of the specific DNA sequence, as confirmed by quantum-chemical
calculations. In addition, we demonstrate non-enzymatic sequence-specific DNA
incision in living cells and in vivo using these CdTe nanoparticles, which may
help in the design of abiotic materials for gene editing and other biological
applications.

Polyacenes are organic compounds that have multiple, fused, aromatic rings. These
highly conjugated molecules often have interesting photonic and/or electronic
properties that afford them the potential for application in a host of
organoelectronic devices such as sensors, light-emitting diodes, photovoltaic
devices and field-effect transistors. Here, we show the development and use of
the domino hexadehydro-Diels-Alder reaction to synthesize structurally diverse
polyacenes from acyclic polyyne precursors. The key event in these
transformations is the successive reaction of multiple 1,3-butadiyne units with a
series of in-situ-generated, diynophilic arynes. The polyyne substrates were
designed to allow for rapid engagement of each progressively larger aryne
following the initiating (and ratelimiting) production of the first reactive
intermediate-the benzyne. We show that aryne-trapping reactions are broad in
scope and that these cascade or domino processes can be quite efficient.

The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to multi-carbon products has attracted much 
attention because it provides an avenue to the synthesis of value-added
carbon-based fuels and feedstocks using renewable electricity. Unfortunately, the
efficiency of CO2 conversion to C2 products remains below that necessary for its 
implementation at scale. Modifying the local electronic structure of copper with 
positive valence sites has been predicted to boost conversion to C2 products.
Here, we use boron to tune the ratio of Cuδ+ to Cu0 active sites and improve both
stability and C2-product generation. Simulations show that the ability to tune
the average oxidation state of copper enables control over CO adsorption and
dimerization, and makes it possible to implement a preference for the
electrosynthesis of C2 products. We report experimentally a C2 Faradaic
efficiency of 79 ± 2% on boron-doped copper catalysts and further show that boron
doping leads to catalysts that are stable for in excess of ~40 hours while
electrochemically reducing CO2 to multi-carbon hydrocarbons.

Nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) is one of the most widely applied
reaction classes in pharmaceutical and chemical research, providing a broadly
useful platform for the modification of aromatic ring scaffolds. The generally
accepted mechanism for SNAr reactions involves a two-step addition-elimination
sequence via a discrete, non-aromatic Meisenheimer complex. Here we use 12C/13C
kinetic isotope effect (KIE) studies and computational analyses to provide
evidence that prototypical SNAr reactions in fact proceed through concerted
mechanisms. The KIE measurements were made possible by a new technique that
leverages the high sensitivity of 19F as an NMR nucleus to quantitate the degree 
of isotopic fractionation. This sensitive technique permits the measurement of
KIEs on 10 mg of natural abundance material in one overnight acquisition. As a
result, it provides a practical tool for performing detailed mechanistic analyses
of reactions that form or break C-F bonds.

Metal hydrides are key intermediates in catalytic proton reduction and dihydrogen
oxidation. There is currently much interest in appending proton relays near the
metal centre to accelerate catalysis by proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET). 
However, the elementary PCET steps and the role of the proton relays are still
poorly understood, and direct kinetic studies of these processes are scarce.
Here, we report a series of tungsten hydride complexes as proxy catalysts, with
covalently attached pyridyl groups as proton acceptors. The rate of their PCET
reaction with external oxidants is increased by several orders of magnitude
compared to that of the analogous systems with external pyridine on account of
facilitated proton transfer. Moreover, the mechanism of the PCET reaction is
altered by the appended bases. A unique feature is that the reaction can be tuned
to follow three distinct PCET mechanisms-electron-first, proton-first or a
concerted reaction-with very different sensitivities to oxidant and base
strength. Such knowledge is crucial for rational improvements of solar fuel
catalysts.

In the News & Views 'Foldamers wave to the ribosome', multiple changes to the
main text were required. In paragraph 2 "whose monomer sequence is truly defined"
should have read "whose monomer sequence is both diverse and truly defined" and
"Truly sequence-defined..." should have read "Diverse and truly sequence
defined…". In the penultimate paragraph, 'appendages 5-9' should have been
"appendages 5 and 7-9"; in the sentence starting "Based on these criteria...",
QPQ should have been QQQ and vice versa; and the whole sentence starting "What is
interesting..." needed revising to "What is interesting is that an alternating
sequence with a terminal P monomer appears essential: PQPQ is unfolded and an
initiator tRNA carrying PQPQ-Gly-Phe initiates translation, whereas QPQPQ is
folded and does not." Furthermore, the structures in Fig. 1a have been replaced
to correct several errors in the chemical structures arising from missing -CH2-
groups. The table in Fig. 1b also required changes: in the last two columns of
row two, 'Fast' and 'No' should have read 'Slow and 'Yes', respectively; in the
first column of row three, 'ND' should have been a tick; and in the last two
columns of row four, 'Slow' and 'Yes' should have read 'Fast' and 'No',
respectively. Finally, a new reference 'Milon, P. et al. EMBO Rep. 11, 312-316
(2010).' has been added to the reference list at number 13 and cited in the fifth
paragraph, the references list has been renumbered accordingly.

Kinases are ubiquitous enzymes involved in the regulation of critical cellular
pathways. However, in silico modelling of the conformational ensembles of these
enzymes is difficult due to inherent limitations and the cost of computational
approaches. Recent algorithmic advances combined with homology modelling and
parallel simulations have enabled researchers to address this computational
sampling bottleneck. Here, we present the results of molecular dynamics studies
for seven Src family kinase (SFK) members: Fyn, Lyn, Lck, Hck, Fgr, Yes and Blk. 
We present a sequence invariant extension to Markov state models, which allows us
to quantitatively compare the structural ensembles of the seven kinases. Our
findings indicate that in the absence of their regulatory partners, SFK members
have similar in silico dynamics with active state populations ranging from 4 to
40% and activation timescales in the hundreds of microseconds. Furthermore, we
observe several potentially druggable intermediate states, including a pocket
next to the adenosine triphosphate binding site that could potentially be
targeted via a small-molecule inhibitor.

The chemical synthesis of organic molecules involves, at its very essence, the
creation of carbon-carbon bonds. In this context, the aldol reaction is among the
most important synthetic methods, and a wide variety of catalytic and
stereoselective versions have been reported. However, aldolizations yielding
tertiary aldols, which result from the reaction of an enolate with a ketone, are 
challenging and only a few catalytic asymmetric Mukaiyama aldol reactions with
ketones as electrophiles have been described. These methods typically require
relatively high catalyst loadings, deliver substandard enantioselectivity or need
special reagents or additives. We now report extremely potent catalysts that
readily enable the reaction of silyl ketene acetals with a diverse set of ketones
to furnish the corresponding tertiary aldol products in excellent yields and
enantioselectivities. Parts per million (ppm) levels of catalyst loadings can be 
routinely used and provide fast and quantitative product formation in high
enantiopurity. In situ spectroscopic studies and acidity measurements suggest a
silylium ion based, asymmetric counteranion-directed Lewis acid catalysis
mechanism.

Creating designer enzymes with the ability to catalyse abiological
transformations is a formidable challenge. Efforts toward this goal typically
consider only canonical amino acids in the initial design process. However,
incorporating unnatural amino acids that feature uniquely reactive side chains
could significantly expand the catalytic repertoire of designer enzymes. To
explore the potential of such artificial building blocks for enzyme design, here 
we selected p-aminophenylalanine as a potentially novel catalytic residue. We
demonstrate that the catalytic activity of the aniline side chain for hydrazone
and oxime formation reactions is increased by embedding p-aminophenylalanine into
the hydrophobic pore of the multidrug transcriptional regulator from Lactococcus 
lactis. Both the recruitment of reactants by the promiscuous binding pocket and a
judiciously placed aniline that functions as a catalytic residue contribute to
the success of the identified artificial enzyme. We anticipate that our design
strategy will prove rewarding to significantly expand the catalytic repertoire of
designer enzymes in the future.

Rearrangements that change the connectivity of a carbon skeleton are often useful
in synthesis, but it can be difficult to follow their mechanisms. Scanning probe 
microscopy can be used to manipulate a skeletal rearrangement at the
single-molecule level, while monitoring the geometry of reactants, intermediates 
and final products with atomic resolution. We studied the reductive rearrangement
of 1,1-dibromo alkenes to polyynes on a NaCl surface at 5 K, a reaction that
resembles the Fritsch-Buttenberg-Wiechell rearrangement. Voltage pulses were used
to cleave one C-Br bond, forming a radical, then to cleave the remaining C•-Br
bond, triggering the rearrangement. These experiments provide structural insight 
into the bromo-vinyl radical intermediates, showing that the C=C•-Br unit is
nonlinear. Long polyynes, up to the octayne Ph-(C≡C)8-Ph, have been prepared in
this way. The control of skeletal rearrangements opens a new window on
carbon-rich materials and extends the toolbox for molecular synthesis by atom
manipulation.

Achieving site-selectivity in arene functionalization that is complementary to
the site-selectivity from electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions has been 
a long-standing quest in organic synthesis. Palladium/norbornene cooperative
catalysis potentially offers a unique approach to this problem, but its use has
been hampered by the ortho constraint, which is the requirement of an ortho
substituent for mono ortho functionalization of haloarenes. Here, we show that
such a challenge could be addressed using a new class of bridgehead-modified
norbornenes, thereby enabling a broadly useful strategy for arene
functionalization with complementary site-selectivity. A range of
ortho-unsubstituted aryl iodides, previously problematic substrates, can now be
employed to provide mono ortho-functionalized products effectively. This method
is applicable for late-stage functionalization of complex bioactive molecules at 
positions that are difficult to reach by conventional approaches.

The combination of well-defined acid sites, shape-selective properties and
outstanding stability places zeolites among the most practically relevant
heterogeneous catalysts. The development of structure-performance descriptors for
processes that they catalyse has been a matter of intense debate, both in
industry and academia, and the direct conversion of methanol to olefins is a
prototypical system in which various catalytic functions contribute to the
overall performance. Propylene selectivity and resistance to coking are the two
most important parameters in developing new methanol-to-olefin catalysts. Here,
we present a systematic investigation on the effect of acidity on the performance
of the zeolite 'ZSM-5' for the production of propylene. Our results demonstrate
that the isolation of Brønsted acid sites is key to the selective formation of
propylene. Also, the introduction of Lewis acid sites prevents the formation of
coke, hence drastically increasing catalyst lifetime.

The increasing requirement to produce platform chemicals and fuels from renewable
sources means advances in biocatalysis are rapidly becoming a necessity. Biomass 
is widely used in nature as a source of energy and as chemical building blocks.
However, recalcitrance towards traditional chemical processes and solvents
provides a significant barrier to widespread utility. Here, by optimizing enzyme 
solubility in ionic liquids, we have discovered solvent-induced substrate
promiscuity of glucosidase, demonstrating an unprecedented example of homogeneous
enzyme bioprocessing of cellulose. Specifically, chemical modification of
glucosidase for solubilization in ionic liquids can increase thermal stability to
up to 137 °C, allowing for enzymatic activity 30 times greater than is possible
in aqueous media. These results establish that through a synergistic combination 
of chemical biology (enzyme modification) and reaction engineering (solvent
choice), the biocatalytic capability of enzymes can be intensified: a key step
towards the full-scale deployment of industrial biocatalysis.

Biaryls are ubiquitous core structures in drugs, agrochemicals and organic
materials that have profoundly improved many aspects of our society. Although
traditional cross-couplings have made practical the synthesis of many biaryls,
C-H arylation represents a more attractive and cost-effective strategy for
building these structural motifs. Furthermore, the ability to install biaryl
units in complex molecules via late-stage C-H arylation would allow access to
valuable structural diversity, novel chemical space and intellectual property in 
only one step. However, known C-H arylation protocols are not suitable for
substrates decorated with polar and delicate functionalities, which are commonly 
found in molecules that possess biological activity. Here we introduce a class of
ruthenium catalysts that display a unique efficacy towards late-stage arylation
of heavily functionalized substrates. The design and development of this class of
catalysts was enabled by a mechanistic breakthrough on the Ru(II)-catalysed C-H
arylation of N-chelating substrates with aryl (pseudo)halides, which has remained
poorly understood for nearly two decades.

The human DNA repair enzyme MUTYH excises mispaired adenine residues in oxidized 
DNA. Homozygous MUTYH mutations underlie the autosomal, recessive cancer syndrome
MUTYH-associated polyposis. We report a MUTYH variant, p.C306W (c.918C>G), with a
tryptophan residue in place of native cysteine, that ligates the [4Fe4S] cluster 
in a patient with colonic polyposis and family history of early age colon cancer.
In bacterial MutY, the [4Fe4S] cluster is redox active, allowing rapid
localization to target lesions by long-range, DNA-mediated signalling. In the
current study, using DNA electrochemistry, we determine that wild-type MUTYH is
similarly redox-active, but MUTYH C306W undergoes rapid oxidative degradation of 
its cluster to [3Fe4S]+, with loss of redox signalling. In MUTYH C306W, oxidative
cluster degradation leads to decreased DNA binding and enzyme function. This
study confirms redox activity in eukaryotic DNA repair proteins and establishes
MUTYH C306W as a pathogenic variant, highlighting the essential role of redox
signalling by the [4Fe4S] cluster.

Photochromic fluorescent proteins play key roles in super-resolution microscopy
and optogenetics. The light-driven structural changes that modulate the
fluorescence involve both trans-to-cis isomerization and proton transfer. The
mechanism, timescale and relative contribution of chromophore and protein
dynamics are currently not well understood. Here, the mechanism of
off-to-on-state switching in dronpa is studied using femtosecond-to-millisecond
time-resolved infrared spectroscopy and isotope labelling. Chromophore and
protein dynamics are shown to occur on multiple timescales, from picoseconds to
hundreds of microseconds. Following excitation of the trans chromophore, a
ground-state primary product is formed within picoseconds. Surprisingly, the
characteristic vibrational spectrum of the neutral cis isomer appears only after 
several tens of nanoseconds. Further fluctuations in protein structure around the
neutral cis chromophore are required to form a new intermediate, which promotes
the final proton-transfer reaction. These data illustrate the interplay between
chromophore dynamics and the protein environment underlying fluorescent protein
photochromism.

Strategies that provide enzymes with the ability to catalyse non-natural
reactions are of considerable synthetic value. Photoredox catalysis has proved
adept at expanding the synthetic repertoire of existing catalytic platforms, yet,
in the realm of biocatalysis it has primarily been used for cofactor
regeneration. Here we show that photoredox catalysts can be used to enable new
catalytic function in nicotinamide-dependent enzymes. Under visible-light
irradiation, xanthene-based photocatalysts enable a double-bond reductase to
catalyse an enantioselective deacetoxylation. Mechanistic experiments support the
intermediacy of an α-acyl radical, formed after the elimination of acetate.
Isotopic labelling experiments support nicotinamide as the source of the hydrogen
atom. Preliminary calculations and mechanistic experiments suggest that binding
to the protein attenuates the reduction potential of the starting material, an
important feature for localizing radical formation to the enzyme active site. The
generality of this approach is highlighted with the radical dehalogenation of
α-bromoamides catalysed by ketoreductases with Eosin Y as a photocatalyst.

The development of a Pd(II)-catalysed enantioselective fluorination of C(sp3)-H
bonds would offer a new approach to making chiral organofluorines. However, such 
a strategy is particularly challenging because of the difficulty in
differentiating prochiral C(sp3)-H bonds through Pd(II)-insertion, as well as the
sluggish reductive elimination involving Pd-F bonds. Here, we report the
development of a Pd(II)-catalysed enantioselective C(sp3)-H fluorination using a 
chiral transient directing group strategy. In this work, a bulky, amino amide
transient directing group was developed to control the stereochemistry of the C-H
insertion step and selectively promote the C(sp3)-F reductive elimination pathway
from the Pd(IV)-F intermediate. Stereochemical analysis revealed that while the
desired C(sp3)-F formation proceeds via an inner-sphere pathway with retention of
configuration, the undesired C(sp3)-O formation occurs through an SN2-type
mechanism. Elucidation of the dual mechanism allows us to rationalize the
profound ligand effect on controlling reductive elimination selectivity from
high-valent Pd species.

Biological and bio-inspired mineralization processes yield a variety of
three-dimensional structures with relevance for fields such as photonics,
electronics and photovoltaics. However, these processes are only compatible with 
specific material compositions, often carbonate salts, thereby hampering
widespread applications. Here we present a strategy to convert a wide range of
metal carbonate structures into lead halide perovskite semiconductors with
tunable bandgaps, while preserving the 3D shape. First, we introduce lead ions by
cation exchange. Second, we use carbonate as a leaving group, facilitating anion 
exchange with halide, which is followed rapidly by methylammonium insertion to
form the perovskite. As proof of principle, pre-programmed carbonate salt shapes 
such as vases, coral-like forms and helices are transformed into perovskites
while preserving the morphology and crystallinity of the initial
micro-architectures. This approach also readily converts calcium carbonate
biominerals into semiconductors, furnishing biological and programmable synthetic
shapes with the performance of artificial compositions such as perovskite-based
semiconductors.

Genetically encoding distinct non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins
synthesized in cells requires mutually orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase
(aaRS)/tRNA pairs. The pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase/PyltRNA pair from
Methanosarcina mazei (Mm) has been engineered to incorporate diverse ncAAs and is
commonly considered an ideal pair for genetic code expansion. However, finding
new aaRS/tRNA pairs that share the advantages of the MmPylRS/MmPyltRNA pair and
are orthogonal to both endogenous aaRS/tRNA pairs and the MmPylRS/MmPyltRNA pair 
has proved challenging. Here we demonstrate that several ΔNPylRS/PyltRNACUA
pairs, in which PylRS lacks an N-terminal domain, are active, orthogonal and
efficiently incorporate ncAAs in Escherichia coli. We create new PylRS/PyltRNA
pairs that are mutually orthogonal to the MmPylRS/MmPyltRNA pair and show that
transplanting mutations that reprogram the ncAA specificity of MmPylRS into the
new PylRS reprograms its substrate specificity. Finally, we show that distinct
PylRS/PyltRNA-derived pairs can function in the same cell, decode distinct codons
and incorporate distinct ncAAs.

The idea that excitonic (electronic) coherences are of fundamental importance to 
natural photosynthesis gained popularity when slowly dephasing quantum beats
(QBs) were observed in the two-dimensional electronic spectra of the
Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex at 77 K. These were assigned to superpositions
of excitonic states, a controversial interpretation, as the strong
chromophore-environment interactions in the complex suggest fast dephasing.
Although it has been pointed out that vibrational motion produces similar
spectral signatures, a concrete assignment of these oscillatory signals to
distinct physical processes is still lacking. Here we revisit the coherence
dynamics of the FMO complex using polarization-controlled two-dimensional
electronic spectroscopy, supported by theoretical modelling. We show that the
long-lived QBs are exclusively vibrational in origin, whereas the dephasing of
the electronic coherences is completed within 240 fs even at 77 K. We further
find that specific vibrational coherences are produced via vibronically coupled
excited states. The presence of such states suggests that vibronic coupling is
relevant for photosynthetic energy transfer.

For solution-phase chemical reactions, the solvent is often considered simply as 
a medium to allow the reactants to encounter each other by diffusion. Although
examples of direct solvent effects on molecular solutes exist, such as the
compression of solute bonding electrons due to Pauli repulsion interactions, the 
solvent is not usually considered a part of the chemical species of interest. We 
show, using quantum simulations of Na2, that when there are local specific
interactions between a solute and solvent that are energetically on the same
order as a hydrogen bond, the solvent controls not only the bond dynamics but
also the chemical identity of the solute. In tetrahydrofuran, dative bonding
interactions between the solvent and Na atoms lead to unique coordination states 
that must cross a free energy barrier of ~8 kBT-undergoing a chemical reaction-to
interconvert. Each coordination state has its own dynamics and spectroscopic
signatures, highlighting the importance of considering the solvent in the
identity of condensed-phase chemical systems.

Isomerism is a fundamental chemical concept, reflecting the fact that the
arrangement of atoms in a molecular entity has a profound influence on its
chemical and physical properties. Here we describe a previously unclassified
fundamental form of conformational isomerism through four resolved stereoisomers 
of a transoid (BF)O(BF)-quinoxalinoporphyrin. These comprise two pairs of
enantiomers that manifest structural relationships not describable within
existing IUPAC nomenclature and terminology. They undergo thermal diastereomeric 
interconversion over a barrier of 104 ± 2 kJ mol-1, which we term
'akamptisomerization'. Feasible interconversion processes between conceivable
synthesis products and reaction intermediates were mapped out by density
functional theory calculations, identifying bond-angle inversion (BAI) at a
singly bonded atom as the reaction mechanism. We also introduce the necessary BAI
stereodescriptors parvo and amplo. Based on an extended polytope formalism of
molecular structure and stereoisomerization, BAI-driven akamptisomerization is
shown to be the final fundamental type of conformational isomerization.

Rhinoviruses (RVs) are the pathogens most often responsible for the common cold, 
and are a frequent cause of exacerbations in asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis. Here we report the discovery of IMP-1088, 
a picomolar dual inhibitor of the human N-myristoyltransferases NMT1 and NMT2,
and use it to demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of host-cell
N-myristoylation rapidly and completely prevents rhinoviral replication without
inducing cytotoxicity. The identification of cooperative binding between
weak-binding fragments led to rapid inhibitor optimization through fragment
reconstruction, structure-guided fragment linking and conformational control over
linker geometry. We show that inhibition of the co-translational myristoylation
of a specific virus-encoded protein (VP0) by IMP-1088 potently blocks a key step 
in viral capsid assembly, to deliver a low nanomolar antiviral activity against
multiple RV strains, poliovirus and foot and-mouth disease virus, and protection 
of cells against virus-induced killing, highlighting the potential of host
myristoylation as a drug target in picornaviral infections.

Controlled activation is a critical component in prodrug development. Here we
report a concentration-sensitive platform approach for bioorthogonal prodrug
activation by taking advantage of reaction kinetics. Using two 'click and
release' systems, we demonstrate enrichment and prodrug activation specifically
in mitochondria to demonstrate the principle of the approach. In both cases, the 
payload (doxorubicin or carbon monoxide) was released inside the mitochondrial
matrix following the enrichment-initiated click reaction. Furthermore,
mitochondria-targeted delivery yielded substantial augmentation of functional
biological and therapeutic effects in vitro and in vivo when compared to
controls, which did not result in enrichment. This method is thus a platform for 
targeted drug delivery that is amenable to conjugation with a variety of
molecules and is not limited to cell-surface delivery. Taken together, these two 
'click and release' pairs clearly demonstrate the concept of enrichment-triggered
drug release and the critical feasibility of treating clinically relevant
diseases such as acute liver injury and cancer.

Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with the aberrant 
aggregation of the amyloid-β peptide. Although increasing evidence implicates
cholesterol in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, the detailed mechanistic 
link between this lipid molecule and the disease process remains to be fully
established. To address this problem, we adopt a kinetics-based strategy that
reveals a specific catalytic role of cholesterol in the aggregation of Aβ42 (the 
42-residue form of the amyloid-β peptide). More specifically, we demonstrate that
lipid membranes containing cholesterol promote Aβ42 aggregation by enhancing its 
primary nucleation rate by up to 20-fold through a heterogeneous nucleation
pathway. We further show that this process occurs as a result of cooperativity in
the interaction of multiple cholesterol molecules with Aβ42. These results
identify a specific microscopic pathway by which cholesterol dramatically
enhances the onset of Aβ42 aggregation, thereby helping rationalize the link
between Alzheimer's disease and the impairment of cholesterol homeostasis.

Multi-electron redox reactions, although central to artificial photosynthesis,
are kinetically sluggish. Amidst the search for synthetic catalysts for such
processes, plasmonic nanoparticles have been found to catalyse multi-electron
reduction of CO2 under visible light. This example motivates the need for a
general, insight-driven framework for plasmonic catalysis of such multi-electron 
chemistry. Here, we elucidate the principles underlying the extraction of
multiple redox equivalents from a plasmonic photocatalyst. We measure the
kinetics of electron harvesting from a gold nanoparticle photocatalyst as a
function of photon flux. Our measurements, supported by theoretical modelling,
reveal a regime where two-electron transfer from the excited gold nanoparticle
becomes prevalent. Multiple electron harvesting becomes possible under
continuous-wave, visible-light excitation of moderate intensity due to strong
interband transitions in gold and electron-hole separation accomplished using a
hole scavenger. These insights will help expand the utility of plasmonic
photocatalysis beyond CO2 reduction to other challenging multi-electron,
multi-proton transformations such as N2 fixation.

NaCl in a 1:1 stoichiometry is the only known stable form of the Na-Cl crystal
under ambient conditions, and non-1:1 Na-Cl species can only form under extreme
conditions, such as high pressures. Here we report the direct observation, under 
ambient conditions, of Na2Cl and Na3Cl as two-dimensional (2D) Na-Cl crystals,
together with regular NaCl, on reduced graphene oxide membranes and on the
surfaces of natural graphite powders from salt solutions far below the saturated 
concentration. Molecular dynamics and density functional theory calculations
suggest that this unconventional crystallization process originates from the
cation-π interaction between the ions and the π-conjugated system in the
graphitic surface, which promotes the ion-surface adsorption. The strong Na+-π
interaction and charge transfer lead to stoichiometries with an excess of Na+.
With unique electron and spin distributions and bonding, the resulting 2D
crystals may have unusual electronic, magnetic, optical and mechanical
properties.

Reactions that directly install nitrogen into C-H bonds of complex molecules are 
significant because of their potential to change the chemical and biological
properties of a given compound. Although selective intramolecular C-H amination
reactions are known, achieving high levels of reactivity while maintaining
excellent site selectivity and functional-group tolerance remains a challenge for
intermolecular C-H amination. Here, we report a manganese perchlorophthalocyanine
catalyst [MnIII(ClPc)] for intermolecular benzylic C-H amination of bioactive
molecules and natural products that proceeds with unprecedented levels of
reactivity and site selectivity. In the presence of a Brønsted or Lewis acid, the
[MnIII(ClPc)]-catalysed C-H amination demonstrates unique tolerance for tertiary 
amine, pyridine and benzimidazole functionalities. Mechanistic studies suggest
that C-H amination likely proceeds through an electrophilic metallonitrene
intermediate via a stepwise pathway where C-H cleavage is the rate-determining
step of the reaction. Collectively, these mechanistic features contrast with
previous base-metal-catalysed C-H aminations and provide new opportunities for
tunable selectivities.

De novo design and construction of stimuli-responsive protein assemblies that
predictably switch between discrete conformational states remains an essential
but highly challenging goal in biomolecular design. We previously reported
synthetic, two-dimensional protein lattices self-assembled via disulfide bonding 
interactions, which endows them with a unique capacity to undergo coherent
conformational changes without losing crystalline order. Here, we carried out
all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to map the free-energy landscape of these
lattices, validated this landscape through extensive structural characterization 
by electron microscopy and established that it is predominantly governed by
solvent reorganization entropy. Subsequent redesign of the protein surface with
conditionally repulsive electrostatic interactions enabled us to predictably
perturb the free-energy landscape and obtain a new protein lattice whose
conformational dynamics can be chemically and mechanically toggled between three 
different states with varying porosities and molecular densities.

Successful screening campaigns depend on large and structurally diverse
collections of compounds. In macrocycle screening, variation of the molecular
scaffold is important for structural diversity, but so far it has been
challenging to diversify this aspect in large combinatorial libraries. Here, we
report the cyclization of peptides with two chemical bridges to provide rapid
access to thousands of different macrocyclic scaffolds in libraries that are easy
to synthesize, screen and decode. Application of this strategy to phage-encoded
libraries allowed for the screening of an unprecedented structural diversity of
macrocycles against plasma kallikrein, which is important in the swelling
disorder hereditary angioedema. These libraries yielded inhibitors with
remarkable binding properties (subnanomolar Ki, >1,000-fold selectivity) despite 
the small molecular mass (~1,200 Da). An interlaced bridge format characteristic 
of this strategy provided high proteolytic stability (t1/2 in plasma of >3 days),
making double-bridged peptides potentially amenable to topical or oral delivery.

Nature has engineered exquisitely responsive systems where molecular-scale
information is transferred across an interface and propagated over long length
scales. Such systems rely on multiple interacting, signalling and adaptable
molecular and supramolecular networks that are built on dynamic, non-equilibrium 
structures. Comparable synthetic systems are still in their infancy. Here, we
demonstrate that the light-induced actuation of a molecularly thin interfacial
layer, assembled from a hydrophilic- azobenzene -hydrophobic diblock copolymer,
can result in a reversible, long-lived perturbation of a robust glassy membrane
across a range of over 500 chemical bonds. We show that the out-of-equilibrium
actuation is caused by the photochemical trans-cis isomerization of the azo
group, a single chemical functionality, in the middle of the interfacial layer.
The principles proposed here are implemented in water-dispersed nanocapsules, and
have implications for on-demand release of embedded cargo molecules.

Glycosylated natural products and synthetic glycopeptides represent a significant
and growing source of biochemical probes and therapeutic agents. However, methods
that enable the aqueous glycosylation of endogenous amino acid functionality in
peptides without the use of protecting groups are scarce. Here, we report a
transformation that facilitates the efficient aqueous O-glycosylation of phenolic
functionality in a wide range of small molecules, unprotected tyrosine, and
tyrosine residues embedded within a range of complex, fully unprotected peptides.
The transformation, which uses glycosyl fluoride donors and is promoted by
Ca(OH)2, proceeds rapidly at room temperature in water, with good yields and
selective formation of unique anomeric products depending on the stereochemistry 
of the glycosyl donor. High functional group tolerance is observed, and the
phenol glycosylation occurs selectively in the presence of virtually all side
chains of the proteinogenic amino acids with the singular exception of Cys. This 
method offers a highly selective, efficient, and operationally simple approach
for the protecting-group-free synthesis of O-aryl glycosides and
Tyr-O-glycosylated peptides in water.

Despite its early promise as a diagnostic and prognostic tool, gene expression
profiling remains cost-prohibitive and challenging to implement in a clinical
setting. Here, we introduce a molecular computation strategy for analysing the
information contained in complex gene expression signatures without the need for 
costly instrumentation. Our workflow begins by training a computational
classifier on labelled gene expression data. This in silico classifier is then
realized at the molecular level to enable expression analysis and classification 
of previously uncharacterized samples. Classification occurs through a series of 
molecular interactions between RNA inputs and engineered DNA probes designed to
differentially weigh each input according to its importance. We validate our
technology with two applications: a classifier for early cancer diagnostics and a
classifier for differentiating viral and bacterial respiratory infections based
on host gene expression. Together, our results demonstrate a general and modular 
framework for low-cost gene expression analysis.

Aqueous compatible supramolecular materials hold promise for applications in
environmental remediation, energy harvesting and biomedicine. One remaining
challenge is to actively select a target structure from a multitude of possible
options, in response to chemical signals, while maintaining constant,
physiological conditions. Here, we demonstrate the use of amino acids to actively
decorate a self-assembling core molecule in situ, thereby controlling its
amphiphilicity and consequent mode of assembly. The core molecule is the organic 
semiconductor naphthalene diimide, functionalized with D- and L- tyrosine methyl 
esters as competing reactive sites. In the presence of α-chymotrypsin and a
selected encoding amino acid, kinetic competition between ester hydrolysis and
amidation results in covalent or non-covalent amino acid incorporation, and
variable supramolecular self-assembly pathways. Taking advantage of the
semiconducting nature of the naphthalene diimide core, electronic wires could be 
formed and subsequently degraded, giving rise to temporally regulated
electro-conductivity.

Mechanically interlocked molecules such as rotaxanes and catenanes comprise two
or more components whose motion relative to each other can be controlled. A
[2]rotaxane molecular shuttle, for example, consists of an axle bearing two
recognition sites and a single macrocyclic wheel that can undergo a to-and-fro
motion along the axle-shuttling between the recognition sites. The ability of
mechanically interlocked molecules to undergo this type of large-amplitude change
is the core mechanism behind almost every interlocked molecular switch or
machine, including sophisticated mechanical systems such as a molecular elevator 
and a peptide synthesizer. Here, as a way to expand the scope of dynamics
possible at the molecular level, we have developed a molecular shuttling
mechanism involving the exchange of rings between two recognition sites in a
saturated [3]rotaxane (one with no empty recognition sites). This was
accomplished by passing a smaller ring through a larger one, thus achieving
ring-through-ring molecular shuttling.

Calcium-ion batteries (CIBs) are attractive candidates for energy storage because
Ca2+ has low polarization and a reduction potential (-2.87 V versus standard
hydrogen electrode, SHE) close to that of Li+ (-3.04 V versus SHE), promising a
wide voltage window for a full battery. However, their development is limited by 
difficulties such as the lack of proper cathode/anode materials for reversible
Ca2+ intercalation/de-intercalation, low working voltages (<2 V), low cycling
stability, and especially poor room-temperature performance. Here, we report a
CIB that can work stably at room temperature in a new cell configuration using
graphite as the cathode and tin foils as the anode as well as the current
collector. This CIB operates on a highly reversible electrochemical reaction that
combines hexafluorophosphate intercalation/de-intercalation at the cathode and a 
Ca-involved alloying/de-alloying reaction at the anode. An optimized CIB exhibits
a working voltage of up to 4.45 V with capacity retention of 95% after 350
cycles.

Accurate measurements of product state-resolved angular distributions are central
to fundamental studies of chemical reaction dynamics. Yet, fine
quantum-mechanical structures in product angular distributions of a reactive
scattering process, such as the fast oscillations in the forward-scattering
direction, have never been observed experimentally and the nature of these
oscillations has not been fully explored. Here we report the
crossed-molecular-beam experimental observation of these fast forward-scattering 
oscillations in the product angular distribution of the benchmark chemical
reaction, H + HD → H2 + D. Clear oscillatory structures are observed for the
H2(v' = 0, j' = 1, 3) product states at a collision energy of 1.35 eV, in
excellent agreement with the quantum-mechanical dynamics calculations. Our
analysis reveals that the oscillatory forward-scattering components are mainly
contributed by the total angular momentum J around 28. The partial waves and
impact parameters responsible for the forward scatterings are also determined
from these observed oscillations, providing crucial dynamics information on the
transient reaction process.

Human genome function is underpinned by the primary storage of genetic
information in canonical B-form DNA, with a second layer of DNA structure
providing regulatory control. I-motif structures are thought to form in
cytosine-rich regions of the genome and to have regulatory functions; however, in
vivo evidence for the existence of such structures has so far remained elusive.
Here we report the generation and characterization of an antibody fragment (iMab)
that recognizes i-motif structures with high selectivity and affinity, enabling
the detection of i-motifs in the nuclei of human cells. We demonstrate that the
in vivo formation of such structures is cell-cycle and pH dependent. Furthermore,
we provide evidence that i-motif structures are formed in regulatory regions of
the human genome, including promoters and telomeric regions. Our results support 
the notion that i-motif structures provide key regulatory roles in the genome.

Molecular interactions are best probed by scattering experiments. Interpretation 
of these studies has been limited by lack of control over the quantum states of
the incoming collision partners. We report here the rotationally inelastic
collisions of quantum-state prepared deuterium hydride (HD) with H2 and D2 using 
a method that provides an improved control over the input states. HD was
coexpanded with its partner in a single supersonic beam, which reduced the
collision temperature to 0-5 K, and thereby restricted the involved incoming
partial waves to s and p. By preparing HD with its bond axis preferentially
aligned parallel and perpendicular to the relative velocity of the colliding
partners, we observed that the rotational relaxation of HD depends strongly on
the initial bond-axis orientation. We developed a partial-wave analysis that
conclusively demonstrates that the scattering mechanism involves the exchange of 
internal angular momentum between the colliding partners. The striking
differences between H2/HD and D2/HD scattering suggest the presence of
anisotropically sensitive resonances.

The M-cluster is the [(homocitrate)MoFe7S9C] active site of nitrogenase that is
derived from an 8Fe core assembled viacoupling and rearrangement of two [Fe4S4]
clusters concomitant with the insertion of an interstitial carbon and a 'ninth
sulfur'. Combining synthetic [Fe4S4] clusters with an assembly protein template, 
here we show that sulfite can give rise to the ninth sulfur that is incorporated 
in the catalytically important belt region of the cofactor after the radical
S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent carbide insertion and the concurrent 8Fe-core
rearrangement have already taken place. Based on the differential reactivity of
the formed cluster species, we also propose a new [Fe8S8C] cluster intermediate, 
the L*-cluster, which is similar to the [Fe8S9C] L-cluster, but lacks the ninth
sulfur from sulfite. This work provides a semi-synthetic tool for protein
reconstitution that could be widely applicable for the functional analysis of
other FeS systems.

Inelastic collisions that occur between open-shell atoms and other atoms or
molecules, and that promote a spin-orbit transition, involve multiple interaction
potentials. They are non-adiabatic by nature and cannot be described within the
Born-Oppenheimer approximation; in particular, their theoretical modelling
becomes very challenging when the collision energies have values comparable to
the spin-orbit splitting. Here we study inelastic collisions between carbon in
its ground state C(3Pj=0) and helium atoms-at collision energies in the vicinity 
of spin-orbit excitation thresholds (~0.2 and 0.5 kJ mol-1)-that result in
spin-orbit excitation to C(3Pj=1) and C(3Pj=2). State-to-state integral
cross-sections are obtained from crossed-beam experiments with a beam source that
provides an almost pure beam of C(3Pj=0) . We observe very good agreement between
experimental and theoretical results (acquired using newly calculated potential
energy curves), which validates our characterization of the quantum dynamical
resonances that are observed. Rate coefficients at very low temperatures suitable
for chemical modelling of the interstellar medium are also calculated.

We the authors are retracting this Article because of our failure to reproduce
the molecular weight dispersities (PDI) shown in Fig. 4 using the chain-transfer 
agent described in the paper (CTA1). While the degenerate chain-transfer
mechanism described in Fig. 3 is correct, the best molecular weight dispersities 
that could be reproduced with the chain-transfer agent shown in the Article are
much larger (PDI > 2.0) than reported.We have since studied the kinetics of CTA1 
in comparison with several other chain-transfer agents we are currently
investigating and we now understand that the reactivity of CTA1 towards
propagating ruthenium alkylidene complexes is very low. Very long monomer
addition times would therefore have been necessary to gain control over the
molecular weight distribution. Such long addition times would exceed the lifetime
of the Grubbs catalyst in solution. Faster addition of the monomer has since
repeatedly been shown to broaden the molecular weight dispersity.Additionally,
the best chain-transfer agents we are currently investigating are orders of
magnitude more reactive than CTA1 but give broader molecular weight dispersities 
than reported in Fig. 4. Molecular weight and dispersity control as shown in Fig.
4 is therefore an inappropriate claim for CTA1.The authors deeply regret these
errors and apologize to the community.

Collision-induced absorption is the phenomenon in which interactions between
colliding molecules lead to absorption of light, even for transitions that are
forbidden for the isolated molecules. Collision-induced absorption contributes to
the atmospheric heat balance and is important for the electronic excitations of
O2 that are used for remote sensing. Here, we present a theoretical study of five
vibronic transitions in O2-O2 and O2-N2, using analytical models and numerical
quantum scattering calculations. We unambiguously identify the underlying
absorption mechanism, which is shown to depend explicitly on the collision
partner-contrary to textbook knowledge. This explains experimentally observed
qualitative differences between O2-O2 and O2-N2 collisions in the overall
intensity, line shape and vibrational dependence of the absorption spectrum. It
is shown that these results can be used to discriminate between conflicting
experimental data and even to identify unphysical results, thus impacting future 
experimental studies and atmospheric applications.

Biosynthesis of the [FeFe] hydrogenase active site (the 'H-cluster') requires the
interplay of multiple proteins and small molecules. Among them, the radical
S-adenosylmethionine enzyme HydG, a tyrosine lyase, has been proposed to generate
a complex that contains an Fe(CO)2(CN) moiety that is eventually incorporated
into the H-cluster. Here we describe the characterization of an intermediate in
the HydG reaction: a [4Fe-4S][(Cys)Fe(CO)(CN)] species, 'Complex A', in which a
CO, a CN- and a cysteine (Cys) molecule bind to the unique 'dangler' Fe site of
the auxiliary [5Fe-4S] cluster of HydG. The identification of this
intermediate-the first organometallic precursor to the H-cluster-validates the
previously hypothesized HydG reaction cycle and provides a basis for elucidating 
the biosynthetic origin of other moieties of the H-cluster.

New methods capable of effecting cyclization, and forming novel three-dimensional
structures while maintaining favourable physicochemical properties are needed to 
facilitate the development of cyclic peptide-based drugs that can engage
challenging biological targets, such as protein-protein interactions. Here, we
report a highly efficient and generally applicable strategy for constructing new 
types of peptide macrocycles using palladium-catalysed intramolecular C(sp3)-H
arylation reactions. Easily accessible linear peptide precursors of simple and
versatile design can be selectively cyclized at the side chains of either
aromatic or modified non-aromatic amino acid units to form various
cyclophane-braced peptide cycles. This strategy provides a powerful tool to
address the long-standing challenge of size- and composition-dependence in
peptide macrocyclization, and generates novel peptide macrocycles with uniquely
buttressed backbones and distinct loop-type three-dimensional structures.
Preliminary cell proliferation screening of the pilot library revealed a potent
lead compound with selective cytotoxicity toward proliferative Myc-dependent
cancer cell lines.

Numerous essential biomolecular processes require the recognition of DNA surface 
features by proteins. Molecules mimicking these features could potentially act as
decoys and interfere with pharmacologically or therapeutically relevant
protein-DNA interactions. Although naturally occurring DNA-mimicking proteins
have been described, synthetic tunable molecules that mimic the charge surface of
double-stranded DNA are not known. Here, we report the design, synthesis and
structural characterization of aromatic oligoamides that fold into single helical
conformations and display a double helical array of negatively charged residues
in positions that match the phosphate moieties in B-DNA. These molecules were
able to inhibit several enzymes possessing non-sequence-selective DNA-binding
properties, including topoisomerase 1 and HIV-1 integrase, presumably through
specific foldamer-protein interactions, whereas sequence-selective enzymes were
not inhibited. Such modular and synthetically accessible DNA mimics provide a
versatile platform to design novel inhibitors of protein-DNA interactions.

Cell-to-cell variation in gene expression creates a need for techniques that can 
characterize expression at the level of individual cells. This is particularly
true for rare circulating tumour cells, in which subtyping and drug resistance
are of intense interest. Here we describe a method for cell analysis-single-cell 
mRNA cytometry-that enables the isolation of rare cells from whole blood as a
function of target mRNA sequences. This approach uses two classes of magnetic
particles that are labelled to selectively hybridize with different regions of
the target mRNA. Hybridization leads to the formation of large magnetic clusters 
that remain localized within the cells of interest, thereby enabling the cells to
be magnetically separated. Targeting specific intracellular mRNAs
enablescirculating tumour cells to be distinguished from normal haematopoietic
cells. No polymerase chain reaction amplification is required to determine RNA
expression levels and genotype at the single-cell level, and minimal cell
manipulation is required. To demonstrate this approach we use single-cell mRNA
cytometry to detect clinically important sequences in prostate cancer specimens.

DNA-encoded libraries have emerged as a widely used resource for the discovery of
bioactive small molecules, and offer substantial advantages compared with
conventional small-molecule libraries. Here, we have developed and streamlined
multiple fundamental aspects of DNA-encoded and DNA-templated library synthesis
methodology, including computational identification and experimental validation
of a 20 × 20 × 20 × 80 set of orthogonal codons, chemical and computational tools
for enhancing the structural diversity and drug-likeness of library members, a
highly efficient polymerase-mediated template library assembly strategy, and
library isolation and purification methods. We have integrated these improved
methods to produce a second-generation DNA-templated library of 256,000
small-molecule macrocycles with improved drug-like physical properties. In vitro 
selection of this library for insulin-degrading enzyme affinity resulted in novel
insulin-degrading enzyme inhibitors, including one of unusual potency and novel
macrocycle stereochemistry (IC50 = 40 nM). Collectively, these developments
enable DNA-templated small-molecule libraries to serve as more powerful,
accessible, streamlined and cost-effective tools for bioactive small-molecule
discovery.

Phase control plays an important role in the precise synthesis of inorganic
materials, as the phase structure has a profound influence on properties such as 
conductivity and chemical stability. Phase-controlled preparation has been
challenging for the metallic-phase group-VI transition metal dichalcogenides (the
transition metals are Mo and W, and the chalcogens are S, Se and Te), which show 
better performance in electrocatalysis than their semiconducting counterparts.
Here, we report the large-scale preparation of micrometre-sized metallic-phase
1T'-MoX2 (X = S, Se)-layered bulk crystals in high purity. We reveal that
1T'-MoS2 crystals feature a distorted octahedral coordination structure and are
convertible to 2H-MoS2 following thermal annealing or laser irradiation.
Electrochemical measurements show that the basal plane of 1T'-MoS2 is much more
active than that of 2H-MoS2 for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction 
in an acidic medium.

Magnesium-based batteries possess potential advantages over their lithium
counterparts. However, reversible Mg chemistry requires a thermodynamically
stable electrolyte at low potential, which is usually achieved with corrosive
components and at the expense of stability against oxidation. In lithium-ion
batteries the conflict between the cathodic and anodic stabilities of the
electrolytes is resolved by forming an anode interphase that shields the
electrolyte from being reduced. This strategy cannot be applied to Mg batteries
because divalent Mg2+ cannot penetrate such interphases. Here, we engineer an
artificial Mg2+-conductive interphase on the Mg anode surface, which successfully
decouples the anodic and cathodic requirements for electrolytes and demonstrate
highly reversible Mg chemistry in oxidation-resistant electrolytes. The
artificial interphase enables the reversible cycling of a Mg/V2O5 full-cell in
the water-containing, carbonate-based electrolyte. This approach provides a new
avenue not only for Mg but also for other multivalent-cation batteries facing the
same problems, taking a step towards their use in energy-storage applications.

Mapping free-energy landscapes has proved to be a powerful tool for studying
reaction mechanisms. Many complex biomolecular assembly processes, however, have 
remained challenging to access using this approach, including the aggregation of 
peptides and proteins into amyloid fibrils implicated in a range of disorders.
Here, we generalize the strategy used to probe free-energy landscapes in protein 
folding to determine the activation energies and entropies that characterize each
of the molecular steps in the aggregation of the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ42), which 
is associated with Alzheimer's disease. Our results reveal that interactions
between monomeric Aβ42 and amyloid fibrils during fibril-dependent secondary
nucleation fundamentally reverse the thermodynamic signature of this process
relative to primary nucleation, even though both processes generate aggregates
from soluble peptides. By mapping the energetic and entropic contributions along 
the reaction trajectories, we show that the catalytic efficiency of Aβ42 fibril
surfaces results from the enthalpic stabilization of adsorbing peptides in
conformations amenable to nucleation, resulting in a dramatic lowering of the
activation energy for nucleation.

Enzymes often show catalytic allostery in which reactions occurring at different 
sites communicate cooperatively over distances of up to a few nanometres. Whether
such effects can occur with non-biological nanocatalysts remains unclear, even
though these nanocatalysts can undergo restructuring and molecules can diffuse
over catalyst surfaces. Here we report that phenomenologically similar, but
mechanistically distinct, cooperative effects indeed exist for nanocatalysts.
Using spatiotemporally resolved single-molecule catalysis imaging, we find that
catalytic reactions on a single Pd or Au nanocatalyst can communicate with each
other, probably via hopping of positively charged holes on the catalyst surface, 
over ~102 nanometres and with a temporal memory of ~101 to 102 seconds, giving
rise to positive cooperativity among its surface active sites. Similar
communication is also observed between individual nanocatalysts, however it
operates via a molecular diffusion mechanism involving negatively charged product
molecules, and its communication distance is many micrometres. Generalization of 
these long-range intra- and interparticle catalytic communication mechanisms may 
introduce a novel conceptual framework for understanding nanoscale catalysis.

Phytochemicals are of great pharmaceutical and agricultural importance, but often
exhibit low abundance in nature. Recent demonstrations of industrial-scale
production of phytochemicals in yeast have shown that microbial production of
these high-value chemicals is a promising alternative to sourcing these molecules
from native plant hosts. However, a number of challenges remain in the broader
application of this approach, including the limited knowledge of plant secondary 
metabolism and the inefficient reconstitution of plant metabolic pathways in
microbial hosts. In this Review, we discuss recent strategies to achieve
microbial biosynthesis of complex phytochemicals, including strategies to: (1)
reconstruct plant biosynthetic pathways that have not been fully elucidated by
mining enzymes from native and non-native hosts or by enzyme engineering; (2)
enhance plant enzyme activity, specifically cytochrome P450 activity, by
improving efficiency, selectivity, expression or electron transfer; and (3)
enhance overall reaction efficiency of multi-enzyme pathways by dynamic control, 
compartmentalization or optimization with the host's metabolism. We also
highlight remaining challenges to - and future opportunities of - this approach.

Despite decades of ground-breaking research in academia, organic synthesis is
still a rate-limiting factor in drug-discovery projects. Here we present some
current challenges in synthetic organic chemistry from the perspective of the
pharmaceutical industry and highlight problematic steps that, if overcome, would 
find extensive application in the discovery of transformational medicines.
Significant synthesis challenges arise from the fact that drug molecules
typically contain amines and N-heterocycles, as well as unprotected polar groups.
There is also a need for new reactions that enable non-traditional
disconnections, more C-H bond activation and late-stage functionalization, as
well as stereoselectively substituted aliphatic heterocyclic ring synthesis, C-X 
or C-C bond formation. We also emphasize that syntheses compatible with
biomacromolecules will find increasing use, while new technologies such as
machine-assisted approaches and artificial intelligence for synthesis planning
have the potential to dramatically accelerate the drug-discovery process. We
believe that increasing collaboration between academic and industrial chemists is
crucial to address the challenges outlined here.

The importance of halogen bonds-highly directional interactions between an
electron-deficient σ-hole moiety in a halogenated compound and an acceptor such
as a Lewis base-is being increasingly recognized in a wide variety of fields from
biomedicinal chemistry to materials science. The heaviest halogens are known to
form stronger halogen bonds, implying that if this trend continues down the
periodic table, astatine should exhibit the highest halogen-bond donating
ability. This may be mitigated, however, by the relativistic effects undergone by
heavy elements, as illustrated by the metallic character of astatine. Here, the
occurrence of halogen-bonding interactions involving astatine is experimentally
evidenced. The complexation constants of astatine monoiodide with a series of
organic ligands in cyclohexane solution were derived from distribution
coefficient measurements and supported by relativistic quantum mechanical
calculations. Taken together, the results show that astatine indeed behaves as a 
halogen-bond donor-a stronger one than iodine-owing to its much more
electrophilic σ-hole.

Translation, the mRNA-templated synthesis of peptides by the ribosome, can be
manipulated to incorporate variants of the 20 cognate amino acids. Such
approaches for expanding the range of chemical entities that can be produced by
the ribosome may accelerate the discovery of molecules that can perform functions
for which poorly folded, short peptidic sequences are ill suited. Here, we show
that the ribosome tolerates some artificial helical aromatic oligomers, so-called
foldamers. Using a flexible tRNA-acylation ribozyme-flexizyme-foldamers were
attached to tRNA, and the resulting acylated tRNAs were delivered to the ribosome
to initiate the synthesis of non-cyclic and cyclic foldamer-peptide hybrid
molecules. Passing through the ribosome exit tunnel requires the foldamers to
unfold. Yet foldamers encode sufficient folding information to influence the
peptide structure once translation is completed. We also show that in cyclic
hybrids, the foldamer portion can fold into a helix and force the peptide segment
to adopt a constrained and stretched conformation.

Vibronic coupling is key to efficient energy flow in molecular systems and a
critical component of most mechanisms invoking quantum effects in biological
processes. Despite increasing evidence for coherent coupling of electronic states
being mediated by vibrational motion, it is not clear how and to what degree
properties associated with vibrational coherence such as phase and coupling of
atomic motion can impact the efficiency of light-induced processes under natural,
incoherent illumination. Here, we show that deuteration of the H11-C11=C12-H12
double-bond of the 11-cis retinal chromophore in the visual pigment rhodopsin
significantly and unexpectedly alters the photoisomerization yield while inducing
smaller changes in the ultrafast isomerization dynamics assignable to known
isotope effects. Combination of these results with non-adiabatic molecular
dynamics simulations reveals a vibrational phase-dependent isotope effect that we
suggest is an intrinsic attribute of vibronically coherent photochemical
processes.

In nature, specific antibodies can be generated as a result of an adaptive
selection and expansion of lymphocytes with suitable protein binding properties. 
We attempted to mimic antibody-antigen recognition by displaying multiple
chemical diversity elements on a defined macrocyclic scaffold. Encoding of the
displayed combinations was achieved using distinctive DNA tags, resulting in a
library size of 35,393,112. Specific binders could be isolated against a variety 
of proteins, including carbonic anhydrase IX, horseradish peroxidase, tankyrase
1, human serum albumin, alpha-1 acid glycoprotein, calmodulin, prostate-specific 
antigen and tumour necrosis factor. Similar to antibodies, the encoded display of
multiple chemical elements on a constant scaffold enabled practical applications,
such as fluorescence microscopy procedures or the selective in vivo delivery of
payloads to tumours. Furthermore, the versatile structure of the scaffold
facilitated the generation of protein-specific chemical probes, as illustrated by
photo-crosslinking.

Post-translational modification of proteins is a strategy widely used in
biological systems. It expands the diversity of the proteome and allows for
tailoring of both the function and localization of proteins within cells as well 
as the material properties of structural proteins and matrices. Despite their
ubiquity in biology, with a few exceptions, the potential of post-translational
modifications in biomaterials synthesis has remained largely untapped. As a proof
of concept to demonstrate the feasibility of creating a genetically encoded
biohybrid material through post-translational modification, we report here the
generation of a family of three stimulus-responsive hybrid
materials-fatty-acid-modified elastin-like polypeptides-using a one-pot
recombinant expression and post-translational lipidation methodology. These
hybrid biomaterials contain an amphiphilic domain, composed of a β-sheet-forming 
peptide that is post-translationally functionalized with a C14 alkyl chain, fused
to a thermally responsive elastin-like polypeptide. They exhibit
temperature-triggered hierarchical self-assembly across multiple length scales
with varied structure and material properties that can be controlled at the
sequence level.

Crystal-phase engineering offers opportunities for the rational design and
synthesis of noble metal nanomaterials with unusual crystal phases that normally 
do not exist in bulk materials. However, it remains a challenge to use these
materials as seeds to construct heterometallic nanostructures with desired
crystal phases and morphologies for promising applications such as catalysis.
Here, we report a strategy for the synthesis of binary and ternary hybrid noble
metal nanostructures. Our synthesized crystal-phase heterostructured 4H/fcc Au
nanowires enable the epitaxial growth of Ru nanorods on the 4H phase and fcc-twin
boundary in Au nanowires, resulting in hybrid Au-Ru nanowires. Moreover, the
method can be extended to the epitaxial growth of Rh, Ru-Rh and Ru-Pt nanorods on
the 4H/fcc Au nanowires to form unique hybrid nanowires. Importantly, the Au-Ru
hybrid nanowires with tunable compositions exhibit excellent electrocatalytic
performance towards the hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline media.

Proton transfer via hydronium and hydroxide ions in water is ubiquitous. It
underlies acid-base chemistry, certain enzyme reactions, and even infection by
the flu. Despite two centuries of investigation, the mechanism underlying why
hydroxide diffuses slower than hydronium in water is still not well understood.
Herein, we employ state-of-the-art density-functional-theory-based molecular
dynamics-with corrections for non-local van der Waals interactions, and
self-interaction in the electronic ground state-to model water and hydrated water
ions. At this level of theory, we show that structural diffusion of hydronium
preserves the previously recognized concerted behaviour. However, by contrast,
proton transfer via hydroxide is less temporally correlated, due to a stabilized 
hypercoordination solvation structure that discourages proton transfer.
Specifically, the latter exhibits non-planar geometry, which agrees with
neutron-scattering results. Asymmetry in the temporal correlation of proton
transfer leads to hydroxide diffusing slower than hydronium.

Inspired by the remarkable ability of natural protein switches to sense and
respond to a wide range of environmental queues, here we report a strategy to
engineer synthetic protein switches by using DNA strand displacement to
dynamically organize proteins with highly diverse and complex logic gate
architectures. We show that DNA strand displacement can be used to dynamically
control the spatial proximity and the corresponding fluorescence resonance energy
transfer between two fluorescent proteins. Performing Boolean logic operations
enabled the explicit control of protein proximity using multi-input, reversible
and amplification architectures. We further demonstrate the power of this
technology beyond sensing by achieving dynamic control of an enzyme cascade.
Finally, we establish the utility of the approach as a synthetic computing
platform that drives the dynamic reconstitution of a split enzyme for targeted
prodrug activation based on the sensing of cancer-specific miRNAs.

The evolution of sequence-defined synthetic polymers made of building blocks
beyond those compatible with polymerase enzymes or the ribosome has the potential
to generate new classes of receptors, catalysts and materials. Here we describe a
ligase-mediated DNA-templated polymerization and in vitro selection system to
evolve highly functionalized nucleic acid polymers (HFNAPs) made from 32 building
blocks that contain eight chemically diverse side chains on a DNA backbone.
Through iterated cycles of polymer translation, selection and reverse
translation, we discovered HFNAPs that bind proprotein convertase
subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and interleukin-6, two protein targets implicated
in human diseases. Mutation and reselection of an active PCSK9-binding polymer
yielded evolved polymers with high affinity (KD = 3 nM). This evolved polymer
potently inhibited the binding between PCSK9 and the low-density lipoprotein
receptor. Structure-activity relationship studies revealed that specific side
chains at defined positions in the polymers are required for binding to their
respective targets. Our findings expand the chemical space of evolvable polymers 
to include densely functionalized nucleic acids with diverse, researcher-defined 
chemical repertoires.

Control over the nucleation of new phases is highly desirable but elusive. Even
though there is a long history of crystallization engineering by varying
physicochemical parameters, controlling which polymorph crystallizes or whether a
molecule crystallizes or forms an amorphous precipitate is still a poorly
understood practice. Although there are now numerous examples of control using
laser-induced nucleation, the absence of physical understanding is preventing
progress. Here we show that the proximity of a liquid-liquid critical point or
the corresponding binodal line can be used by a laser-tweezing potential to
induce concentration gradients. A simple theoretical model shows that the stored 
electromagnetic energy of the laser beam produces a free-energy potential that
forces phase separation or triggers the nucleation of a new phase. Experiments in
a liquid mixture using a low-power laser diode confirm the effect. Phase
separation and nucleation using a laser-tweezing potential explains the physics
behind non-photochemical laser-induced nucleation and suggests new ways of
manipulating matter.

The evolution of atmospheric organic carbon as it undergoes oxidation has a
controlling influence on concentrations of key atmospheric species, including
particulate matter, ozone and oxidants. However, full characterization of organic
carbon over hours to days of atmospheric processing has been stymied by its
extreme chemical complexity. Here we study the multigenerational oxidation of
α-pinene in the laboratory, characterizing products with several state-of-the-art
analytical techniques. Although quantification of some early generation products 
remains elusive, full carbon closure is achieved (within measurement uncertainty)
by the end of the experiments. These results provide new insights into the
effects of oxidation on organic carbon properties (volatility, oxidation state
and reactivity) and the atmospheric lifecycle of organic carbon. Following an
initial period characterized by functionalization reactions and particle growth, 
fragmentation reactions dominate, forming smaller species. After approximately
one day of atmospheric aging, most carbon is sequestered in two long-lived
reservoirs-volatile oxidized gases and low-volatility particulate matter.

The most common mechanism of catalytic surface chemistry is that of Langmuir and 
Hinshelwood (LH). In the LH mechanism, reactants adsorb, become thermalized with 
the surface, and subsequently react. The measured vibrational (relaxation)
lifetimes of molecules adsorbed at metal surfaces are in the range of a few
picoseconds. As a consequence, vibrational promotion of LH chemistry is rarely
observed, with the exception of LH reactions occurring via a molecular
physisorbed intermediate. Here, we directly detect adsorption and subsequent
desorption of vibrationally excited CO molecules from a Au(111) surface. Our
results show that CO (v = 1) survives on a Au(111) surface for ~1 × 10-10 s. Such
long vibrational lifetimes for adsorbates on metal surfaces are unexpected and
pose an interesting challenge to the current understanding of vibrational energy 
dissipation on metal surfaces. They also suggest that vibrational promotion of
surface chemistry might be more common than is generally believed.

In recent years, the synthesis of amines and other nitrogen-containing motifs has
been a major area of research in organic chemistry because they are widely
represented in biologically active molecules. Current strategies rely on a
multistep approach and require one reactant to be activated prior to the
carbon-nitrogen bond formation. This leads to a reaction inefficiency and
functional group intolerance. As such, a general approach to the synthesis of
nitrogen-containing compounds from readily available and benign starting
materials is highly desirable. Here we present a palladium-catalysed oxidative
amination reaction in which the addition of the nitrogen occurs at the
less-substituted carbon of a double bond, in what is known as anti-Markovnikov
selectivity. Alkenes are shown to react with imides in the presence of a
palladate catalyst to generate the terminal imide through trans-aminopalladation.
Subsequently, olefin isomerization occurs to afford the thermodynamically
favoured products. Both the scope of the transformation and mechanistic
investigations are reported.

The search for improved energy-storage materials has revealed Li- and Na-rich
intercalation compounds as promising high-capacity cathodes. They exhibit
capacities in excess of what would be expected from alkali-ion
removal/reinsertion and charge compensation by transition-metal (TM) ions. The
additional capacity is provided through charge compensation by oxygen redox
chemistry and some oxygen loss. It has been reported previously that oxygen redox
occurs in O 2p orbitals that interact with alkali ions in the TM and alkali-ion
layers (that is, oxygen redox occurs in compounds containing Li+-O(2p)-Li+
interactions). Na2/3[Mg0.28Mn0.72]O2 exhibits an excess capacity and here we show
that this is caused by oxygen redox, even though Mg2+ resides in the TM layers
rather than alkali-metal (AM) ions, which demonstrates that excess AM ions are
not required to activate oxygen redox. We also show that, unlike the alkali-rich 
compounds, Na2/3[Mg0.28Mn0.72]O2 does not lose oxygen. The extraction of alkali
ions from the alkali and TM layers in the alkali-rich compounds results in
severely underbonded oxygen, which promotes oxygen loss, whereas Mg2+ remains in 
Na2/3[Mg0.28Mn0.72]O2, which stabilizes oxygen.

Translocation of lipid II across the cytoplasmic membrane is essential in
peptidoglycan biogenesis. Although most steps are understood, identifying the
lipid II flippase has yielded conflicting results, and the lipid II binding
properties of two candidate flippases-MurJ and FtsW-remain largely unknown. Here 
we apply native mass spectrometry to both proteins and characterize lipid II
binding. We observed lower levels of lipid II binding to FtsW compared to MurJ,
consistent with MurJ having a higher affinity. Site-directed mutagenesis of MurJ 
suggests that mutations at A29 and D269 attenuate lipid II binding to MurJ,
whereas chemical modification of A29 eliminates binding. The antibiotic
ramoplanin dissociates lipid II from MurJ, whereas vancomycin binds to form a
stable complex with MurJ:lipid II. Furthermore, we reveal cardiolipins associate 
with MurJ but not FtsW, and exogenous cardiolipins reduce lipid II binding to
MurJ. These observations provide insights into determinants of lipid II binding
to MurJ and suggest roles for endogenous lipids in regulating substrate binding.

The reactivity of uranium compounds towards small molecules typically occurs
through stoichiometric rather than catalytic processes. Examples of uranium
catalysts reacting with water are particularly scarce, because stable uranyl
groups form that preclude the recovery of the uranium compound. Recently,
however, an arene-anchored, electron-rich uranium complex has been shown to
facilitate the electrocatalytic formation of H2 from H2O. Here, we present the
precise role of uranium-arene δ bonding in intermediates of the catalytic cycle, 
as well as details of the atypical two-electron oxidative addition of H2O to the 
trivalent uranium catalyst. Both aspects were explored by synthesizing mid- and
high-valent uranium-oxo intermediates and by performing comparative studies with 
a structurally related complex that cannot engage in δ bonding. The redox
activity of the arene anchor and a covalent δ-bonding interaction with the
uranium ion during H2 formation were supported by density functional theory
analysis. Detailed insight into this catalytic system may inspire the design of
ligands for new uranium catalysts.

Singlet fission is a process whereby two triplet excitons can be produced from
one photon, potentially increasing the efficiency of photovoltaic devices.
Endothermic singlet fission is desired for a maximum energy-conversion
efficiency, and such systems have been considered to form an excimer-like state
with multiexcitonic character prior to the appearance of triplets. However, the
role of the excimer as an intermediate has, until now, been unclear. Here we
show, using 5,12-bis((triisopropylsilyl)ethynyl)tetracene in solution as a
prototypical example, that, rather than acting as an intermediate, the excimer
serves to trap excited states to the detriment of singlet-fission yield. We
clearly demonstrate that singlet fission and its conjugate process,
triplet-triplet annihilation, occur at a longer intermolecular distance than an
excimer intermediate would impute. These results establish that an endothermic
singlet-fission material must be designed to avoid excimer formation, thus
allowing singlet fission to reach its full potential in enhancing photovoltaic
energy conversion.

The primary electron-attachment process in electron-driven chemistry represents
one of the most fundamental chemical transformations with wide-ranging importance
in science and technology. However, the mechanistic detail of the seemingly
simple reaction of an electron and a neutral molecule to form an anion remains
poorly understood, particularly at very low electron energies. Here,
time-resolved photoelectron imaging was used to probe the electron-attachment
process to a non-polar molecule using time-resolved methods. An initially
populated diffuse non-valence state of the anion that is bound by correlation
forces evolves coherently in ∼30 fs into a valence state of the anion. The
extreme efficiency with which the correlation-bound state serves as a doorway
state for low-energy electron attachment explains a number of electron-driven
processes, such as anion formation in the interstellar medium and electron
attachment to fullerenes.

The successful transport of drug- and cell-based therapeutics to diseased sites
represents a major barrier in the development of clinical therapies. Targeted
delivery can be mediated through degradable biomaterial vehicles that utilize
disease biomarkers to trigger payload release. Here, we report a modular chemical
framework for imparting hydrogels with precise degradative responsiveness by
using multiple environmental cues to trigger reactions that operate
user-programmable Boolean logic. By specifying the molecular architecture and
connectivity of orthogonal stimuli-labile moieties within material cross-linkers,
we show selective control over gel dissolution and therapeutic delivery. To
illustrate the versatility of this methodology, we synthesized 17 distinct
stimuli-responsive materials that collectively yielded all possible YES/OR/AND
logic outputs from input combinations involving enzyme, reductant and light.
Using these hydrogels we demonstrate the first sequential and environmentally
stimulated release of multiple cell lines in well-defined combinations from a
material. We expect these platforms will find utility in several diverse fields
including drug delivery, diagnostics and regenerative medicine.

Biosynthetic modification of nonribosomal peptide backbones represents a
potentially powerful strategy to modulate the structure and properties of an
important class of therapeutics. Using a high-throughput assay for catalytic
activity, we show here that an L-Phe-specific module of an archetypal
nonribosomal peptide synthetase can be reprogrammed to accept and process the
backbone-modified amino acid (S)-β-Phe with near-native specificity and
efficiency. A co-crystal structure with a non-hydrolysable aminoacyl-AMP analogue
reveals the origins of the 40,000-fold α/β-specificity switch, illuminating
subtle but precise remodelling of the active site. When the engineered catalyst
was paired with downstream module(s), (S)-β-Phe-containing peptides were produced
at preparative scale in vitro (~1 mmol) and high titres in vivo (~100 mg l-1),
highlighting the potential of biosynthetic pathway engineering for the
construction of novel nonribosomal β-frameworks.

Interfacial supramolecular self-assembly represents a powerful tool for
constructing regular and quasicrystalline materials. In particular, complex
two-dimensional molecular tessellations, such as semi-regular Archimedean tilings
with regular polygons, promise unique properties related to their nontrivial
structures. However, their formation is challenging, because current methods are 
largely limited to the direct assembly of precursors, that is, where structure
formation relies on molecular interactions without using chemical
transformations. Here, we have chosen ethynyl-iodophenanthrene (which features
dissymmetry in both geometry and reactivity) as a single starting precursor to
generate the rare semi-regular (3.4.6.4) Archimedean tiling with long-range order
on an atomically flat substrate through a multi-step reaction. Intriguingly, the 
individual chemical transformations converge to form a symmetric
alkynyl-Ag-alkynyl complex as the new tecton in high yields. Using a combination 
of microscopy and X-ray spectroscopy tools, as well as computational modelling,
we show that in situ generated catalytic Ag complexes mediate the tecton
conversion.

The entatic state denotes a distorted coordination geometry of a complex from its
typical arrangement that generates an improvement to its function. The
entatic-state principle has been observed to apply to copper electron-transfer
proteins and it results in a lowering of the reorganization energy of the
electron-transfer process. It is thus crucial for a multitude of biochemical
processes, but its importance to photoactive complexes is unexplored. Here we
study a copper complex-with a specifically designed constraining ligand
geometry-that exhibits metal-to-ligand charge-transfer state lifetimes that are
very short. The guanidine-quinoline ligand used here acts on the bis(chelated)
copper(I) centre, allowing only small structural changes after photoexcitation
that result in very fast structural dynamics. The data were collected using a
multimethod approach that featured time-resolved ultraviolet-visible, infrared
and X-ray absorption and optical emission spectroscopy. Through supporting
density functional calculations, we deliver a detailed picture of the structural 
dynamics in the picosecond-to-nanosecond time range.

Catalytic anticancer metallodrugs active at low doses could minimize
side-effects, introduce novel mechanisms of action that combat resistance and
widen the spectrum of anticancer-drug activity. Here we use highly stable chiral 
half-sandwich organometallic Os(II) arene sulfonyl diamine complexes,
[Os(arene)(TsDPEN)] (TsDPEN, N-(p-toluenesulfonyl)-1,2-diphenylethylenediamine), 
to achieve a highly enantioselective reduction of pyruvate, a key intermediate in
metabolic pathways. Reduction is shown both in aqueous model systems and in human
cancer cells, with non-toxic concentrations of sodium formate used as a hydride
source. The catalytic mechanism generates selectivity towards ovarian cancer
cells versus non-cancerous fibroblasts (both ovarian and lung), which are
commonly used as models of healthy proliferating cells. The formate precursor
N-formylmethionine was explored as an alternative to formate in PC3 prostate
cancer cells, which are known to overexpress a deformylase enzyme.
Transfer-hydrogenation catalysts that generate reductive stress in cancer cells
offer a new approach to cancer therapy.

Random mutagenesis has the potential to optimize the efficiency and selectivity
of protein catalysts without requiring detailed knowledge of protein structure;
however, introducing synthetic metal cofactors complicates the expression and
screening of enzyme libraries, and activity arising from free cofactor must be
eliminated. Here we report an efficient platform to create and screen libraries
of artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) via random mutagenesis, which we use to
evolve highly selective dirhodium cyclopropanases. Error-prone PCR and
combinatorial codon mutagenesis enabled multiplexed analysis of random mutations,
including at sites distal to the putative ArM active site that are difficult to
identify using targeted mutagenesis approaches. Variants that exhibited
significantly improved selectivity for each of the cyclopropane product
enantiomers were identified, and higher activity than previously reported ArM
cyclopropanases obtained via targeted mutagenesis was also observed. This
improved selectivity carried over to other dirhodium-catalysed transformations,
including N-H, S-H and Si-H insertion, demonstrating that ArMs evolved for one
reaction can serve as starting points to evolve catalysts for others.

Enzymatic catalysis is essential to cell survival. In many instances, enzymes
that participate in reaction cascades have been shown to assemble into metabolons
in response to the presence of the substrate for the first enzyme. However, what 
triggers metabolon formation has remained an open question. Through a combination
of theory and experiments, we show that enzymes in a cascade can assemble via
chemotaxis. We apply microfluidic and fluorescent spectroscopy techniques to
study the coordinated movement of the first four enzymes of the glycolysis
cascade: hexokinase, phosphoglucose isomerase, phosphofructokinase and aldolase. 
We show that each enzyme independently follows its own specific substrate
gradient, which in turn is produced by the preceding enzymatic reaction.
Furthermore, we find that the chemotactic assembly of enzymes occurs even under
cytosolic crowding conditions.

The recent availability of shale gas has led to a renewed interest in C-H bond
activation as the first step towards the synthesis of fuels and fine chemicals.
Heterogeneous catalysts based on Ni and Pt can perform this chemistry, but
deactivate easily due to coke formation. Cu-based catalysts are not practical due
to high C-H activation barriers, but their weaker binding to adsorbates offers
resilience to coking. Using Pt/Cu single-atom alloys (SAAs), we examine C-H
activation in a number of systems including methyl groups, methane and butane
using a combination of simulations, surface science and catalysis studies. We
find that Pt/Cu SAAs activate C-H bonds more efficiently than Cu, are stable for 
days under realistic operating conditions, and avoid the problem of coking
typically encountered with Pt. Pt/Cu SAAs therefore offer a new approach to
coke-resistant C-H activation chemistry, with the added economic benefit that the
precious metal is diluted at the atomic limit.

Supported metal catalysts, which are composed of metal nanoparticles dispersed on
metal oxides or other high-surface-area materials, are ubiquitous in industrially
catalysed reactions. Identifying and characterizing the catalytic active sites on
these materials still remains a substantial challenge, even though it is required
to guide rational design of practical heterogeneous catalysts. Metal-support
interactions have an enormous impact on the chemistry of the catalytic active
site and can determine the optimum support for a reaction; however, few direct
probes of these interactions are available. Here we show how benzyl alcohol
oxidation Hammett studies can be used to characterize differences in the
catalytic activity of Au nanoparticles hosted on various metal-oxide supports. We
combine reactivity analysis with density functional theory calculations to
demonstrate that the slope of experimental Hammett plots is affected by electron 
donation from the underlying oxide support to the Au particles.

Peptides derived from non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) represent an
important class of pharmaceutically relevant drugs. Methods to generate novel
non-ribosomal peptides or to modify peptide natural products in an easy and
predictable way are therefore of great interest. However, although the overall
modular structure of NRPSs suggests the possibility of adjusting domain
specificity and selectivity, only a few examples have been reported and these
usually show a severe drop in production titre. Here we report a new strategy for
the modification of NRPSs that uses defined exchange units (XUs) and not modules 
as functional units. XUs are fused at specific positions that connect the
condensation and adenylation domains and respect the original specificity of the 
downstream module to enable the production of the desired peptides. We also
present the use of internal condensation domains as an alternative to other
peptide-chain-releasing domains for the production of cyclic peptides.

Although collisions between atoms and molecules are largely understood,
collisions between two molecules have proven much harder to study. In both
experiment and theory, our ability to determine quantum-state-resolved
bimolecular cross-sections lags behind their atom-molecule counterparts by
decades. For many bimolecular systems, even rules of thumb-much less intuitive
understanding-of scattering cross sections are lacking. Here, we report the
measurement of state-to-state differential cross sections on the collision of
state-selected and velocity-controlled nitric oxide (NO) radicals and oxygen (O2)
molecules. Using velocity map imaging of the scattered NO radicals, the full
product-pair correlations of rotational excitation that occurs in both collision 
partners from individual encounters are revealed. The correlated cross sections
show surprisingly good agreement with quantum scattering calculations using ab
initio NO-O2 potential energy surfaces. The observations show that the well-known
energy-gap law that governs atom-molecule collisions does not generally apply to 
bimolecular excitation processes, and reveal a propensity rule for the vector
correlation of product angular momenta.

Over the last 25 years, the formalism known as coupled-cluster (CC) theory has
emerged as the method of choice for the ab initio calculation of intermolecular
interaction potentials. The implementation known as CCSD(T) is often referred to 
as the gold standard in quantum chemistry. It gives excellent agreement with
experimental observations for a variety of energy-transfer processes in molecular
collisions, and it is used to calibrate density functional theory. Here, we
present measurements of low-energy collisions between NO radicals and H2
molecules with a resolution that challenges the most sophisticated quantum
chemistry calculations at the CCSD(T) level. Using hitherto-unexplored
anti-seeding techniques to reduce the collision energy in a crossed-beam
inelastic-scattering experiment, a resonance structure near 14 cm-1 is clearly
resolved in the state-to-state integral cross-section, and a unique resonance
fingerprint is observed in the corresponding differential cross-section. This
resonance structure discriminates between two NO-H2 potentials calculated at the 
CCSD(T) level and pushes the required accuracy beyond the gold standard.

Aggregated tau protein is associated with over 20 neurological disorders, which
include Alzheimer's disease. Previous work has shown that tau's sequence segments
VQIINK and VQIVYK drive its aggregation, but inhibitors based on the structure of
the VQIVYK segment only partially inhibit full-length tau aggregation and are
ineffective at inhibiting seeding by full-length fibrils. Here we show that the
VQIINK segment is the more powerful driver of tau aggregation. Two structures of 
this segment determined by the cryo-electron microscopy method micro-electron
diffraction explain its dominant influence on tau aggregation. Of practical
significance, the structures lead to the design of inhibitors that not only
inhibit tau aggregation but also inhibit the ability of exogenous full-length tau
fibrils to seed intracellular tau in HEK293 biosensor cells into amyloid. We also
raise the possibility that the two VQIINK structures represent amyloid polymorphs
of tau that may account for a subset of prion-like strains of tau.

The development of metal-catalysed methods to functionalize inert C-H bonds has
become a dominant research theme in the past decade as an approach to efficient
synthesis. However, the incorporation of carbon monoxide into such reactions to
form valuable ketones has to date proved a challenge, despite its potential as a 
straightforward and green alternative to Friedel-Crafts reactions. Here we
describe a new approach to palladium-catalysed C-H bond functionalization in
which carbon monoxide is used to drive the generation of high-energy
electrophiles. This offers a method to couple the useful features of
metal-catalysed C-H functionalization (stable and available reagents) and
electrophilic acylations (broad scope and selectivity), and synthesize ketones
simply from aryl iodides, CO and arenes. Notably, the reaction proceeds in an
intermolecular fashion, without directing groups and at very low
palladium-catalyst loadings. Mechanistic studies show that the reaction proceeds 
through the catalytic build-up of potent aroyl triflate electrophiles.

As colloidal self-assembly increasingly approaches the complexity of natural
systems, an ongoing challenge is to generate non-centrosymmetric structures. For 
example, patchy, Janus or living crystallization particles have significantly
advanced the area of polymer assembly. It has remained difficult, however, to
devise polymer particles that associate in a directional manner, with controlled 
valency and recognition motifs. Here, we present a method to transfer DNA
patterns from a DNA cage to a polymeric nanoparticle encapsulated inside the cage
in three dimensions. The resulting DNA-imprinted particles (DIPs), which are
'moulded' on the inside of the DNA cage, consist of a monodisperse crosslinked
polymer core with a predetermined pattern of different DNA strands covalently
'printed' on their exterior, and further assemble with programmability and
directionality. The number, orientation and sequence of DNA strands grafted onto 
the polymeric core can be controlled during the process, and the strands are
addressable independently of each other.

Labelling and determination of the energy in reactive intermediates in solution

Any long-lived chemical structure in solution is subject to statistical energy
equilibration, so the history of any specific structure does not affect its
subsequent reactions. This is not true for very short-lived intermediates because
energy equilibration takes time. Here, this idea is applied to achieve the
'energy labelling' of a reactive intermediate. The selectivity of the
ring-opening α-cleavage reaction of the 1-methylcyclobutoxy radical is found here
to vary broadly depending on how the radical was formed. Reactions that provide
little excess energy to the intermediate lead to a high selectivity in the
subsequent cleavage (measured as a kinetic isotope effect), whereas reactions
that provide more excess energy to the intermediate exhibit a lower selectivity. 
Accounting for the expected excess energy allows the prediction of the observed
product ratios and, in turn, the product ratios can be used to determine the

The development of sustainable oxidation chemistry demands strategies to harness 
O2 as a terminal oxidant. Oxidase catalysis, in which O2 serves as a chemical
oxidant without necessitating incorporation of oxygen into reaction products,
would allow diverse substrate functionalization chemistry to be coupled to O2
reduction. Direct O2 utilization suffers from intrinsic challenges imposed by the
triplet ground state of O2 and the disparate electron inventories of
four-electron O2 reduction and two-electron substrate oxidation. Here, we
generate hypervalent iodine reagents-a broadly useful class of selective
two-electron oxidants-from O2. This is achieved by intercepting reactive
intermediates of aldehyde autoxidation to aerobically generate hypervalent iodine
reagents for a broad array of substrate oxidation reactions. The use of aryl
iodides as mediators of aerobic oxidation underpins an oxidase catalysis platform
that couples substrate oxidation directly to O2 reduction. We anticipate that
aerobically generated hypervalent iodine reagents will expand the scope of
aerobic oxidation chemistry in chemical synthesis.

The efficiency with which renewable fuels and feedstocks are synthesized from
electrical sources is limited at present by the sluggish oxygen evolution
reaction (OER) in pH-neutral media. We took the view that generating
transition-metal sites with high valence at low applied bias should improve the
activity of neutral OER catalysts. Here, using density functional theory, we find
that the formation energy of desired Ni4+ sites is systematically modulated by
incorporating judicious combinations of Co, Fe and non-metal P. We therefore
synthesized NiCoFeP oxyhydroxides and probed their oxidation kinetics with in
situ soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS). In situ sXAS studies of
neutral-pH OER catalysts indicate ready promotion of Ni4+ under low overpotential
conditions. The NiCoFeP catalyst outperforms IrO2 and retains its performance
following 100 h of operation. We showcase NiCoFeP in a membrane-free CO2
electroreduction system that achieves a 1.99 V cell voltage at 10 mA cm-2,
reducing CO2 into CO and oxidizing H2O to O2 with a 64%
electricity-to-chemical-fuel efficiency.

Femtosecond pulsed excitation of light-harvesting complexes creates oscillatory
features in their response. This phenomenon has inspired a large body of work
aimed at uncovering the origin of the coherent beatings and possible implications
for function. Here we exploit site-directed mutagenesis to change the excitonic
level structure in Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complexes and compare the
coherences using broadband pump-probe spectroscopy. Our experiments detect two
oscillation frequencies with dephasing on a picosecond timescale-both at 77 K and
at room temperature. By studying these coherences with selective excitation
pump-probe experiments, where pump excitation is in resonance only with the
lowest excitonic state, we show that the key contributions to these oscillations 
stem from ground-state vibrational wavepackets. These experiments explicitly show
that the coherences-although in the ground electronic state-can be probed at the 
absorption resonances of other bacteriochlorophyll molecules because of
delocalization of the electronic excitation over several chromophores.

A striking feature of living systems is their ability to produce motility by
amplification of collective molecular motion from the nanoscale up to macroscopic
dimensions. Some of nature's protein motors, such as myosin in muscle tissue,
consist of a hierarchical supramolecular assembly of very large proteins, in
which mechanical stress induces a coordinated movement. However, artificial
molecular muscles have often relied on covalent polymer-based actuators. Here, we
describe the macroscopic contractile muscle-like motion of a supramolecular
system (comprising 95% water) formed by the hierarchical self-assembly of a
photoresponsive amphiphilic molecular motor. The molecular motor first assembles 
into nanofibres, which further assemble into aligned bundles that make up
centimetre-long strings. Irradiation induces rotary motion of the molecular
motors, and propagation and accumulation of this motion lead to contraction of
the fibres towards the light source. This system supports large-amplitude motion,
fast response, precise control over shape, as well as weight-lifting experiments 
in water and air.

The advent of antibody-drug conjugates as pharmaceuticals has fuelled a need for 
reliable methods of site-selective protein modification that furnish homogeneous 
adducts. Although bioorthogonal methods that use engineered amino acids often
provide an elegant solution to the question of selective functionalization,
achieving homogeneity using native amino acids remains a challenge. Here, we
explore visible-light-mediated single-electron transfer as a mechanism towards
enabling site- and chemoselective bioconjugation. Specifically, we demonstrate
the use of photoredox catalysis as a platform to selectivity wherein the
discrepancy in oxidation potentials between internal versus C-terminal
carboxylates can be exploited towards obtaining C-terminal functionalization
exclusively. This oxidation potential-gated technology is amenable to endogenous 
peptides and has been successfully demonstrated on the protein insulin. As a
fundamentally new approach to bioconjugation this methodology provides a
blueprint toward the development of photoredox catalysis as a generic platform to
target other redox-active side chains for native conjugation.

DNA performs diverse functional roles in biology, nanotechnology and
biotechnology, but current methods for autonomously synthesizing arbitrary
single-stranded DNA are limited. Here, we introduce the concept of primer
exchange reaction (PER) cascades, which grow nascent single-stranded DNA with
user-specified sequences following prescribed reaction pathways. PER synthesis
happens in a programmable, autonomous, in situ and environmentally responsive
fashion, providing a platform for engineering molecular circuits and devices with
a wide range of sensing, monitoring, recording, signal-processing and actuation
capabilities. We experimentally demonstrate a nanodevice that transduces the
detection of a trigger RNA into the production of a DNAzyme that degrades an
independent RNA substrate, a signal amplifier that conditionally synthesizes long
fluorescent strands only in the presence of a particular RNA signal, molecular
computing circuits that evaluate logic (AND, OR, NOT) combinations of RNA inputs,
and a temporal molecular event recorder that records in the PER transcript the
order in which distinct RNA inputs are sequentially detected.

Infrared (IR) excitation of vibrations that participate in the reaction
coordinate of an otherwise thermally driven chemical reaction are believed to
lead to its acceleration. Attempts at the practical realization of this concept
have been hampered so far by competing processes leading to sample heating. Here 
we demonstrate, using femtosecond IR-pump IR-probe experiments, the acceleration 
of urethane and polyurethane formation due to vibrational excitation of the
reactants for 1:1 mixtures of phenylisocyanate and cyclohexanol, and
toluene-2,4-diisocyanate and 2,2,2-trichloroethane-1,1-diol, respectively. We
measured reaction rate changes upon selective vibrational excitation with
negligible heating of the sample and observed an increase of the reaction rate up
to 24%. The observation is rationalized using reactant and transition-state
structures obtained from quantum chemical calculations. We subsequently used
IR-driven reaction acceleration to write a polyurethane square on sample windows 
using a femtosecond IR pulse.

Dynemicin A is a member of a subfamily of enediyne antitumour antibiotics
characterized by a 10-membered carbocycle fused to an anthraquinone, both of
polyketide origin. Sequencing of the dynemicin biosynthetic gene cluster in
Micromonospora chersina previously identified an enediyne polyketide synthase
(PKS), but no anthraquinone PKS, suggesting gene(s) for biosynthesis of the
latter were distant from the core dynemicin cluster. To identify these gene(s),
we sequenced and analysed the genome of M. chersina. Sequencing produced a short 
list of putative PKS candidates, yet CRISPR-Cas9 mutants of each locus retained
dynemicin production. Subsequently, deletion of two cytochromes P450 in the
dynemicin cluster suggested that the dynemicin enediyne PKS, DynE8, may
biosynthesize the anthraquinone. Together with 18O-labelling studies, we now
present evidence that DynE8 produces the core scaffolds of both the enediyne and 
anthraquinone, and provide a working model to account for their formation from
the programmed octaketide of the enediyne PKS.

The biocatalytic transformations used by chemists are often restricted to simple 
functional-group interconversions. In contrast, nature has developed
complexity-generating biocatalytic reactions within natural product pathways.
These sophisticated catalysts are rarely employed by chemists, because the
substrate scope, selectivity and robustness of these catalysts are unknown. Our
strategy to bridge the gap between the biosynthesis and synthetic chemistry
communities leverages the diversity of catalysts available within natural product
pathways. Here we show that, starting from a suite of biosynthetic enzymes,
catalysts with complementary substrate scope as well as selectivity can be
identified. This strategy has been applied to the oxidative dearomatization of
phenols, a chemical transformation that rapidly builds molecular complexity from 
simple starting materials and cannot be accomplished with high selectivity using 
existing catalytic methods. Using enzymes from biosynthetic pathways, we have
successfully developed a method to produce ortho-quinol products with controlled 
site- and stereoselectivity. Furthermore, we have capitalized on the scalability 
and robustness of this method in gram-scale reactions as well as multi-enzyme and
chemoenzymatic cascades.

The generation and transfer of triplet excitons across semiconductor
nanomaterial-molecular interfaces will play an important role in emerging
photonic and optoelectronic technologies, and understanding the rules that govern
such phenomena is essential. The ability to cooperatively merge the photophysical
properties of semiconductor quantum dots with those of well-understood and
inexpensive molecular chromophores is therefore paramount. Here we show that
1-pyrenecarboxylic acid-functionalized CdSe quantum dots undergo thermally
activated delayed photoluminescence. This phenomenon results from a near
quantitative triplet-triplet energy transfer from the nanocrystals to
1-pyrenecarboxylic acid, producing a molecular triplet-state 'reservoir' that
thermally repopulates the photoluminescent state of CdSe through endothermic
reverse triplet-triplet energy transfer. The photoluminescence properties are
systematically and predictably tuned through variation of the quantum
dot-molecule energy gap, temperature and the triplet-excited-state lifetime of
the molecular adsorbate. The concepts developed are likely to be applicable to
semiconductor nanocrystals interfaced with molecular chromophores, enabling
potential applications of their combined excited states.

Prebiotic phosphorylation of (pre)biological substrates under aqueous conditions 
is a critical step in the origins of life. Previous investigations have had
limited success and/or require unique environments that are incompatible with
subsequent generation of the corresponding oligomers or higher-order structures. 
Here, we demonstrate that diamidophosphate (DAP)-a plausible prebiotic agent
produced from trimetaphosphate-efficiently (amido)phosphorylates a wide variety
of (pre)biological building blocks (nucleosides/tides, amino acids and lipid
precursors) under aqueous (solution/paste) conditions, without the need for a
condensing agent. Significantly, higher-order structures (oligonucleotides,
peptides and liposomes) are formed under the same phosphorylation reaction
conditions. This plausible prebiotic phosphorylation process under similar
reaction conditions could enable the systems chemistry of the three classes of
(pre)biologically relevant molecules and their oligomers, in a single-pot aqueous
environment.

Cyclic amines are ubiquitous core structures of bioactive natural products and
pharmaceutical drugs. Although the site-selective abstraction of C-H bonds is an 
attractive strategy for preparing valuable functionalized amines from their
readily available parent heterocycles, this approach has largely been limited to 
substrates that require protection of the amine nitrogen atom. In addition, most 
methods rely on transition metals and are incompatible with the presence of amine
N-H bonds. Here we introduce a protecting-group-free approach for the
α-functionalization of cyclic secondary amines. An operationally simple one-pot
procedure generates products via a process that involves intermolecular hydride
transfer to generate an imine intermediate that is subsequently captured by a
nucleophile, such as an alkyl or aryl lithium compound. Reactions are
regioselective and stereospecific and enable the rapid preparation of bioactive
amines, as exemplified by the facile synthesis of anabasine and (-)-solenopsin A.

Mass spectrometry (MS) has become a crucial technique for the analysis of protein
complexes. Native MS has traditionally examined protein subunit arrangements,
while proteomics MS has focused on sequence identification. These two techniques 
are usually performed separately without taking advantage of the synergies
between them. Here we describe the development of an integrated native MS and
top-down proteomics method using Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance
(FTICR) to analyse macromolecular protein complexes in a single experiment. We
address previous concerns of employing FTICR MS to measure large macromolecular
complexes by demonstrating the detection of complexes up to 1.8 MDa, and we
demonstrate the efficacy of this technique for direct acquirement of sequence to 
higher-order structural information with several large complexes. We then
summarize the unique functionalities of different activation/dissociation
techniques. The platform expands the ability of MS to integrate proteomics and
structural biology to provide insights into protein structure, function and
regulation.

Direct arylation of C-H bonds is in principle a powerful way of preparing
value-added molecules that contain carbon-aryl fragments. Unfortunately,
currently available synthetic methods are not sufficiently effective to be
practical alternatives to conventional cross-coupling reactions. We propose that 
the main problem lies in the late portion of the catalytic cycle where reductive 
elimination gives the desired carbon-aryl bond. Accordingly, we have developed a 
strategy where the Ir(III) centre of the key intermediate is first oxidized to
Ir(IV). Density functional theory calculations indicate that the barrier to
reductive elimination is reduced by nearly 19 kcal mol-1 for this oxidized
complex compared with that of its Ir(III) counterpart. Various experiments
confirm this prediction, affording a new methodology capable of directly
arylating C-H bonds at room temperature with a broad substrate scope and in good 
yields. This work highlights how the oxidation states of intermediates can be
targeted deliberately to catalyse an otherwise impossible reaction.

Stephacidin A and its congeners are a collection of secondary metabolites that
possess intriguing structural motifs. They stem from unusual biosynthetic
sequences that lead to the incorporation of a prenyl or reverse-prenyl group into
a bicyclo[2.2.2]diazaoctane framework, a chromene unit or the vestige thereof. To
complement biosynthetic studies, which normally play a significant role in
unveiling the biosynthetic pathways of natural products, here we demonstrate that
chemical synthesis can provide important insights into biosynthesis. We identify 
a short total synthesis of congeners in the reverse-prenylated indole alkaloid
family related to stephacidin A by taking advantage of a direct indole C6
halogenation of the related ketopremalbrancheamide. This novel strategic approach
has now made possible the syntheses of several natural products, including
malbrancheamides B and C, notoamides F, I and R, aspergamide B, and waikialoid A,
which is a heterodimer of avrainvillamide and aspergamide B. Our approach to the 
preparation of these prenylated and reverse-prenylated indole alkaloids is
bioinspired, and may also inform the as-yet undetermined biosynthesis of several 
congeners.

On planet Earth, water is everywhere: the majority of the surface is covered with
it; it is a key component of all life; its vapour and droplets fill the lower
atmosphere; and even rocks contain it and undergo geomorphological changes
because of it. A community of physical scientists largely drives studies of the
chemistry of water and aqueous solutions, with expertise in biochemistry,
spectroscopy and computer modelling. More recently, however, supramolecular
chemists - with their expertise in macrocyclic synthesis and measuring
supramolecular interactions - have renewed their interest in water-mediated
non-covalent interactions. These two groups offer complementary expertise that,
if harnessed, offer to accelerate our understanding of aqueous supramolecular
chemistry and water writ large. This Review summarizes the state-of-the-art of
the two fields, and highlights where there is latent chemical space for
collaborative exploration by the two groups.

Single crystals are typically brittle, inelastic materials. Such mechanical
responses limit their use in practical applications, particularly in flexible
electronics and optical devices. Here we describe single crystals of a well-known
coordination compound-copper(II) acetylacetonate-that are flexible enough to be
reversibly tied into a knot. Mechanical measurements indicate that the crystals
exhibit an elasticity similar to that of soft materials such as nylon, and thus
display properties normally associated with both hard and soft matter. Using
microfocused synchrotron radiation, we mapped the changes in crystal structure
that occur on bending, and determined the mechanism that allows this flexibility 
with atomic precision. We show that, under strain, the molecules in the crystal
reversibly rotate, and thus reorganize to allow the mechanical compression and
expansion required for elasticity and still maintain the integrity of the crystal
structure.

Chromophores absorb light in photosensitive proteins and thereby initiate
fundamental biological processes such as photosynthesis, vision and
biofluorescence. An important goal in their understanding is the provision of
detailed structural descriptions of the ultrafast photochemical events that they 
undergo, in particular of the excited states that connect chemistry to biological
function. Here we report on the structures of two excited states in the
reversibly photoswitchable fluorescent protein rsEGFP2. We populated the states
through femtosecond illumination of rsEGFP2 in its non-fluorescent off state and 
observed their build-up (within less than one picosecond) and decay (on the
several picosecond timescale). Using an X-ray free-electron laser, we performed
picosecond time-resolved crystallography and show that the hydroxybenzylidene
imidazolinone chromophore in one of the excited states assumes a near-canonical
twisted configuration halfway between the trans and cis isomers. This is in line 
with excited-state quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics and classical molecular 
dynamics simulations. Our new understanding of the structure around the twisted
chromophore enabled the design of a mutant that displays a twofold increase in
its off-to-on photoswitching quantum yield.

Natural photosynthesis uses the energy in sunlight to oxidize or reduce reaction 
centres multiple times, therefore preparing each reaction centre for a
multiple-electron-transfer reaction that will ultimately generate stable reaction
products. This process relies on multiple chromophores per reaction centre to
quickly generate the active state of the reaction centre and to outcompete
deleterious charge recombination. Using a similar design principle, we report
spectroscopic evidence for the generation of a twice-oxidized TiO2-bound
molecular proxy catalyst after low-intensity visible-light excitation of
co-anchored molecular Ru(II)-polypyridyl dyes. Electron transfer from an excited 
dye to TiO2 generated a Ru(III) state that subsequently and repeatedly reacted
with neighbouring Ru(II) dyes via self-exchange electron transfer to ultimately
oxidize a distant co-anchored proxy catalyst before charge recombination. The
largest yield for twice-oxidized proxy catalysts occurred when they were present 
at low coverage, suggesting that large dye/electrocatalyst ratios are also
desired in dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells.

Naturally occurring peptides and proteins often use dynamic disulfide bonds to
impart defined tertiary/quaternary structures for the formation of binding
pockets with uniform size and function. Although peptide synthesis and
modification are well established, controlling quaternary structure formation
remains a significant challenge. Here, we report the facile incorporation of aryl
aldehyde and acyl hydrazide functionalities into peptide oligomers via
solid-phase copper-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SP-CuAAC) click
reactions. When mixed, these complementary functional groups rapidly react in
aqueous media at neutral pH to form peptide-peptide intermolecular macrocycles
with highly tunable ring sizes. Moreover, sequence-specific figure-of-eight,
dumbbell-shaped, zipper-like and multi-loop quaternary structures were formed
selectively. Controlling the proportions of reacting peptides with mismatched
numbers of complementary reactive groups results in the formation of
higher-molecular-weight sequence-defined ladder polymers. This also amplified
antimicrobial effectiveness in select cases. This strategy represents a general
approach to the creation of complex abiotic peptide quaternary structures.

Abiotic foldamers, that is foldamers that have backbones chemically remote from
peptidic and nucleotidic skeletons, may give access to shapes and functions
different to those of peptides and nucleotides. However, design methodologies
towards abiotic tertiary and quaternary structures are yet to be developed. Here 
we report rationally designed interactional patterns to guide the folding and
assembly of abiotic helix bundles. Computational design facilitated the
introduction of hydrogen-bonding functionalities at defined locations on the
aromatic amide backbones that promote cooperative folding into helix-turn-helix
motifs in organic solvents. The hydrogen-bond-directed aggregation of helices not
linked by a turn unit produced several thermodynamically and kinetically stable
homochiral dimeric and trimeric bundles with structures that are distinct from
the designed helix-turn-helix. Relative helix orientation within the bundles may 
be changed from parallel to tilted on subtle solvent variations. Altogether,
these results prefigure the richness and uniqueness of abiotic tertiary structure
behaviour.

A rapidly emerging set of catalytic reactions involves intermediates that contain
a copper-substituted stereogenic carbon centre. Here, we demonstrate that an
intimate understanding of this distinction provides ways for addressing
limitations in reaction scope and explaining why unexpected variations in
enantioselectivity often occur. By using catalytic enantioselective Cu-boryl
addition to alkenes as the model process, we elucidate several key mechanistic
principles. We show that higher electrophile concentration can lead to elevated
enantioselectivity. This is because diastereoselective Cu-H elimination may be
avoided and/or achiral Cu-boryl intermediates can be converted to allyl-B(pin)
rather than add to an alkene. We illustrate that lower alkene amounts and/or
higher chiral ligand concentration can minimize the deleterious influence of
achiral Cu-alkyl species, resulting in improved enantiomeric ratios. Moreover,
and surprisingly, we find that enantioselectivities are higher with the less
reactive allylphenyl carbonates as chemoselective copper-hydride elimination is
faster with an achiral Cu-alkyl species.

Arylation is a fundamental reaction that can be mostly fulfilled by electrophilic
aromatic substitution and transition-metal-catalysed aryl functionalization.
Although the azo group has been used as a directing group for many
transformations via transition-metal-catalysed aryl carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond
activation, there remain significant unmet challenges in organocatalytic
arylation. Here, we show that the azo group can effectively act as both a
directing and activating group for organocatalytic asymmetric arylation of
indoles via formal nucleophilic aromatic substitution of azobenzene derivatives. 
Thus, a wide range of axially chiral arylindoles have been achieved in good
yields with excellent enantioselectivities by utilizing chiral phosphoric acid as
catalyst. Furthermore, highly enantioenriched pyrroloindoles bearing two
contiguous quaternary chiral centres have also been obtained via a cascade
enantioselective formal nucleophilic aromatic substitution-cyclization process.
This strategy should be useful in other related research fields and will open new
avenues for organocatalytic asymmetric aryl functionalization.

Today, more than 100 Food and Drug Administration-approved steroidal agents are
prescribed daily for indications including heart failure, inflammation, pain and 
cancer. While triumphs in organic chemistry have enabled the establishment and
sustained growth of the steroid pharmaceutical industry, the production of highly
functionalized synthetic steroids of varying substitution and stereochemistry
remains challenging, despite the numerous reports of elegant strategies for their
de novo synthesis. Here, we describe an advance in chemical synthesis that has
established an enantiospecific means to access novel steroids with unprecedented 
facility and flexibility through the sequential use of two powerful ring-forming 
reactions: a modern metallacycle-mediated annulative cross-coupling and a new
acid-catalysed vinylcyclopropane rearrangement cascade. In addition to accessing 
synthetic steroids of either enantiomeric series, these steroidal products have
been selectively functionalized within each of the four carbocyclic rings, a
synthetic ent-steroid has been prepared on a multigram scale, the enantiomer of a
selective oestrogen has been synthesized, and a novel ent-steroid with growth
inhibitory properties in three cancer cell lines has been discovered.

The selective (and controllable) modification of complex molecules with disparate
functional groups (for example, natural products) is a long-standing challenge
that has been addressed using catalysts tuned to perform singular transformations
(for example, C-H hydroxylation). A method whereby reactions with diverse
functional groups within a single natural product are feasible depending on which
catalyst or reagent is chosen would widen the possible structures one could
obtain. Fluoroarylborane catalysts can heterolytically split Si-H bonds to yield 
an oxophilic silylium (R3Si+) equivalent along with a reducing (H-) equivalent.
Together, these reactive intermediates enable the reduction of multiple
functional groups. Exogenous phosphine Lewis bases further modify the catalyst
speciation and attenuate aggressive silylium ions for the selective modification 
of complex natural products. Manipulation of the catalyst, silane reagent and the
reaction conditions provides experimental control over which site is modified
(and how). Applying this catalytic method to complex bioactive compounds (natural
products or drugs) provides a powerful tool for studying structure-activity
relationships.

Hybridization is a key molecular process in biology and biotechnology, but so far
there is no predictive model for accurately determining hybridization rate
constants based on sequence information. Here, we report a weighted neighbour
voting (WNV) prediction algorithm, in which the hybridization rate constant of an
unknown sequence is predicted based on similarity reactions with known rate
constants. To construct this algorithm we first performed 210 fluorescence
kinetics experiments to observe the hybridization kinetics of 100 different DNA
target and probe pairs (36 nt sub-sequences of the CYCS and VEGF genes) at
temperatures ranging from 28 to 55 °C. Automated feature selection and weighting 
optimization resulted in a final six-feature WNV model, which can predict

Self-assembly of particles into long-range, three-dimensional, ordered
superstructures is crucial for the design of a variety of materials, including
plasmonic sensing materials, energy or gas storage systems, catalysts and
photonic crystals. Here, we have combined experimental and simulation data to
show that truncated rhombic dodecahedral particles of the metal-organic framework
(MOF) ZIF-8 can self-assemble into millimetre-sized superstructures with an
underlying three-dimensional rhombohedral lattice that behave as photonic
crystals. Those superstructures feature a photonic bandgap that can be tuned by
controlling the size of the ZIF-8 particles and is also responsive to the
adsorption of guest substances in the micropores of the ZIF-8 particles. In
addition, superstructures with different lattices can also be assembled by tuning
the truncation of ZIF-8 particles, or by using octahedral UiO-66 MOF particles
instead. These well-ordered, sub-micrometre-sized superstructures might
ultimately facilitate the design of three-dimensional photonic materials for
applications in sensing.

Water splitting is a promising approach to the efficient and cost-effective
production of renewable fuels, but water oxidation remains a bottleneck in its
technological development because it largely relies on noble-metal catalysts.
Although inexpensive transition-metal oxides are competitive water oxidation
catalysts in alkaline media, they cannot compete with noble metals in acidic
media, in which hydrogen production is easier and faster. Here, we report a water
oxidation catalyst based on earth-abundant metals that performs well in acidic
conditions. Specifically, we report the enhanced catalytic activity of insoluble 
salts of polyoxometalates with caesium or barium counter-cations for oxygen
evolution. In particular, the barium salt of a cobalt-phosphotungstate polyanion 
outperforms the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst even at pH < 1, with an
overpotential of 189 mV at 1 mA cm-2. In addition, we find that a carbon-paste
conducting support with a hydrocarbon binder can improve the stability of
metal-oxide catalysts in acidic media by providing a hydrophobic environment.

The rapid generation of molecular complexity from simple starting materials is a 
key challenge in synthesis. Enantioselective radical cyclization cascades have
the potential to deliver complex, densely packed, polycyclic architectures, with 
control of three-dimensional shape, in one step. Unfortunately, carrying out
reactions with radicals in an enantiocontrolled fashion remains challenging due
to their high reactivity. This is particularly the case for reactions of radicals
generated using the classical reagent, SmI2. Here, we demonstrate that
enantioselective SmI2-mediated radical cyclizations and cascades that exploit a
simple, recyclable chiral ligand can convert symmetrical ketoesters to complex
carbocyclic products bearing multiple stereocentres with high enantio- and
diastereocontrol. A computational study has been used to probe the origin of the 
enantioselectivity. Our studies suggest that many processes that rely on SmI2 can
be rendered enantioselective by the design of suitable ligands.

Protein catalysis requires the atomic-level orchestration of side chains,
substrates and cofactors, and yet the ability to design a small-molecule-binding 
protein entirely from first principles with a precisely predetermined structure
has not been demonstrated. Here we report the design of a novel protein, PS1,
that binds a highly electron-deficient non-natural porphyrin at temperatures up
to 100 °C. The high-resolution structure of holo-PS1 is in sub-Å agreement with
the design. The structure of apo-PS1 retains the remote core packing of the
holoprotein, with a flexible binding region that is predisposed to ligand binding
with the desired geometry. Our results illustrate the unification of core packing
and binding-site definition as a central principle of ligand-binding protein
design.

Bacterial meroterpenoids constitute an important class of natural products with
diverse biological properties and therapeutic potential. The biosynthetic logic
for their production is unknown and defies explanation via classical biochemical 
paradigms. A large subgroup of naphthoquinone-based meroterpenoids exhibits a
substitution pattern of the polyketide-derived aromatic core that seemingly
contradicts the established reactivity pattern of polyketide phenol nucleophiles 
and terpene diphosphate electrophiles. We report the discovery of a hitherto
unprecedented enzyme-promoted α-hydroxyketone rearrangement catalysed by
vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases to account for these discrepancies in the
merochlorin and napyradiomycin class of meroterpenoid antibiotics, and we
demonstrate that the α-hydroxyketone rearrangement is potentially a conserved
biosynthetic reaction in this molecular class. The biosynthetic α-hydroxyketone
rearrangement was applied in a concise total synthesis of naphthomevalin, a
prominent member of the napyradiomycin meroterpenes, and sheds further light on
the mechanism of this unifying enzymatic transformation.

Singlet exciton fission (SF), the conversion of one spin-singlet exciton (S1)
into two spin-triplet excitons (T1), could provide a means to overcome the
Shockley-Queisser limit in photovoltaics. SF as measured by the decay of S1 has
been shown to occur efficiently and independently of temperature, even when the
energy of S1 is as much as 200 meV less than that of 2T1. Here we study films of 
triisopropylsilyltetracene using transient optical spectroscopy and show that the
triplet pair state (TT), which has been proposed to mediate singlet fission,
forms on ultrafast timescales (in 300 fs) and that its formation is mediated by
the strong coupling of electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom. This is
followed by a slower loss of singlet character as the excitation evolves to
become only TT. We observe the TT to be thermally dissociated on 10-100 ns
timescales to form free triplets. This provides a model for
'temperature-independent' efficient TT formation and thermally activated TT
separation.

Polyoxygenated hydrocarbons that bear one or more hydroxyl groups comprise a
large set of natural and synthetic compounds, often with potent biological
activity. In synthetic chemistry, alcohols are important precursors to carbonyl
groups, which then can be converted into a wide range of oxygen- or
nitrogen-based functionality. Therefore, the selective conversion of a single
hydroxyl group in natural products into a ketone would enable the selective
introduction of unnatural functionality. However, the methods known to convert a 
simple alcohol, or even an alcohol in a molecule that contains multiple protected
functional groups, are not suitable for selective reactions of complex polyol
structures. We present a new ruthenium catalyst with a unique efficacy for the
selective oxidation of a single hydroxyl group among many in unprotected polyol
natural products. This oxidation enables the introduction of nitrogen-based
functional groups into such structures that lack nitrogen atoms and enables a
selective alcohol epimerization by stepwise or reversible oxidation and
reduction.

Mononuclear gold(II) complexes are very rare labile species. Transient gold(II)
species have been suggested in homogeneous catalysis and in medical applications,
but their geometric and electronic structures have remained essentially
unexplored: even fundamental data, such as the ionic radius of gold(II), are
unknown. Now, an unprecedentedly stable neutral gold(II) complex of a porphyrin
derivative has been isolated, and its structural and spectroscopic features
determined. The gold atom adopts a 2+2 coordination mode in between those of
gold(III) (four-coordinate square planar) and gold(I) (two-coordinate linear),
owing to a second-order Jahn-Teller distortion enabled by the relativistically
lowered 6s orbital of gold. The reactivity of this gold(II) complex towards
dioxygen, nitrosobenzene and acids is discussed. This study provides insight on
the ionic radius of gold(II), and allows it to be placed within the homologous
series of nd9 Cu/Ag/Au divalent ions and the 5d8/9/10 Pt/Au/Hg 'relativistic'
triad in the periodic table.

The controlled introduction of impurities into the crystal lattice of solid-state
compounds is a cornerstone of materials science. Intercalation, the insertion of 
guest atoms, ions or molecules between the atomic layers of a host structure, can
produce novel electronic, magnetic and optical properties in many materials. Here
we describe an intercalation compound in which the host [Co6Te8(PnPr3)6][C60]3,
formed from the binary assembly of atomically precise molecular clusters, is a
superatomic analogue of traditional layered atomic compounds. We find that
tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) can be inserted into the superstructure through a
single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation. Using electronic absorption
spectroscopy, electrical transport measurements and electronic structure
calculations, we demonstrate that the intercalation is driven by the exchange of 
charge between the host [Co6Te8(PnPr3)6][C60]3 and the intercalant TCNE. These
results show that intercalation is a powerful approach to manipulate the material
properties of superatomic crystals.

Complex DNA sequences are difficult to detect and profile, but are important
contributors to human health and disease. Existing hybridization probes lack the 
capability to selectively bind and enrich hypervariable, long or repetitive
sequences. Here, we present a generalized strategy for constructing modular
hybridization probes (M-Probes) that overcomes these challenges. We demonstrate
that M-Probes can tolerate sequence variations of up to 7 nt at prescribed
positions while maintaining single nucleotide sensitivity at other positions.
M-Probes are also shown to be capable of sequence-selectively binding a
continuous DNA sequence of more than 500 nt. Furthermore, we show that M-Probes
can detect genes with triplet repeats exceeding a programmed threshold. As a
demonstration of this technology, we have developed a hybrid capture method to
determine the exact triplet repeat expansion number in the Huntington's gene of
genomic DNA using quantitative PCR.

The amino acid serine is known to form a very stable octamer that has properties 
that set it apart from serine complexes of different sizes or from complexes
composed of other amino acids. For example, both singly protonated serine
octamers and anionic octamers complexed with two halogen ions strongly prefer
homochirality, even when assembled from racemic D,L mixtures. Consequently, the
structures of these complexes are of great interest, but no acceptable candidates
have so far been identified. Here, we investigate anionic serine octamers
coordinated with two chloride ions using a novel technique coupling ion mobility 
spectrometry-mass spectrometry with infrared spectroscopy, in combination with
theoretical calculations. The results allow the identification of a unique
structure for (Ser8Cl2)2- that is highly symmetric, very stable and homochiral
and whose calculated properties match those observed in experiments.

In nature, many organisms generate large families of natural product metabolites 
that have related molecular structures as a means to increase functional
diversity and gain an evolutionary advantage against competing systems within the
same environment. One pathway commonly employed by living systems to generate
these large classes of structurally related families is oligomerization, wherein 
a series of enzymatically catalysed reactions is employed to generate secondary
metabolites by iteratively appending monomers to a growing serial oligomer chain.
The polypyrroloindolines are an interesting class of oligomeric natural products 
that consist of multiple cyclotryptamine subunits. Herein we describe an
iterative application of asymmetric copper catalysis towards the synthesis of six
distinct oligomeric polypyrroloindoline natural products: hodgkinsine,
hodgkinsine B, idiospermuline, quadrigemine H and isopsychotridine B and C. Given
the customizable nature of the small-molecule catalysts employed, we demonstrate 
that this strategy is further amenable to the construction of quadrigemine H-type
alkaloids not isolated previously from natural sources.

Nucleophilic amino acids make important contributions to protein function,
including performing key roles in catalysis and serving as sites for
post-translational modification. Electrophilic groups that target amino-acid
nucleophiles have been used to create covalent ligands and drugs, but have, so
far, been mainly limited to cysteine and serine. Here, we report a chemical
proteomic platform for the global and quantitative analysis of lysine residues in
native biological systems. We have quantified, in total, more than 9,000 lysines 
in human cell proteomes and have identified several hundred residues with
heightened reactivity that are enriched at protein functional sites and can
frequently be targeted by electrophilic small molecules. We have also discovered 
lysine-reactive fragment electrophiles that inhibit enzymes by active site and
allosteric mechanisms, as well as disrupt protein-protein interactions in
transcriptional regulatory complexes, emphasizing the broad potential and diverse
functional consequences of liganding lysine residues throughout the human
proteome.

Classic formulations of aromaticity have long been associated with topologically 
planar conjugated macrocyclic systems. The theoretical possibility of so-called
bicycloaromaticity was noted early on. However, it has yet to be demonstrated by 
experiment in a simple synthetic organic molecule. Conjugated organic systems are
attractive for studying the effect of structure on electronic features. This is
because, in principle, they can be modified readily through dedicated synthesis. 
As such, they can provide useful frameworks for testing by experiment with
fundamental insights provided by theory. Here we detail the synthesis and
characterization of two purely organic non-planar dithienothiophene-bridged
[34]octaphyrins that permit access to two different aromatic forms as a function 
of the oxidation state. In their neutral forms, these congeneric systems contain 
competing 26 and 34 π-electronic circuits. When subject to two-electron
oxidation, electronically mixed [4n+1]/[4n+1] triplet biradical species in the
ground state are obtained that display global aromaticity in accord with Baird's 
rule.

Iron-sulfur clusters are ancient cofactors that play a fundamental role in
metabolism and may have impacted the prebiotic chemistry that led to life.
However, it is unclear whether iron-sulfur clusters could have been synthesized
on prebiotic Earth. Dissolved iron on early Earth was predominantly in the
reduced ferrous state, but ferrous ions alone cannot form polynuclear iron-sulfur
clusters. Similarly, free sulfide may not have been readily available. Here we
show that UV light drives the synthesis of [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters through
the photooxidation of ferrous ions and the photolysis of organic thiols.
Iron-sulfur clusters coordinate to and are stabilized by a wide range of
cysteine-containing peptides and the assembly of iron-sulfur cluster-peptide
complexes can take place within model protocells in a process that parallels
extant pathways. Our experiments suggest that iron-sulfur clusters may have
formed easily on early Earth, facilitating the emergence of an
iron-sulfur-cluster-dependent metabolism.

The transition state, which gates and modulates reactive flux, serves as the
central concept in our understanding of activated reactions. The barrier height
of the transition state can be estimated from the activation energy taken from
thermal kinetics data or from the energetic threshold in the measured excitation 
function (the dependence of reaction cross-sections on initial collision
energies). However, another critical and equally important property, the
angle-dependent barrier to reaction, has not yet been amenable to experimental
determination until now. Here, using the benchmark reaction of Cl + CHD3(v1 = 1) 
as an example, we show how to map this anisotropic property of the transition
state as a function of collision energy from the preferred reactant bond
alignment of the backward-scattered products-the imprints of small
impact-parameter collisions. The deduced bend potential at the transition state
agrees with ab initio calculations. We expect that the method should be
applicable to many other direct reactions with a collinear barrier.

Bond activation at a transition metal centre is a key fundamental step in
numerous chemical transformations. The oxidative addition of element-hydrogen
bonds, for example, represents a critical step in a range of widely applied
catalytic processes. Despite this, experimental studies defining steps along the 
bond activation pathway are very rare. In this work, we report on fundamental
studies defining a new oxidative activation pathway: combined experimental and
computational approaches yield structural snapshots of the simultaneous
activation of both bonds of a β-diketiminate-stabilized GaH2 unit at a single
metal centre. Systematic variation of the supporting phosphine ligands and single
crystal X-ray/neutron diffraction are exploited in tandem to allow structural
visualization of the activation process, from a η2-H,H σ-complex showing little
Ga-H bond activation, through species of intermediate geometry featuring
stretched Ga-H and compressed M-H/M-Ga bonds, to a fully activated metal
dihydride featuring a neutral (carbene-type) N-heterocyclic GaI ligand.

There are many biologically active organic molecules that contain one or more
nitrogen-containing moieties, and broadly applicable and efficient catalytic
transformations that deliver them diastereoselectively and/or enantioselectively 
are much sought after. Various methods for enantioselective synthesis of
α-secondary amines are available (for example, from additions to
protected/activated aldimines), but those involving ketimines are much less
common. There are no reported additions of carbon-based nucleophiles to
unprotected/unactivated (or N-H) ketimines. Here, we report a catalytic,
diastereo- and enantioselective three-component strategy for merging an N-H
ketimine, a monosubstituted allene and B2(pin)2, affording products in up to 95% 
yield, >98% diastereoselectivity and >99:1 enantiomeric ratio. The utility of the
approach is highlighted by synthesis of the tricyclic core of a class of
compounds that have been shown to possess anti-Alzheimer activity. Stereochemical
models developed with the aid of density functional theory calculations, which
account for the observed trends and levels of enantioselectivity, are presented.

Two-dimensional (2D) supramolecular arrays provide a route to the spatial control
of the chemical functionality of a surface, but their deposition is in almost all
cases limited to a monolayer termination. Here we investigated the sequential
deposition of one 2D array on another to form a supramolecular heterostructure
and realize the growth-normal to the underlying substrate-of distinct ordered
layers, each of which is stabilized by in-plane hydrogen bonding. For
heterostructures formed by depositing terephthalic acid or trimesic acid on
cyanuric acid/melamine, we have determined, using atomic force microscopy under
ambient conditions, a clear epitaxial arrangement despite the intrinsically
distinct symmetries and/or lattice constants of each layer. Structures calculated
using classical molecular dynamics are in excellent agreement with the
orientation, registry and dimensions of the epitaxial layers. Calculations
confirm that van der Waals interactions provide the dominant contribution to the 
adsorption energy and registry of the layers.

Many intracellular membraneless organelles form via phase separation of
intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) or regions (IDRs). These include the
Caenorhabditis elegans protein LAF-1, which forms P granule-like droplets in
vitro. However, the role of protein disorder in phase separation and the
macromolecular organization within droplets remain elusive. Here, we utilize a
novel technique, ultrafast-scanning fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, to
measure the molecular interactions and full coexistence curves (binodals), which 
quantify the protein concentration within LAF-1 droplets. The binodals of LAF-1
and its IDR display a number of unusual features, including 'high concentration' 
binodal arms that correspond to remarkably dilute droplets. We find that LAF-1
and other in vitro and intracellular droplets are characterized by an effective
mesh size of ∼3-8 nm, which determines the size scale at which droplet properties
impact molecular diffusion and permeability. These findings reveal how specific
IDPs can phase separate to form permeable, low-density (semi-dilute) liquids,
whose structural features are likely to strongly impact biological function.

Ultrafast electron transfer in condensed-phase molecular systems is often
strongly coupled to intramolecular vibrations that can promote, suppress and
direct electronic processes. Recent experiments exploring this phenomenon proved 
that light-induced electron transfer can be strongly modulated by vibrational
excitation, suggesting a new avenue for active control over molecular function.
Here, we achieve the first example of such explicit vibrational control through
judicious design of a Pt(II)-acetylide charge-transfer
donor-bridge-acceptor-bridge-donor 'fork' system: asymmetric 13C isotopic
labelling of one of the two -C≡C- bridges makes the two parallel and otherwise
identical donor→acceptor electron-transfer pathways structurally distinct,
enabling independent vibrational perturbation of either. Applying an ultrafast
UVpump(excitation)-IRpump(perturbation)-IRprobe(monitoring) pulse sequence, we
show that the pathway that is vibrationally perturbed during UV-induced electron 
transfer is dramatically slowed down compared to its unperturbed counterpart. One
can thus choose the dominant electron transfer pathway. The findings deliver a
new opportunity for precise perturbative control of electronic energy propagation
in molecular devices.

Selectively converting linear alkanes to α-olefins under mild conditions is a
highly desirable transformation given the abundance of alkanes as well as the use
of olefins as building blocks in the chemical community. Until now, this reaction
has been primarily the remit of noble-metal catalysts, despite extensive work
showing that base-metal alkylidenes can mediate the reaction in a stoichiometric 
fashion. Here, we show how the presence of a hydrogen acceptor, such as the
phosphorus ylide, when combined with the alkylidene complex (PNP)Ti=CHtBu(CH3)
(PNP=N[2-P(CHMe2)2-4-methylphenyl]2-), catalyses the dehydrogenation of
cycloalkanes to cyclic alkenes, and linear alkanes with chain lengths of C4 to C8
to terminal olefins under mild conditions. This Article represents the first
example of a homogeneous and selective alkane dehydrogenation reaction using a
base-metal titanium catalyst. We also propose a unique mechanism for the transfer
dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons to olefins and discuss a complete cycle based on 
a combined experimental and computational study.

One of the enticing characteristics of supramolecular polymers is their
thermodynamic reversibility, which is attractive, in particular, for
stimuli-responsive applications. These polymers usually disassemble upon heating,
but here we report a supramolecular polymerization that occurs upon heating as
well as cooling. This behaviour arises from the use of a metalloporphyrin-based
tailored monomer bearing eight amide-containing side chains, which assembles into
a highly thermostable one-dimensional polymer through π-stacking and multivalent 
hydrogen-bonding interactions, and a scavenger, 1-hexanol, in a dodecane-based
solvent. At around 50 °C, the scavenger locks the monomer into a
non-polymerizable form through competing hydrogen bonding. On cooling, the
scavenger preferentially self-aggregates, unlocking the monomer for
polymerization. Heating also results in unlocking the monomer for polymerization,
by disrupting the dipole and hydrogen-bonding interactions with the scavenger.
Analogous to 'upper and lower critical solution temperature phenomena' for
covalently bonded polymers, such a thermally bisignate feature may lead to
supramolecular polymers with tailored complex thermoresponsive properties.

Termolecular association reactions involve ephemeral collision complexes-formed
from the collision of two molecules-that collide with a third and chemically
inert 'bath gas' molecule that simply transfers energy to/from the complex. These
collision complexes are generally not thought to react chemically on collision
with a third molecule in the gas-phase systems of combustion and planetary
atmospheres. Such 'chemically termolecular' reactions, in which all three
molecules are involved in bond making and/or breaking, were hypothesized long ago
in studies establishing radical chain branching mechanisms, but were later
concluded to be unimportant. Here, with data from ab initio master equation and
kinetic-transport simulations, we reveal that reactions of H + O2 collision
complexes with other radicals constitute major kinetic pathways under common
combustion situations. These reactions are also found to influence flame
propagation speeds, a common measure of global reactivity. Analogous chemically
termolecular reactions mediated by ephemeral collision complexes are probably of 
significance in various combustion and planetary environments.

The synthesis of carboxylic acid derivatives from unsaturated hydrocarbons is an 
important process for the preparation of polymers, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and
agrochemicals. Despite its industrial relevance, the traditional Reppe-type
carbonylation reaction using pressurized CO is of limited applicability to
laboratory-scale synthesis because of: (1) the safety hazards associated with the
use of CO, (2) the need for special equipment to handle pressurized gas, (3) the 
low reactivity of several relevant nucleophiles and (4) the necessity to employ
different, often tailor-made, catalytic systems for each nucleophile. Herein we
demonstrate that a shuttle-catalysis approach enables a CO- and HCl-free transfer
process between an inexpensive reagent, butyryl chloride, and a wide range of
unsaturated substrates to access the corresponding acid chlorides in good yields.
This new transformation provides access to a broad range of carbonyl-containing
products through the in situ transformation of the reactive acid chloride
intermediate. In a broader context, this work demonstrates that isodesmic
shuttle-catalysis reactions can unlock elusive catalytic reactions.

Polysulfates and polysulfonates possess exceptional mechanical properties making 
them potentially valuable engineering polymers. However, they have been little
explored due to a lack of reliable synthetic access. Here we report bifluoride
salts (Q+[FHF]-, where Q+ represents a wide range of cations) as powerful
catalysts for the sulfur(VI) fluoride exchange (SuFEx) reaction between aryl
silyl ethers and aryl fluorosulfates (or alkyl sulfonyl fluorides). The
bifluoride salts are significantly more active in catalysing the SuFEx reaction
compared to organosuperbases, therefore enabling much lower catalyst-loading
(down to 0.05 mol%). Using this chemistry, we are able to prepare polysulfates
and polysulfonates with high molecular weight, narrow polydispersity and
excellent functional group tolerance. The process is practical with regard to the
reduced cost of catalyst, polymer purification and by-product recycling. We have 
also observed that the process is not sensitive to scale-up, which is essential
for its future translation from laboratory research to industrial applications.

analogue-oriented synthesis approaches provide a series of lissoclimide natural
products and analogues that expand the structure-activity relationships (SARs) in
this family. The semisynthesis approach yielded significant quantities of
chlorolissoclimide (CL) to permit an evaluation against the National Cancer
Institute's 60-cell line panel and allowed us to obtain an X-ray co-crystal
structure of the synthetic secondary metabolite with the eukaryotic 80S ribosome.
Although it shares a binding site with other imide-based natural product
translation inhibitors, CL engages in a particularly interesting and novel
face-on halogen-π interaction between the ligand's alkyl chloride and a guanine
residue. Our analogue-oriented synthesis provides many more lissoclimide
compounds, which were tested against aggressive human cancer cell lines and for
protein synthesis inhibitory activity. Finally, computational modelling was used 
to explain the SARs of certain key compounds and set the stage for the
structure-guided design of better translation inhibitors.

Despite recent advances in the synthesis of increasingly complex topologies at
the molecular level, nano- and microscopic weaves have remained difficult to
achieve. Only a few diaxial molecular weaves exist-these were achieved by
templation with metals. Here, we present an extended triaxial supramolecular
weave that consists of self-assembled organic threads. Each thread is formed by
the self-assembly of a building block comprising a rigid oligoproline segment
with two perylene-monoimide chromophores spaced at 18 Å. Upon π stacking of the
chromophores, threads form that feature alternating up- and down-facing voids at 
regular distances. These voids accommodate incoming building blocks and establish
crossing points through CH-π interactions on further assembly of the threads into
a triaxial woven superstructure. The resulting micrometre-scale supramolecular
weave proved to be more robust than non-woven self-assemblies of the same
building block. The uniform hexagonal pores of the interwoven network were able
to host iridium nanoparticles, which may be of interest for practical
applications.

The chemical synthesis of oligonucleotides and their enzyme-mediated assembly
into genes and genomes has significantly advanced multiple scientific
disciplines. However, these approaches are not without their shortcomings;
enzymatic amplification and ligation of oligonucleotides into genes and genomes
makes automation challenging, and site-specific incorporation of epigenetic
information and/or modified bases into large constructs is not feasible. Here we 
present a fully chemical one-pot method for the assembly of oligonucleotides into
a gene by click-DNA ligation. We synthesize the 335 base-pair gene that encodes
the green fluorescent protein iLOV from ten functionalized oligonucleotides that 
contain 5'-azide and 3'-alkyne units. The resulting click-linked iLOV gene
contains eight triazoles at the sites of chemical ligation, and yet is fully
biocompatible; it is replicated by DNA polymerases in vitro and encodes a
functional iLOV protein in Escherichia coli. We demonstrate the power and
potential of our one-pot gene-assembly method by preparing an epigenetically
modified variant of the iLOV gene.

Understanding the diversity of dynamic structures and functions of DNA and RNA in
biology requires tools that can selectively and intimately probe these
biomolecules. Synthetic fluorescent nucleobases that can be incorporated into
nucleic acids alongside their natural counterparts have emerged as a powerful
class of molecular reporters of location and environment. They are enabling new
basic insights into DNA and RNA, and are facilitating a broad range of new
technologies with chemical, biological and biomedical applications. In this
Review, we will present a brief history of the development of fluorescent
nucleobases and explore their utility as tools for addressing questions in
biophysics, biochemistry and biology of nucleic acids. We provide chemical
insights into the two main classes of these compounds: canonical and
non-canonical nucleobases. A point-by-point discussion of the advantages and
disadvantages of both types of fluorescent nucleobases is made, along with a
perspective into the future challenges and outlook for this burgeoning field.

Nucleic acids have attracted widespread attention due to the simplicity with
which they can be designed to form discrete structures and programmed to perform 
specific functions at the nanoscale. The advantages of DNA/RNA nanotechnology
offer numerous opportunities for in-cell and in-vivo applications, and the
technology holds great promise to advance the growing field of synthetic biology.
Many elegant examples have revealed the potential in integrating nucleic acid
nanostructures in cells and in vivo where they can perform important
physiological functions. In this Review, we summarize the current abilities of
DNA/RNA nanotechnology to realize applications in live cells and then discuss the
key problems that must be solved to fully exploit the useful properties of
nanostructures. Finally, we provide viewpoints on how to integrate the tools
provided by DNA/RNA nanotechnology and related new technologies to construct
nucleic acid nanostructure-based molecular circuitry for synthetic biology.

DNA and histone modifications regulate transcriptional activity and thus
represent valuable targets to reprogram the activity of genes. Current epigenetic
therapies target the machinery that regulates these modifications, leading to
global transcriptional reprogramming with the potential for extensive undesired
effects. Epigenetic information can also be modified as a consequence of
disrupting processive DNA replication. Here, we demonstrate that impeding
replication by small-molecule-mediated stabilization of G-quadruplex nucleic acid
secondary structures triggers local epigenetic plasticity. We report the use of
the BU-1 locus of chicken DT40 cells to screen for small molecules able to induce
G-quadruplex-dependent transcriptional reprogramming. Further characterization of
the top hit compound revealed its ability to induce a dose-dependent inactivation
of BU-1 expression in two steps: the loss of H3K4me3 and then subsequent DNA
cytosine methylation, changes that were heritable across cell divisions even
after the compound was removed. Targeting DNA secondary structures thus
represents a potentially new approach for locus-specific epigenetic
reprogramming.

Although the α-alkylation of ketones has already been established, the analogous 
reaction using aldehyde substrates has proven surprisingly elusive. Despite the
structural similarities between the two classes of compounds, the sensitivity and
unique reactivity of the aldehyde functionality has typically required activated 
substrates or specialized additives. Here, we show that the synergistic merger of
three catalytic processes-photoredox, enamine and hydrogen-atom transfer (HAT)
catalysis-enables an enantioselective α-aldehyde alkylation reaction that employs
simple olefins as coupling partners. Chiral imidazolidinones or prolinols, in
combination with a thiophenol, iridium photoredox catalyst and visible light,
have been successfully used in a triple catalytic process that is temporally
sequenced to deliver a new hydrogen and electron-borrowing mechanism. This
multicatalytic process enables both intra- and intermolecular aldehyde
α-methylene coupling with olefins to construct both cyclic and acyclic products, 
respectively. With respect to atom and step-economy ideals, this stereoselective 
process allows the production of high-value molecules from feedstock chemicals in
one step while consuming only photons.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) represent a subset of cells within tumours that exhibit 
self-renewal properties and the capacity to seed tumours. CSCs are typically
refractory to conventional treatments and have been associated to metastasis and 
relapse. Salinomycin operates as a selective agent against CSCs through
mechanisms that remain elusive. Here, we provide evidence that a synthetic
derivative of salinomycin, which we named ironomycin (AM5), exhibits a more
potent and selective activity against breast CSCs in vitro and in vivo, by
accumulating and sequestering iron in lysosomes. In response to the ensuing
cytoplasmic depletion of iron, cells triggered the degradation of ferritin in
lysosomes, leading to further iron loading in this organelle. Iron-mediated
production of reactive oxygen species promoted lysosomal membrane
permeabilization, activating a cell death pathway consistent with ferroptosis.
These findings reveal the prevalence of iron homeostasis in breast CSCs, pointing
towards iron and iron-mediated processes as potential targets against these
cells.

Tubingensin B is an indole diterpenoid that bears a daunting chemical structure
featuring a disubstituted carbazole unit, five stereogenic centres-three of which
are quaternary-and a decorated [3.2.2]-bridged bicycle. We describe our synthetic
design toward a concise and enantiospecific total synthesis of tubingensin B,
which hinges on the strategic use of a transient aryne intermediate. Although
initial studies led to unexpected reaction outcomes, we ultimately implemented a 
sequence of carbazolyne cyclization followed by Rh-catalysed fragmentation to
install the seven-membered ring and vicinal quaternary stereocentres of the
natural product. Coupled with a late-stage radical cyclization to construct the
[3.2.2]-bridged bicycle, these efforts have enabled the total synthesis of
tubingensin B. The design and evolution of our succinct total synthesis
underscores the utility of long-avoided aryne intermediates for the introduction 
of structural motifs that have conventionally been viewed as challenging.

Crystalline frameworks composed of hexacoordinate silicon species have thus far
only been observed in a few high pressure silicate phases. By implementing
reversible Si-O chemistry for the crystallization of covalent organic frameworks,
we demonstrate the simple one-pot synthesis of silicate organic frameworks based 
on octahedral dianionic SiO6 building units. Clear evidence of the hexacoordinate
environment around the silicon atoms is given by 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance 
analysis. Characterization by high-resolution powder X-ray diffraction, density
functional theory calculation and analysis of the pair-distribution function
showed that those anionic frameworks-M2[Si(C16H10O4)1.5], where M = Li, Na, K and
C16H10O4 is 9,10-dimethylanthracene-2,3,6,7-tetraolate-crystallize as
two-dimensional hexagonal layers stabilized in a fully eclipsed stacking
arrangement with pronounced disorder in the stacking direction. Permanent
microporosity with high surface area (up to 1,276 m2 g-1) was evidenced by
gas-sorption measurements. The negatively charged backbone balanced with
extra-framework cations and the permanent microporosity are characteristics that 
are shared with zeolites.

During embryo development, patterns of protein concentration appear in response
to morphogen gradients. These patterns provide spatial and chemical information
that directs the fate of the underlying cells. Here, we emulate this process
within non-living matter and demonstrate the autonomous structuration of a
synthetic material. First, we use DNA-based reaction networks to synthesize a
French flag, an archetypal pattern composed of three chemically distinct zones
with sharp borders whose synthetic analogue has remained elusive. A bistable
network within a shallow concentration gradient creates an immobile, sharp and
long-lasting concentration front through a reaction-diffusion mechanism. The
combination of two bistable circuits generates a French flag pattern whose
'phenotype' can be reprogrammed by network mutation. Second, these concentration 
patterns control the macroscopic organization of DNA-decorated particles,
inducing a French flag pattern of colloidal aggregation. This experimental
framework could be used to test reaction-diffusion models and fabricate soft
materials following an autonomous developmental programme.

Singlet fission, in which a singlet exciton is converted to two triplet excitons,
is a process that could be beneficial in photovoltaic applications. A full
understanding of the dynamics of singlet fission in molecular systems requires
detailed knowledge of the relevant potential energy surfaces and their (conical) 
intersections. However, obtaining such information is a nontrivial task,
particularly for molecular aggregates. Here we investigate singlet fission in
rubrene crystals using transient absorption spectroscopy and state-of-the-art
quantum chemical calculations. We observe a coherent and ultrafast
singlet-fission channel as well as the well-known and conventional thermally
assisted incoherent channel. This coherent channel is accessible because the
conical intersection for singlet fission on the excited-state potential energy
surface is located very close to the equilibrium position of the ground-state
potential energy surface and also because of the excitation of an intermolecular 
symmetry-breaking mode, which activates the electronic coupling necessary for
singlet fission.

The trifluoromethylthio (SCF3) functional group has been of increasing importance
in drug design and development as a consequence of its unique electronic
properties and high stability coupled with its high lipophilicity. As a result,
methods to introduce this highly electronegative functional group have attracted 
considerable attention in recent years. Although significant progress has been
made in the introduction of SCF3 functionality into a variety of molecules, there
remain significant challenges regarding the enantioselective synthesis of
SCF3-containing compounds. Here, an asymmetric trifluoromethylthiolation that
proceeds through the enantioselective [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of a
sulfonium ylide generated from a metal carbene and sulfide (Doyle-Kirmse
reaction) has been developed using chiral Rh(II) and Cu(I) catalysts. This
transformation features mild reaction conditions and excellent
enantioselectivities (up to 98% yield and 98% e.e.), thus providing a unique,
highly efficient and enantioselective method for the construction of C(sp3)-SCF3 
bonds bearing chiral centres.

The transition state governs how chemical bonds form and cleave during a chemical
reaction and its direct characterization is a long-standing challenge in physical
chemistry. Transition state spectroscopy experiments based on negative-ion
photodetachment provide a direct probe of the vibrational structure and
metastable resonances that are characteristic of the reactive surface. Dynamical 
resonances are extremely sensitive to the topography of the reactive surface and 
provide an exceptional point of comparison with theory. Here we study the
seven-atom F + CH3OH → HF + CH3O reaction using slow photoelectron velocity-map
imaging spectroscopy of cryocooled CH3OHF- anions. These measurements reveal
spectral features associated with a manifold of vibrational Feshbach resonances
and bound states supported by the post-transition state potential well. Quantum
dynamical calculations yield excellent agreement with the experimental results,
allow the assignment of spectral structure and demonstrate that the key dynamics 
of complex bimolecular reactions can be captured with a relatively simple
theoretical framework.

The assembly-disassembly-organization-reassembly (ADOR) mechanism is a recent
method for preparing inorganic framework materials and, in particular, zeolites. 
This flexible approach has enabled the synthesis of isoreticular families of
zeolites with unprecedented continuous control over porosity, and the design and 
preparation of materials that would have been difficult-or even impossible-to
obtain using traditional hydrothermal techniques. Applying the ADOR process to a 
parent zeolite with the UTL framework topology, for example, has led to six
previously unknown zeolites (named IPC-n, where n = 2, 4, 6, 7, 9 and 10). To
realize the full potential of the ADOR method, however, a further understanding
of the complex mechanism at play is needed. Here, we probe the disassembly,
organization and reassembly steps of the ADOR process through a combination of
in situ solid-state NMR spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffraction experiments. We
further use the insight gained to explain the formation of the unusual structure 
of zeolite IPC-6.

Protein-protein association is fundamental to many life processes. However, a
microscopic model describing the structures and kinetics during association and
dissociation is lacking on account of the long lifetimes of associated states,
which have prevented efficient sampling by direct molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations. Here we demonstrate protein-protein association and dissociation in 
atomistic resolution for the ribonuclease barnase and its inhibitor barstar by
combining adaptive high-throughput MD simulations and hidden Markov modelling.
The model reveals experimentally consistent intermediate structures, energetics
and kinetics on timescales from microseconds to hours. A variety of flexibly
attached intermediates and misbound states funnel down to a transition state and 
a native basin consisting of the loosely bound near-native state and the tightly 
bound crystallographic state. These results offer a deeper level of insight into 
macromolecular recognition and our approach opens the door for understanding and 
manipulating a wide range of macromolecular association processes.

Although considerable progress has been made in carbon dioxide (CO2)
hydrogenation to various C1 chemicals, it is still a great challenge to
synthesize value-added products with two or more carbons, such as gasoline,
directly from CO2 because of the extreme inertness of CO2 and a high C-C coupling
barrier. Here we present a bifunctional catalyst composed of reducible indium
oxides (In2O3) and zeolites that yields a high selectivity to gasoline-range
hydrocarbons (78.6%) with a very low methane selectivity (1%). The oxygen
vacancies on the In2O3 surfaces activate CO2 and hydrogen to form methanol, and
C-C coupling subsequently occurs inside zeolite pores to produce gasoline-range
hydrocarbons with a high octane number. The proximity of these two components
plays a crucial role in suppressing the undesired reverse water gas shift
reaction and giving a high selectivity for gasoline-range hydrocarbons. Moreover,
the pellet catalyst exhibits a much better performance during an
industry-relevant test, which suggests promising prospects for industrial
applications.

Reductive amination is one of the most important methods for the synthesis of
chiral amines. Here we report the discovery of an NADP(H)-dependent reductive
aminase from Aspergillus oryzae (AspRedAm, Uniprot code Q2TW47) that can catalyse
the reductive coupling of a broad set of carbonyl compounds with a variety of
primary and secondary amines with up to >98% conversion and with up to >98%
enantiomeric excess. In cases where both carbonyl and amine show high reactivity,
it is possible to employ a 1:1 ratio of the substrates, forming amine products
with up to 94% conversion. Steady-state kinetic studies establish that the enzyme
is capable of catalysing imine formation as well as reduction. Crystal structures
of AspRedAm in complex with NADP(H) and also with both NADP(H) and the
pharmaceutical ingredient (R)-rasagiline are reported. We also demonstrate
preparative scale reductive aminations with wild-type and Q240A variant
biocatalysts displaying total turnover numbers of up to 32,000 and space time
yields up to 3.73 g l-1 d-1.

Direct C(sp3)-C(sp2) bond formation under transition-metal-free conditions offers
an atom-economical, inexpensive and environmentally benign alternative to
traditional transition-metal-catalysed cross-coupling reactions. A new chemo- and
regioselective coupling protocol between
3-aryl-substituted-1,1-diphenyl-2-azaallyl derivatives and vinyl bromides has
been developed. This is the first transition-metal-free cross-coupling of
azaallyls with vinyl bromide electrophiles and delivers allylic amines in
excellent yields (up to 99%). This relatively simple and mild protocol offers a
direct and practical strategy for the synthesis of high-value allylic amine
building blocks that does not require the use of transition metals, special
initiators or photoredox catalysts. Radical clock experiments, electron
paramagnetic resonance studies and density functional theory calculations point
to an unprecedented substrate-dependent coupling mechanism. Furthermore, an
electron paramagnetic resonance signal was observed when the N-benzyl
benzophenone ketimine was subjected to silylamide base, supporting the formation 
of radical species upon deprotonation. The unique mechanisms outlined herein
could pave the way for new approaches to transition-metal-free C-C bond
formations.

The double-helix structure of DNA, in which complementary strands reversibly
hybridize to each other, not only explains how genetic information is stored and 
replicated, but also has proved very attractive for the development of
nanomaterials. The discovery of metal-mediated base pairs has prompted the
generation of short metal-DNA hybrid duplexes by a bottom-up approach. Here we
describe a metallo-DNA nanowire-whose structure was solved by high-resolution
X-ray crystallography-that consists of dodecamer duplexes held together by four
different metal-mediated base pairs (the previously observed C-Ag-C, as well as
G-Ag-G, G-Ag-C and T-Ag-T) and linked to each other through G overhangs involved 
in interduplex G-Ag-G. The resulting hybrid nanowires are 2 nm wide with a length
of the order of micrometres to millimetres, and hold the silver ions in
uninterrupted one-dimensional arrays along the DNA helical axis. The hybrid
nanowires are further assembled into three-dimensional lattices by interactions
between adenine residues, fully bulged out of the double helix.

The concept of a glucose-responsive insulin (GRI) has been a recent objective of 
diabetes technology. The idea behind the GRI is to create a therapeutic that
modulates its potency, concentration or dosing relative to a patient's dynamic
glucose concentration, thereby approximating aspects of a normally functioning
pancreas. From the perspective of the medicinal chemist, the GRI is also
important as a generalized model of a potentially new generation of therapeutics 
that adjust potency in response to a critical therapeutic marker. The aim of this
Perspective is to highlight emerging concepts, including mathematical modelling
and the molecular engineering of insulin itself and its potency, towards a viable
GRI. We briefly outline some of the most important recent progress toward this
goal and also provide a forward-looking viewpoint, which asks if there are new
approaches that could spur innovation in this area as well as to encourage
synthetic chemists and chemical engineers to address the challenges and promises 
offered by this therapeutic approach.

A strategy to develop improved catalysts is to create systems that merge the
advantages of heterogeneous and molecular catalysis. One such system involves
supported liquid-phase catalysts, which feature a molecularly defined,
catalytically active liquid film/droplet layer adsorbed on a porous solid
support. In the past decade, this concept has also been extended to supported
ionic liquid-phase catalysts. Here we develop this idea further and describe
supported catalytically active liquid metal solutions (SCALMS). We report a
liquid mixture of gallium and palladium deposited on porous glass that forms an
active catalyst for alkane dehydrogenation that is resistant to coke formation
and is thus highly stable. X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, supported by theoretical calculations, confirm the liquid state of 
the catalytic phase under the reaction conditions. Unlike traditional
heterogeneous catalysts, the supported liquid metal reported here is highly
dynamic and catalysis does not proceed at the surface of the metal nanoparticles,
but presumably at homogeneously distributed metal atoms at the surface of a
liquid metallic phase.

Madanin-1 and chimadanin are two small cysteine-free thrombin inhibitors that
facilitate blood feeding in the tick Haemaphysalis longicornis. Here, we report a
post-translational modification-tyrosine sulfation-of these two proteins that is 
critical for potent anti-thrombotic and anticoagulant activity. Inhibitors
produced in baculovirus-infected insect cells displayed heterogeneous sulfation
of two tyrosine residues within each of the proteins. One-pot
ligation-desulfurization chemistry enabled access to homogeneous samples of all
possible sulfated variants of the proteins. Tyrosine sulfation of madanin-1 and
chimadanin proved crucial for thrombin inhibitory activity, with the doubly
sulfated variants three orders of magnitude more potent than the unmodified
inhibitors. The three-dimensional structure of madanin-1 in complex with thrombin
revealed a unique mode of inhibition, with the sulfated tyrosine residues binding
to the basic exosite II of the protease. The importance of tyrosine sulfation
within this family of thrombin inhibitors, together with their unique binding
mode, paves the way for the development of anti-thrombotic drug leads based on
these privileged scaffolds.

Berkelium (Bk) has been predicted to be the only transplutonium element able to
exhibit both +III and +IV oxidation states in solution, but evidence of a stable 
oxidized Bk chelate has so far remained elusive. Here we describe the
stabilization of the heaviest 4+ ion of the periodic table, under mild aqueous
conditions, using a siderophore derivative. The resulting Bk(IV) complex exhibits
luminescence via sensitization through an intramolecular antenna effect. This
neutral Bk(IV) coordination compound is not sequestered by the protein
siderocalin-a mammalian metal transporter-in contrast to the negatively charged
species obtained with neighbouring trivalent actinides americium, curium and
californium (Cf). The corresponding Cf(III)-ligand-protein ternary adduct was
characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis. Combined with theoretical
predictions, these data add significant insight to the field of transplutonium
chemistry, and may lead to innovative Bk separation and purification processes.

Actinyl species, [AnO2]2+, are well-known derivatives of the f-block because of
their natural occurrence and essential roles in the nuclear fuel cycle. Along
with their nitrogen analogues, [An(NR)2]2+, actinyls are characterized by their
two strong trans-An-element multiple bonds, a consequence of the inverse trans
influence. We report that these robust bonds can be weakened significantly by
increasing the number of multiple bonds to uranium, as demonstrated by a family
of uranium(VI) dianions bearing four U-N multiple bonds, [M]2[U(NR)4] (M = Li,
Na, K, Rb, Cs). Their geometry is dictated by cation coordination and sterics
rather than by electronic factors. Multiple bond weakening by the addition of
strong π donors has the potential for applications in the processing of
high-valent actinyls, commonly found in environmental pollutants and spent
nuclear fuels.

Elucidating the binding mode of carboxylate-containing ligands to gold
nanoparticles (AuNPs) is crucial to understand their stabilizing role. A detailed
picture of the three-dimensional structure and coordination modes of citrate,
acetate, succinate and glutarate to AuNPs is obtained by 13C and 23Na solid-state
NMR in combination with computational modelling and electron microscopy. The
binding between the carboxylates and the AuNP surface is found to occur in three 
different modes. These three modes are simultaneously present at low citrate to
gold ratios, while a monocarboxylate monodentate (1κO1) mode is favoured at high 
citrate:gold ratios. The surface AuNP atoms are found to be predominantly in the 
zero oxidation state after citrate coordination, although trace amounts of Auδ+
are observed. 23Na NMR experiments show that Na+ ions are present near the gold
surface, indicating that carboxylate binding occurs as a 2e- L-type interaction
for each oxygen atom involved. This approach has broad potential to probe the
binding of a variety of ligands to metal nanoparticles.

Biomolecular receptors are able to process information by responding
differentially to combinations of chemical signals. Synthetic receptors that are 
likewise capable of multi-stimuli response can form the basis of programmable
molecular systems, wherein specific input sequences create distinct outputs. Here
we report a pseudo-cuboctahedral assembly capable of cooperatively binding
anionic and neutral guest species. The binding of pairs of fullerene guests was
observed to effect the all-or-nothing cooperative templation of an S6-symmetric
host stereoisomer. This bis-fullerene adduct exhibits different cooperativity in 
binding pairs of anions from the fullerene-free parent: in one case, positive
cooperativity is observed, while in another all binding affinities are enhanced
by an order of magnitude, and in a third the binding events are only minimally
perturbed. This intricate modulation of binding affinity, and thus cooperativity,
renders our new cuboctahedral receptor attractive for incorporation into systems 
with complex, programmable responses to different sets of stimuli.

The polypropionate motif is ubiquitous, being characteristic of the most
important family of natural products for human health, the polyketides. Numerous 
strategies have been devised to construct these molecules with high
stereocontrol, but certain stereoisomers remain challenging to prepare. We now
describe the development of an iterative assembly line strategy for the
construction of polypropionates. An assembly line strategy for the synthesis of
deoxypolypropionates has already been described. However, the introduction of
carbinol units required the development of new building blocks and new reaction
conditions. This has been achieved by the use of enantioenriched lithiated
α-chlorosilanes
[1-((2'-lithiochloromethyldimethylsilyl)-methyl)-2-(methoxymethyl)-pyrrolidine], 
thus enabling the programmed synthesis of polypropionates in a fully
stereocontrolled manner, including the stereochemically challenging anti-anti
isomers. The versatility of the approach is exemplified in its extension to the
synthesis of 1,3-related polyols. The methodology now allows access to a much
wider family of polyketide natural products with stereochemistry being dialled in
at will.

Electron transfer in mixed-valent transition-metal complexes, clusters and
materials is ubiquitous in both natural and synthetic systems. The degree to
which intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) occurs, dependent on the degree of
delocalization, places these within class II or III of the Robin-Day system. In
contrast to the d-block, compounds of f-block elements typically exhibit class I 
behaviour (no IVCT) because of localization of the valence electrons and poor
spatial overlap between metal and ligand orbitals. Here, we report experimental
and computational evidence for delocalization of 5f electrons in the mixed-valent
PuIII/PuIV solid-state compound, Pu3(DPA)5(H2O)2
(DPA = 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylate). The properties of this compound are
benchmarked by the pure PuIII and PuIV dipicolinate complexes,
[PuIII(DPA)(H2O)4]Br and PuIV(DPA)2(H2O)3·3H2O, as well as by a second
mixed-valent compound, PuIII[PuIV(DPA)3H0.5]2, that falls into class I instead.
Metal-to-ligand charge transfer is involved in both the formation of
Pu3(DPA)5(H2O)2 and in the IVCT.

Understanding the behaviour of flexible metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-porous
crystalline materials that undergo a structural change upon exposure to an
external stimulus-underpins their design as responsive materials for specific
applications, such as gas separation, molecular sensing, catalysis and drug
delivery. Reversible transformations of a MOF between open- and closed-pore
forms-a behaviour known as 'breathing'-typically occur through well-defined
crystallographic transitions. By contrast, continuous breathing is rare, and
detailed characterization has remained very limited. Here we report a
continuous-breathing mechanism that was studied by single-crystal diffraction in 
a MOF with a diamondoid network, (Me2NH2)[In(ABDC)2] (ABDC,
2-aminobenzene-1,4-dicarboxylate). Desolvation of the MOF in two different
solvents leads to two polymorphic activated forms with very different pore
openings, markedly different gas-adsorption capacities and different CO2 versus
CH4 selectivities. Partial desolvation introduces a gating pressure associated
with CO2 adsorption, which shows that the framework can also undergo a
combination of stepped and continuous breathing.

Catalysis by high-valent metals such as titanium(IV) impacts our lives daily
through reactions like olefin polymerization. In any catalysis, optimization
involves a careful choice of not just the metal but also the ancillary ligands.
Because these choices dramatically impact the electronic structure of the system 
and, in turn, catalyst performance, new tools for catalyst development are
needed. Understanding ancillary ligand effects is arguably one of the most
critical aspects of catalyst optimization and, while parameters for phosphines
have been used for decades with low-valent systems, a comparable system does not 
exist for high-valent metals. A new electronic parameter for ligand donation,
derived from experiments on a high-valent chromium species, is now available.
Here, we show that the new parameters enable quantitative determination of
ancillary ligand effects on catalysis rate and, in some cases, even provide
mechanistic information. Analysing reactions in this way can be used to design
better catalyst architectures and paves the way for the use of such parameters in
a host of high-valent processes.

Difluoromethylated aromatic compounds are of increasing importance in
pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and materials. Chlorodifluoromethane (ClCF2H), an 
inexpensive, abundant and widely used industrial raw material, represents the
ideal and most straightforward difluoromethylating reagent, but introduction of
the difluoromethyl group (CF2H) from ClCF2H into aromatics has not been reported.
Here, we describe a direct palladium-catalysed difluoromethylation method for
coupling ClCF2H with arylboronic acids and esters to generate difluoromethylated 
arenes with high efficiency. The reaction exhibits a remarkably broad substrate
scope, including heteroarylboronic acids, and was used for difluoromethylation of
a range of pharmaceuticals and biologically active compounds. Preliminary
mechanistic studies revealed that a palladium difluorocarbene intermediate is
involved in the reaction. Although numerous metal-difluorocarbene complexes have 
been prepared, the catalytic synthesis of difluoromethylated or
difluoromethylenated compounds involving metal-difluorocarbene complexes has not 
received much attention. This new reaction therefore also opens the door to
understand metal-difluorocarbene complex catalysed reactions.

Chiral iminium ions-generated upon condensation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and 
amine catalysts-are used extensively by chemists to make chiral molecules in
enantioenriched form. In contrast, their potential to absorb light and promote
stereocontrolled photochemical processes remains unexplored. This is despite the 
fact that visible-light absorption by iminium ions is a naturally occurring event
that triggers the mechanism of vision in higher organisms. Herein we demonstrate 
that the direct excitation of chiral iminium ions can unlock unconventional
reaction pathways, enabling enantioselective catalytic photochemical
β-alkylations of enals that cannot be realized via thermal activation. The
chemistry uses readily available alkyl silanes, which are recalcitrant to
classical conjugate additions, and occurs under illumination by
visible-light-emitting diodes. Crucial to success was the design of a chiral
amine catalyst with well-tailored electronic properties that can generate a
photo-active iminium ion while providing the source of stereochemical induction. 
This strategy is expected to offer new opportunities for reaction design in the
field of enantioselective catalytic photochemistry.

The self-propagation of misfolded conformations of tau underlies
neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's. There is considerable interest
in discovering the minimal sequence and active conformational nucleus that
defines this self-propagating event. The microtubule-binding region, spanning
residues 244-372, reproduces much of the aggregation behaviour of tau in cells
and animal models. Further dissection of the amyloid-forming region to a
hexapeptide from the third microtubule-binding repeat resulted in a peptide that 
rapidly forms fibrils in vitro. We show that this peptide lacks the ability to
seed aggregation of tau244-372 in cells. However, as the hexapeptide is gradually
extended to 31 residues, the peptides aggregate more slowly and gain potent
activity to induce aggregation of tau244-372 in cells. X-ray fibre diffraction,
hydrogen-deuterium exchange and solid-state NMR studies map the beta-forming
region to a 25-residue sequence. Thus, the nucleus for self-propagating
aggregation of tau244-372 in cells is packaged in a remarkably small peptide.

Functional antibody delivery in living cells would enable the labelling and
manipulation of intracellular antigens, which constitutes a long-thought goal in 
cell biology and medicine. Here we present a modular strategy to create
functional cell-permeable nanobodies capable of targeted labelling and
manipulation of intracellular antigens in living cells. The cell-permeable
nanobodies are formed by the site-specific attachment of intracellularly stable
(or cleavable) cyclic arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptides to camelid-derived 
single-chain VHH antibody fragments. We used this strategy for the non-endocytic 
delivery of two recombinant nanobodies into living cells, which enabled the
relocalization of the polymerase clamp PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) 
and tumour suppressor p53 to the nucleolus, and thereby allowed the detection of 
protein-protein interactions that involve these two proteins in living cells.
Furthermore, cell-permeable nanobodies permitted the co-transport of
therapeutically relevant proteins, such as Mecp2, into the cells. This technology
constitutes a major step in the labelling, delivery and targeted manipulation of 
intracellular antigens. Ultimately, this approach opens the door towards
immunostaining in living cells and the expansion of immunotherapies to
intracellular antigen targets.

The field of Ni-catalysed cross-coupling has seen rapid recent growth because of 
the low cost of Ni, its earth abundance, and its ability to promote unique
cross-coupling reactions. Whereas advances in the related field of Pd-catalysed
cross-coupling have been driven by ligand design, the development of ligands
specifically for Ni has received minimal attention. Here, we disclose a class of 
phosphines that enable the Ni-catalysed Csp3 Suzuki coupling of acetals with
boronic acids to generate benzylic ethers, a reaction that failed with known
ligands for Ni and designer phosphines for Pd. Using parameters to quantify
phosphine steric and electronic properties together with regression statistical
analysis, we identify a model for ligand success. The study suggests that
effective phosphines feature remote steric hindrance, a concept that could guide 
future ligand design tailored to Ni. Our analysis also reveals that two classic
descriptors for ligand steric environment-cone angle and % buried volume-are not 
equivalent, despite their treatment in the literature.

In oxygenic photosynthesis, light harvesting is regulated to safely dissipate
excess energy and prevent the formation of harmful photoproducts. Regulation is
known to be necessary for fitness, but the molecular mechanisms are not
understood. One challenge has been that ensemble experiments average over active 
and dissipative behaviours, preventing identification of distinct states. Here,
we use single-molecule spectroscopy to uncover the photoprotective states and
dynamics of the light-harvesting complex stress-related 1 (LHCSR1) protein, which
is responsible for dissipation in green algae and moss. We discover the existence
of two dissipative states. We find that one of these states is activated by pH
and the other by carotenoid composition, and that distinct protein dynamics
regulate these states. Together, these two states enable the organism to respond 
to two types of intermittency in solar intensity-step changes (clouds and
shadows) and ramp changes (sunrise), respectively. Our findings reveal key
control mechanisms underlying photoprotective dissipation, with implications for 
increasing biomass yields and developing robust solar energy devices.

The conversion of oxygen-rich biomass into hydrocarbon fuels requires efficient
hydrodeoxygenation catalysts during the upgrading process. However, traditionally
prepared CoMoS2 catalysts, although efficient for hydrodesulfurization, are not
appropriate due to their poor activity, sulfur loss and rapid deactivation at
elevated temperature. Here, we report the synthesis of MoS2 monolayer sheets
decorated with isolated Co atoms that bond covalently to sulfur vacancies on the 
basal planes that, when compared with conventionally prepared samples, exhibit
superior activity, selectivity and stability for the hydrodeoxygenation of
4-methylphenol to toluene. This higher activity allows the reaction temperature
to be reduced from the typically used 300 °C to 180 °C and thus allows the
catalysis to proceed without sulfur loss and deactivation. Experimental analysis 
and density functional theory calculations reveal a large number of sites at the 
interface between the Co and Mo atoms on the MoS2 basal surface and we ascribe
the higher activity to the presence of sulfur vacancies that are created local to
the observed Co-S-Mo interfacial sites.

One of the major obstacles in intracellular targeting using antibodies is their
limited release from endosomes into the cytosol. Here we report an approach to
deliver proteins, which include antibodies, into cells by using endosomolytic
peptides derived from the cationic and membrane-lytic spider venom peptide
M-lycotoxin. The delivery peptides were developed by introducing one or two
glutamic acid residues into the hydrophobic face. One peptide with the
substitution of leucine by glutamic acid (L17E) was shown to enable a marked
cytosolic liberation of antibodies (immunoglobulins G (IgGs)) from endosomes. The
predominant membrane-perturbation mechanism of this peptide is the preferential
disruption of negatively charged membranes (endosomal membranes) over neutral
membranes (plasma membranes), and the endosomolytic peptide promotes the uptake
by inducing macropinocytosis. The fidelity of this approach was confirmed through
the intracellular delivery of a ribosome-inactivation protein (saporin), Cre
recombinase and IgG delivery, which resulted in a specific labelling of the
cytosolic proteins and subsequent suppression of the glucocorticoid
receptor-mediated transcription. We also demonstrate the L17E-mediated cytosolic 
delivery of exosome-encapsulated proteins.

Template-directed polymerization reactions enable the accurate storage and
processing of nature's biopolymer information. This mutualistic relationship of
nucleic acids and proteins, a network known as life's central dogma, is now
marvellously complex, and the progressive steps necessary for creating the
initial sequence and chain-length-specific polymer templates are lost to time.
Here we design and construct dynamic polymerization networks that exploit
metastable prion cross-β phases. Mixed-phase environments have been used for
constructing synthetic polymers, but these dynamic phases emerge naturally from
the growing peptide oligomers and create environments suitable both to nucleate
assembly and select for ordered templates. The resulting templates direct the
amplification of a phase containing only chain-length-specific peptide-like
oligomers. Such multi-phase biopolymer dynamics reveal pathways for the
emergence, self-selection and amplification of chain-length- and possibly
sequence-specific biopolymers.

Macromolecular architecture plays a pivotal role in determining the properties of
polymers. When designing polymers for specific applications, it is not only the
size of a macromolecule that must be considered, but also its shape. In most
cases, the topology of a polymer is a static feature that is inalterable once
synthesized. Using reversible-covalent chemistry to prompt the disconnection of
chemical bonds and the formation of new linkages in situ, we report polymers that
undergo dramatic topological transformations via a process we term macromolecular
metamorphosis. Utilizing this technique, a linear amphiphilic block copolymer or 
hyperbranched polymer undergoes 'metamorphosis' into comb, star and hydrophobic
block copolymer architectures. This approach was extended to include a
macroscopic gel which transitioned from a densely and covalently crosslinked
network to one with larger distances between the covalent crosslinks when heated.
These architectural transformations present an entirely new approach to 'smart'
materials.

Structural DNA nanotechnology finds applications in numerous areas, but the
construction of objects, 2D and 3D crystalline lattices and devices is prominent 
among them. Each of these components has been developed individually, and most of
them have been combined in pairs. However, to date there are no reports of
independent devices contained within 3D crystals. Here we report a three-state 3D
device whereby we change the colour of the crystals by diffusing strands that
contain dyes in or out of the crystals through the mother-liquor component of the
system. Each colouring strand is designed to pair with an extended triangle
strand by Watson-Crick base pairing. The arm that contains the dyes is quite
flexible, but it is possible to establish the presence of the duplex proximal to 
the triangle by X-ray crystallography. We modelled the transition between the red
and blue states through a simple kinetic model.

The protein-only infectious agents known as prions exist within cellular matrices
as populations of assembled polypeptide phases ranging from particles to amyloid 
fibres. These phases appear to undergo Darwinian-like selection and propagation, 
yet remarkably little is known about their accessible chemical and biological
functions. Here we construct simple peptides that assemble into well-defined
amyloid phases and define paracrystalline surfaces able to catalyse specific
enantioselective chemical reactions. Structural adjustments of individual amino
acid residues predictably control both the assembled crystalline order and their 
accessible catalytic repertoire. Notably, the density and proximity of the
extended arrays of enantioselective catalytic sites achieve template-directed
polymerization of new polymers. These diverse amyloid templates can now be
extended as dynamic self-propagating templates for the construction of even more 
complex functional materials.

Bipleiophylline is a highly complex monoterpene indole alkaloid composed of two
pleiocarpamine units anchored on an aromatic spacer platform. The synthesis of
bipleiophylline is considered as a mountain to climb by the organic chemistry
community. Here, a unified oxidative coupling protocol between indole derivatives
and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid, mediated by silver oxide, has been developed to
produce the core of bipleiophylline. This method also allows the independent
preparation of benzofuro[2,3-b]indolenine and isochromano[3,4-b]indolenine
scaffolds, depending only on the nature of the aromatic platform used. The
procedure has been applied to simple indole derivatives and to more challenging
monoterpene indole alkaloids, thereby furnishing natural-product-like structures.
The use of scarce pleiocarpamine as the starting indole allows the first
syntheses of bipleiophylline and of its biosynthetic precursor, voacalgine A. The
structure of the latter has been reassigned in the course of our investigations
by 2D NMR and displays an isochromano[3,4-b]indolenine motif instead of a
benzofuro[2,3-b]indolenine.

The preparation of well-defined nanoparticles based on soft matter, using
solution-processing techniques on a commercially viable scale, is a major
challenge of widespread importance. Self-assembly of block copolymers in solvents
that selectively solvate one of the segments provides a promising route to
core-corona nanoparticles (micelles) with a wide range of potential uses.
Nevertheless, significant limitations to this approach also exist. For example,
the solution processing of block copolymers generally follows a separate
synthesis step and is normally performed at high dilution. Moreover,
non-spherical micelles-which are promising for many applications-are generally
difficult to access, samples are polydisperse and precise dimensional control is 
not possible. Here we demonstrate the formation of platelet and cylindrical
micelles at concentrations up to 25% solids via a one-pot approach-starting from 
monomers-that combines polymerization-induced and crystallization-driven
self-assembly. We also show that performing the procedure in the presence of
small seed micelles allows the scalable formation of low dispersity samples of
cylindrical micelles of controlled length up to three micrometres.

Boron-containing molecules have been extensively used for the purposes of
chemical sensing, biological probe development and drug discovery. Due to boron's
empty p orbital, it can coordinate to heteroatoms such as oxygen and nitrogen.
This reversible covalent mode of interaction has led to the use of boron as bait 
for nucleophilic residues in disease-associated proteins, culminating in the
approval of new therapeutics that work by covalent mechanisms. Our analysis of a 
wide range of covalent inhibitors with electrophilic groups suggests that boron
is a unique electrophile in its chameleonic ability to engage protein targets.
Here we review boron's interactions with a range of protein side-chain residues
and reveal that boron's properties are nuanced and arise from its uncommon
coordination preferences. These mechanistic and structural insights should serve 
as a guide for the development of selective boron-based bioactive molecules.

Unveiling the nuclear motions of photoreceptor proteins in action is a crucial
goal in protein science in order to understand their elaborate mechanisms and how
they achieve optimal selectivity and efficiency. Previous studies have provided
detailed information on the structures of intermediates that appear during the
later stages (>ns) of such photoreception cycles, yet the initial events
immediately after photoabsorption remain unclear because of experimental
challenges in monitoring nuclear rearrangements on ultrafast timescales,
including protein-specific low-frequency motions. Using time-domain Raman probing
with sub-7-fs pulses, we obtain snapshot vibrational spectra of photoactive
yellow protein and a mutant with high sensitivity, providing insights into the
key responses that drive photoreception. Our data show a drastic intensity drop
of the excited-state marker band at 135 cm-1 within a few hundred femtoseconds,
suggesting a rapid weakening of the hydrogen bond that anchors the chromophore.
We also track formation of the first ground-state intermediate over the first few
picoseconds and fully characterize its vibrational structure, revealing a
substantially-twisted cis conformation.

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a fundamental spectroscopic technique for the
study of biological systems and materials, molecular imaging and the analysis of 
small molecules. It detects interactions at very low energies and is thus
non-invasive and applicable to a variety of targets, including animals and
humans. However, one of its most severe limitations is its low sensitivity, which
stems from the small interaction energies involved. Here, we report that dynamic 
nuclear polarization in liquid solution and at room temperature can enhance the
NMR signal of 13C nuclei by up to three orders of magnitude at magnetic fields of
∼3 T. The experiment can be repeated within seconds for signal averaging, without
interfering with the sample magnetic homogeneity. The method is therefore
compatible with the conditions required for high-resolution NMR. Enhancement of
13C signals on various organic compounds opens up new perspectives for dynamic
nuclear polarization as a general tool to increase the sensitivity of liquid NMR.

Alkali metal intercalation into polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) has been studied
intensely after reports of superconductivity in a number of potassium- and
rubidium-intercalated materials. There are, however, no reported crystal
structures to inform our understanding of the chemistry and physics because of
the complex reactivity of PAHs with strong reducing agents at high temperature.
Here we present the synthesis of crystalline K2Pentacene and K2Picene by a
solid-solid insertion protocol that uses potassium hydride as a redox-controlled 
reducing agent to access the PAH dianions, and so enables the determination of
their crystal structures. In both cases, the inserted cations expand the parent
herringbone packings by reorienting the molecular anions to create multiple
potassium sites within initially dense molecular layers, and thus interact with
the PAH anion π systems. The synthetic and crystal chemistry of alkali metal
intercalation into PAHs differs from that into fullerenes and graphite, in which 
the cation sites are pre-defined by the host structure.

Protein affinity reagents are widely used in basic research, diagnostics and
separations and for clinical applications, the most common of which are
antibodies. However, they often suffer from high cost, and difficulties in their 
development, production and storage. Here we show that a synthetic polymer
nanoparticle (NP) can be engineered to have many of the functions of a protein
affinity reagent. Polymer NPs with nM affinity to a key vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF165) inhibit binding of the signalling protein to its receptor
VEGFR-2, preventing receptor phosphorylation and downstream VEGF165-dependent
endothelial cell migration and invasion into the extracellular matrix. In
addition, the NPs inhibit VEGF-mediated new blood vessel formation in Matrigel
plugs in vivo. Importantly, the non-toxic NPs were not found to exhibit
off-target activity. These results support the assertion that synthetic polymers 
offer a new paradigm in the search for abiotic protein affinity reagents by
providing many of the functions of their protein counterparts.

C-H bonds are ubiquitous structural units of organic molecules. Although these
bonds are generally considered to be chemically inert, the recent emergence of
methods for C-H functionalization promises to transform the way synthetic
chemistry is performed. The intermolecular amination of C-H bonds represents a
particularly desirable and challenging transformation for which no efficient,
highly selective, and renewable catalysts exist. Here we report the directed
evolution of an iron-containing enzymatic catalyst-based on a cytochrome P450
monooxygenase-for the highly enantioselective intermolecular amination of
benzylic C-H bonds. The biocatalyst is capable of up to 1,300 turnovers, exhibits
excellent enantioselectivities, and provides access to valuable benzylic amines. 
Iron complexes are generally poor catalysts for C-H amination: in this catalyst, 
the enzyme's protein framework confers activity on an otherwise unreactive
iron-haem cofactor.

Ribosomally synthesized peptides are built out of L-amino acids, whereas D-amino 
acids are generally the hallmark of non-ribosomal synthetic processes. Here we
show that the model bacterium Bacillus subtilis is able to produce a novel type
of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide that
contains D-amino acids, and which we propose to call epipeptides. We demonstrate 
that a two [4Fe-4S]-cluster radical S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) enzyme converts
L-amino acids into their D-counterparts by catalysing Cα-hydrogen-atom
abstraction and using a critical cysteine residue as the hydrogen-atom donor.
Unexpectedly, these D-amino acid residues proved to be essential for the activity
of a peptide that induces the expression of LiaRS, a major component of the
bacterial cell envelope stress-response system. Present in B. subtilis and in
several members of the human microbiome, these epipeptides and radical SAM
epimerases broaden the landscape of peptidyl structures accessible to living
organisms.

Molecular solids with cooperative electronic properties based purely on π
electrons from carbon atoms offer a fertile ground in the search for exotic
states of matter, including unconventional superconductivity and quantum
magnetism. The field was ignited by reports of high-temperature superconductivity
in materials obtained by the reaction of alkali metals with polyaromatic
hydrocarbons, such as phenanthrene and picene, but the composition and structure 
of any compound in this family remained unknown. Here we isolate the binary
caesium salts of phenanthrene, Cs(C14H10) and Cs2(C14H10), to show that they are 
multiorbital strongly correlated Mott insulators. Whereas Cs2(C14H10) is
diamagnetic because of orbital polarization, Cs(C14H10) is a Heisenberg
antiferromagnet with a gapped spin-liquid state that emerges from the coupled
highly frustrated Δ-chain magnetic topology of the alternating-exchange spiral
tubes of S = ½ (C14H10)•- radical anions. The absence of long-range magnetic
order down to 1.8 K (T/J ≈ 0.02; J is the dominant exchange constant) renders the
compound an excellent candidate for a spin-½ quantum-spin liquid (QSL) that
arises purely from carbon π electrons.

The diverse structure and regulated deformation of lipid bilayer membranes are
among a cell's most fascinating features. Artificial membrane-bound vesicles,
known as liposomes, are versatile tools for modelling biological membranes and
delivering foreign objects to cells. To fully mimic the complexity of cell
membranes and optimize the efficiency of delivery vesicles, controlling liposome 
shape (both statically and dynamically) is of utmost importance. Here we report
the assembly, arrangement and remodelling of liposomes with designer geometry:
all of which are exquisitely controlled by a set of modular, reconfigurable DNA
nanocages. Tubular and toroid shapes, among others, are transcribed from DNA
cages to liposomes with high fidelity, giving rise to membrane curvatures present
in cells yet previously difficult to construct in vitro. Moreover, the
conformational changes of DNA cages drive membrane fusion and bending with
predictable outcomes, opening up opportunities for the systematic study of
membrane mechanics.

Arylmetals are highly valuable carbon nucleophiles that are readily and
inexpensively prepared from aryl halides or arenes and widely used on both
laboratory and industrial scales to react directly with a wide range of
electrophiles. Although C-C bond formation has been a staple of organic
synthesis, the direct transfer of primary amino (-NH2) and hydroxyl (-OH) groups 
to arylmetals in a scalable and environmentally friendly fashion remains a
formidable synthetic challenge because of the absence of suitable
heteroatom-transfer reagents. Here, we demonstrate the use of bench-stable N-H
and N-alkyl oxaziridines derived from readily available terpenoid scaffolds as
efficient multifunctional reagents for the direct primary amination and
hydroxylation of structurally diverse aryl- and heteroarylmetals. This practical 
and scalable method provides one-step synthetic access to primary anilines and
phenols at low temperature and avoids the use of transition-metal catalysts,
ligands and additives, nitrogen-protecting groups, excess reagents and harsh
workup conditions.

Catalysis observed in enzymatic processes and protein polymerizations often
relies on the use of supramolecular interactions and the organization of
functional elements in order to gain control over the spatial and temporal
elements of fundamental cellular processes. Harnessing these cooperative
interactions to catalyse reactions in synthetic systems, however, remains
challenging due to the difficulty in creating structurally controlled
macromolecules. Here, we report a polypeptide-based macromolecule with spatially 
organized α-helices that can catalyse its own formation. The system consists of a
linear polymeric scaffold containing a high density of initiating groups from
which polypeptides are grown, forming a brush polymer. The folding of polypeptide
side chains into α-helices dramatically enhances the polymerization rate due to
cooperative interactions of macrodipoles between neighbouring α-helices. The
parameters that affect the rate are elucidated by a two-stage kinetic model using
principles from nucleation-controlled protein polymerizations; the key difference
being the irreversible nature of this polymerization.

Photoionization is at the heart of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which 
gives access to important information on a sample's local chemical environment.
Local and non-local electronic decay after photoionization-in which the refilling
of core holes results in electron emission from either the initially ionized
species or a neighbour, respectively-have been well studied. However,
electron-transfer-mediated decay (ETMD), which involves the refilling of a core
hole by an electron from a neighbouring species, has not yet been observed in
condensed phase. Here we report the experimental observation of ETMD in an
aqueous LiCl solution by detecting characteristic secondary low-energy electrons 
using liquid-microjet soft XPS. Experimental results are interpreted using
molecular dynamics and high-level ab initio calculations. We show that both
solvent molecules and counterions participate in the ETMD processes, and
different ion associations have distinctive spectral fingerprints. Furthermore,
ETMD spectra are sensitive to coordination numbers, ion-solvent distances and
solvent arrangement.

Strong electron-donation from the axial thiolate ligand of cytochrome P450 has
been proposed to increase the reactivity of compound I with respect to C-H bond
activation. However, it has proven difficult to test this hypothesis, and a
direct link between reactivity and electron donation has yet to be established.
To make this connection, we have prepared a selenolate-ligated cytochrome P450
compound I intermediate. This isoelectronic perturbation allows for direct
comparisons with the wild-type enzyme. Selenium incorporation was achieved using 
a cysteine auxotrophic Escherichia coli strain. The intermediate was prepared
with meta-chloroperbenzoic acid and characterized by UV-visible, Mössbauer and
electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies. Measurements revealed increased
asymmetry around the ferryl moiety, consistent with increased electron donation
from the axial selenolate ligand. In line with this observation, we find that the
selenolate-ligated compound I cleaves C-H bonds more rapidly than the wild-type
intermediate.

Perturbations in cellular chloride concentrations can affect cellular pH and
autophagy and lead to the onset of apoptosis. With this in mind, synthetic ion
transporters have been used to disturb cellular ion homeostasis and thereby
induce cell death; however, it is not clear whether synthetic ion transporters
can also be used to disrupt autophagy. Here, we show that squaramide-based ion
transporters enhance the transport of chloride anions in liposomal models and
promote sodium chloride influx into the cytosol. Liposomal and cellular transport
activity of the squaramides is shown to correlate with cell death activity, which
is attributed to caspase-dependent apoptosis. One ion transporter was also shown 
to cause additional changes in lysosomal pH, which leads to impairment of
lysosomal enzyme activity and disruption of autophagic processes. This disruption
is independent of the initiation of apoptosis by the ion transporter. This study 
provides the first experimental evidence that synthetic ion transporters can
disrupt both autophagy and induce apoptosis.

Silver(i) chalcogenide/chalcogenolate clusters are promising photofunctional
materials for sensing, optoelectronics and solar energy harvesting applications. 
However, their instability and poor room-temperature luminescent quantum yields
have hampered more extensive study. Here, we graft such clusters to adaptable
bridging ligands, enabling their interconnection and the formation of rigid
metal-organic frameworks. By controlling the spatial separation and orientation
of the clusters, they then exhibit enhanced stability (over one year) and quantum
yield (12.1%). Ultrafast dual-function fluorescence switching (<1 s) is also
achieved, with turn-off triggered by O2 and multicoloured turn-on by volatile
organic compounds. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction of the inclusion materials,
obtained by single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation, enables precise
determination of the position of the small molecules within the framework,
elucidating the switching mechanism. The work enriches the cluster-based
metal-organic framework portfolio, bridges the gap between silver
chalcogenide/chalcogenolate clusters and metal-organic frameworks, and provides a
foundation for further development of functional silver-cluster-based materials.

Elementary steps in enantioselective heterogeneous catalysis take place on the
catalyst surface and the targeted synthesis of a desired enantiomer requires the 
implantation of chiral information at the surface, which can be achieved-for
example-by adsorbing chiral molecules. Studies of the structures of complexes
formed between adsorbed prochiral reagents and chiral molecules yield information
on the forces exerting stereocontrol, but further insight could be gained by
studying the dynamics of their interactions. Here, using time-lapsed scanning
tunnelling microscopy and density functional theory, we observe coupling between 
multiple stereochemical states within individual non-covalently bonded
chirality-transfer complexes on a metal surface. We identify two modes of
transformation between stereochemical states and find that the prochiral reagent 
can sample several complexation geometries during the lifetime of a complex,
switching between states of opposing prochirality in the process. These results
provide insight on the contribution of individual stereochemical states to the
overall enantioselectivity of reactions occurring on catalyst surfaces.

Axially chiral biaryls, as exemplified by 1,1'-bi-2-naphthol (BINOL), are key
components of catalysts, natural products and medicines. These materials are
synthesized conventionally in enantioenriched form through metal-mediated cross
coupling, de novo construction of an aromatic ring, point-to-axial chirality
transfer or an atropselective transformation of an existing biaryl. Here, we
report a highly enantioselective organocatalytic method for the synthesis of
atropisomeric biaryls by a cation-directed O-alkylation. Treatment of racemic
1-aryl-2-tetralones with a chiral quinidine-derived ammonium salt under basic
conditions in the presence of an alkylating agent leads to atropselective
O-alkylation with e.r. up to 98:2. Oxidation with DDQ gives access to
C2-symmetric and non-symmetric BINOL derivatives without compromising e.r. We
propose that the chiral ammonium counterion differentiates between rapidly
equilibrating atropisomeric enolates, leading to highly atropselective
O-alkylation. This dynamic kinetic resolution process offers a general approach
to the synthesis of enantioenriched atropisomeric materials.

Mono-iron hydrogenase was the third type of hydrogenase discovered. Its Lewis
acidic iron(II) centre promotes the heterolytic cleavage of the H-H bond and this
non-redox H2 activation distinguishes it from the well-studied dinuclear [FeFe]
and [NiFe] hydrogenases. Cleavage of the H-H bond is followed by hydride transfer
to the enzyme's organic substrate, H4MPT+, which serves as a CO2 'carrier' in
methanogenic pathways. Here we report a scaffold-based synthetic approach by
which to model mono-iron hydrogenase using an anthracene framework, which
supports a biomimetic fac-C,N,S coordination motif to an iron(II) centre. This
arrangement includes the biomimetic and organometallic Fe-C σ bond, which enables
bidirectional activity reminiscent of the native enzyme: the complex activates H2
under mild conditions, and catalyses C-H hydride abstraction plus H2 generation
from a model substrate. Notably, neither H2 activation nor C-H hydride
abstraction was observed in the analogous complex with a pincer-type mer-C,N,S
ligation, emphasizing the importance of the fac-C,N,S-iron(II) motif in promoting
enzyme-like reactivity.

Solid-state reactions are influenced by the spatial arrangement of the reactants 
and the electrostatic environment of the lattice, which may enable
lattice-directed chemical dynamics. Unlike the caging imposed by an inert matrix,
an active lattice participates in the reaction, however, little evidence of such 
lattice participation has been gathered on ultrafast timescales due to the
irreversibility of solid-state chemical systems. Here, by lowering the
temperature to 80 K, we have been able to study the dissociative photochemistry
of the triiodide anion (I3-) in single-crystal tetra-n-butylammonium triiodide
using broadband transient absorption spectroscopy. We identified the coherently
formed tetraiodide radical anion (I4•-) as a reaction intermediate. Its delayed
appearance after that of the primary photoproduct, diiodide radical I2•-,
indicates that I4•- was formed via a secondary reaction between a dissociated
iodine radical (I•) and an adjacent I3-. This chemistry occurs as a result of the
intermolecular interaction determined by the crystalline arrangement and is in
stark contrast with previous solution studies.

The expansion of molecular diversity beyond what nature can produce is a
fundamental objective in chemical sciences. Despite the rich chemistry of
boron-containing heterocycles, the 1,3-dioxa-5-aza-2,4,6-triborinane (DATB) ring 
system, which is characterized by a six-membered B3NO2 core, remains elusive.
Here, we report the synthesis of m-terphenyl-templated DATB derivatives,
displaying high stability and peculiar Lewis acidity arising from the three
suitably arranged boron atoms. We identify a particular utility for DATB in the
dehydrative amidation of carboxylic acids and amines, a reaction of high academic
and industrial importance. The three boron sites are proposed to engage in
substrate assembly, lowering the entropic cost of the transition state, in
contrast with the operative mechanism of previously reported catalysts and amide 
coupling reagents. The distinct mechanistic pathway dictated by the DATB core
will advance not only such amidations, but also other reactions driven by
multisite activation.

The capability to graft synthetic polymers onto the surfaces of live cells offers
the potential to manipulate and control their phenotype and underlying cellular
processes. Conventional grafting-to strategies for conjugating preformed polymers
to cell surfaces are limited by low polymer grafting efficiency. Here we report
an alternative grafting-from strategy for directly engineering the surfaces of
live yeast and mammalian cells through cell surface-initiated controlled radical 
polymerization. By developing cytocompatible PET-RAFT (photoinduced electron
transfer-reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization),
synthetic polymers with narrow polydispersity (Mw/Mn < 1.3) could be obtained at 
room temperature in 5 minutes. This polymerization strategy enables chain growth 
to be initiated directly from chain-transfer agents anchored on the surface of
live cells using either covalent attachment or non-covalent insertion, while
maintaining high cell viability. Compared with conventional grafting-to
approaches, these methods significantly improve the efficiency of grafting
polymer chains and enable the active manipulation of cellular phenotypes.

Building small-molecule libraries with structural and stereogenic diversity plays
an important role in drug discovery. The development of switchable intermolecular
cycloaddition reactions from identical substrates in different regioselective
fashions would provide an attractive protocol. However, this also represents a
challenge in organic chemistry, because it is difficult to control
regioselectivity to afford the products exclusively and at the same time achieve 
high levels of stereoselectivity. Here, we report the diversified cycloadditions 
of α'-alkylidene-2-cyclopentenones catalysed by cinchona-derived primary amines. 
An asymmetric γ,β'-regioselective intermolecular [6+2] cycloaddition reaction
with 3-olefinic (7-aza)oxindoles is realized through the in situ generation of
formal 4-aminofulvenes, while a different β,γ-regioselective [2+2] cycloaddition 
reaction with maleimides to access fused cyclobutanes is disclosed. In contrast, 
an intriguing α,γ-regioselective [4+2] cycloaddition reaction is uncovered with
the same set of substrates, by employing an unprecedented dual small-molecule
catalysis of amines and thiols. All of the cycloaddition reactions exhibit
excellent regio- and stereoselectivity, producing a broad spectrum of chiral
architectures with high structural diversity and molecular complexity.

Dynamic protein-rich intracellular structures that contain phase-separated
intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) composed of sequences of low complexity 
(SLC) have been shown to serve a variety of important cellular functions, which
include signalling, compartmentalization and stabilization. However, our
understanding of these structures and our ability to synthesize models of them
have been limited. We present design rules for IDPs possessing SLCs that phase
separate into diverse assemblies within droplet microenvironments. Using
theoretical analyses, we interpret the phase behaviour of archetypal IDP
sequences and demonstrate the rational design of a vast library of multicomponent
protein-rich structures that ranges from uniform nano-, meso- and microscale
puncta (distinct protein droplets) to multilayered orthogonally phase-separated
granular structures. The ability to predict and program IDP-rich assemblies in
this fashion offers new insights into (1) genetic-to-molecular-to-macroscale
relationships that encode hierarchical IDP assemblies, (2) design rules of such
assemblies in cell biology and (3) molecular-level engineering of self-assembled 
recombinant IDP-rich materials.

The fabrication of crystalline 2D conjugated polymers with well-defined repeating
units and in-built porosity presents a significant challenge to synthetic
chemists. Yet they present an appealing target because of their desirable
physical and electronic properties. Here we report the preparation of a 2D
conjugated aromatic polymer synthesized via C-C coupling reactions between
tetrabromopolyaromatic monomers. Pre-arranged monomers in the bulk crystal
undergo C-C coupling driven by endogenous solid-state polymerization to produce a
crystalline polymer, which can be mechanically exfoliated into micrometre-sized
lamellar sheets with a thickness of 1 nm. Isothermal gas-sorption measurements of
the bulk material reveal a dominant pore size of ~0.6 nm, which indicates uniform
open channels from the eclipsed stacking of the sheets. When employed as an
organic anode in an ambient-temperature sodium cell, the material allows a fast
charge/discharge of sodium ions, with impressive reversible capacity, rate
capability and stability metrics.

Reactions of hexadehydro-Diels-Alder benzynes with structurally complex

An important question in organic chemistry concerns the extent to which
benzynes-one of the classical reactive intermediates in organic chemistry-can
react in discriminating fashion with trapping reagents. In particular, whether
these species can react selectively with substrates containing multiple
functional groups and possible sites of reactivity has remained unanswered.
Natural products comprise a palette of multifunctional compounds with which to
address this question. Here, we show that benzynes produced by the
hexadehydro-Diels-Alder (HDDA) reaction react with many secondary metabolites
with a preference for one among several pathways. Examples demonstrating such
selectivity include reactions with: phenolics, through dearomatizing
ortho-substitution; alkaloids, through Hofmann-type elimination; tropolone and
furan, through cycloaddition; and alkaloids, through three-component
fragmentation-coupling reactions. We also demonstrate that the cinchona alkaloids
quinidine and quinine give rise to products (some in as few as three steps) that 
enable subsequent and rapid access to structurally diverse polyheterocyclic
compounds. The results show that benzynes are quite discriminating in their
reactivity-a trait perhaps not broadly enough appreciated.

First-row, earth-abundant metals offer an inexpensive and sustainable alternative
to precious-metal catalysts. As such, iron and cobalt catalysts have garnered
interest as replacements for alkene and alkyne hydrofunctionalization reactions. 
However, these have required the use of air- and moisture-sensitive catalysts and
reagents, limiting both adoption by the non-expert as well as applicability,
particularly in industrial settings. Here, we report a simple method for the use 
of earth-abundant metal catalysts by general activation with sodium
tert-butoxide. Using only robust air- and moisture-stable reagents and
pre-catalysts, both known and, significantly, novel catalytic activities have
been successfully achieved, covering hydrosilylation, hydroboration,
hydrovinylation, hydrogenation and [2π+2π] alkene cycloaddition. This activation 
method allows for the easy use of earth-abundant metals, including iron, cobalt, 
nickel and manganese, and represents a generic platform for the discovery and
application of non-precious metal catalysis.

Our knowledge of actinide chemical bonds lags far behind our understanding of the
bonding regimes of any other series of elements. This is a major issue given the 
technological as well as fundamental importance of f-block elements. Some key
chemical differences between actinides and lanthanides-and between different
actinides-can be ascribed to minor differences in covalency, that is, the degree 
to which electrons are shared between the f-block element and coordinated
ligands. Yet there are almost no direct measures of such covalency for actinides.
Here we report the first pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of
actinide compounds. We apply the hyperfine sublevel correlation technique to
quantify the electron-spin density at ligand nuclei (via the weak hyperfine
interactions) in molecular thorium(III) and uranium(III) species and therefore
the extent of covalency. Such information will be important in developing our
understanding of the chemical bonding, and therefore the reactivity, of
actinides.

Fluorinated organic compounds are becoming increasingly important in
pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and materials science. The introduction of
trifluoromethoxy groups into new drugs and agrochemicals has attracted much
attention due to their strongly electron-withdrawing nature and high
lipophilicity. However, synthesis of trifluoromethoxylated organic molecules is
difficult owing to the decomposition of trifluoromethoxide anion and β-fluoride
elimination from transition-metal-trifluoromethoxide complexes, and no catalytic 
enantioselective trifluoromethoxylation reaction has been reported until now.
Here, we present an example of an asymmetric silver-catalysed intermolecular
bromotrifluoromethoxylation of alkenes with trifluoromethyl arylsulfonate (TFMS) 
as a new trifluoromethoxylation reagent. Compared to other trifluoromethoxylation
reagents, TFMS is easily prepared and thermally stable with good reactivity. In
addition, this reaction is operationally simple, scalable and proceeds under mild
reaction conditions. Furthermore, broad scope and good functional group
compatibility has been demonstrated by application of the method to the
bromotrifluoromethoxylation of double bonds in natural products and natural
product derivatives.

The majority of biomolecules are intrinsically atomically precise, an important
characteristic that enables rational engineering of their recognition and binding
properties. However, imparting a similar precision to hybrid nanoparticles has
been challenging because of the inherent limitations of existing chemical methods
and building blocks. Here we report a new approach to form atomically precise and
highly tunable hybrid nanomolecules with well-defined three-dimensionality.
Perfunctionalization of atomically precise clusters with
pentafluoroaryl-terminated linkers produces size-tunable rigid cluster
nanomolecules. These species are amenable to facile modification with a variety
of thiol-containing molecules and macromolecules. Assembly proceeds at room
temperature within hours under mild conditions, and the resulting nanomolecules
exhibit high stabilities because of their full covalency. We further demonstrate 
how these nanomolecules grafted with saccharides can exhibit dramatically
improved binding affinity towards a protein. Ultimately, the developed strategy
allows the rapid generation of precise molecular assemblies to investigate
multivalent interactions.

Transmission and amplification of chemical signals across lipid bilayer membranes
is of profound significance in many biological processes, from the development of
multicellular organisms to information processing in the nervous system. In
biology, membrane-spanning proteins are responsible for the transmission of
chemical signals across membranes, and signal transduction is often associated
with an amplified signalling cascade. The ability to reproduce such processes in 
artificial systems has potential applications in sensing, controlled drug
delivery and communication between compartments in tissue-like constructs of
synthetic vesicles. Here we describe a mechanism for transmitting a chemical
signal across a membrane based on the controlled translocation of a synthetic
molecular transducer from one side of a lipid bilayer membrane to the other. The 
controlled molecular motion has been coupled to the activation of a catalyst on
the inside of a vesicle, which leads to a signal-amplification process analogous 
to the biological counterpart.

Although carbon dioxide (CO2) is highly abundant, its low reactivity has limited 
its use in chemical synthesis. In particular, methods for carbon-carbon bond
formation generally rely on two-electron mechanisms for CO2 activation and
require highly activated reaction partners. Alternatively, radical pathways
accessed via photoredox catalysis could provide new reactivity under milder
conditions. Here we demonstrate the direct coupling of CO2 and amines via the
single-electron reduction of CO2 for the photoredox-catalysed continuous flow
synthesis of α-amino acids. By leveraging the advantages of utilizing gases and
photochemistry in flow, a commercially available organic photoredox catalyst
effects the selective α-carboxylation of amines that bear various functional
groups and heterocycles. The preliminary mechanistic studies support CO2
activation and carbon-carbon bond formation via single-electron pathways, and we 
expect that this strategy will inspire new perspectives on using this feedstock

Molecular self-assembly under kinetic control is expected to yield nanostructures
that are inaccessible through the spontaneous thermodynamic process. Moreover,
time-dependent evolution, which is reminiscent of biomolecular systems, may occur
under such out-of-equilibrium conditions, allowing the synthesis of
supramolecular assemblies with enhanced complexities. Here we report on the
capacity of a metastable porphyrin supramolecular assembly to differentiate into 
nanofibre and nanosheet structures. Mechanistic studies of the relationship
between the molecular design and pathway complexity in the self-assembly unveiled
the energy landscape that governs the unique kinetic behaviour. Based on this
understanding, we could control the differentiation phenomena and achieve both
one- and two-dimensional living supramolecular polymerization using an identical 
monomer. Furthermore, we found that the obtained nanostructures are
electronically distinct, which illustrates the pathway-dependent material
properties.

Two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks often π stack into crystalline solids
that allow precise spatial positioning of molecular building blocks. Inspired by 
the hydrogen-bonded G-quadruplexes found frequently in guanine-rich DNA, here we 
show that this structural motif can be exploited to guide the self-assembly of
naphthalene diimide and perylene diimide electron acceptors end-capped with two
guanine electron donors into crystalline G-quadruplex-based organic frameworks,
wherein the electron donors and acceptors form ordered, segregated π-stacked
arrays. Time-resolved optical and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies 
show that photogenerated holes and electrons in the frameworks have long
lifetimes and display recombination kinetics typical of dissociated charge
carriers. Moreover, the reduced acceptors form polarons in which the electron is 
shared over several molecules. The G-quadruplex frameworks also demonstrate
potential as cathode materials in Li-ion batteries because of the favourable
electron- and Li-ion-transporting capacity provided by the ordered rylene diimide
arrays and G-quadruplex structures, respectively.

Cycloadditions that involve more than six π electrons are termed higher-order
cycloadditions and are an excellent tool for solving complex synthetic
challenges, as they provide direct access to polycyclic scaffolds that contain
medium-sized rings. They have interesting synthetic potential for the discovery
of new bioactive molecules and in natural product synthesis. It is peculiar that 
stereocontrolled [8+2] and [6+4] cycloadditions have been largely neglected for
the past 50 years. Here we demonstrate a cross-dienamine activation of
2-cyclopentenone and the unprecedented endocyclic linear-dienamine activation of 
2-cyclohexenones and 2-cycloheptenones. These dienamine intermediates undergo
aminocatalytic stereoselective [8+2], [6+4] and formal [4+2] cycloadditions with 
various heptafulvenes. The periselectivities of the cycloadditions are controlled
based on the ring size of the 2-cycloalkenones and the substitution patterns of
the heptafulvenes. The chiral products obtained undergo various chemical and
photochemical single-step transformations that give access to other classes of
all-carbon polycyclic scaffolds.

Helium is generally understood to be chemically inert and this is due to its
extremely stable closed-shell electronic configuration, zero electron affinity
and an unsurpassed ionization potential. It is not known to form
thermodynamically stable compounds, except a few inclusion compounds. Here, using
the ab initio evolutionary algorithm USPEX and subsequent high-pressure synthesis
in a diamond anvil cell, we report the discovery of a thermodynamically stable
compound of helium and sodium, Na2He, which has a fluorite-type structure and is 
stable at pressures >113 GPa. We show that the presence of He atoms causes strong
electron localization and makes this material insulating. This phase is an
electride, with electron pairs localized in interstices, forming eight-centre
two-electron bonds within empty Na8 cubes. We also predict the existence of
Na2HeO with a similar structure at pressures above 15 GPa.

Genetic circuits and reaction cascades are of great importance for synthetic
biology, biochemistry and bioengineering. An open question is how to maximize the
modularity of their design to enable the integration of different reaction
networks and to optimize their scalability and flexibility. One option is
encapsulation within liposomes, which enables chemical reactions to proceed in
well-isolated environments. Here we adapt liposome encapsulation to enable the
modular, controlled compartmentalization of genetic circuits and cascades. We
demonstrate that it is possible to engineer genetic circuit-containing synthetic 
minimal cells (synells) to contain multiple-part genetic cascades, and that these
cascades can be controlled by external signals as well as inter-liposomal
communication without crosstalk. We also show that liposomes that contain
different cascades can be fused in a controlled way so that the products of
incompatible reactions can be brought together. Synells thus enable a more
modular creation of synthetic biology cascades, an essential step towards their
ultimate programmability.

Self-propelled catalytic micro- and nanomotors have been the subject of intense
study over the past few years, but it remains a continuing challenge to build in 
an effective speed-regulation mechanism. Movement of these motors is generally
fully dependent on the concentration of accessible fuel, with propulsive movement
only ceasing when the fuel consumption is complete. Here we report a
demonstration of control over the movement of self-assembled stomatocyte
nanomotors via a molecularly built, stimulus-responsive regulatory mechanism. A
temperature-sensitive polymer brush is chemically grown onto the nanomotor,
whereby the opening of the stomatocytes is enlarged or narrowed on temperature
change, which thus controls the access of hydrogen peroxide fuel and, in turn,
regulates movement. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first
nanosized chemically driven motor for which motion can be reversibly controlled
by a thermally responsive valve/brake. We envision that such artificial
responsive nanosystems could have potential applications in controllable cargo
transportation.

The fabrication of monodisperse transmembrane barrels formed from short synthetic
peptides has not been demonstrated previously. This is in part because of the
complexity of the interactions between peptides and lipids within the hydrophobic
environment of a membrane. Here we report the formation of a transmembrane pore
through the self-assembly of 35 amino acid α-helical peptides. The design of the 
peptides is based on the C-terminal D4 domain of the Escherichia coli
polysaccharide transporter Wza. By using single-channel current recording, we
define discrete assembly intermediates and show that the pore is most probably a 
helix barrel that contains eight D4 peptides arranged in parallel. We also show
that the peptide pore is functional and capable of conducting ions and binding
blockers. Such α-helix barrels engineered from peptides could find applications
in nanopore technologies such as single-molecule sensing and nucleic-acid
sequencing.

Understanding how materials that catalyse the oxygen evolution reaction (OER)
function is essential for the development of efficient energy-storage
technologies. The traditional understanding of the OER mechanism on metal oxides 
involves four concerted proton-electron transfer steps on metal-ion centres at
their surface and product oxygen molecules derived from water. Here, using in
situ 18O isotope labelling mass spectrometry, we provide direct experimental
evidence that the O2 generated during the OER on some highly active oxides can
come from lattice oxygen. The oxides capable of lattice-oxygen oxidation also
exhibit pH-dependent OER activity on the reversible hydrogen electrode scale,
indicating non-concerted proton-electron transfers in the OER mechanism. Based on
our experimental data and density functional theory calculations, we discuss
mechanisms that are fundamentally different from the conventional scheme and show
that increasing the covalency of metal-oxygen bonds is critical to trigger
lattice-oxygen oxidation and enable non-concerted proton-electron transfers
during OER.

Cation-π interactions drive the self-assembly and cohesion of many biological
molecules, including the adhesion proteins of several marine organisms. Although 
the origin of cation-π bonds in isolated pairs has been extensively studied, the 
energetics of cation-π-driven self-assembly in molecular films remains uncharted.
Here we use nanoscale force measurements in combination with solid-state NMR
spectroscopy to show that the cohesive properties of simple aromatic- and
lysine-rich peptides rival those of the strong reversible intermolecular cohesion
exhibited by adhesion proteins of marine mussel. In particular, we show that
peptides incorporating the amino acid phenylalanine, a functional group that is
conspicuously sparing in the sequences of mussel proteins, exhibit reversible
adhesion interactions significantly exceeding that of analogous mussel-mimetic
peptides. More broadly, we demonstrate that interfacial confinement fundamentally
alters the energetics of cation-π-mediated assembly: an insight that should prove
relevant for diverse areas, which range from rationalizing biological assembly to
engineering peptide-based biomaterials.

Self-assembling cyclic protein homo-oligomers play important roles in biology,
and the ability to generate custom homo-oligomeric structures could enable new
approaches to probe biological function. Here we report a general approach to
design cyclic homo-oligomers that employs a new residue-pair-transform method to 
assess the designability of a protein-protein interface. This method is
sufficiently rapid to enable the systematic enumeration of cyclically docked
arrangements of a monomer followed by sequence design of the newly formed
interfaces. We use this method to design interfaces onto idealized repeat
proteins that direct their assembly into complexes that possess cyclic symmetry. 
Of 96 designs that were characterized experimentally, 21 were found to form
stable monodisperse homo-oligomers in solution, and 15 (four homodimers, six
homotrimers, six homotetramers and one homopentamer) had solution small-angle
X-ray scattering data consistent with the design models. X-ray crystal structures
were obtained for five of the designs and each is very close to their
corresponding computational model.

Dispersing graphite in water to obtain true (single-layer) graphene in bulk
quantity in a liquid has been an unreachable goal for materials scientists in the
past decade. Similarly, a diagnostic tool to identify solubilized graphene in
situ has been long awaited. Here we show that homogeneous stable dispersions of
single-layer graphene (SLG) in water can be obtained by mixing graphenide
(negatively charged graphene) solutions in tetrahydrofuran with degassed water
and evaporating the organic solvent. In situ Raman spectroscopy of these aqueous 
dispersions shows all the expected characteristics of SLG. Transmission electron 
and atomic force microscopies on deposits confirm the single-layer character. The
resulting additive-free stable water dispersions contain 400 m2 l-1 of developed 
graphene surface. Films prepared from these dispersions exhibit a conductivity of
up to 32 kS m-1.

Many hypotheses concerning the nature of early life assume that genetic
information was once transferred through the template-directed synthesis of RNA, 
before the emergence of coded enzymes. However, attempts to demonstrate
enzyme-free, template-directed synthesis of nucleic acids have been limited by
'strand inhibition', whereby transferring information from a template strand in
the presence of its complementary strand is inhibited by the stability of the
template duplex. Here, we use solvent viscosity to circumvent strand inhibition, 
demonstrating information transfer from a gene-length template (>300 nt) within a
longer (545 bp or 3 kb) duplex. These results suggest that viscous environments
on the prebiotic Earth, generated periodically by water evaporation, could have
facilitated nucleic acid replication-particularly of long, structured sequences
such as ribozymes. Our approach works with DNA and RNA, suggesting that
viscosity-mediated replication is possible for a range of genetic polymers,
perhaps even for informational polymers that may have preceded RNA.

Previous research has identified ribose aminooxazoline as a potential
intermediate in the prebiotic synthesis of the pyrimidine nucleotides with
remarkable properties. It crystallizes spontaneously from reaction mixtures, with
an enhanced enantiomeric excess if initially enantioenriched, which suggests that
reservoirs of this compound might have accumulated on the early Earth in an
optically pure form. Ribose aminooxazoline can be converted efficiently into
α-ribocytidine by way of 2,2'-anhydroribocytidine, although anomerization to
β-ribocytidine by ultraviolet irradiation is extremely inefficient. Our previous 
work demonstrated the synthesis of pyrimidine β-ribonucleotides, but at the cost 
of ignoring ribose aminooxazoline, using arabinose aminooxazoline instead. Here
we describe a long-sought route through ribose aminooxazoline to the pyrimidine
β-ribonucleosides and their phosphate derivatives that involves an
extraordinarily efficient photoanomerization of α-2-thioribocytidine. In addition
to the canonical nucleosides, our synthesis accesses β-2-thioribouridine, a
modified nucleoside found in transfer RNA that enables both faster and
more-accurate nucleic acid template-copying chemistry.

The direct and selective functionalization of C-H bonds of arenes is one of the
most challenging yet valuable aims in organic synthesis. Despite notable recent
achievements, a pre-installed directing group proved to be essential in most of
the methodologies reported so far. In this context, the use of a transient
directing group that can be generated in situ has attracted attention and
demonstrated the great potential of this strategy. Here we report the use of an
in situ generated palladacycle to accomplish remote-selective C-H alkylation
reactions of arenes. Following the C-H functionalization event, the alkylated
aryl ring undergoes a formal migration to provide diversely substituted
benzofuran and indole scaffolds. Computational studies revealed that a
palladium(IV) intermediate is not involved in the alkylation step. The aryl
migration was found to proceed through a sequential C-C bond cleavage, insertion 
and β-hydride-elimination process. The increasing steric bulk that builds up
during the C-H functionalization step drives the unusual C-C bond cleavage in a
non-strained system.

Heterocyclic architectures offer powerful creative possibilities to a range of
chemistry end-users. This is particularly true of heterocycles containing a high 
proportion of sp3-carbon atoms, which confer precise spatial definition upon
chemical probes, drug substances, chiral monomers and the like. Nonetheless,
simple catalytic routes to new heterocyclic cores are infrequently reported, and 
methods making use of biomass-accessible starting materials are also rare. Here, 
we demonstrate a new method allowing rapid entry to spirocyclic bis-heterocycles,
in which inexpensive iron(III) catalysts mediate a highly stereoselective C-C
bond-forming cyclization cascade reaction using (2-halo)aryl ethers and amines
constructed using feedstock chemicals readily available from plant sources.
Fe(acac)3 mediates the deiodinative cyclization of (2-halo)aryloxy furfuranyl
ethers, followed by capture of the intermediate metal species by Grignard
reagents, to deliver spirocycles containing two asymmetric centres. The reactions
offer potential entry to key structural motifs present in bioactive natural
products.

Phosphoenol pyruvate is the highest-energy phosphate found in living organisms
and is one of the most versatile molecules in metabolism. Consequently, it is an 
essential intermediate in a wide variety of biochemical pathways, including
carbon fixation, the shikimate pathway, substrate-level phosphorylation,
gluconeogenesis and glycolysis. Triose glycolysis (generation of ATP from
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate via phosphoenol pyruvate) is among the most central
and highly conserved pathways in metabolism. Here, we demonstrate the efficient
and robust synthesis of phosphoenol pyruvate from prebiotic nucleotide
precursors, glycolaldehyde and glyceraldehyde. Furthermore, phosphoenol pyruvate 
is derived within an α-phosphorylation controlled reaction network that gives
access to glyceric acid 2-phosphate, glyceric acid 3-phosphate, phosphoserine and
pyruvate. Our results demonstrate that the key components of a core metabolic
pathway central to energy transduction and amino acid, sugar, nucleotide and
lipid biosyntheses can be reconstituted in high yield under mild, prebiotically
plausible conditions.

Uncultivated bacteria represent a massive resource of new enzymes and bioactive
metabolites, but such bacteria remain functionally enigmatic. Polytheonamides are
potent peptide cytotoxins produced by uncultivated bacteria that exist as
symbionts in a marine sponge. Outside glycobiology, polytheonamides represent the
most heavily post-translationally modified biomolecules that are derived from
amino acids. The biosynthesis of polytheonamides involves up to 50 site-specific 
modifications to create a membrane-spanning β-helical structure. Here, we provide
functional evidence that only seven enzymes are necessary for this process. They 
iteratively catalyse epimerization, methylation and hydroxylation of diverse
amino acids. To reconstitute C-methylation, we employed the rarely used
heterologous host Rhizobium leguminosarum to invoke the activities of two
cobalamin-dependent C-methyltransferases. We observed 44 of the modifications to 
systematically unravel the biosynthesis of one of the most densely modified and
metabolically obscure ribosome-derived molecules found in nature.

Nucleophilic addition reactions of organometallic reagents to carbonyl compounds 
for carbon-carbon bond construction have played a pivotal role in modern
chemistry. However, this reaction's reliance on petroleum-derived chemical
feedstocks and a stoichiometric quantity of metal have prompted the development
of many carbanion equivalents and catalytic metal alternatives. Here, we show
that naturally occurring carbonyls can be used as latent alkyl carbanion
equivalents for additions to carbonyl compounds, via reductive polarity reversal.
Such 'umpolung' reactivity is facilitated by a ruthenium catalyst and diphosphine
ligand under mild conditions, delivering synthetically valuable secondary and
tertiary alcohols in up to 98% yield. The unique chemoselectivity exhibited by
carbonyl-derived carbanion equivalents is demonstrated by their tolerance to
protic reaction media and good functional group compatibility. Enantioenriched
tertiary alcohols can also be accessed with the aid of chiral ligands, albeit
with moderate stereocontrol. Such carbonyl-derived carbanion equivalents are
anticipated to find broad utility in chemical bond formation.

The emergence of functional interactions between nucleic acids and polypeptides
was a key transition in the origin of life and remains at the heart of all
biology. However, how and why simple non-coded peptides could have become
critical for RNA function is unclear. Here, we show that putative ancient peptide
segments from the cores of both ribosomal subunits enhance RNA polymerase
ribozyme (RPR) function, as do derived homopolymeric peptides comprising lysine
or the non-proteinogenic lysine analogues ornithine or, to a lesser extent,
diaminobutyric acid, irrespective of chirality or chiral purity. Lysine
decapeptides enhance RPR function by promoting holoenzyme assembly through
primer-template docking, accelerate RPR evolution, and allow RPR-catalysed RNA
synthesis at near physiological (≥1 mM) Mg2+ concentrations, enabling templated
RNA synthesis within membranous protocells. Our results outline how
compositionally simple, mixed-chirality peptides may have augmented the
functional potential of early RNAs and promoted the emergence of the first
protocells.

The absorption of a photon usually creates a singlet exciton (S1) in molecular
systems, but in some cases S1 may split into two triplets (2×T1) in a process
called singlet fission. Singlet fission is believed to proceed through the
correlated triplet-pair 1(TT) state. Here, we probe the 1(TT) state in
crystalline hexacene using time-resolved photoemission and transient absorption
spectroscopies. We find a distinctive 1(TT) state, which decays to 2×T1 with a
time constant of 270 fs. However, the decay of S1 and the formation of 1(TT)
occur on different timescales of 180 fs and <50 fs, respectively. Theoretical
analysis suggests that, in addition to an incoherent S1→1(TT) rate process
responsible for the 180 fs timescale, S1 may couple coherently to a vibronically 
excited 1(TT) on ultrafast timescales (<50 fs). The coexistence of coherent and
incoherent singlet fission may also reconcile different experimental observations
in other acenes.

How molecules in solution form crystal nuclei, which then grow into large
crystals, is a poorly understood phenomenon. The classical mechanism of
homogeneous crystal nucleation proceeds via the spontaneous random aggregation of
species from liquid or solution. However, a non-classical mechanism suggests the 
formation of an amorphous dense phase that reorders to form stable crystal
nuclei. So far it has remained an experimental challenge to observe the formation
of crystal nuclei from five to thirty molecules. Here, using polyoxometallates,
we show that the formation of small crystal nuclei is observable by cryogenic
transmission electron microscopy. We observe both classical and non-classical
nucleation processes, depending on the identity of the cation present. The
experiments verify theoretical studies that suggest non-classical nucleation is
the lower of the two energy pathways. The arrangement in just a seven-molecule
proto-crystal matches the order found by X-ray diffraction of a single bulk
crystal, which demonstrates that the same structure was formed in each case.

The production of natural product compound libraries has been observed in nature 
for different organisms such as bacteria, fungi and plants; however, little is
known about the mechanisms generating such chemically diverse libraries. Here we 
report mechanisms leading to the biosynthesis of the chemically diverse
rhabdopeptide/xenortide peptides (RXPs). They are exclusively present in
entomopathogenic bacteria of the genera Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus that live in
symbiosis with nematodes delivering them to insect prey, which is killed and
utilized for nutrition by both nematodes and bacteria. Chemical diversity of the 
biologically active RXPs results from a combination of iterative and flexible use
of monomodular nonribosomal peptide synthetases including substrate promiscuity, 
enzyme cross-talk and enzyme stoichiometry as shown by in vivo and in vitro
experiments. Together, this highlights several of nature's methods for
diversification, or evolution, of natural products and sheds light on the
biosynthesis of the bioactive RXPs.

Translating the precise monomer sequence control achieved in nature over
macromolecular structure (for example, DNA) to whole synthetic systems has been
limited due to the lack of efficient synthetic methodologies. So far, chemists
have only been able to synthesize monomer sequence-controlled macromolecules by
means of complex, time-consuming and iterative chemical strategies such as
solid-state Merrifield-type approaches or molecularly dissolved solution-phase
systems. Here, we report a rapid and quantitative synthesis of
sequence-controlled multiblock polymers in discrete stable nanoscale compartments
via an emulsion polymerization approach in which a vinyl-terminated macromolecule
is used as an efficient chain-transfer agent. This approach is environmentally
friendly, fully translatable to industry and thus represents a significant
advance in the development of complex macromolecule synthesis, where a high level
of molecular precision or monomer sequence control confers potential for
molecular targeting, recognition and biocatalysis, as well as molecular
information storage.

The optimization of supported metal catalysts predominantly focuses on
engineering the metal site, for which physical insights based on extensive
theoretical and experimental contributions have enabled the rational design of
active sites. Although it is well known that supports can influence the catalytic
properties of metals, insights into how metal-support interactions can be
exploited to optimize metal active-site properties are lacking. Here we utilize
in situ spectroscopy and microscopy to identify and characterize a support effect
in oxide-supported heterogeneous Rh catalysts. This effect is characterized by
strongly bound adsorbates (HCOx) on reducible oxide supports (TiO2 and Nb2O5)
that induce oxygen-vacancy formation in the support and cause HCOx-functionalized
encapsulation of Rh nanoparticles by the support. The encapsulation layer is
permeable to reactants, stable under the reaction conditions and strongly
influences the catalytic properties of Rh, which enables rational and dynamic
tuning of CO2-reduction selectivity.

Engineering bioelectronic components and set-ups that mimic natural systems is
extremely challenging. Here we report the design of a protein-only redox film
inspired by the architecture of bacterial electroactive biofilms. The nanowire
scaffold is formed using a chimeric protein that results from the attachment of a
prion domain to a rubredoxin (Rd) that acts as an electron carrier. The prion
domain self-assembles into stable fibres and provides a suitable arrangement of
redox metal centres in Rd to permit electron transport. This results in highly
organized films, able to transport electrons over several micrometres through a
network of bionanowires. We demonstrate that our bionanowires can be used as
electron-transfer mediators to build a bioelectrode for the electrocatalytic
oxygen reduction by laccase. This approach opens opportunities for the
engineering of protein-only electron mediators (with tunable redox potentials and
optimized interactions with enzymes) and applications in the field of
protein-only bioelectrodes.

The synthesis of enantiomerically pure compounds is of great importance in
pharmaceuticals, fragrances and biological applications, and functions as a key
to many processes in nature. Asymmetric catalysis using enantiomerically pure
catalysts represents an efficient synthetic method to achieve this goal. The
enantiomeric excess of the reaction product correlates with the enantiomeric
purity of the catalysts, except for nonlinear behaviour, therefore the use of
stereochemically flexible catalysts seems to complicate the control of
stereoselectivity. Self-amplifying catalytic reactions are attractive, but a
general rational design is highly challenging. Here we show that product
interaction with chiral recognition sites attached to structurally flexible
phoshoramidite-type catalysts can sense the chirality and induce
enantioselectivity in the catalyst. Structural flexibility along with sensing of 
the chirality of the product molecules results in a rapid increase of
enantioselectivity of the dynamic catalysts (Δe.e. of up to 76%) and a shift out 
of equilibrium. In contrast to stereodynamic catalysts controlled with cleavable 
chiral auxiliaries, the enantioselectivity does not decrease.

Recently, N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) were introduced as alternative anchors
for surface modifications and so offered many attractive features, which might
render them superior to thiol-based systems. However, little effort has been made
to investigate the self-organization process of NHCs on surfaces, an important
aspect for the formation of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), which requires
molecular mobility. Based on investigations with scanning tunnelling microscopy
and first-principles calculations, we provide an understanding of the microscopic
mechanism behind the high mobility observed for NHCs. These NHCs extract a gold
atom from the surface, which leads to the formation of an NHC-gold adatom complex
that displays a high surface mobility by a ballbot-type motion. Together with
their high desorption barrier this enables the formation of ordered and strongly 
bound SAMs. In addition, this mechanism allows a complementary surface-assisted
synthesis of dimeric and hitherto unknown trimeric NHC gold complexes on the
surface.

Developing homogeneous catalysts that convert CS2 and COS pollutants into
environmentally benign products is important for both fundamental catalytic
research and applied environmental science. Here we report a series of air-stable
dimeric Pd complexes that mediate the facile hydrolytic cleavage of both CS2
carbon-sulfur bonds at 25 °C to produce CO2 and trimeric Pd complexes. Oxidation 
of the trimeric complexes with HNO3 regenerates the dimeric starting complexes
with the release of SO2 and NO2. Isotopic labelling confirms that the carbon and 
oxygen atoms of CO2 originate from CS2 and H2O, respectively, and reaction
intermediates were observed by gas-phase and electrospray ionization mass
spectrometry, as well as by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. We also
propose a plausible mechanistic scenario based on the experimentally observed
intermediates. The mechanism involves intramolecular attack by a nucleophilic
Pd-OH moiety on the carbon atom of coordinated µ-OCS2, which on deprotonation
cleaves one C-S bond and simultaneously forms a C-O bond. Coupled C-S cleavage
and CO2 release to yield [(bpy)3Pd3(µ3-S)2](NO3)2 (bpy, 2,2'-bipyridine) provides
the thermodynamic driving force for the reaction.

The reduction of disulfides has a broad importance in chemistry, biochemistry and
materials science, particularly those methods that use mechanochemical
activation. Here we show, using isotensional simulations, that strikingly
different mechanisms govern disulfide cleavage depending on the external force.
Desolvation and resolvation processes are found to be crucial, as they have a
direct impact on activation free energies. The preferred pathway at moderate
forces, a bimolecular SN2 attack of OH- at sulfur, competes with unimolecular C-S
bond rupture at about 2 nN, and the latter even becomes barrierless at greater
applied forces. Moreover, our study unveils a surprisingly rich reactivity
scenario that also includes the transformation of concerted SN2 reactions into
pure bond-breaking processes at specific forces. Given that these forces are
easily reached in experiments, these insights will fundamentally change our
understanding of mechanochemical activation in general, which is now expected to 
be considerably more intricate than previously thought.

Saturated aza-heterocycles are highly privileged building blocks that are
commonly encountered in bioactive compounds and approved therapeutic agents.
These N-heterocycles are also incorporated as chiral auxiliaries and ligands in
asymmetric synthesis. As such, the development of methods to functionalize the
α-methylene C-H bonds of these systems enantioselectively is of great importance,
especially in drug discovery. Currently, enantioselective lithiation with
(-)-sparteine followed by Pd(0) catalysed cross-coupling to prepare α-arylated
amines is largely limited to pyrrolidines. Here we report a Pd(II)-catalysed
enantioselective α-C-H coupling of a wide range of amines, which include ethyl
amines, azetidines, pyrrolidines, piperidines, azepanes, indolines and
tetrahydroisoquinolines. Chiral phosphoric acids are demonstrated as effective
anionic ligands for the enantioselective coupling of methylene C-H bonds with
aryl boronic acids. This catalytic reaction not only affords high
enantioselectivities, but also provides exclusive regioselectivity in the
presence of two methylene groups in different steric environments.

Recent progress in the chemical construction of colloidal objects comprising
integrated biomimetic functions is paving the way towards rudimentary forms of
artificial cell-like entities (protocells). Although several new types of
protocells are currently available, the design of synthetic protocell communities
and investigation of their collective behaviour has received little attention.
Here we demonstrate an artificial form of predatory behaviour in a community of
protease-containing coacervate microdroplets and protein-polymer microcapsules
(proteinosomes) that interact via electrostatic binding. The coacervate
microdroplets act as killer protocells for the obliteration of the target
proteinosome population by protease-induced lysis of the protein-polymer
membrane. As a consequence, the proteinosome payload (dextran, single-stranded
DNA, platinum nanoparticles) is trafficked into the attached coacervate
microdroplets, which are then released as functionally modified killer protocells
capable of rekilling. Our results highlight opportunities for the development of 
interacting artificial protocell communities, and provide a strategy for inducing
collective behaviour in soft matter microcompartmentalized systems and synthetic 
protocell consortia.

The development of polymers with switchable glass transition temperatures (Tg)
can address scientific challenges such as the healing of cracks in high-Tg
polymers and the processing of hard polymers at room temperature without using
plasticizing solvents. Here, we demonstrate that light can switch the Tg of
azobenzene-containing polymers (azopolymers) and induce reversible
solid-to-liquid transitions of the polymers. The azobenzene groups in the
polymers exhibit reversible cis-trans photoisomerization abilities. Trans
azopolymers are solids with Tg above room temperature, whereas cis azopolymers
are liquids with Tg below room temperature. Because of the photoinduced
solid-to-liquid transitions of these polymers, light can reduce the surface
roughness of azopolymer films by almost 600%, repeatedly heal cracks in
azopolymers, and control the adhesion of azopolymers for transfer printing. The
photoswitching of Tg provides a new strategy for designing healable polymers with
high Tg and allows for control over the mechanical properties of polymers with
high spatiotemporal resolution.

Helicity switching in biological and artificial systems is a fundamental process 
that allows for the dynamic control of structures and their functions. In
contrast to chemical approaches to responsive behaviour in helicates, the use of 
light as an external stimulus offers unique opportunities to invert the chirality
of helical structures in a non-invasive manner with high spatiotemporal
precision. Here, we report that unidirectional rotary motors with connecting
oligobipyridyl ligands, which can dynamically change their chirality upon
irradiation, assemble into metal helicates that are responsive to light. The
motor function controls the self-assembly process as well as the helical
chirality, allowing switching between oligomers and double-stranded helicates
with distinct handedness. The unidirectionality of the light-induced motion
governs the sequence of programmable steps, enabling the highly regulated
self-assembly of fully responsive helical structures. This discovery paves the
way for the future development of new chirality-dependent photoresponsive systems
including smart materials, enantioselective catalysts and light-driven molecular 
machines.

Haem-copper oxidase (HCO) catalyses the natural reduction of oxygen to water
using a haem-copper centre. Despite decades of research on HCOs, the role of
non-haem metal and the reason for nature's choice of copper over other metals
such as iron remains unclear. Here, we use a biosynthetic model of HCO in
myoglobin that selectively binds different non-haem metals to demonstrate 30-fold
and 11-fold enhancements in the oxidase activity of Cu- and Fe-bound HCO mimics, 
respectively, as compared with Zn-bound mimics. Detailed electrochemical, kinetic
and vibrational spectroscopic studies, in tandem with theoretical density
functional theory calculations, demonstrate that the non-haem metal not only
donates electrons to oxygen but also activates it for efficient O-O bond
cleavage. Furthermore, the higher redox potential of copper and the enhanced
weakening of the O-O bond from the higher electron density in the d orbital of
copper are central to its higher oxidase activity over iron. This work resolves a
long-standing question in bioenergetics, and renders a chemical-biological basis 
for the design of future oxygen-reduction catalysts.

Strategies for forming liquid dispersions of nanomaterials typically focus on
retarding reaggregation, for example via surface modification, as opposed to
promoting the thermodynamically driven dissolution common for molecule-sized
species. Here we demonstrate the true dissolution of a wide range of important 2D
nanomaterials by forming layered material salts that spontaneously dissolve in
polar solvents yielding ionic solutions. The benign dissolution advantageously
maintains the morphology of the starting material, is stable against
reaggregation and can achieve solutions containing exclusively individualized
monolayers. Importantly, the charge on the anionic nanosheet solutes is
reversible, enables targeted deposition over large areas via electroplating and
can initiate novel self-assembly upon drying. Our findings thus reveal a unique
solution-like behaviour for 2D materials that enables their scalable production
and controlled manipulation.

Pentoses and hexoses contain more than three oxygen-bearing stereocentres and are
ideal starting materials for the synthesis of multiply oxygenated natural
products such as sagittamide D, maitotoxin and hikizimycin. Here we demonstrate
new radical-radical homocoupling reactions of sugar derivatives with minimal
perturbation of their chiral centres. The radical exchange procedure using
Et3B/O2 converted sugar-derived α-alkoxyacyl tellurides into α-alkoxy radicals
via decarbonylation and rapidly dimerized the monomeric radicals. The robustness 
of this process was demonstrated by a single-step preparation of 12
stereochemically diverse dimers with 6-10 secondary hydroxy groups, including the
C5-C10 stereohexad of sagittamide D and the enantiomer of the C51-C60 stereodecad
of maitotoxin. Furthermore, the optimally convergent radical-radical
cross-coupling reaction achieved a one-step assembly of the protected C1-C11
oxygenated carbon chain of the anthelmintic hikizimycin. These exceptionally
efficient homo- and heterocoupling methods together provide a powerful strategy
for the expedited total synthesis of contiguously hydroxylated natural products.

The structural and dynamical properties of water are known to be affected by ion 
solvation. However, a consistent molecular picture that describes how and to what
extent ions perturb the water structure is still missing. Here we apply 2D
Raman-terahertz spectroscopy to investigate the impact of monatomic cations on
the relaxation dynamics of the hydrogen-bond network in aqueous salt solutions.
The inherent ability of multidimensional spectroscopy to deconvolute
heterogeneous relaxation dynamics is used to reveal the correlation between the
inhomogeneity of the collective intermolecular hydrogen-bond modes and the
viscosity of a salt solution. Specifically, we demonstrate that the relaxation
time along the echo direction t1 = t2 correlates with the capability of a given
cation to 'structure' water. Moreover, we provide evidence that the echo
originates from the water-water modes, and not the water-cation modes, which
implies that cations can structure the hydrogen-bond network to a certain extent.

The chirality of molecular structures is paramount in many phenomena, including
enantioselective reactions, molecular self-assembly, biological processes and
light or electron-spin polarization. Flat prochiral molecules, which are achiral 
in the gas phase or solution, can exhibit adsorption-induced chirality when
deposited on surfaces. The whole array of such molecular adsorbates is naturally 
racemic as spontaneous global mirror-symmetry breaking is disfavoured. Here we
demonstrate a chemical method of obtaining flat prochiral molecules adsorbed on
the solid achiral surface in such a way that a specific adsorbate handedness
globally dominates. An optically pure helical precursor is flattened in a cascade
of on-surface reactions, which enables chirality transfer. The individual
reaction products are identified by high-resolution scanning-probe microscopy.
The ultimate formation of globally non-racemic assemblies of flat molecules
through stereocontrolled on-surface synthesis allows for chirality to be
expressed in as yet unexplored types of organic-inorganic chiral interfaces.

There is a pressing need for new technologies that improve the efficacy and
efficiency of drug discovery. Structure-based methods have contributed towards
this goal but they focus on predicting the binding affinity of protein-ligand
complexes, which is notoriously difficult. We adopt an alternative approach that 
evaluates structural, rather than thermodynamic, stability. As bioactive
molecules present a static binding mode, we devised dynamic undocking (DUck), a
fast computational method to calculate the work necessary to reach a quasi-bound 
state at which the ligand has just broken the most important native contact with 
the receptor. This non-equilibrium property is surprisingly effective in virtual 
screening because true ligands form more-resilient interactions than decoys.
Notably, DUck is orthogonal to docking and other 'thermodynamic' methods. We
demonstrate the potential of the docking-undocking combination in a fragment
screening against the molecular chaperone and oncology target Hsp90, for which we
obtain novel chemotypes and a hit rate that approaches 40%.

Stereodynamics describes how the vector properties of molecules, such as the
directions in which they move and the axes about which they rotate, affect the
probabilities (or cross-sections) of specific processes or transitions that occur
on collision. The main aspects of stereodynamics in inelastic atom-molecule
collisions can often be understood from classical considerations, in which the
particles are represented by billiard-ball-like hard objects. In a quantum
picture, however, the collision is described in terms of matter waves, which can 
also scatter into the region of the geometrical shadow of the object and reveal
detailed information on the pure quantum-mechanical contribution to the
stereodynamics. Here we present measurements of irregular diffraction patterns
for NO radicals colliding with rare-gas atoms that can be explained by the
analytical Fraunhofer model. They reveal a hitherto overlooked dependence on (or 
'propensity rule' for) the magnetic quantum number m of the molecules, and a
previously unrecognized type of quantum stereodynamics that has no classical
analogue or interpretation.

In multidimensional spectroscopy, dynamics of coherences between excited states
report on the interactions between electronic states and their environment. The
prolonged coherence lifetimes revealed through beating signals in the spectra of 
some systems may result from vibronic coupling between nearly degenerate excited 
states, and recent observations confirm the existence of such coupling in both
model systems and photosynthetic complexes. Understanding the origin of beating
signals in the spectra of photosynthetic complexes has been given considerable
attention; however, strategies to generate them in artificial systems that would 
allow us to test the hypotheses in detail are still lacking. Here we demonstrate 
control over the presence of quantum-beating signals by packing structurally
flexible synthetic heterodimers on single-walled carbon nanotubes, and thereby
restrict the motions of chromophores. Using two-dimensional electronic
spectroscopy, we find that both limiting the relative rotation of chromophores
and tuning the energy difference between the two electronic transitions in the
dimer to match a vibrational mode of the lower-energy monomer are necessary to
enhance the observed quantum-beating signals.

Nanoscale compartments are one of the foundational elements of living systems.
Capsids, carboxysomes, exosomes, vacuoles and other nanoshells easily
self-assemble from biomolecules such as lipids or proteins, but not from
inorganic nanomaterials because of difficulties with the replication of spherical
tiling. Here we show that stabilizer-free polydispersed inorganic nanoparticles
(NPs) can spontaneously organize into porous nanoshells. The association of
water-soluble CdS NPs into self-limited spherical capsules is the result of
scale-modified electrostatic, dispersion and other colloidal forces. They cannot 
be accurately described by the Derjaguin-Landau-Vervey-Overbeek theory, whereas
molecular-dynamics simulations with combined atomistic and coarse-grained
description of NPs reveal the emergence of nanoshells and some of their
stabilization mechanisms. Morphology of the simulated assemblies formed under
different conditions matched nearly perfectly the transmission electron
microscopy tomography data. This study bridges the gap between biological and
inorganic self-assembling nanosystems and conceptualizes a new pathway to
spontaneous compartmentalization for a wide range of inorganic NPs including
those existing on prebiotic Earth.

Tumour hypoxia is speculated to be a key driver of therapeutic resistance and
metastatic dissemination. Consequently, the discovery of new potent agents that
selectively target the hypoxic cell population may reveal new and untapped
antitumour mechanisms. Here we demonstrate that the BE-43547 subclass of the
APD-CLD (amidopentadienoate-containing cyclolipodepsipeptides) natural products
possesses highly hypoxia-selective growth-inhibitory activity against pancreatic 
cancer cells. To enable this discovery, we have developed the first synthesis of 
the BE-43547-macrocyclic scaffold in 16 steps (longest linear sequence), which
also allowed access to the full panel of relative stereoisomers and ultimately to
the assignment of stereochemical configuration. Discrepancies between the
spectroscopic signatures of the synthetic compounds with that originally reported
for the BE-43547 members stimulated us to re-isolate the natural product from a
BE-43547-producing microorganism during which we elucidated the biosynthetic gene
clusters for the BE-43547 family as well as for all other known APD-CLDs. Our
studies underline the exciting possibilities for the further development of the
anticancer activities of these natural products.

Alterations in glutathione (GSH) homeostasis are associated with a variety of
diseases and cellular functions, and therefore, real-time live-cell imaging and
quantification of GSH dynamics are important for understanding pathophysiological
processes. However, existing fluorescent probes are unsuitable for these purposes
due to their irreversible fluorogenic mechanisms or slow reaction rates. In this 
work, we have successfully overcome these problems by establishing a design
strategy inspired by Mayr's work on nucleophilic reaction kinetics. The
synthesized probes exhibit concentration-dependent, reversible and rapid
absorption/fluorescence changes (t1/2 = 620 ms at [GSH] = 1 mM), as well as
appropriate Kd values (1-10 mM: within the range of intracellular GSH
concentrations). We also developed FRET-based ratiometric probes, and
demonstrated that they are useful for quantifying GSH concentration in various
cell types and also for real-time live-cell imaging of GSH dynamics with temporal
resolution of seconds.

Activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) serves as a chemical proteomic platform
to discover and characterize functional amino acids in proteins on the basis of
their enhanced reactivity towards small-molecule probes. This approach, to date, 
has mainly targeted nucleophilic functional groups, such as the side chains of
serine and cysteine, using electrophilic probes. Here we show that
'reverse-polarity' (RP)-ABPP using clickable, nucleophilic hydrazine probes can
capture and identify protein-bound electrophiles in cells. Using this approach,
we demonstrate that the pyruvoyl cofactor of S-adenosyl-L-methionine
decarboxylase (AMD1) is dynamically controlled by intracellular methionine
concentrations. We also identify a heretofore unknown modification-an
N-terminally bound glyoxylyl group-in the poorly characterized protein
secernin-3. RP-ABPP thus provides a versatile method to monitor the metabolic
regulation of electrophilic cofactors and discover novel types of electrophilic
modifications on proteins in human cells.

FeFe hydrogenases are the most efficient H2-producing enzymes. However,
inactivation by O2 remains an obstacle that prevents them being used in many
biotechnological devices. Here, we combine electrochemistry, site-directed
mutagenesis, molecular dynamics and quantum chemical calculations to uncover the 
molecular mechanism of O2 diffusion within the enzyme and its reactions at the
active site. We propose that the partial reversibility of the reaction with O2
results from the four-electron reduction of O2 to water. The third
electron/proton transfer step is the bottleneck for water production, competing
with formation of a highly reactive OH radical and hydroxylated cysteine. The
rapid delivery of electrons and protons to the active site is therefore crucial
to prevent the accumulation of these aggressive species during prolonged O2
exposure. These findings should provide important clues for the design of
hydrogenase mutants with increased resistance to oxidative damage.

Although there are some proposed explanations for aggregation-induced emission, a
phenomenon with applications that range from biosensors to organic light-emitting
diodes, current understanding of the quantum-mechanical origin of this
photophysical behaviour is limited. To address this issue, we assessed the
emission properties of a series of BF2-hydrazone-based dyes as a function of
solvent viscosity. These molecules turned out to be highly efficient fluorescent 
molecular rotors. This property, in addition to them being aggregation-induced
emission luminogens, enabled us to probe deeper into their emission mechanism.
Time-dependent density functional theory calculations and experimental results
showed that the emission is not from the S1 state, as predicted from Kasha's
rule, but from a higher energy (>S1) state. Furthermore, we found that
suppression of internal conversion to the dark S1 state by restricting the rotor 
rotation enhances fluorescence, which leads to the proposal that suppression of
Kasha's rule is the photophysical mechanism responsible for emission in both
viscous solution and the solid state.

Surface-assisted covalent linking of precursor molecules enables the fabrication 
of low-dimensional nanostructures, which include graphene nanoribbons. One
approach to building functional multicomponent systems involves the lateral
anchoring of organic heteromolecules to graphene. Here we demonstrate the
dehydrogenative coupling of single porphines to graphene edges on the same metal 
substrate as used for graphene synthesis. The covalent linkages are visualized by
scanning probe techniques with submolecular resolution, which directly reveals
bonding motifs and electronic features. Distinct configurations are identified
that can be steered towards entities predominantly fused to graphene edges
through two pyrrole rings by thermal annealing. Furthermore, we succeeded in the 
concomitant metallation of the macrocycle with substrate atoms and the axial
ligation of adducts. Such processes combined with graphene-nanostructure
synthesis has the potential to create complex materials systems with tunable
functionalities.

The concept of shaping electric fields to steer light-induced processes
coherently has fascinated scientists for decades. Despite early theoretical
considerations that ruled out one-photon coherent control (CC), several
experimental studies reported that molecular responses are sensitive to the shape
of the excitation field in the weak-field limit. These observations were largely 
attributed to the presence of rapid-decay channels, but experimental verification
is lacking. Here, we test this hypothesis by investigating the degree of
achievable control over the photoisomerization of the retinal protonated
Schiff-base in bacteriorhodopsin, isorhodopsin and rhodopsin, all of which
exhibit similar chromophores but different isomerization yields and excited-state
lifetimes. Irrespective of the system studied, we find no evidence for
dissipation-dependent behaviour, nor for any CC in the strict one-photon limit.
Our results question the extent to which a photochemical process at ambient
conditions can be controlled at the amplitude level, and how the underlying
molecular potential-energy surfaces and dynamics may influence this
controllability.

Synthetic control over pore size and pore connectivity is the crowning
achievement for porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The same level of control
has not been achieved for molecular crystals, which are not defined by strong,
directional intermolecular coordination bonds. Hence, molecular crystallization
is inherently less controllable than framework crystallization, and there are
fewer examples of 'reticular synthesis', in which multiple building blocks can be
assembled according to a common assembly motif. Here we apply a chiral
recognition strategy to a new family of tubular covalent cages to create both 1D 
porous nanotubes and 3D diamondoid pillared porous networks. The diamondoid
networks are analogous to MOFs prepared from tetrahedral metal nodes and linear
ditopic organic linkers. The crystal structures can be rationalized by
computational lattice-energy searches, which provide an in silico screening
method to evaluate candidate molecular building blocks. These results are a
blueprint for applying the 'node and strut' principles of reticular synthesis to 
molecular crystals.

Metal-organic frameworks are a novel family of chemically diverse materials,
which are of interest across engineering, physics, chemistry, biology and
medicine-based disciplines. Since the development of the field in its current
form more than two decades ago, priority has been placed on the synthesis of new 
structures. However, more recently, a clear trend has emerged in shifting the
emphasis from material design to exploring the chemical and physical properties
of structures already known. In particular, although such nanoporous materials
were traditionally seen as rigid crystalline structures, there is growing
evidence that large-scale flexibility, the presence of defects and long-range
disorder are not the exception in metal-organic frameworks, but the rule. Here we
offer some perspective into how these concepts are perhaps inescapably
intertwined, highlight recent advances in our understanding and discuss how a
consideration of the interfaces between them may lead to enhancements of the
materials' functionalities.

The nucleation and growth of solids from solutions impacts many natural processes
and is fundamental to applications in materials engineering and medicine. For a
crystalline solid, the nucleus is a nanoscale cluster of ordered atoms that forms
through mechanisms still poorly understood. In particular, it is unclear whether 
a nucleus forms spontaneously from solution via a single- or multiple-step
process. Here, using in situ electron microscopy, we show how gold and silver
nanocrystals nucleate from supersaturated aqueous solutions in three distinct
steps: spinodal decomposition into solute-rich and solute-poor liquid phases,
nucleation of amorphous nanoclusters within the metal-rich liquid phase, followed
by crystallization of these amorphous clusters. Our ab initio calculations on
gold nucleation suggest that these steps might be associated with strong
gold-gold atom coupling and water-mediated metastable gold complexes. The
understanding of intermediate steps in nuclei formation has important
implications for the formation and growth of both crystalline and amorphous
materials.

Designing catalysts that achieve the rates and selectivities of natural enzymes
is a long-standing goal in protein chemistry. Here, we show that an
ultrahigh-throughput droplet-based microfluidic screening platform can be used to
improve a previously optimized artificial aldolase by an additional factor of 30 
to give a >109 rate enhancement that rivals the efficiency of class I aldolases. 
The resulting enzyme catalyses a reversible aldol reaction with high
stereoselectivity and tolerates a broad range of substrates. Biochemical and
structural studies show that catalysis depends on a Lys-Tyr-Asn-Tyr tetrad that
emerged adjacent to a computationally designed hydrophobic pocket during directed
evolution. This constellation of residues is poised to activate the substrate by 
Schiff base formation, promote mechanistically important proton transfers and
stabilize multiple transition states along a complex reaction coordinate. The
emergence of such a sophisticated catalytic centre shows that there is nothing
magical about the catalytic activities or mechanisms of naturally occurring
enzymes, or the evolutionary process that gave rise to them.

Amyloidogenic peptides and proteins play a crucial role in a variety of
neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. These
proteins undergo a spontaneous transition from a soluble, often partially folded 
form, into insoluble amyloid fibrils that are rich in β-sheets. Increasing
evidence suggests that highly dynamic, polydisperse folding intermediates, which 
occur during fibril formation, are the toxic species in the amyloid-related
diseases. Traditional condensed-phase methods are of limited use for
characterizing these states because they typically only provide ensemble averages
rather than information about individual oligomers. Here we report the first
direct secondary-structure analysis of individual amyloid intermediates using a
combination of ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry and gas-phase infrared
spectroscopy. Our data reveal that oligomers of the fibril-forming peptide
segments VEALYL and YVEALL, which consist of 4-9 peptide strands, can contain a
significant amount of β-sheet. In addition, our data show that the more-extended 
variants of each oligomer generally exhibit increased β-sheet content.

Ammonia synthesis under mild conditions is a goal that has been long sought
after. Previous investigations have shown that adsorption and transition-state
energies of intermediates in this process on transition metals (TMs) scale with
each other. This prevents the independent optimization of these energies that
would result in the ideal catalyst: one that activates reactants well, but binds 
intermediates relatively weakly. Here we demonstrate that these scaling relations
can be broken by intervening in the TM-mediated catalysis with a second catalytic
site, LiH. The negatively charged hydrogen atoms of LiH act as strong reducing
agents, which remove activated nitrogen atoms from the TM or its nitride (TMN),
and as an immediate source of hydrogen, which binds nitrogen atoms to form LiNH2.
LiNH2 further splits H2 heterolytically to give off NH3 and regenerate LiH. This 
synergy between TM (or TMN) and LiH creates a favourable pathway that allows both
early and late 3d TM-LiH composites to exhibit unprecedented lower-temperature
catalytic activities.

Conformational control of organic reactions is at the heart of the biomolecular
sciences. To achieve a particular reactivity, one of many conformers may be
selected, for instance, by a (bio)catalyst, as the geometrically most suited and 
appropriately reactive species. The equilibration of energetically close-lying
conformers is typically assumed to be facile and less energetically taxing than
the reaction under consideration itself: this is termed the 'Curtin-Hammett
principle'. Here, we show that the trans conformer of
trifluoromethylhydroxycarbene preferentially rearranges through a facile
quantum-mechanical hydrogen tunnelling pathway, while its cis conformer is
entirely unreactive. Hence, this presents the first example of a
conformer-specific hydrogen tunnelling reaction. The Curtin-Hammett principle is 
not applicable, due to the high barrier between the two conformers.

The surface-assisted bottom-up fabrication of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), which 
consists of the radical polymerization of precursors followed by dehydrogenation,
has attracted attention because of the method's ability to control the edges and 
widths of the resulting ribbon. Although these reactions on a metal surface are
believed to be catalytic, the mechanism has remained unknown. Here, we
demonstrate 'conformation-controlled surface catalysis': the two-zone chemical
vapour deposition of a 'Z-bar-linkage' precursor, which represents two terphenyl 
units linked in a 'Z' shape, results in the efficient formation of acene-type
GNRs with a width of 1.45 nm through optimized cascade reactions. These
precursors exhibit flexibility that allows them to adopt chiral conformations
with height asymmetry on a Au(111) surface, which enables the production of
self-assembled homochiral polymers in a chain with a planar conformation,
followed by dehydrogenation via a conformation-controlled mechanism. This is
conceptually analogous to enzymatic catalysis and will be useful for the
fabrication of new nanocarbon materials.

When an assembly of two or more molecules absorbs a photon to form a singlet
exciton, and the energetics and intermolecular interactions are favourable, the
singlet exciton can rapidly and spontaneously produce two triplet excitons by
singlet fission. To understand this process is important because it may prove to 
be technologically significant for enhancing solar-cell performance. Theory
strongly suggests that charge-transfer states are involved in singlet fission,
but their role has remained an intriguing puzzle and, up until now, no molecular 
system has provided clear evidence for such a state. Here we describe a
terrylenediimide dimer that forms a charge-transfer state in a few picoseconds in
polar solvents, and undergoes equally rapid, high-yield singlet fission in
nonpolar solvents. These results show that adjusting the charge-transfer-state
energy relative to those of the exciton states can serve to either inhibit or
promote singlet fission.

Recent observations of destructive quantum interference in single-molecule
junctions confirm the role of quantum effects in the electronic conductance
properties of molecular systems. These effects are central to a broad range of
chemical and biological processes and may be beneficial for the design of
single-molecule electronic components to exploit the intrinsic quantum effects
that occur at the molecular scale. Here we show that destructive interference can
be turned on or off within the same molecular system by mechanically controlling 
its conformation. Using a combination of ab initio calculations and
single-molecule conductance measurements, we demonstrate the existence of a
quasiperiodic destructive quantum-interference pattern along the breaking traces 
of π-stacked molecular dimers. The results demonstrate that it is possible to
control the molecular conductance over more than one order of magnitude and with 
a sub-ångström resolution by exploiting the subtle structure-property
relationship of π-stacked dimers.

Off-target binding of hydrophobic drugs can lead to unwanted side effects, either
through specific or non-specific binding to unintended membrane protein targets. 
However, distinguishing the binding of drugs to membrane proteins from that of
detergents, lipids and cofactors is challenging. Here, we use high-resolution
mass spectrometry to study the effects of HIV protease inhibitors on the human
zinc metalloprotease ZMPSTE24. This intramembrane protease plays a major role in 
converting prelamin A to mature lamin A. We monitored the proteolysis of
farnesylated prelamin A peptide by ZMPSTE24 and unexpectedly found retention of
the C-terminal peptide product with the enzyme. We also resolved binding of zinc,
lipids and HIV protease inhibitors and showed that drug binding blocked prelamin 
A peptide cleavage and conferred stability to ZMPSTE24. Our results not only have
relevance for the progeria-like side effects of certain HIV protease inhibitor
drugs, but also highlight new approaches for documenting off-target drug binding.

Oriented external electric fields (OEEFs) as 'smart reagents' are no longer a
theoretical dream. Here, we discuss the wide-ranging potential of using OEEFs to 
catalyse and control a variety of non-redox reactions and impart selectivity at
will. An OEEF along the direction of electron reorganization (the so-called
reaction axis) will catalyse nonpolar reactions by orders of magnitude, control
regioselectivity and induce spin-state selectivity. Simply flipping the direction
of the OEEF or orienting it off of the reaction axis, will control at will the
endo/exo ratio in Diels-Alder reactions and steps in enzymatic cycles. This
Perspective highlights these outcomes using theoretical results for hydrogen
abstraction reactions, epoxidation of double bonds, C-C bond forming reactions,
proton transfers and the cycle of the enzyme cytochrome P450, as well as recent
experimental data. We postulate that, as experimental techniques mature, chemical
syntheses may become an exercise in zapping oriented molecules with OEEFs.

Synthetic methods that provide control over macrocycle conformation and, at the
same time, mitigate the polarity of peptide bonds represent valuable tools for
the discovery of new bioactive molecules. Here, we report a macrocyclization
reaction between a linear peptide, an aldehyde and
(N-isocyanimino)triphenylphosphorane. This process generates head-to-tail cyclic 
peptidomimetics in a single step. This method is tolerant to variation in the
peptide and aldehyde components and has been applied for the synthesis of 15-,
18-, 21- and 24-membered rings. The resulting peptide macrocycles feature a
1,3,4-oxadiazole and a tertiary amine in their scaffolds. This non-canonical
backbone region acts as an endocyclic control element that promotes and
stabilizes a unique intramolecular hydrogen-bond network and can lead to
macrocycles with conformationally rigid turn structures. Oxadiazole-containing
macrocycles can also display a high passive membrane permeability, an important
property for the development of bioavailable peptide-based therapeutics.

Determining the initial pathway for ultrafast energy redistribution within
biomolecules is a challenge, and haem proteins, for which energy can be deposited
locally in the haem moiety using short light pulses, are suitable model systems
to address this issue. However, data acquired using existing experimental
techniques that fail to combine sufficient structural sensitivity with adequate
time resolution have resulted in alternative hypotheses concerning the interplay 
between energy flow among highly excited vibrational levels and potential
concomitant electronic processes. By developing a femtosecond-stimulated Raman
set-up, endowed with the necessary tunability to take advantage of different
resonance conditions, here we visualize the temporal evolution of energy
redistribution over different vibrational modes in myoglobin. We establish that
the vibrational energy initially stored in the highly excited Franck-Condon
manifold is transferred with different timescales into low- and high-frequency
modes, prior to slow dissipation through the protein. These findings demonstrate 
that a newly proposed mechanism involving the population dynamics of specific
vibrational modes settles the controversy on the existence of transient
electronic intermediates.

Ligands are essential for controlling the reactivity and selectivity of reactions
catalysed by transition metals. Access to large phosphine ligand libraries has
become an essential tool for the application of metal-catalysed reactions
industrially, but these existing libraries are not well suited to new catalytic
methods based on non-precious metals (for example, Ni, Cu and Fe). The
development of the requisite nitrogen- and oxygen-based ligand libraries lags far
behind that of the phosphines and the development of new libraries is anticipated
to be time consuming. Here we show that this process can be dramatically
accelerated by mining for new ligands in a typical pharmaceutical compound
library that is rich in heterocycles. Using this approach, we were able to screen
a structurally diverse set of compounds with minimal synthetic effort and
identify several new ligand classes for nickel-catalysed cross-electrophile
coupling. These new ligands gave improved yields for challenging cross-couplings 
of pharmaceutically relevant substrates compared with those of those of
previously published ligands.

Regioselective activation of aromatic C-H bonds is a long-standing challenge for 
arene functionalization reactions such as the hydroarylation of alkynes. One
possible solution is to employ a removable directing group that activates one of 
several aromatic C-H bonds. Here we report a new catalytic method for
regioselective alkyne hydroarylation with benzoic acid derivatives during which
the carboxylate functionality directs the alkyne to the ortho-C-H bond with
elimination in situ to form a vinylarene product. The decarboxylation stage of
this tandem sequence is envisioned to proceed with the assistance of an
ortho-alkenyl moiety, which is formed by the initial alkyne coupling. This
ruthenium-catalysed decarboxylative alkyne hydroarylation eliminates the common
need for pre-existing ortho-substitution on benzoic acids for substrate
activation, proceeds under redox-neutral and relatively mild conditions, and
tolerates a broad range of synthetically useful aromatic functionality. Thus, it 
significantly increases the synthetic utility of benzoic acids as easily
accessible aromatic building blocks.

Hydroesterification reactions represent a fundamental type of carbonylation
reaction and constitute one of the most important industrial applications of
homogeneous catalysis. Over the past 70 years, numerous catalyst systems have
been developed that allow for highly linear-selective (anti-Markovnikov)
reactions and are used in industry to produce linear carboxylates starting from
olefins. In contrast, a general catalyst system for Markovnikov-selective
alkoxycarbonylation of aliphatic olefins remains unknown. In this paper, we show 
that a specific palladium catalyst system consisting of PdX2/N-phenylpyrrole
phosphine (X, halide) catalyses the alkoxycarbonylation of various alkenes to
give the branched esters in high selectivity (branched selectivity up to 91%).
The observed (and unexpected) selectivity has been rationalized by density
functional theory computation that includes a dispersion correction.

The reversible attachment of a small-molecule drug to a carrier for targeted
delivery can improve pharmacokinetics and the therapeutic index. Previous studies
have reported the delivery of molecules that contain primary and secondary amines
via an amide or carbamate bond; however, the ability to employ
tertiary-amine-containing bioactive molecules has been elusive. Here we describe 
a bioreversible linkage based on a quaternary ammonium that can be used to
connect a broad array of tertiary and heteroaryl amines to a carrier protein.
Using a concise, protecting-group-free synthesis we demonstrate the
chemoselective modification of 12 complex molecules that contain a range of
reactive functional groups. We also show the utility of this connection with both
protease-cleavable and reductively cleavable antibody-drug conjugates that were
effective and stable in vitro and in vivo. Studies with a
tertiary-amine-containing antibiotic show that the resulting antibody-antibiotic 
conjugate provided appropriate stability and release characteristics and led to
an unexpected improvement in activity over the conjugates previously connected
via a carbamate.

In CdS nanocrystals, photoexcited holes rapidly become trapped at the particle
surface. The dynamics of these trapped holes have profound consequences for the
photophysics and photochemistry of these materials. Using a combination of
transient absorption spectroscopy and theoretical modelling, we demonstrate that 
trapped holes in CdS nanorods are mobile and execute a random walk at room
temperature. In CdS nanorods of non-uniform width, we observe the recombination
of spatially separated electrons and trapped holes, which exhibits a t-1/2
power-law decay at long times. A one-dimensional diffusion-annihilation model
describes the time-dependence of the recombination over four orders of magnitude 
in time, from one nanosecond to ten microseconds, with a single adjustable
parameter. We propose that diffusive trapped-hole motion is a general phenomenon 
in CdS nanocrystals, but one that is normally obscured in structures in which the
wavefunctions of the electron and trapped hole spatially overlap. This phenomenon
has important implications for the oxidation photochemistry of CdS nanocrystals.

G proteins are key mediators of G protein-coupled receptor signalling, which
facilitates a plethora of important physiological processes. The cyclic
depsipeptides YM-254890 and FR900359 are the only known specific inhibitors of
the Gq subfamily of G proteins; however, no synthetic route has been reported
previously for these complex natural products and they are not easily isolated
from natural sources. Here we report the first total synthesis of YM-254890 and
FR900359, as well as of two known analogues, YM-385780 and YM-385781. The
versatility of the synthetic approach also enabled the design and synthesis of
ten analogues, which provided the first structure-activity relationship study for
this class of compounds. Pharmacological characterization of all the compounds at
Gq-, Gi- and Gs-mediated signalling provided succinct information on the
structural requirements for inhibition, and demonstrated that both YM-254890 and 
FR900359 are highly potent inhibitors of Gq signalling, with FR900359 being the
most potent. These natural products and their analogues represent unique tools
for explorative studies of G protein inhibition.

Vinylidene (H2C=C) is a member of the family of compounds of composition CH (and 
isomeric with ethyne, HC≡CH), but it has been observed only transiently-with a
lifetime in the region of 0.1 ns. Indeed, no simple (non-base-stabilized)
compounds of the type R2E=E have been characterized structurally for any of the
group 14 elements. Here we show that by employing the bulky and strongly
electron-donating boryl ligand (HCDippN)2B (Dipp, 2,6-iPr2C6H3), a simple
monomeric digermavinylidene compound, (boryl)2GeGe, can be synthesized and is
stable at room temperature. Both its formation via the two-electron chemical
oxidation of the symmetrical Ge0 compound K2[(boryl)GeGe(boryl)] and its
subsequent reaction chemistry (for example, with H2), are consistent with a high 
substituent lability and the accessibility of both 1,1- and 1,2-substitution
patterns. Structural and computational studies of [(HCDippN)2B]2GeGe reveal a
weak Ge-Ge double bond-the π component of which contributes to the highest
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)-with a Ge-centred lone pair as the HOMO-1.

The use of transaminases to access pharmaceutically relevant chiral amines is an 
attractive alternative to transition-metal-catalysed asymmetric chemical
synthesis. However, one major challenge is their limited substrate scope. Here we
report the creation of highly active and stereoselective transaminases starting
from fold class I. The transaminases were developed by extensive protein
engineering followed by optimization of the identified motif. The resulting
enzymes exhibited up to 8,900-fold higher activity than the starting scaffold and
are highly stereoselective (up to >99.9% enantiomeric excess) in the asymmetric
synthesis of a set of chiral amines bearing bulky substituents. These enzymes
should therefore be suitable for use in the synthesis of a wide array of
potential intermediates for pharmaceuticals. We also show that the motif can be
engineered into other protein scaffolds with sequence identities as low as 70%,
and as such should have a broad impact in the field of biocatalytic synthesis and
enzyme engineering.

Charge transport through the DNA double helix is of fundamental interest in
chemistry and biochemistry, but also has potential technological applications
such as for DNA-based nanoelectronics. For the latter, it is of considerable
interest to explore ways to influence or enhance charge transfer. In this Article
we demonstrate a new mechanism for DNA charge transport, namely 'deep-hole
transfer', which involves long-range migration of a hole through low-lying
electronic states of the nucleobases. Here, we demonstrate, in a combined
experimental and theoretical study, that it is possible to achieve such transfer 
behaviour by changing the energetics of charge injection. This mechanism leads to
an enhancement in transfer rates by up to two orders of magnitude and much weaker
distance dependence. This transfer is faster than relaxation to the lowest-energy
state, setting this mechanism apart from those previously described. This opens
up a new direction to optimize charge transfer in DNA with unprecedented
charge-transfer rates.

Sticky-ended DNA duplexes can associate spontaneously into long double helices;
however, such self-assembly is much less developed with proteins. Collagen is the
most prevalent component of the extracellular matrix and a common clinical
biomaterial. As for natural DNA, the ~103-residue triple helices (~300 nm) of
natural collagen are recalcitrant to chemical synthesis. Here we show how the
self-assembly of short collagen-mimetic peptides (CMPs) can enable the
fabrication of synthetic collagen triple helices that are nearly a micrometre in 
length. Inspired by the mathematics of tessellations, we derive rules for the
design of single CMPs that self-assemble into long triple helices with perfect
symmetry. Sticky ends thus created are uniform across the assembly and drive its 
growth. Enacting this design yields individual triple helices that, in length,
match or exceed those in natural collagen and are remarkably thermostable,
despite the absence of higher-order association. The symmetric assembly of CMPs
provides an enabling platform for the development of advanced materials for
medicine and nanotechnology.

Ring-opening polymerization of lactones is a versatile approach to generate
well-defined functional polyesters. Typical ring-opening catalysts are subject to
a trade-off between rate and selectivity. Here we describe an effective catalytic
system combining alkoxides with thioureas that catalyses rapid and selective
ring-opening polymerizations. Deprotonation of thioureas by sodium, potassium or 
imidazolium alkoxides generates a hydrogen-bonded alcohol adduct of the thiourea 
anion (thioimidate). The ring-opening polymerization of L-lactide mediated by
these alcohol-bonded thioimidates yields highly isotactic polylactide with fast
kinetics and living polymerization behaviour, as evidenced by narrow molecular
weight distributions (Mw/Mn < 1.1), chain extension experiments and minimal
transesterifications. Computational studies indicate a bifunctional catalytic
mechanism whereby the thioimidate activates the carbonyl of the monomer and the
alcohol initiator/chain end to effect the selective ring-opening of lactones and 
carbonates. The high selectivity of the catalyst towards monomer propagation over
transesterification is attributed to a selective activation of monomer over
polymer chains.

MIDA boronates (N-methylimidodiacetic boronic acid esters) serve as an
increasingly general platform for small-molecule construction based on building
blocks, largely because of the dramatic and general rate differences with which
they are hydrolysed under various basic conditions. Yet the mechanistic
underpinnings of these rate differences have remained unclear, which has hindered
efforts to address the current limitations of this chemistry. Here we show that
there are two distinct mechanisms for this hydrolysis: one is base mediated and
the other neutral. The former can proceed more than three orders of magnitude
faster than the latter, and involves a rate-limiting attack by a hydroxide at a
MIDA carbonyl carbon. The alternative 'neutral' hydrolysis does not require an
exogenous acid or base and involves rate-limiting B-N bond cleavage by a small
water cluster, (H2O)n. The two mechanisms can operate in parallel, and their
relative rates are readily quantified by 18O incorporation. Whether hydrolysis is
'fast' or 'slow' is dictated by the pH, the water activity and the mass-transfer 
rates between phases. These findings stand to enable, in a rational way, an even 
more effective and widespread utilization of MIDA boronates in synthesis.

Hydrogen production through water splitting is one of the most promising
solutions for the storage of renewable energy. [NiFe] hydrogenases are
organometallic enzymes containing nickel and iron centres that catalyse hydrogen 
evolution with performances that rival those of platinum. These enzymes provide
inspiration for the design of new molecular catalysts that do not require
precious metals. However, all heterodinuclear NiFe models reported so far do not 
reproduce the Ni-centred reactivity found at the active site of [NiFe]
hydrogenases. Here, we report a structural and functional NiFe mimic that
displays reactivity at the Ni site. This is shown by the detection of two
catalytic intermediates that reproduce structural and electronic features of the 
Ni-L and Ni-R states of the enzyme during catalytic turnover. Under
electrocatalytic conditions, this mimic displays high rates for H2 evolution
(second-order rate constant of 2.5 × 104 M-1 s-1; turnover frequency of 250 s-1
at 10 mM H+ concentration) from mildly acidic solutions.

Biological drugs generated via recombinant techniques are uniquely positioned due
to their high potency and high selectivity of action. The major drawback of this 
class of therapeutics, however, is their poor stability upon oral administration 
and during subsequent circulation. As a result, biological drugs have very low
bioavailability and short therapeutic half-lives. Fortunately, tools of chemistry
and biotechnology have been developed into an elaborate arsenal, which can be
applied to improve the pharmacokinetics of biological drugs. Depot-type release
systems are available to achieve sustained release of drugs over time.
Conjugation to synthetic or biological polymers affords long circulating
formulations. Administration of biological drugs through non-parenteral routes
shows excellent performance and the first products have reached the market. This 
Review presents the main accomplishments in this field and illustrates the
materials and methods behind existing and upcoming successful formulations and
delivery strategies for biological drugs.

Using small molecules to control the function of proteins in live cells with
complete specificity is highly desirable, but challenging. Here we report a
small-molecule switch that can be used to control protein activity. The approach 
uses a phosphine-mediated Staudinger reduction to activate protein function.
Genetic encoding of an ortho-azidobenzyloxycarbonyl amino acid using a pyrrolysyl
transfer RNA synthetase/tRNACUA pair in mammalian cells enables the site-specific
introduction of a small-molecule-removable protecting group into the protein of
interest. Strategic placement of this group renders the protein inactive until
deprotection through a bioorthogonal Staudinger reduction delivers the active
wild-type protein. This developed methodology was applied to the conditional
control of several cellular processes, including bioluminescence (luciferase),
fluorescence (enhanced green fluorescent protein), protein translocation (nuclear
localization sequence), DNA recombination (Cre) and gene editing (Cas9).

Spectroscopically observing the translational and rotational motion of solute
molecules in liquid solutions is typically impeded by their interactions with the
solvent, which conceal spectral detail through linewidth broadening. Here we show
that unique insights into solute dynamics can be made with perfluorinated
solvents, which interact weakly with solutes and provide a simplified liquid
environment that helps to bridge the gap in our understanding of gas- and
liquid-phase dynamics. Specifically, we show that in such solvents, the
translational and rotational cooling of an energetic CN radical can be observed
directly using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. We observe that
translational-energy dissipation within these liquids can be modelled through a
series of classic collisions, whereas classically simulated rotational-energy
dissipation is shown to be distinctly faster than experimentally measured. We
also observe the onset of rotational hindering from nearby solvent molecules,
which arises as the average rotational energy of the solute falls below the
effective barrier to rotation induced by the solvent.

Proteins can misfold into amyloid structures that are associated with diseases;
however, the same proteins often have important biological roles. To degrade
selectively the amyloid form without affecting the fraction of functional protein
is, therefore, an attractive goal. Here we report target-state-dependent
photooxygenation catalysts that are active only when bound to the cross-β-sheet
structure that is characteristic of pathogenic aggregated amyloid proteins. We
show these catalysts can selectively oxygenate the amyloid form of amyloid
β-protein (Aβ) 1-42 in the presence of non-amyloid off-target substrates.
Furthermore, photooxygenation with a catalyst that bears an Aβ-binding peptide
attenuated the Aβ pathogenicity in the presence of cells. We also show that
selective photooxygenation is generally applicable to other amyloidogenic
proteins (amylin, insulin, β2-microglobulin, transthyretin and α-synuclein) and
does not affect the physiologically functional non-aggregate states of these
proteins. This is the first report of an artificial catalyst that can be
selectively and reversibly turned on and off depending on the structure and
aggregation state of the substrate protein.

The controlled activation of proteins in living cells is an important goal in
protein-design research, but to introduce an artificial activation switch into
membrane proteins through rational design is a significant challenge because of
the structural and functional complexity of such proteins. Here we report the
allosteric activation of two types of membrane-bound neurotransmitter receptors, 
the ion-channel type and the G-protein-coupled glutamate receptors, using
coordination chemistry in living cells. The high programmability of coordination 
chemistry enabled two His mutations, which act as an artificial allosteric site, 
to be semirationally incorporated in the vicinity of the ligand-binding pockets. 
Binding of Pd(2,2'-bipyridine) at the allosteric site enabled the active
conformations of the glutamate receptors to be stabilized. Using this approach,
we were able to activate selectively a mutant glutamate receptor in live neurons,
which initiated a subsequent signal-transduction pathway.

The cavity inside fullerenes provides a unique environment for the study of
isolated atoms and molecules. We report the encapsulation of hydrogen fluoride
inside C60 using molecular surgery to give the endohedral fullerene HF@C60. The
key synthetic step is the closure of the open fullerene cage with the escape of
HF minimized. The encapsulated HF molecule moves freely inside the cage and
exhibits quantization of its translational and rotational degrees of freedom, as 
revealed by inelastic neutron scattering and infrared spectroscopy. The
rotational and vibrational constants of the encapsulated HF molecules were found 
to be redshifted relative to free HF. The NMR spectra display a large (1)H-(19)F 
J coupling typical of an isolated species. The dipole moment of HF@C60 was
estimated from the temperature dependence of the dielectric constant at cryogenic
temperatures and showed that the cage shields around 75% of the HF dipole.

Ferroelectrics are used in a wide range of applications, including memory
elements, capacitors and sensors. Recently, molecular ferroelectric crystals have
attracted interest as viable alternatives to conventional ceramic ferroelectrics 
because of their solution processability and lack of toxicity. Here we show that 
a class of molecular compounds-known as plastic crystals-can exhibit
ferroelectricity if the constituents are judiciously chosen from polar ionic
molecules. The intrinsic features of plastic crystals, for example, the
rotational motion of molecules and phase transitions with lattice-symmetry
changes, provide the crystals with unique ferroelectric properties relative to
those of conventional molecular crystals. This allows a flexible alteration of
the polarization axis direction in a grown crystal by applying an electric field.
Owing to the tunable nature of the crystal orientation, together with mechanical 
deformability, this type of molecular crystal represents an attractive functional
material that could find use in a diverse range of applications.

Electronic delocalization in redox-active polymers may be disrupted by the
heterogeneity of the environment that surrounds each monomer. When the
differences in monomer redox-potential induced by the environment are small (as
compared with the monomer-monomer electronic interactions), delocalization
persists. Here we show that guanine (G) runs in double-stranded DNA support
delocalization over 4-5 guanine bases. The weak interaction between delocalized G
blocks on opposite DNA strands is known to support partially coherent long-range 
charge transport. The molecular-resolution model developed here finds that the
coherence among these G blocks follows an even-odd orbital-symmetry rule and
predicts that weakening the interaction between G blocks exaggerates the
resistance oscillations. These findings indicate how sequence can be exploited to
change the balance between coherent and incoherent transport. The predictions are
tested and confirmed using break-junction experiments. Thus, tailored orbital
symmetry and structural fluctuations may be used to produce coherent transport
with a length scale of multiple nanometres in soft-matter assemblies, a length
scale comparable to that of small proteins.

Heat transfer, electrical potential and light energy are common ways to activate 
chemical reactions. Applied force is another way, but dedicated studies for such 
a mechanical activation are limited, and this activation is poorly understood at 
the single-molecule level. Here, we report force-induced tautomerization in a
single porphycene molecule on a Cu(110) surface at 5 K, which is studied by
scanning probe microscopy and density functional theory calculations. Force
spectroscopy quantifies the force needed to trigger tautomerization with
submolecular spatial resolution. The calculations show how the reaction pathway
and barrier of tautomerization are modified in the presence of a copper tip and
reveal the atomistic origin of the process. Moreover, we demonstrate that a
chemically inert tip whose apex is terminated by a xenon atom cannot induce the
reaction because of a weak interaction with porphycene and a strong relaxation of
xenon on the tip as contact to the molecule is formed.

Fischer-Tropsch synthesis is a heterogeneous catalytic reaction that creates
approximately 2% of the world's fuel. It involves the synthesis of linear
hydrocarbon molecules from a gaseous mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen at
high pressures (from a few to tens of bars) and high temperatures (200-350 °C).
To gain further insight into the fundamental mechanisms of this industrial
process, we have used a purpose-built scanning tunnelling microscope to monitor a
cobalt model catalyst under reaction conditions. We show that, after 30 minutes
of reaction, the terraces of the cobalt catalyst are covered by parallel arrays
of stripes. We propose that the stripes are formed by the self-assembly of linear
hydrocarbon product molecules. Surprisingly, the width of the stripes corresponds
to molecules that are 14 or 15 carbon atoms long. We introduce a simple model
that explains the accumulation of such long molecules by describing their
monomer-by-monomer synthesis and explicitly accounting for their thermal
desorption.

Aromatic hydrocarbons are some of the most elementary feedstock chemicals,
produced annually on a million metric ton scale, and are used in the production
of polymers, paints, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals. Dearomatization reactions
convert simple, readily available arenes into more complex molecules with broader
potential utility, however, despite substantial progress and achievements in this
field, there are relatively few methods for the dearomatization of simple arenes 
that also selectively introduce functionality. Here we describe a new
dearomatization process that involves visible-light activation of small
heteroatom-containing organic molecules-arenophiles-that results in their
para-cycloaddition with a variety of aromatic compounds. The approach uses
N-N-arenophiles to enable dearomative dihydroxylation and diaminodihydroxylation 
of simple arenes. This strategy provides direct and selective access to highly
functionalized cyclohexenes and cyclohexadienes and is orthogonal to existing
chemical and biological dearomatization processes. Finally, we demonstrate the
synthetic utility of this strategy with the concise synthesis of several
biologically active compounds and natural products.

The non-enzymatic replication of RNA is thought to have been a critical process
required for the origin of life. One unsolved difficulty with non-enzymatic RNA
replication is that template-directed copying of RNA results in a double-stranded
product. After strand separation, rapid strand reannealing outcompetes slow
non-enzymatic template copying, which renders multiple rounds of RNA replication 
impossible. Here we show that oligoarginine peptides slow the annealing of
complementary oligoribonucleotides by up to several thousand-fold; however, short
primers and activated monomers can still bind to template strands, and
template-directed primer extension can still occur, all within a phase-separated 
condensed state, or coacervate. Furthermore, we show that within this phase,
partial template copying occurs even in the presence of full-length complementary
strands. This method to enable further rounds of replication suggests one
mechanism by which short non-coded peptides could have enhanced early cellular
fitness, and potentially explains how longer coded peptides, that is, proteins,
came to prominence in modern biology.

The realization of complex topologies at the molecular level represents a grand
challenge in chemistry. This necessitates the manipulation of molecular
interactions with high precision. Here we show that single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)
knots and links can be created by utilizing the inherent topological properties
that pertain to the DNA four-way junction, at which the two helical strands form 
a node and can be configured conveniently and connected for complex topological
construction. Using this strategy, we produced series of ssDNA topoisomers with
the same sequences. By finely designing the curvature and torsion,
double-stranded DNA knots were accessed by hybridizing and ligating the
complementary strands with the knotted ssDNA templates. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the use of a constructed ssDNA knot both to probe the topological
conversion catalysed by DNA topoisomerase and to study the DNA replication under 
topological constraint.

Asymmetric lipid giant vesicles have been used to model the biochemical reactions
in cell membranes. However, methods for producing asymmetric giant vesicles lead 
to the inclusion of an organic solvent layer that affects the mechanical and
physical characteristics of the membrane. Here we describe the formation of
asymmetric giant vesicles that include little organic solvent, and use them to
investigate the dynamic responses of lipid molecules in the vesicle membrane. We 
formed the giant vesicles via the inhomogeneous break-up of a lipid microtube
generated by applying a jet flow to an asymmetric planar lipid bilayer. The
asymmetric giant vesicles showed a lipid flip-flop behaviour in the membrane,
superficially similar to the lipid flip-flop activity observed in apoptotic
cells. In vitro synthesis of membrane proteins into the asymmetric giant vesicles
revealed that the lipid asymmetry in bilayer membranes improves the
reconstitution ratio of membrane proteins. Our asymmetric giant vesicles will be 
useful in elucidating lipid-lipid and lipid-membrane protein interactions
involved in the regulation of cellular functions.

Directional proton transport along 'wires' that feed biochemical reactions in
proteins is poorly understood. Amino-acid residues with high pKa are seldom
considered as active transport elements in such wires because of their large
classical barrier for proton dissociation. Here, we use the light-triggered
proton wire of the green fluorescent protein to study its ground-electronic-state
proton-transport kinetics, revealing a large temperature-dependent kinetic
isotope effect. We show that 'deep' proton tunnelling between hydrogen-bonded
oxygen atoms with a typical donor-acceptor distance of 2.7-2.8 Å fully accounts
for the rates at all temperatures, including the unexpectedly large value
(2.5 × 10(9) s(-1)) found at room temperature. The rate-limiting step in green
fluorescent protein is assigned to tunnelling of the ionization-resistant serine 
hydroxyl proton. This suggests how high-pKa residues within a proton wire can act
as a 'tunnel diode' to kinetically trap protons and control the direction of
proton flow.

The science of self-assembly has undergone a radical shift from asking questions 
about why individual components self-organize into ordered structures, to
manipulating the resultant order. However, the quest for far-reaching
nanomanufacturing requires addressing an even more challenging question: how to
form nanoparticle (NP) structures with designed architectures without explicitly 
prescribing particle positions. Here we report an assembly concept in which
building instructions are embedded into NPs via DNA frames. The integration of
NPs and DNA origami frames enables the fabrication of NPs with designed
anisotropic and selective interactions. Using a pre-defined set of different
DNA-framed NPs, we show it is possible to design diverse planar architectures,
which include periodic structures and shaped meso-objects that spontaneously
emerge on mixing of the different topological types of NP. Even objects of
non-trivial shapes, such as a nanoscale model of Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian
Man, can be self-assembled successfully.

Molecular approaches to solar-energy conversion require a kinetic optimization of
light-induced electron-transfer reactions. At molecular-semiconductor interfaces,
this optimization has previously been accomplished through control of the
distance between the semiconductor donor and the molecular acceptor and/or the
free energy that accompanies electron transfer. Here we show that a kinetic
pathway for electron transfer from a semiconductor to a molecular acceptor also
exists and provides an alternative method for the control of interfacial
kinetics. The pathway was identified by the rational design of molecules in which
the distance and the driving force were held near parity and only the geometric
torsion about a xylyl- or phenylthiophene bridge was varied. Electronic coupling 
through the phenyl bridge was a factor of ten greater than that through the xylyl
bridge. Comparative studies revealed a significant bridge dependence for electron
transfer that could not be rationalized by a change in distance or driving force.
Instead, the data indicate an interfacial electron-transfer pathway that utilizes
the aromatic bridge orbitals.

The achievement of long-lived photoinduced redox separation lifetimes has long
been a central goal of molecular-based solar energy conversion strategies. The
longer the redox-separation lifetime, the more time available for useful work to 
be extracted from the absorbed photon energy. Here we describe a novel strategy
for dye-sensitized solar energy applications in which redox-separated lifetimes
on the order of milliseconds to seconds can be achieved based on a simple toolkit
of molecular components. Specifically, molecular chromophores (C), electron
acceptors (A) and electron donors (D) were self-assembled on the surfaces of
mesoporous, transparent conducting indium tin oxide nanoparticle (nanoITO)
electrodes to prepare both photoanode (nanoITO|-A-C-D) and photocathode
(nanoITO|-D-C-A) assemblies. Nanosecond transient-absorption and steady-state
photolysis measurements show that the electrodes function microscopically as
molecular analogues of semiconductor p/n junctions. These results point to a new 
chemical strategy for dye-sensitized solar energy conversion based on molecular
excited states and electron acceptors/donors on the surfaces of transparent
conducting oxide nanoparticle electrodes.

The design of enzyme-like catalysts tests our understanding of
sequence-to-structure/function relationships in proteins. Here we install
hydrolytic activity predictably into a completely de novo and thermostable
α-helical barrel, which comprises seven helices arranged around an accessible
channel. We show that the lumen of the barrel accepts 21 mutations to functional 
polar residues. The resulting variant, which has cysteine-histidine-glutamic acid
triads on each helix, hydrolyses p-nitrophenyl acetate with catalytic
efficiencies that match the most-efficient redesigned hydrolases based on natural
protein scaffolds. This is the first report of a functional catalytic triad
engineered into a de novo protein framework. The flexibility of our system also
allows the facile incorporation of unnatural side chains to improve activity and 
probe the catalytic mechanism. Such a predictable and robust construction of
truly de novo biocatalysts holds promise for applications in chemical and
biochemical synthesis.

One atom or molecule binds to another through various types of bond, the
strengths of which range from several meV to several eV. Although some
computational methods can provide accurate descriptions of all bond types, those 
methods are not efficient enough for many studies (for example, large systems, ab
initio molecular dynamics and high-throughput searches for functional materials).
Here, we show that the recently developed non-empirical strongly constrained and 
appropriately normed (SCAN) meta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA)
within the density functional theory framework predicts accurate geometries and
energies of diversely bonded molecules and materials (including covalent,
metallic, ionic, hydrogen and van der Waals bonds). This represents a significant
improvement at comparable efficiency over its predecessors, the GGAs that
currently dominate materials computation. Often, SCAN matches or improves on the 
accuracy of a computationally expensive hybrid functional, at almost-GGA cost.
SCAN is therefore expected to have a broad impact on chemistry and materials
science.

Cyclic oligomers comprising strongly interacting redox-active monomer units
represent an unknown, yet highly desirable class of nanoscale materials. Here we 
describe the synthesis and properties of the first family of molecules belonging 
to this compound category-differently sized rings comprising only
1,1'-disubstituted ferrocene units (cyclo[n], n = 5-7, 9). Due to the close
proximity and connectivity of centres (covalent Cp-Cp linkages; Cp =
cyclopentadienyl) solution voltammograms exhibit well-resolved, separated 1e(-)
waves. Theoretical interrogations into correlations based on ring size and charge
state are facilitated using values of the equilibrium potentials of these
transitions, as well as their relative spacing. As the interaction free energies 
between the redox centres scale linearly with overall ring charge and in
conjunction with fast intramolecular electron transfer (∼10(7) s(-1)), these
molecules can be considered as uniformly charged nanorings (diameter ∼1-2 nm).

Efficient C-H functionalization requires selectivity for specific C-H bonds.
Progress has been made for directed aromatic substitution reactions to achieve
ortho and meta selectivity, but a general strategy for para-selective C-H
functionalization has remained elusive. Herein we introduce a previously
unappreciated concept that enables nearly complete para selectivity. We propose
that radicals with high electron affinity elicit arene-to-radical charge transfer
in the transition state of radical addition, which is the factor primarily
responsible for high positional selectivity. We demonstrate with a simple
theoretical tool that the selectivity is predictable and show the utility of the 
concept through a direct synthesis of aryl piperazines. Our results contradict
the notion, widely held by organic chemists, that radical aromatic substitution
reactions are inherently unselective. The concept of radical substitution
directed by charge transfer could serve as the basis for the development of new, 
highly selective C-H functionalization reactions.

Natural gas contains large volumes of light alkanes, and its abundant reserves
make it an appealing feedstock for value-added chemicals and fuels. However,
selectively activating the C-H bonds in these useful hydrocarbons is one of the
greatest challenges in catalysis. Here we report an attractive oxybromination
method for the one-step functionalization of methane under mild conditions that
integrates gas-phase alkane bromination with heterogeneously catalysed HBr
oxidation, a step that is usually executed separately. Catalyst-design strategies
to provide optimal synergy between these two processes are discussed. Among many 
investigated material families, vanadium phosphate (VPO) is identified as the
best oxybromination catalyst, as it provides selectivity for CH3Br up to 95% and 
stable operation for over 100 hours on stream. The outstanding performance of VPO
is rationalized by its high activity in HBr oxidation and low propensity for
methane and bromomethane oxidation. Data on the oxybromination of ethane and
propane over VPO suggest that the reaction network for higher alkanes is more
complex.

Studies of transuranic organometallic complexes provide a particularly valuable
insight into covalent contributions to the metal-ligand bonding, in which the
subtle differences between the transuranium actinide ions and their lighter
lanthanide counterparts are of fundamental importance for the effective
remediation of nuclear waste. Unlike the organometallic chemistry of uranium,
which has focused strongly on U(III) and has seen some spectacular advances, that
of the transuranics is significantly technically more challenging and has
remained dormant. In the case of neptunium, it is limited mainly to Np(IV). Here 
we report the synthesis of three new Np(III) organometallic compounds and the
characterization of their molecular and electronic structures. These studies
suggest that Np(III) complexes could act as single-molecule magnets, and that the
lower oxidation state of Np(II) is chemically accessible. In comparison with
lanthanide analogues, significant d- and f-electron contributions to key Np(III) 
orbitals are observed, which shows that fundamental neptunium organometallic
chemistry can provide new insights into the behaviour of f-elements.

Cyclic polymers have dramatically different physical properties compared with
those of their equivalent linear counterparts. However, the exploration of cyclic
polymers is limited because of the inherent challenges associated with their
synthesis. Conjugated linear polyacetylenes are important materials for
electrical conductivity, paramagnetic susceptibility, optical nonlinearity,
photoconductivity, gas permeability, liquid crystallinity and chain helicity.
However, their cyclic analogues are unknown, and therefore the ability to examine
how a cyclic topology influences their properties is currently not possible. We
have solved this challenge and now report a tungsten catalyst supported by a
tetraanionic pincer ligand that can rapidly polymerize alkynes to form conjugated
macrocycles in high yield. The catalyst works by tethering the ends of the
polymer to the metal centre to overcome the inherent entropic penalty of
cyclization. Gel-permeation chromatography, dynamic and static light scattering, 
viscometry and chemical tests are all consistent with theoretical predictions and
provide unambiguous confirmation of a cyclic topology. Access to a wide variety
of new cyclic polymers is now possible by simply choosing the appropriate alkyne 
monomer.

The noble gases are the most inert group of the periodic table, but their
reactivity increases with pressure. Diamond-anvil-cell experiments and ab initio 
modelling have been used to investigate a possible direct reaction between xenon 
and oxygen at high pressures. We have now synthesized two oxides below 100 GPa
(Xe2O5 under oxygen-rich conditions, and Xe3O2 under oxygen-poor conditions),
which shows that xenon is more reactive under pressure than predicted previously.
Xe2O5 was observed using X-ray diffraction methods, its structure identified
through ab initio random structure searching and confirmed using X-ray absorption
and Raman spectroscopies. The experiments confirm the recent prediction of Xe3O2 
as a stable xenon oxide under high pressure. Xenon atoms adopt mixed oxidation
states of 0 and +4 in Xe3O2 and +4 and +6 in Xe2O5. Xe3O2 and Xe2O5 form extended
networks that incorporate oxygen-sharing XeO4 squares, and Xe2O5 additionally
incorporates oxygen-sharing XeO5 pyramids. Other xenon oxides (XeO2, XeO3) are
expected to form at higher pressures.

Semiconductor electrodes capable of using solar photons to drive water-splitting 
reactions, such as haematite (α-Fe2O3), have been the subject of tremendous
interest over recent decades. The surface has been found to play a significant
role in determining the efficiency of water oxidation with haematite; however,
previous works have only allowed hypotheses to be formulated regarding the
identity of relevant surface species. Here we investigate the water-oxidation
reaction on haematite using infrared spectroscopy under photoelectrochemical
(PEC) water-oxidation conditions. A potential- and light-dependent absorption
peak at 898 cm(-1) is assigned to a Fe(IV)=O group, which is an intermediate in
the PEC water-oxidation reaction. These results provide direct evidence of
high-valent iron-oxo intermediates as the product of the first hole-transfer
reaction on the haematite surface and represent an important step in establishing
the mechanism of PEC water oxidation on semiconductor electrodes.

Organofluorine compounds are central to modern chemistry, and broadly applicable 
transformations that generate them efficiently and enantioselectively are in much
demand. Here we introduce efficient catalytic methods for the addition of allyl
and allenyl organoboron reagents to fluorine-substituted ketones. These reactions
are facilitated by readily and inexpensively available catalysts and deliver
versatile and otherwise difficult-to-access tertiary homoallylic alcohols in up
to 98% yield and >99:1 enantiomeric ratio. Utility is highlighted by a concise
enantioselective approach to the synthesis of the antiparasitic drug fluralaner
(Bravecto, presently sold as the racemate). Different forms of
ammonium-organofluorine interactions play a key role in the control of
enantioselectivity. The greater understanding of various non-bonding interactions
afforded by these studies should facilitate the future development of
transformations that involve fluoroorganic entities.

Analog molecular circuits can exploit the nonlinear nature of biochemical
reaction networks to compute low-precision outputs with fewer resources than
digital circuits. This analog computation is similar to that employed by
gene-regulation networks. Although digital systems have a tractable link between 
structure and function, the nonlinear and continuous nature of analog circuits
yields an intricate functional landscape, which makes their design
counter-intuitive, their characterization laborious and their analysis delicate. 
Here, using droplet-based microfluidics, we map with high resolution and
dimensionality the bifurcation diagrams of two synthetic, out-of-equilibrium and 
nonlinear programs: a bistable DNA switch and a predator-prey DNA oscillator. The
diagrams delineate where function is optimal, dynamics bifurcates and models
fail. Inverse problem solving on these large-scale data sets indicates
interference from enzymatic coupling. Additionally, data mining exposes the
presence of rare, stochastically bursting oscillators near deterministic
bifurcations.

The consequence of unpaired electrons in organic molecules has fascinated and
confounded chemists for over a century. The study of open-shell molecules has
been rekindled in recent years as new synthetic methods, improved spectroscopic
techniques and powerful computational tools have been brought to bear on this
field. Nonetheless, it is the intrinsic instability of the biradical species that
limits the practicality of this research. Here we report the synthesis and
characterization of a molecule based on the diindeno[b,i]anthracene framework
that exhibits pronounced open-shell character yet possesses remarkable stability.
The synthetic route is rapid, efficient and possible on the gram scale. The
molecular structure was confirmed through single-crystal X-ray diffraction. From 
variable-temperature Raman spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility measurements 
a thermally accessible triplet excited state was found. Organic field-effect
transistor device data show an ambipolar performance with balanced electron and
hole mobilities. Our results demonstrate the rational design and synthesis of an 
air- and temperature-stable biradical compound.

Self-sorted supramolecular nanofibres-a multicomponent system that consists of
several types of fibre, each composed of distinct building units-play a crucial
role in complex, well-organized systems with sophisticated functions, such as
living cells. Designing and controlling self-sorting events in synthetic
materials and understanding their structures and dynamics in detail are important
elements in developing functional artificial systems. Here, we describe the in
situ real-time imaging of self-sorted supramolecular nanofibre hydrogels
consisting of a peptide gelator and an amphiphilic phosphate. The use of
appropriate fluorescent probes enabled the visualization of self-sorted fibres
entangled in two and three dimensions through confocal laser scanning microscopy 
and super-resolution imaging, with 80 nm resolution. In situ time-lapse imaging
showed that the two types of fibre have different formation rates and that their 
respective physicochemical properties remain intact in the gel. Moreover, we
directly visualized stochastic non-synchronous fibre formation and observed a
cooperative mechanism.

The metals of the s block of the periodic table are well known to be exceptional 
electron donors, and the vast majority of their molecular complexes therefore
contain these metals in their fully oxidized form. Low-valent main-group
compounds have recently become desirable synthetic targets owing to their
interesting reactivities, sometimes on a par with those of transition-metal
complexes. In this work, we used stabilizing cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene ligands
to isolate and characterize the first neutral compounds that contain a
zero-valent s-block metal, beryllium. These brightly coloured complexes display
very short beryllium-carbon bond lengths and linear beryllium coordination
geometries, indicative of strong multiple Be-C bonding. Structural, spectroscopic
and theoretical results show that the complexes adopt a closed-shell singlet
configuration with a Be(0) metal centre. The surprising stability of the molecule
can be ascribed to an unusually strong three-centre two-electron π bond across
the C-Be-C unit.

Dissipative self-assembly is exploited by nature to control important biological 
functions, such as cell division, motility and signal transduction. The ability
to construct synthetic supramolecular assemblies that require the continuous
consumption of energy to remain in the functional state is an essential premise
for the design of synthetic systems with lifelike properties. Here, we show a new
strategy for the dissipative self-assembly of functional supramolecular
structures with high structural complexity. It relies on the transient
stabilization of vesicles through noncovalent interactions between the
surfactants and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which acts as the chemical fuel. It
is shown that the lifetime of the vesicles can be regulated by controlling the
hydrolysis rate of ATP. The vesicles sustain a chemical reaction but only as long
as chemical fuel is present to keep the system in the out-of-equilibrium state.
The lifetime of the vesicles determines the amount of reaction product produced
by the system.

One- and two-dimensional carbon nanomaterials are attracting considerable
attention because of their extraordinary electrical, mechanical and thermal
properties, which could lead to a range of important potential applications.
Synthetic processes associated with making these materials can be quite complex
and also consume large amounts of energy, so a major challenge is to develop
simple and efficient methods to produce them. Here, we present a self-templated, 
catalyst-free strategy for the synthesis of one-dimensional carbon nanorods by
morphology-preserved thermal transformation of rod-shaped metal-organic
frameworks. The as-synthesized non-hollow (solid) carbon nanorods can be
transformed into two- to six-layered graphene nanoribbons through sonochemical
treatment followed by chemical activation. The performance of these metal-organic
framework-derived carbon nanorods and graphene nanoribbons in supercapacitor
electrodes demonstrates that this synthetic approach can produce functionally
useful materials. Moreover, this approach is readily scalable and could be used
to produce carbon nanorods and graphene nanoribbons on industrial levels.

A dominant theme within the research on two-dimensional chirality is the
sergeant-soldiers principle, wherein a small fraction of chiral molecules
(sergeants) is used to skew the handedness of achiral molecules (soldiers) to
generate a homochiral surface. Here, we have combined the sergeant-soldiers
principle with temperature-dependent molecular self-assembly to unravel a
peculiar chiral amplification mechanism at the solution-solid interface in which,
depending on the concentration of a sergeant-soldiers solution, the majority
handedness of the system can either be amplified or entirely reversed after an
annealing step, furnishing a homochiral surface. Two discrete pathways that
affect different stages of two-dimensional crystal growth are invoked for
rationalizing this phenomenon and we present a set of experiments where the
access to each pathway can be precisely controlled. These results demonstrate
that a detailed understanding of subtle intermolecular and interfacial
interactions can be used to induce drastic changes in the handedness of a
supramolecular network.

Absorption of sunlight is the first step in photosynthesis, which provides energy
for the vast majority of organisms on Earth. The primary processes of
photosynthesis have been studied extensively in isolated light-harvesting
complexes and reaction centres, however, to understand fully the way in which
organisms capture light it is crucial to also reveal the functional relationships
between the individual complexes. Here we report the use of two-dimensional
electronic spectroscopy to track directly the excitation-energy flow through the 
entire photosynthetic system of green sulfur bacteria. We unravel the functional 
organization of individual complexes in the photosynthetic unit and show that,
whereas energy is transferred within subunits on a timescale of subpicoseconds to
a few picoseconds, across the complexes the energy flows at a timescale of tens
of picoseconds. Thus, we demonstrate that the bottleneck of energy transfer is
between the constituents.

The overwhelmingly homochiral nature of life has left a puzzle as to whether
mirror-image biological systems based on a chirally inverted version of molecular
machinery could also have existed. Here we report that two key steps in the
central dogma of molecular biology, the template-directed polymerization of DNA
and transcription into RNA, can be catalysed by a chemically synthesized D-amino 
acid polymerase on an L-DNA template. We also show that two chirally mirrored
versions of the 174-residue African swine fever virus polymerase X could operate 
in a racemic mixture without significant enantiomeric cross-inhibition to the
activity of each other. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a functionally active
L-DNAzyme could be enzymatically produced using the D-amino acid polymerase. The 
establishment of such molecular systems with an opposite handedness highlights
the potential to exploit enzymatically produced mirror-image biomolecules as
research and therapeutic tools.

Lithium-ion batteries are now reaching the energy density limits set by their
electrode materials, requiring new paradigms for Li(+) and electron hosting in
solid-state electrodes. Reversible oxygen redox in the solid state in particular 
has the potential to enable high energy density as it can deliver excess capacity
beyond the theoretical transition-metal redox-capacity at a high voltage.
Nevertheless, the structural and chemical origin of the process is not
understood, preventing the rational design of better cathode materials. Here, we 
demonstrate how very specific local Li-excess environments around oxygen atoms
necessarily lead to labile oxygen electrons that can be more easily extracted and
participate in the practical capacity of cathodes. The identification of the
local structural components that create oxygen redox sets a new direction for the
design of high-energy-density cathode materials.

During the charging and discharging of lithium-ion-battery cathodes through the
de- and reintercalation of lithium ions, electroneutrality is maintained by
transition-metal redox chemistry, which limits the charge that can be stored.
However, for some transition-metal oxides this limit can be broken and oxygen
loss and/or oxygen redox reactions have been proposed to explain the phenomenon. 
We present operando mass spectrometry of (18)O-labelled
Li1.2[Ni0.13(2+)Co0.13(3+)Mn0.54(4+)]O2, which demonstrates that oxygen is
extracted from the lattice on charging a Li1.2[Ni0.13(2+)Co0.13(3+)Mn0.54(4+)]O2 
cathode, although we detected no O2 evolution. Combined soft X-ray absorption
spectroscopy, resonant inelastic X-ray scattering spectroscopy, X-ray absorption 
near edge structure spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy demonstrates that, in
addition to oxygen loss, Li(+) removal is charge compensated by the formation of 
localized electron holes on O atoms coordinated by Mn(4+) and Li(+) ions, which
serve to promote the localization, and not the formation, of true O2(2-)
(peroxide, O-O ~1.45 Å) species. The quantity of charge compensated by oxygen
removal and by the formation of electron holes on the O atoms is estimated, and
for the case described here the latter dominates.

Chemical transformations at the interface between solid/liquid or solid/gaseous
phases of matter lie at the heart of key industrial-scale manufacturing
processes. A comprehensive study of the molecular energetics and conformational
dynamics that underlie these transformations is often limited to
ensemble-averaging analytical techniques. Here we report the detailed
investigation of a surface-catalysed cross-coupling and sequential cyclization
cascade of 1,2-bis(2-ethynyl phenyl)ethyne on Ag(100). Using non-contact atomic
force microscopy, we imaged the single-bond-resolved chemical structure of
transient metastable intermediates. Theoretical simulations indicate that the
kinetic stabilization of experimentally observable intermediates is determined
not only by the potential-energy landscape, but also by selective energy
dissipation to the substrate and entropic changes associated with key
transformations along the reaction pathway. The microscopic insights gained here 
pave the way for the rational design and control of complex organic reactions at 
the surface of heterogeneous catalysts.

S-Nitrosothiols are known as reagents for NO storage and transportation and as
regulators in many physiological processes. Although the S-nitrosylation
catalysed by haem proteins is well known, no direct evidence of S-nitrosylation
in copper proteins has been reported. Here, we report reversible insertion of NO 
into a copper-thiolate bond in an engineered copper centre in Pseudomonas
aeruginosa azurin by rational design of the primary coordination sphere and
tuning its reduction potential by deleting a hydrogen bond in the secondary
coordination sphere. The results not only provide the first direct evidence of
S-nitrosylation of Cu(II)-bound cysteine in metalloproteins, but also shed light 
on the reaction mechanism and structural features responsible for stabilizing the
elusive Cu(I)-S(Cys)NO species. The fast, efficient and reversible
S-nitrosylation reaction is used to demonstrate its ability to prevent NO
inhibition of cytochrome bo3 oxidase activity by competing for NO binding with
the native enzyme under physiologically relevant conditions.

Nitric oxide (NO) participates in numerous biological processes, such as
signalling in the respiratory system and vasodilation in the cardiovascular
system. Many metal-mediated processes involve direct reaction of NO to form a
metal-nitrosyl (M-NO), as occurs at the Fe(2+) centres of soluble guanylate
cyclase or cytochrome c oxidase. However, some copper electron-transfer proteins 
that bear a type 1 Cu site (His2Cu-Cys) reversibly bind NO by an unknown motif.
Here, we use model complexes of type 1 Cu sites based on tris(pyrazolyl)borate
copper thiolates [Cu(II)]-SR to unravel the factors involved in NO reactivity.
Addition of NO provides the fully characterized S-nitrosothiol adduct
[Cu(I)](κ(1)-N(O)SR), which reversibly loses NO on purging with an inert gas.
Computational analysis outlines a low-barrier pathway for the capture and release
of NO. These findings suggest a new motif for reversible binding of NO at
bioinorganic metal centres that can interconvert NO and RSNO molecular signals at
copper sites.

The recognition of quasicrystals, which exhibit long-range order but lack
translational symmetry, represented both the introduction of a new class of
materials and a transformative breakthrough in crystallography. Concomitant with 
the exploration of quasicrystallinity, metal-organic architectures emerged as
promising and versatile systems with significant application potential. Their
building principles have been studied extensively and become manifest in a
multitude of intricate amorphous and crystalline phases. To date, however,
indications for quasicrystalline order have been elusive in metal-organic
coordination networks (MOCNs). Here we employ rare-earth-directed assembly to
construct a two-dimensional tiling with quasicrystalline characteristics at a
well-defined gold substrate. By careful stoichiometry control over europium
centres and functional linkers, we produced a porous network, including the
simultaneous expression of four-fold, five-fold and six-fold vertices. The
pertaining features were directly inspected by scanning tunnelling microscopy,
and the molecule-europium reticulation was recognized as square-triangle
tessellation with dodecagonal symmetry. Our findings introduce quasicrystallinity
in surface-confined MOCNs with a nanoporous structure and anticipate
functionalities that arise from quasicrystalline ordering of the coordinative
spheres.

The development of molecular materials whose physical properties can be
controlled by external stimuli - such as light, electric field, temperature, and 
pressure - has recently attracted much attention owing to their potential
applications in molecular devices. There are a number of ways to alter the
physical properties of crystalline materials. These include the modulation of the
spin and redox states of the crystal's components, or the incorporation within
the crystalline lattice of tunable molecules that exhibit stimuli-induced changes
in their molecular structure. A switching behaviour can also be induced by
changing the molecular orientation of the crystal's components, even in cases
where the overall molecular structure is not affected. Controlling intermolecular
interactions within a molecular material is also an effective tool to modulate
its physical properties. This Review discusses recent advances in the development
of such stimuli-responsive, switchable crystalline compounds - referred to here
as dynamic molecular crystals - and suggests how different approaches can serve
to prepare functional materials.

Hierarchically organized myosin and actin filaments found in biological systems
exhibit contraction and expansion behaviours that produce work and force by
consuming chemical energy. Inspired by these naturally occurring examples, we
have developed photoresponsive wet- and dry-type molecular actuators built from
rotaxane-based compounds known as [c2]daisy chains (specifically, [c2]AzoCD2
hydrogel and [c2]AzoCD2 xerogel). These actuators were prepared via
polycondensation between four-armed poly(ethylene glycol) and a [c2]daisy chain
based on α-cyclodextrin as the host component and azobenzene as a photoresponsive
guest component. The light-induced actuation arises from the sliding motion of
the [c2]daisy chain unit. Ultraviolet irradiation caused the gels to bend towards
the light source. The response of the [c2]AzoCD2 xerogel, even under dry
conditions, is very fast (7° every second), which is 10,800 times faster than the
[c2]AzoCD2 hydrogel (7° every 3 h). In addition, the [c2]AzoCD2 xerogel was used 
as a crane arm to lift an object using ultraviolet irradiation to produce
mechanical work.

It is a challenge to synthesize materials that possess the properties of
biological muscles-strong, elastic and capable of self-healing. Herein we report 
a network of poly(dimethylsiloxane) polymer chains crosslinked by coordination
complexes that combines high stretchability, high dielectric strength, autonomous
self-healing and mechanical actuation. The healing process can take place at a
temperature as low as -20 °C and is not significantly affected by surface ageing 
and moisture. The crosslinking complexes used consist of
2,6-pyridinedicarboxamide ligands that coordinate to Fe(III) centres through
three different interactions: a strong pyridyl-iron one, and two weaker
carboxamido-iron ones through both the nitrogen and oxygen atoms of the
carboxamide groups. As a result, the iron-ligand bonds can readily break and
re-form while the iron centres still remain attached to the ligands through the
stronger interaction with the pyridyl ring, which enables reversible unfolding
and refolding of the chains. We hypothesize that this behaviour supports the high
stretchability and self-healing capability of the material.

The mechanistic foundation behind the identity of a phosphine ligand that best
promotes a desired reaction outcome is often non-intuitive, and thus has been
addressed in numerous experimental and theoretical studies. In this work,
multivariate correlations of reaction outcomes using 38 different phosphine
ligands were combined with classic potentiometric analyses to study a Suzuki
reaction, for which the site selectivity of oxidative addition is highly
dependent on the nature of the phosphine. These studies shed light on the
generality of hypotheses regarding the structural influence of different classes 
of phosphine ligands on the reaction mechanism(s), and deliver a methodology that
should prove useful in future studies of phosphine ligands.

Understanding the kinetics and energetics of interfacial electron transfer in
molecular systems is crucial for the development of a broad array of
technologies, including photovoltaics, solar fuel systems and energy storage. The
Marcus formulation for electron transfer relates the thermodynamic driving force 
and reorganization energy for charge transfer between a given donor/acceptor pair
to the kinetics and yield of electron transfer. Here we investigated the
influence of the thermodynamic driving force for photoinduced electron transfer
(PET) between single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and fullerene derivatives
by employing time-resolved microwave conductivity as a sensitive probe of
interfacial exciton dissociation. For the first time, we observed the Marcus
inverted region (in which driving force exceeds reorganization energy) and
quantified the reorganization energy for PET for a model SWCNT/acceptor system.
The small reorganization energies (about 130 meV, most of which probably arises
from the fullerene acceptors) are beneficial in minimizing energy loss in
photoconversion schemes.

Functionalization of atomically thin nanomaterials enables the tailoring of their
chemical, optical and electronic properties. Exfoliated black phosphorus (BP)-a
layered two-dimensional semiconductor-exhibits favourable charge-carrier
mobility, tunable bandgap and highly anisotropic properties, but it is chemically
reactive and degrades rapidly in ambient conditions. Here we show that covalent
aryl diazonium functionalization suppresses the chemical degradation of
exfoliated BP even after three weeks of ambient exposure. This chemical
modification scheme spontaneously forms phosphorus-carbon bonds, has a reaction
rate sensitive to the aryl diazonium substituent and alters the electronic
properties of exfoliated BP, ultimately yielding a strong, tunable p-type doping 
that simultaneously improves the field-effect transistor mobility and on/off

Synthetic macrocycles derived from sequence-defined oligomers are a unique
structural class whose ring size, sequence and structure can be tuned via precise
organization of the primary sequence. Similar to peptides and other
peptidomimetics, these well-defined synthetic macromolecules become
pharmacologically relevant when bioactive side chains are incorporated into their
primary sequence. In this article, we report the synthesis of oligothioetheramide
(oligoTEA) macrocycles via a one-pot acid-catalysed cascade reaction. The
versatility of the cyclization chemistry and modularity of the assembly process
was demonstrated via the synthesis of >20 diverse oligoTEA macrocycles.
Structural characterization via NMR spectroscopy revealed the presence of
conformational isomers, which enabled the determination of local chain dynamics
within the macromolecular structure. Finally, we demonstrate the biological
activity of oligoTEA macrocycles designed to mimic facially amphiphilic
antimicrobial peptides. The preliminary results indicate that macrocyclic
oligoTEAs with just two-to-three cationic charge centres can elicit potent
antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

Industrial hydrogen production through methane steam reforming exceeds 50 million
tons annually and accounts for 2-5% of global energy consumption. The hydrogen
product, even after processing by the water-gas shift, still typically contains
∼1% CO, which must be removed for many applications. Methanation
(CO + 3H2 → CH4 + H2O) is an effective solution to this problem, but consumes
5-15% of the generated hydrogen. The preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO with O2 
in hydrogen represents a more-efficient solution. Supported gold nanoparticles,
with their high CO-oxidation activity and notoriously low hydrogenation activity,
have long been examined as PROX catalysts, but have shown disappointingly low
activity and selectivity. Here we show that, under the proper conditions, a
commercial Au/Al2O3 catalyst can remove CO to below 10 ppm and still maintain an 
O2-to-CO2 selectivity of 80-90%. The key to maximizing the catalyst activity and 
selectivity is to carefully control the feed-flow rate and maintain one to two
monolayers of water (a key CO-oxidation co-catalyst) on the catalyst surface.

Mimicking the ingenuity of nature and exploiting the billions of years over which
natural selection has developed numerous effective biochemical conversions is one
of the most successful strategies in a chemist's toolbox. However, an inability
to replicate the elegance and efficiency of the oxygen-evolving complex of
photosystem II (OEC-PSII) in its oxidation of water into O2 is a significant
bottleneck in the development of a closed-loop sustainable energy cycle. Here, we
present an artificial metallosupramolecular macrocycle that gathers three Ru(bda)
centres (bda = 2,2'-bipyridine-6,6'-dicarboxylic acid) that catalyses water
oxidation. The macrocyclic architecture accelerates the rate of water oxidation
via a water nucleophilic attack mechanism, similar to the mechanism exhibited by 
OEC-PSII, and reaches remarkable catalytic turnover frequencies >100 s(-1).
Photo-driven water oxidation yields outstanding activity, even in the nM
concentration regime, with a turnover number of >1,255 and turnover frequency of 
>13.1 s(-1).

Membraneless organelles are cellular compartments made from drops of liquid
protein inside a cell. These compartments assemble via the phase separation of
disordered regions of proteins in response to changes in the cellular environment
and the cell cycle. Here we demonstrate that the solvent environment within the
interior of these cellular bodies behaves more like an organic solvent than like 
water. One of the most-stable biological structures known, the DNA double helix, 
can be melted once inside the liquid droplet, and simultaneously structures
formed from regulatory single-stranded nucleic acids are stabilized. Moreover,
proteins are shown to have a wide range of absorption or exclusion from these
bodies, and can act as importers for otherwise-excluded nucleic acids, which
suggests the existence of a protein-mediated trafficking system. A common
strategy in organic chemistry is to utilize different solvents to influence the
behaviour of molecules and reactions. These results reveal that cells have also
evolved this capability by exploiting the interiors of membraneless organelles.

A variety of two-dimensional materials have been reported in recent years, yet
single-element systems such as graphene and black phosphorus have remained rare. 
Boron analogues have been predicted, as boron atoms possess a short covalent
radius and the flexibility to adopt sp(2) hybridization, features that favour the
formation of two-dimensional allotropes, and one example of such a borophene
material has been reported recently. Here, we present a parallel experimental
work showing that two-dimensional boron sheets can be grown epitaxially on a
Ag(111) substrate. Two types of boron sheet, a β12 sheet and a χ3 sheet, both
exhibiting a triangular lattice but with different arrangements of periodic
holes, are observed by scanning tunnelling microscopy. Density functional theory 
simulations agree well with experiments, and indicate that both sheets are planar
without obvious vertical undulations. The boron sheets are quite inert to
oxidization and interact only weakly with their substrate. We envisage that such 
boron sheets may find applications in electronic devices in the future.

The PCR amplification of oligonucleotides enables the evolution of sequences
called aptamers that bind specific targets with antibody-like affinity. However, 
in many applications the use of these aptamers is limited by nuclease-mediated
degradation. In contrast, oligonucleotides that are modified at their sugar C2'
positions with methoxy or fluorine substituents are stable to nucleases, but they
cannot be synthesized by natural polymerases. Here we report the development of a
polymerase-evolution system and its use to evolve thermostable polymerases that
efficiently interconvert C2'-OMe-modified oligonucleotides and their DNA
counterparts via 'transcription' and 'reverse transcription' or, more
importantly, that PCR-amplify partially C2'-OMe- or C2'-F-modified
oligonucleotides. A mechanistic analysis demonstrates that the ability to amplify
the modified oligonucleotides evolved by optimizing interdomain interactions that
stabilize the catalytically competent closed conformation of the polymerase. The 
evolved polymerases should find practical applications and the developed
evolution system should be a powerful tool for tailoring polymerases to have
other types of novel function.

Although the water oxidation cycle involves the critical step of O-O bond
formation, the transition metal oxide radical thought to be the catalytic
intermediate for this step has eluded direct observation. The radical represents 
the transformation of charge into a nascent catalytic intermediate, which lacks a
newly formed bond and is therefore inherently difficult to detect. Here, using
theoretical calculations and ultrafast in situ infrared spectroscopy of
photocatalysis at an n-SrTiO3/aqueous interface, we reveal a subsurface vibration
of the oxygen directly below, and uniquely generated by, the oxyl radical
(Ti-O(•)). Intriguingly, this interfacial Ti-O stretch vibration, once decoupled 
from the lattice, couples to reactant dynamics (water librations). These
experiments demonstrate subsurface vibrations and their coupling to solvent and
electron dynamics to detect nascent catalytic intermediates at the solid-liquid
interface at the molecular level. One can envision using the subsurface
vibrations and their coupling across the interface to track and control catalysis
dynamically.

Molecular machines that assemble polymers in a programmed sequence are
fundamental to life. They are also an achievable goal of nanotechnology. Here, we
report synthetic molecular machinery made from DNA that controls and records the 
formation of covalent bonds. We show that an autonomous cascade of DNA
hybridization reactions can create oligomers, from building blocks linked by
olefin or peptide bonds, with a sequence defined by a reconfigurable molecular
program. The system can also be programmed to achieve combinatorial assembly. The
sequence of assembly reactions and thus the structure of each oligomer
synthesized is recorded in a DNA molecule, which enables this information to be
recovered by PCR amplification followed by DNA sequencing.

Natural products and their molecular frameworks have a long tradition as valuable
starting points for medicinal chemistry and drug discovery. Recently, there has
been a revitalization of interest in the inclusion of these chemotypes in
compound collections for screening and achieving selective target modulation.
Here we discuss natural-product-inspired drug discovery with a focus on recent
advances in the design of synthetically tractable small molecules that mimic
nature's chemistry. We highlight the potential of innovative computational tools 
in processing structurally complex natural products to predict their
macromolecular targets and attempt to forecast the role that
natural-product-derived fragments and fragment-like natural products will play in
next-generation drug discovery.

The water dimer is an ideal chemical species with which to study hydrogen bonds. 
Owing to the equilibrium between the monomer and oligomer structure, however,
selective generation and separation of a genuine water dimer has not yet been
achieved. Here, we report a synthetic strategy that leads to the successful
encapsulation of one or two water molecules inside fullerene C70. These
endohedral C70 compounds offer the opportunity to study the intrinsic properties 
of a single water molecule without any hydrogen bonding, as well as an isolated
water dimer with a single hydrogen bond between the two molecules. The
unambiguously determined off-centre position of water in (H2O)2@C70 by X-ray
diffraction provides insights into the formation of (H2O)2@C70. Subsequently, the
(1)H NMR spectroscopic measurements for (H2O)2@C70 confirmed the formation of a
single hydrogen bond rapidly interchanging between the encapsulated water dimer. 
Our theoretical calculations revealed a peculiar cis-linear conformation of the
dimer resulting from confinement effects inside C70.

The hydroxyl radical is an important atmospheric oxidant, and a significant
source of its production occurs through alkene ozonolysis. This takes place via a
cycloaddition reaction and subsequent fragmentation to form an energized carbonyl
oxide (for example, CH3CHOO), known as a Criegee intermediate, which can then
either react with another atmospheric species or decay and, in doing so, produce 
the hydroxyl radical. Here, we examine the dissociation dynamics of a
prototypical Criegee intermediate by characterizing the translational and
internal energy distributions of the OH radical products, which reflect critical 
configurations along the reaction pathway. Experimentally, the kinetic energy
release to OH products is ascertained through velocity map imaging.
Theoretically, quasi-classical trajectories are performed on a new
full-dimensional, ab initio potential energy surface. Both experiment and theory 
show that most of the available energy flows into internal excitation of the
vinoxy products. The isotropic angular distribution of OH fragments indicates
that dissociation occurs in ≥2 ps, in agreement with theory.

Phase transitions that occur in materials, driven, for instance, by changes in
temperature or pressure, can dramatically change the materials' properties.
Discovering new types of transitions and understanding their mechanisms is
important not only from a fundamental perspective, but also for practical
applications. Here we investigate a recently discovered Fe4O5 that adopts an
orthorhombic CaFe3O5-type crystal structure that features linear chains of Fe
ions. On cooling below ∼150 K, Fe4O5 undergoes an unusual charge-ordering
transition that involves competing dimeric and trimeric ordering within the
chains of Fe ions. This transition is concurrent with a significant increase in
electrical resistivity. Magnetic-susceptibility measurements and neutron
diffraction establish the formation of a collinear antiferromagnetic order above 
room temperature and a spin canting at 85 K that gives rise to spontaneous
magnetization. We discuss possible mechanisms of this transition and compare it
with the trimeronic charge ordering observed in magnetite below the Verwey
transition temperature.

Carbon-sulfur bond formation at aliphatic positions is a challenging reaction
that is performed efficiently by radical S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) enzymes.
Here we report that 1,3-thiazolidines can act as ligands and substrates for the
radical SAM enzyme HydE, which is involved in the assembly of the active site of 
[FeFe]-hydrogenase. Using X-ray crystallography, in vitro assays and NMR
spectroscopy we identified a radical-based reaction mechanism that is best
described as the formation of a C-centred radical that concomitantly attacks the 
sulfur atom of a thioether. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
example of a radical SAM enzyme that reacts directly on a sulfur atom instead of 
abstracting a hydrogen atom. Using theoretical calculations based on our
high-resolution structures we followed the evolution of the electronic structure 
from SAM through to the formation of S-adenosyl-L-cysteine. Our results suggest
that, at least in this case, the widely proposed and highly reactive
5'-deoxyadenosyl radical species that triggers the reaction in radical SAM
enzymes is not an isolable intermediate.

The predictability, diversity and programmability of DNA make it a leading
candidate for the design of functional electronic devices that use single
molecules, yet its electron transport properties have not been fully elucidated. 
This is primarily because of a poor understanding of how the structure of DNA
determines its electron transport. Here, we demonstrate a DNA-based molecular
rectifier constructed by site-specific intercalation of small molecules
(coralyne) into a custom-designed 11-base-pair DNA duplex. Measured
current-voltage curves of the DNA-coralyne molecular junction show unexpectedly
large rectification with a rectification ratio of about 15 at 1.1 V, a
counter-intuitive finding considering the seemingly symmetrical molecular
structure of the junction. A non-equilibrium Green's function-based
model-parameterized by density functional theory calculations-revealed that the
coralyne-induced spatial asymmetry in the electron state distribution caused the 
observed rectification. This inherent asymmetry leads to changes in the coupling 
of the molecular HOMO-1 level to the electrodes when an external voltage is
applied, resulting in an asymmetric change in transmission.

Artificial lipid-bilayer membranes are valuable tools for the study of membrane
structure and dynamics. For applications such as the study of vesicular transport
and drug delivery, there is a pressing need for artificial vesicles with
controlled size. However, controlling vesicle size and shape with nanometre
precision is challenging, and approaches to achieve this can be heavily affected 
by lipid composition. Here, we present a bio-inspired templating method to
generate highly monodispersed sub-100-nm unilamellar vesicles, where liposome
self-assembly was nucleated and confined inside rigid DNA nanotemplates. Using
this method, we produce homogeneous liposomes with four distinct predefined
sizes. We also show that the method can be used with a variety of lipid
compositions and probe the mechanism of templated liposome formation by capturing
key intermediates during membrane self-assembly. The DNA nanotemplating strategy 
represents a conceptually novel way to guide lipid bilayer formation and could be
generalized to engineer complex membrane/protein structures with nanoscale
precision.

The rational synthesis of hierarchical three-dimensional nanostructures with
specific compositions, morphologies and functionalities is important for
applications in a variety of fields ranging from energy conversion and
electronics to biotechnology. Here, we report a seeded growth approach for the
controlled epitaxial growth of three types of hierarchical one-dimensional
(1D)/two-dimensional (2D) nanostructures, where nanorod arrays of II-VI
semiconductor CdS or CdSe are grown on the selective facets of hexagonal-shaped
nanoplates, either on the two basal facets of the nanoplate, or on one basal
facet, or on the two basal facets and six side facets. The seed engineering of 2D
hexagonal-shaped nanoplates is the key factor for growth of the three resulting
types of 1D/2D nanostructures. The wurtzite- and zinc-blende-type polymorphs of
semiconductors are used to determine the facet-selective epitaxial growth of 1D
nanorod arrays, resulting in the formation of different hierarchical
three-dimensional (3D) nanostructures.

The outermost protective layer of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria
is composed of bacterial capsular polysaccharides. Insights into the interactions
between the capsular polysaccharide and its transporter and the mechanism of
sugar export would not only increase our understanding of this key process, but
would also help in the design of novel therapeutics to block capsular
polysaccharide export. Here, we report a nanolitre detection system that makes
use of the bilayer interface between two droplets, and we use this system to
study single-molecule recapitulation of sugar export. A synthetic strategy of
polyglycosylation based on tetrasaccharide monomers enables ready synthetic
access to extended fragments of K30 oligosaccharides and polysaccharides.
Examination of the interactions between the Escherichia coli sugar transporter
Wza and very small amounts of fragments of the K30 capsular polysaccharide
substrate reveal the translocation of smaller but not larger fragments. We also
observe capture events that occur only on the intracellular side of Wza, which
would complement coordinated feeding by adjunct biosynthetic machinery.

The reactivity, speciation and solvation structure of CO2 in carbonate melts are 
relevant for both the fate of carbon in deep geological formations and for its
electroreduction to CO (to be used as fuel) when solvated in a molten carbonate
electrolyte. In particular, the high solubility of CO2 in carbonate melts has
been tentatively attributed to the formation of the pyrocarbonate anion,
C2O5(2-). Here we study, by first-principles molecular dynamics simulations, the 
behaviour of CO2 in molten calcium carbonate. We find that pyrocarbonate forms
spontaneously and the identity of the CO2 molecule is quickly lost through O(2-) 
exchange. The transport of CO2 in this molten carbonate thus occurs in a fashion 
similar to the Grotthuss mechanism in water, and is three times faster than
molecular diffusion. This shows that Grotthuss-like transport is more general
than previously thought.

The emergence of homeostatic mechanisms that enable maintenance of an
intracellular steady state during growth was critical to the advent of cellular
life. Here, we show that concentration-dependent reversible binding of short
oligonucleotides, of both specific and random sequence, can modulate ribozyme
activity. In both cases, catalysis is inhibited at high concentrations, and
dilution activates the ribozyme via inhibitor dissociation, thus maintaining
near-constant ribozyme specific activity throughout protocell growth. To mimic
the result of RNA synthesis within non-growing protocells, we co-encapsulated
high concentrations of ribozyme and oligonucleotides within fatty acid vesicles, 
and ribozyme activity was inhibited. Following vesicle growth, the resulting
internal dilution produced ribozyme activation. This simple physical system
enables a primitive homeostatic behaviour: the maintenance of constant ribozyme
activity per unit volume during protocell volume changes. We suggest that such
systems, wherein short oligonucleotides reversibly inhibit functional RNAs, could
have preceded sophisticated modern RNA regulatory mechanisms, such as those
involving miRNAs.

The solid phases of gold(I) and/or silver(I) cyanides are supramolecular
assemblies of inorganic polymer chains in which the key structural degrees of
freedom-namely, the relative vertical shifts of neighbouring chains-are
mathematically equivalent to the phase angles of rotating planar ('XY') spins.
Here, we show how the supramolecular interactions between chains can be tuned to 
mimic different magnetic interactions. In this way, the structures of gold(I)
and/or silver(I) cyanides reflect the phase behaviour of triangular XY magnets.
Complex magnetic states predicted for this family of magnets-including collective
spin-vortices of relevance to data storage applications-are realized in the
structural chemistry of these cyanide polymers. Our results demonstrate how
chemically simple inorganic materials can behave as structural analogues of
otherwise inaccessible 'toy' spin models and also how the theoretical
understanding of those models allows control over collective ('emergent')
phenomena in supramolecular systems.

The discharging and charging of batteries require ion transfer across phase
boundaries. In conventional lithium-ion batteries, Li(+) ions have to cross the
liquid electrolyte and only need to pass the electrode interfaces. Future
high-energy batteries may need to work as hybrids, and so serially combine a
liquid electrolyte and a solid electrolyte to suppress unwanted redox shuttles.
This adds new interfaces that might significantly decrease the cycling-rate
capability. Here we show that the interface between a typical fast-ion-conducting
solid electrolyte and a conventional liquid electrolyte is chemically unstable
and forms a resistive solid-liquid electrolyte interphase (SLEI). Insights into
the kinetics of this new type of interphase are obtained by impedance studies of 
a two-chamber cell. The chemistry of the SLEI, its growth with time and the
influence of water impurities are examined by state-of-the-art surface analysis
and depth profiling.

The dynamic motions of protein structural elements, particularly flexible loops, 
are intimately linked with diverse aspects of enzyme catalysis. Engineering of
these loop regions can alter protein stability, substrate binding and even
dramatically impact enzyme function. When these flexible regions are unresolvable
structurally, computational reconstruction in combination with large-scale
molecular dynamics simulations can be used to guide the engineering strategy.
Here we present a collaborative approach that consists of both experiment and
computation and led to the discovery of a single mutation in the F/G loop of the 
nitrating cytochrome P450 TxtE that simultaneously controls loop dynamics and
completely shifts the enzyme's regioselectivity from the C4 to the C5 position of
L-tryptophan. Furthermore, we find that this loop mutation is naturally present
in a subset of homologous nitrating P450s and confirm that these uncharacterized 
enzymes exclusively produce 5-nitro-L-tryptophan, a previously unknown
biosynthetic intermediate.

Methods to prepare proteins that include a specific modification at a desired
position are essential for understanding their cellular functions and physical
properties in living systems. Chemical protein synthesis, which relies on the
chemoselective ligation of unprotected peptides, enables the preparation of
modified proteins that are not easily fabricated by other methods. In contrast to
recombinant approaches, chemical synthesis can be used to prepare protein
analogues such as D-proteins, which are useful in protein structure determination
and the discovery of novel therapeutics. Post-translationally modifying proteins 
is another example where chemical protein synthesis proved itself as a powerful
approach for preparing samples with high homogeneity and in workable quantities. 
In this Review, we discuss the basic principles of the field, focusing on novel
chemoselective peptide ligation approaches such as native chemical ligation and
the recent advances based on this method with a proven record of success in the
synthesis of highly important protein targets.

The use of multivalent carbohydrate compounds to block cell-surface lectin
receptors is a promising strategy to inhibit the entry of pathogens into cells
and could lead to the discovery of novel antiviral agents. One of the main
problems with this approach, however, is that it is difficult to make compounds
of an adequate size and multivalency to mimic natural systems such as viruses.
Hexakis adducts of [60]fullerene are useful building blocks in this regard
because they maintain a globular shape at the same time as allowing control over 
the size and multivalency. Here we report water-soluble tridecafullerenes
decorated with 120 peripheral carbohydrate subunits, so-called 'superballs', that
can be synthesized efficiently from hexakis adducts of [60]fullerene in one step 
by using copper-catalysed azide–alkyne cycloaddition click chemistry. Infection
assays show that these superballs are potent inhibitors of cell infection by an
artificial Ebola virus with half-maximum inhibitory concentrations in the
subnanomolar range.

Magnetic fields as weak as the Earth's can change the yields of radical pair
reactions even though the energies involved are orders of magnitude smaller than 
the thermal energy, kBT, at room temperature. Proposed as the source of the
light-dependent magnetic compass in migratory birds, the radical pair mechanism
is thought to operate in cryptochrome flavoproteins in the retina. Here we
demonstrate that the primary magnetic field effect on flavin photoreactions can
be amplified chemically by slow radical termination reactions under conditions of
continuous photoexcitation. The nature and origin of the amplification are
revealed by studies of the intermolecular flavin-tryptophan and flavin-ascorbic
acid photocycles and the closely related intramolecular flavin-tryptophan radical
pair in cryptochrome. Amplification factors of up to 5.6 were observed for
magnetic fields weaker than 1 mT. Substantial chemical amplification could have a
significant impact on the viability of a cryptochrome-based magnetic compass
sensor.

The fabrication of porous coordination frameworks in thin-film forms has been
investigated intensively with a view to using their structural response to
external stimuli and guests for potential nanotechnological applications, for
example as membranes for gas separation. Here we report a coordination framework 
that exhibits a dynamic guest-sorption behaviour in a nanometre-sized thin-film
form (16 nm thick), yet shows no guest uptake in the bulk. Highly oriented
crystalline thin films of this coordination framework--which consists of
interdigitated two-dimensional layers of {Fe(py)2[Pt(CN)4]} (py, pyridine)--were 
fabricated through liquid-phase layer-by-layer synthesis. The resulting thin film
exhibited a clear guest uptake with a structural transformation of the
gate-opening type as characterized by in situ X-ray diffraction. Increasing the
film's thickness markedly suppressed this behaviour. We envisage that such a
crystal-downsizing effect may be observed with other coordination frameworks, and
may be of use to develop functional materials, for example, for switching or
sensing devices.

The ability of DNA to store and encode information arises from base pairing of
the four-letter nucleobase code to form a double helix. Expanding this DNA
'alphabet' by synthetic incorporation of new bases can introduce new
functionalities and enable the formation of novel nucleic acid structures.
However, reprogramming the self-assembly of existing nucleobases presents an
alternative route to expand the structural space and functionality of nucleic
acids. Here we report the discovery that a small molecule, cyanuric acid, with
three thymine-like faces, reprogrammes the assembly of unmodified poly(adenine)
(poly(A)) into stable, long and abundant fibres with a unique internal structure.
Poly(A) DNA, RNA and peptide nucleic acid (PNA) all form these assemblies. Our
studies are consistent with the association of adenine and cyanuric acid units
into a hexameric rosette, which brings together poly(A) triplexes with a
subsequent cooperative polymerization. Fundamentally, this study shows that small
hydrogen-bonding molecules can be used to induce the assembly of nucleic acids in
water, which leads to new structures from inexpensive and readily available
materials.

The ability to form multiple carbon-carbon bonds in a controlled sequence and
thus rapidly build molecular complexity in an iterative fashion is an important
goal in modern chemical synthesis. In recent times, transition-metal-catalysed
coupling reactions have dominated in the development of C-C bond forming
processes. A desire to reduce the reliance on precious metals and a need to
obtain products with very low levels of metal impurities has brought a renewed
focus on metal-free coupling processes. Here, we report the in situ preparation
of reactive allylic and benzylic boronic acids, obtained by reacting
flow-generated diazo compounds with boronic acids, and their application in
controlled iterative C-C bond forming reactions is described. Thus far we have
shown the formation of up to three C-C bonds in a sequence including the final
trapping of a reactive boronic acid species with an aldehyde to generate a range 
of new chemical structures.

Enzymes use binding energy to stabilize their substrates in high-energy states
that are otherwise inaccessible at ambient temperature. Here we show that a de
novo designed Zn(II) metalloprotein stabilizes a chemically reactive organic
radical that is otherwise unstable in aqueous media. The protein binds tightly to
and stabilizes the radical semiquinone form of 3,5-di-tert-butylcatechol.
Solution NMR spectroscopy in conjunction with molecular dynamics simulations show
that the substrate binds in the active site pocket where it is stabilized by
metal-ligand interactions as well as by burial of its hydrophobic groups.
Spectrochemical redox titrations show that the protein stabilized the semiquinone
by reducing the electrochemical midpoint potential for its formation via the
one-electron oxidation of the catechol by approximately 400 mV (9 kcal mol(-1)). 
Therefore, the inherent chemical properties of the radical were changed
drastically by harnessing its binding energy to the metalloprotein. This model
sets the basis for designed enzymes with radical cofactors to tackle challenging 
chemistry.

Interfaces between different materials underpin both new scientific phenomena,
such as the emergent behaviour at oxide interfaces, and key technologies, such as
that of the transistor. Control of the interfaces between materials with the same
crystal structures but different chemical compositions is possible in many
materials classes, but less progress has been made for oxide materials with
different crystal structures. We show that dynamical self-organization during
growth can create a coherent interface between the perovskite and fluorite oxide 
structures, which are based on different structural motifs, if an appropriate
choice of cations is made to enable this restructuring. The integration of
calculation with experimental observation reveals that the interface differs from
both the bulk components and identifies the chemical bonding requirements to
connect distinct oxide structures.

A new class of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) from HIV donors has been
reported to target the glycans on gp120--a glycoprotein found on the surface of
the virus envelope--thus renewing hope of developing carbohydrate-based HIV
vaccines. However, the version of gp120 used in previous studies was not from
human T cells and so the glycosylation pattern could be somewhat different to
that found in the native system. Moreover, some antibodies recognized two
different glycans simultaneously and this cannot be detected with the commonly
used glycan microarrays on glass slides. Here, we have developed a glycan
microarray on an aluminium-oxide-coated glass slide containing a diverse set of
glycans, including homo- and mixed N-glycans (high-mannose, hybrid and complex
types) that were prepared by modular chemo-enzymatic methods to detect the
presence of hetero-glycan binding behaviours. This new approach allows rapid
screening and identification of optimal glycans recognized by neutralizing
antibodies, and could speed up the development of HIV-1 vaccines targeting cell
surface glycans.

Kinetic models based on first principles are becoming common place in
heterogeneous catalysis because of their ability to interpret experimental data, 
identify the rate-controlling step, guide experiments and predict novel
materials. To overcome the tremendous computational cost of estimating parameters
of complex networks on metal catalysts, approximate quantum mechanical
calculations are employed that render models potentially inaccurate. Here, by
introducing correlative global sensitivity analysis and uncertainty
quantification, we show that neglecting correlations in the energies of species
and reactions can lead to an incorrect identification of influential parameters
and key reaction intermediates and reactions. We rationalize why models often
underpredict reaction rates and show that, despite the uncertainty being large,
the method can, in conjunction with experimental data, identify influential
missing reaction pathways and provide insights into the catalyst active site and 
the kinetic reliability of a model. The method is demonstrated in ethanol steam
reforming for hydrogen production for fuel cells.

In biomineralization, inorganic materials are formed with remarkable control of
the shape and morphology. Chirality, as present in the biomolecular world, is
therefore also common for biominerals. Biomacromolecules, like proteins and
polysaccharides, are in direct contact with the mineral phase and act as
modifiers during nucleation and crystal growth. Owing to their
homochirality--they exist only as one of two possible mirror-symmetric
isomers--their handedness is often transferred into the macroscopic shape of the 
biomineral crystals, but the way in which handedness is transmitted into achiral 
materials is not yet understood at the atomic level. By using the submolecular
resolution capability of scanning tunnelling microscopy, supported by
photoelectron diffraction and density functional theory, we show how the chiral
'buckybowl' hemibuckminsterfullerene arranges copper surface atoms in its
vicinity into a chiral morphology. We anticipate that such new insight will find 
its way into materials synthesis techniques.

In ribosomal polypeptide synthesis the library of amino acid building blocks is
limited by the manner in which codons are used. Of the proteinogenic amino acids,
18 are coded for by multiple codons and therefore many of the 61 sense codons can
be considered redundant. Here we report a method to reduce the redundancy of
codons by artificially dividing codon boxes to create vacant codons that can then
be reassigned to non-proteinogenic amino acids and thereby expand the library of 
genetically encoded amino acids. To achieve this, we reconstituted a cell-free
translation system with 32 in vitro transcripts of transfer RNASNN (tRNASNN) (S =
G or C), assigning the initiator and 20 elongator amino acids. Reassignment of
three redundant codons was achieved by replacing redundant tRNASNNs with tRNASNNs
pre-charged with non-proteinogenic amino acids. As a demonstration, we expressed 
a 32-mer linear peptide that consists of 20 proteinogenic and three
non-proteinogenic amino acids, and a 14-mer macrocyclic peptide that contains
more than four non-proteinogenic amino acids.

Millions of years of evolution have produced biological systems capable of
efficient one-pot multi-step catalysis. The underlying mechanisms that facilitate
these reaction processes are increasingly providing inspiration in synthetic
chemistry. Substrate channelling, where intermediates between enzymatic steps are
not in equilibrium with the bulk solution, enables increased efficiencies and
yields in reaction and diffusion processes. Here, we review different mechanisms 
of substrate channelling found in nature and provide an overview of the
analytical methods used to quantify these effects. The incorporation of substrate
channelling into synthetic cascades is a rapidly developing concept, and recent
examples of the fabrication of cascades with controlled diffusion and flux of
intermediates are presented.

Despite the growing importance of organofluorines as pharmaceuticals and
agrochemicals, the stereoselective introduction of fluorine into many prominent
classes of natural products and chemotherapeutic agents is difficult. One
long-standing unsolved challenge is the enantioselective aldol reaction of
fluoroacetate to enable access to fluorinated analogues of medicinally relevant
acetate-derived compounds, such as polyketides and statins. Herein we present
fluoromalonic acid halfthioesters as biomimetic surrogates of fluoroacetate and
demonstrate their use in highly stereoselective aldol reactions that proceed
under mild organocatalytic conditions. We also show that the methodology can be
extended to formal aldol reactions with fluoroacetaldehyde and consecutive aldol 
reactions. The synthetic utility of the fluorinated aldol products is illustrated
by the synthesis of a fluorinated derivative of the top-selling drug
atorvastatin. The results show the prospects of the method for the
enantioselective introduction of fluoroacetate to access a wide variety of highly
functionalized fluorinated compounds.

The mechanical flexibility of coordination frameworks can lead to a range of
highly anomalous structural behaviours. Here, we demonstrate the extreme
compressibility of the LnFe(CN)6 frameworks (Ln = Ho, Lu or Y), which reversibly 
compress by 20% in volume under the relatively low pressure of 1 GPa, one of the 
largest known pressure responses for any crystalline material. We delineate in
detail the mechanism for this high compressibility, where the LnN6 units act like
torsion springs synchronized by rigid Fe(CN)6 units performing the role of gears.
The materials also show significant negative linear compressibility via a
cam-like effect. The torsional mechanism is fundamentally distinct from the
deformation mechanisms prevalent in other flexible solids and relies on
competition between locally unstable metal coordination geometries and the
constraints of the framework connectivity, a discovery that has implications for 
the strategic design of new materials with exceptional mechanical properties.

How new species emerge in nature is still incompletely understood and difficult
to study directly. Self-replicating molecules provide a simple model that allows 
us to capture the fundamental processes that occur in species formation. We have 
been able to monitor in real time and at a molecular level the diversification of
self-replicating molecules into two distinct sets that compete for two different 
building blocks ('food') and so capture an important aspect of the process by
which species may arise. The results show that the second replicator set is a
descendant of the first and that both sets are kinetic products that oppose the
thermodynamic preference of the system. The sets occupy related but complementary
food niches. As diversification into sets takes place on the timescale of weeks
and can be investigated at the molecular level, this work opens up new
opportunities for experimentally investigating the process through which species 
arise both in real time and with enhanced detail.

Until recently, it was widely regarded that only one reaction pathway led to the 
production of molecular oxygen in Earth's prebiotic primitive atmosphere: a
three-body recombination reaction of two oxygen atoms and a third body that
removes excess energy. However, an additional pathway has recently been observed 
that involves the photodissociation of CO2 on exposure to ultraviolet light. Here
we demonstrate a further pathway to O2 production, again from CO2, but via
dissociative electron attachment (DEA). Using anion-velocity image mapping, we
provide experimental evidence for a channel of DEA to CO2 that produces
O2(X(3)Σ(-)g) + C(-). This observed channel coexists in the same energy range as 
the competitive three-body dissociation of CO2 to give O + O + C(-). The
abundance of low-energy electrons in interstellar space and the upper atmosphere 
of Earth suggests that the contributions of these pathways are significant and
should be incorporated into atmospheric chemistry models.

Interpenetration, the entwining of multiple lattices, is a common phenomenon in
metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Typically, in interpenetrated MOFs the
sub-lattices are fully occupied. Here we report a family of MOFs in which one
sub-lattice is fully occupied and the occupancy level of the other can be
controlled during synthesis to produce frameworks with variable levels of partial
interpenetration. We also report an 'autocatenation' process, a transformation of
non-interpenetrated lattices into doubly interpenetrated frameworks via
progressively higher degrees of interpenetration that involves no external
reagents. Autocatenation maintains crystallinity and can be triggered either
thermally or by shear forces. The ligand used to construct these MOFs is chiral, 
and both racemic and enantiopure partially interpenetrated frameworks can be
accessed. X-ray diffraction, nonlinear optical microscopy and theoretical
calculations offer insights into the structures and dynamic behaviour of these
materials and the growth mechanisms of interpenetrated MOFs.

Certain non-mammalian cell wall sugars are conserved across a variety of
pathogenic bacteria. This conservation of structure, combined with their
structural differences when compared with mammalian sugars, make them potentially
powerful epitopes for immunization. Here, we report the synthesis of a
glycoconjugate that displays the so-called 'inner core' sugars of Gram-negative
bacterial cell walls. We also describe an antibacterial vaccination strategy
based on immunization with the glycoconjugate and the subsequent administration
of an inhibitor that uncovers the corresponding epitope in pathogenic bacteria.
The core tetrasaccharide, Hep2Kdo2, a common motif in bacterial
lipopolysaccharides, was synthesized and attached via a chain linker to a
diphtheria toxin mutant carrier protein. This glycoconjugate generated titres of 
antibodies towards the inner core tetrasaccharide of the lipopolysaccharide,
which were capable of binding the cell-surface sugars of bacterial pathogenic
strains including Neisseria meningitidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia 
coli. Exposure of bacterial lipopolysaccharide in in vitro experiments, using an 
inhibitor of capsular polysaccharide transport, enabled potent bacterial killing 
with antiserum.

Metal centres in biomolecules are recognized as being particularly sensitive to
radiation damage by X-ray photons. This results in such molecules being both
susceptible to an effective X-ray-induced loss of function and problematic to
study using X-ray diffraction methods, with reliable structures of the metal
centres difficult to obtain. Despite the abundance of experimental evidence, the 
mechanistic details of radiation damage at metal centres are unclear. Here, using
ab initio calculations, we show that the absorption of X-rays by microsolvated
Mg(2+) results in a complicated chain of ultrafast electronic relaxation steps
that comprise both intra- and intermolecular processes and last for a few hundred
femtoseconds. At the end of this cascade the metal reverts to its original charge
state, the immediate environment becomes multiply ionized and large
concentrations of radicals and slow electrons build up in the metal's vicinity.
We conclude that such cascades involving metal ions are essential to our
understanding of radiation chemistry and radiation damage in biological
environments.

The hollow cavities of coordination cages can provide an environment for
enzyme-like catalytic reactions of small-molecule guests. Here, we report a new
example (catalysis of the Kemp elimination reaction of benzisoxazole with
hydroxide to form 2-cyanophenolate) in the cavity of a water-soluble M8L12
coordination cage, with two features of particular interest. First, the rate
enhancement is among the largest observed to date: at pD 8.5, the value of
kcat/kuncat is 2 × 10(5), due to the accumulation of a high concentration of
partially desolvated hydroxide ions around the bound guest arising from
ion-pairing with the 16+ cage. Second, the catalysis is based on two orthogonal
interactions: (1) hydrophobic binding of benzisoxazole in the cavity and (2)
polar binding of hydroxide ions to sites on the cage surface, both of which were 
established by competition experiments.

Tuning reagent and catalyst concentrations is crucial in the development of
efficient catalytic transformations. In enzyme-catalysed reactions the substrate 
is bound-often by multiple non-covalent interactions-in a well-defined pocket
close to the active site of the enzyme; this pre-organization facilitates highly 
efficient transformations. Here we report an artificial system that
co-encapsulates multiple catalysts and substrates within the confined space
defined by an M12L24 nanosphere that contains 24 endohedral guanidinium-binding
sites. Cooperative binding means that sulfonate guests are bound much more
strongly than carboxylates. This difference has been used to fix gold-based
catalysts firmly, with the remaining binding sites left to pre-organize
substrates. This strategy was applied to a Au(I)-catalysed cyclization of
acetylenic acid to enol lactone in which the pre-organization resulted in much
higher reaction rates. We also found that the encapsulated sulfonate-containing
Au(I) catalysts did not convert neutral (acid) substrates, and so could have
potential in the development of substrate-selective catalysis and base-triggered 
on/off switching of catalysis.

The Bergman cyclization is one of the most fascinating rearrangements in
chemistry, with important implications in organic synthesis and pharmacology.
Here we demonstrate a reversible Bergman cyclization for the first time. We
induced the on-surface transformation of an individual aromatic diradical into a 
highly strained ten-membered diyne using atomic manipulation and verified the
products by non-contact atomic force microscopy with atomic resolution. The diyne
and diradical were stabilized by using an ultrathin NaCl film as the substrate,
and the diyne could be transformed back into the diradical. Importantly, the
diradical and the diyne exhibit different reactivity, electronic, magnetic and
optical properties associated with the changes in the bond topology, and spin
multiplicity. With this reversible, triggered Bergman cyclization we demonstrated
switching on demand between the two reactive intermediates by means of selective 
C-C bond formation or cleavage, which opens up the field of radical chemistry for
on-surface reactions by atomic manipulation.

Exploiting the reactivity of one functional group within a molecule to generate a
reaction at a different position is an ongoing challenge in organic synthesis.
Effective remote functionalization protocols have the potential to provide access
to almost any derivatives but are difficult to achieve. The difficulty is more
pronounced for acyclic systems where flexible alkyl chains are present between
the initiating functional group and the desired reactive centres. In this Review,
we discuss the concept of remote functionalization of alkenes using metal
complexes, leading to a selective reaction at a position distal to the initial
double bond. We aim to show the vast opportunity provided by this growing field
through selected and representative examples. Our aim is to demonstrate that
using a double bond as a chemical handle, metal-assisted long-distance activation
could be used as a powerful synthetic strategy.

Glycosyl cations are universally accepted key ionic intermediates in the
mechanism of glycosylation, the reaction that covalently links carbohydrates to
other molecules. These ions have remained hypothetical species so far because of 
their extremely short life in organic media as a consequence of their very high
reactivity. Here, we report the use of liquid hydrofluoric acid-antimony
pentafluoride (HF/SbF5) superacid to generate and stabilize the glycosyl cations 
derived from peracetylated 2-deoxy and 2-bromoglucopyranose in a condensed phase.
Their persistence in this superacid medium allows their three-dimensional
structure to be studied by NMR, aided by complementary computations. Their
deuteration further confirms the impact of the structure of the glycosyl cation
on the stereochemical outcome of its trapping.

The chemistry of highly evolved protein-based compartments has inspired the
design of new catalytically active materials that self-assemble from biological
components. A frontier of this biodesign is the potential to contribute new
catalytic systems for the production of sustainable fuels, such as hydrogen.
Here, we show the encapsulation and protection of an active hydrogen-producing
and oxygen-tolerant [NiFe]-hydrogenase, sequestered within the capsid of the
bacteriophage P22 through directed self-assembly. We co-opted Escherichia coli
for biomolecular synthesis and assembly of this nanomaterial by expressing and
maturing the EcHyd-1 hydrogenase prior to expression of the P22 coat protein,
which subsequently self assembles. By probing the infrared spectroscopic
signatures and catalytic activity of the engineered material, we demonstrate that
the capsid provides stability and protection to the hydrogenase cargo. These
results illustrate how combining biological function with directed supramolecular
self-assembly can be used to create new materials for sustainable catalysis.

Over the past few decades the direct assembly of optical nanomaterials into
ordered mesoporous frameworks has proved to be a considerable challenge. Here we 
propose the incorporation of ultrasmall (sub-5-nm) graphitic pencil nanodots into
ordered mesoporous frameworks for the fabrication of optoelectronic materials.
The nanodots, which were prepared from typical commercial graphite pencils by an 
electrochemical tailoring process, combine properties such as uniform size
(∼3 nm), excellent dispersibility and high photoconversion efficiency (∼27%).
These nanodots were incorporated into a variety of ordered mesoporous frameworks 
(TiO2, silica, carbon and silica-carbon materials) by co-assembly, driven by
hydrogen bonding, with the frameworks' precursors. The resulting materials showed
a high degree of ordering, and a sharp increase in their optical performance (for
example, photocurrent density). We envisage that the large-scale synthesis of
ultrasmall carbon nanodots and their incorporation into ordered mesoporous
frameworks may facilitate the preparation of materials with a variety of optical 
properties.

DNA nanotechnology offers unparalleled precision and programmability for the
bottom-up organization of materials. This approach relies on pre-assembling a DNA
scaffold, typically containing hundreds of different strands, and using it to
position functional components. A particularly attractive strategy is to employ
DNA nanostructures not as permanent scaffolds, but as transient, reusable
templates to transfer essential information to other materials. To our knowledge,
this approach, akin to top-down lithography, has not been examined. Here we
report a molecular printing strategy that chemically transfers a discrete pattern
of DNA strands from a three-dimensional DNA structure to a gold nanoparticle. We 
show that the particles inherit the DNA sequence configuration encoded in the
parent template with high fidelity. This provides control over the number of DNA 
strands and their relative placement, directionality and sequence asymmetry.
Importantly, the nanoparticles produced exhibit the site-specific addressability 
of DNA nanostructures, and are promising components for energy, information and
biomedical applications.

The conversion of inexpensive, saturated hydrocarbon feedstocks into value-added 
speciality chemicals using regiospecific, catalytic functionalization of alkanes 
is a major goal of organometallic chemistry. Linear alkylsilanes represent one
such speciality chemical-they have a wide range of applications, including
release coatings, silicone rubbers and moulding products. Direct, selective,
functionalization of alkanes at primary C-H bonds is difficult and, to date,
methods for catalytically converting alkanes into linear alkylsilanes are
unknown. Here, we report a well-defined, dual-catalyst system for one-pot,
two-step alkane silylations. The system comprises a pincer-ligated Ir catalyst
for alkane dehydrogenation and an Fe catalyst that effects a subsequent tandem
olefin isomerization-hydrosilylation. This method exhibits exclusive
regioselectivity for the production of terminally functionalized alkylsilanes.
This dual-catalyst strategy has also been applied to regioselective alkane
borylations to form linear alkylboronate esters.

In addition to the nucleophile and solvent, the leaving group has a significant
influence on SN2 nucleophilic substitution reactions. Its role is frequently
discussed with respect to reactivity, but its influence on the reaction dynamics 
remains unclear. Here, we uncover the influence of the leaving group on the
gas-phase dynamics of SN2 reactions in a combined approach of crossed-beam
imaging and dynamics simulations. We have studied the reaction F(-) + CH3Cl and
compared it to F(-) + CH3I. For the two leaving groups, Cl and I, we find very
similar structures and energetics, but the dynamics show qualitatively different 
features. Simple scaling of the leaving group mass does not explain these
differences. Instead, the relevant impact parameters for the reaction mechanisms 
are found to be crucial and the differences are attributed to the relative
orientation of the approaching reactants. This effect occurs on short timescales 
and may also prevail in solution-phase conditions.

Amines with remote stereocentres (stereocentres that are three or more bonds away
from the C-N bond) are important structural elements in many pharmaceutical
agents and natural products. However, previously reported methods to prepare
these compounds in an enantioselective manner are indirect and require multistep 
synthesis. Here, we report a copper-hydride-catalysed, enantioselective synthesis
of γ- or δ-chiral amines from readily available allylic alcohols, esters and
ethers using a reductive relay hydroamination strategy (a net reductive process
in which an amino group is installed at a site remote from the original
carbon-carbon double bond). The protocol was suitable for substrates containing a
wide range of functional groups and provided remote chiral amine products with
high levels of regio- and enantioselectivity. Sequential amination of substrates 
containing several carbon-carbon double bonds could be achieved, demonstrating
the high chemoselectivity of this process.

Modern-day factory assembly lines often feature robots that pick up, reposition
and connect components in a programmed manner. The idea of manipulating molecular
fragments in a similar way has to date only been explored using biological
building blocks (specifically DNA). Here, we report on a wholly artificial
small-molecule robotic arm capable of selectively transporting a molecular cargo 
in either direction between two spatially distinct, chemically similar, sites on 
a molecular platform. The arm picks up/releases a 3-mercaptopropanehydrazide
cargo by formation/breakage of a disulfide bond, while dynamic hydrazone
chemistry controls the cargo binding to the platform. Transport is controlled by 
selectively inducing conformational and configurational changes within an
embedded hydrazone rotary switch that steers the robotic arm. In a three-stage
operation, 79-85% of 3-mercaptopropanehydrazide molecules are transported in
either (chosen) direction between the two platform sites, without the cargo at
any time fully dissociating from the machine nor exchanging with other molecules 
in the bulk.

Phosphorylation-mediated RNA/peptide complex coacervation as a model for
intracellular liquid organelles.

Biological cells are highly organized, with numerous subcellular compartments.
Phosphorylation has been hypothesized as a means to control the
assembly/disassembly of liquid-like RNA- and protein-rich intracellular bodies,
or liquid organelles, that lack delimiting membranes. Here, we demonstrate that
charge-mediated phase separation, or complex coacervation, of RNAs with cationic 
peptides can generate simple model liquid organelles capable of reversibly
compartmentalizing biomolecules. Formation and dissolution of these liquid bodies
was controlled by changes in peptide phosphorylation state using a
kinase/phosphatase enzyme pair. The droplet-generating phase transition responded
to modification of even a single serine residue. Electrostatic interactions
between the short cationic peptides and the much longer polyanionic RNAs drove
phase separation. Coacervates were also formed on silica beads, a primitive model
for localization at specific intracellular sites. This work supports
phosphoregulation of complex coacervation as a viable mechanism for dynamic
intracellular compartmentalization in membraneless organelles.

Site-selective functionalization of complex molecules is one of the most
significant challenges in chemistry. Typically, protecting groups or catalysts
must be used to enable the selective modification of one site among many that are
similarly reactive, and general strategies that selectively tune the local
chemical environment around a target site are rare. Here, we show a
four-amino-acid sequence (Phe-Cys-Pro-Phe), which we call the 'π-clamp', that
tunes the reactivity of its cysteine thiol for site-selective conjugation with
perfluoroaromatic reagents. We use the π-clamp to selectively modify one cysteine
site in proteins containing multiple endogenous cysteine residues. These examples
include antibodies and cysteine-based enzymes that would be difficult to modify
selectively using standard cysteine-based methods. Antibodies modified using the 
π-clamp retained binding affinity to their targets, enabling the synthesis of
site-specific antibody-drug conjugates for selective killing of HER2-positive
breast cancer cells. The π-clamp is an unexpected approach to mediate
site-selective chemistry and provides new avenues to modify biomolecules for
research and therapeutics.

Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) comprise antibodies covalently attached to highly
potent drugs using a variety of conjugation technologies. As therapeutics, they
combine the exquisite specificity of antibodies, enabling discrimination between 
healthy and diseased tissue, with the cell-killing ability of cytotoxic drugs.
This powerful and exciting class of targeted therapy has shown considerable
promise in the treatment of various cancers with two US Food and Drug
Administration approved ADCs currently on the market (Adcetris and Kadcyla) and
approximately 40 currently undergoing clinical evaluation. However, most of these
ADCs exist as heterogeneous mixtures, which can result in a narrow therapeutic
window and have major pharmacokinetic implications. In order for ADCs to deliver 
their full potential, sophisticated site-specific conjugation technologies to
connect the drug to the antibody are vital. This Perspective discusses the
strategies currently used for the site-specific construction of ADCs and
appraises their merits and disadvantages.

Nature has produced intricate machinery to covalently diversify the structure of 
proteins after their synthesis in the ribosome. In an attempt to mimic nature,
chemists have developed a large set of reactions that enable post-expression
modification of proteins at pre-determined sites. These reactions are now used to
selectively install particular modifications on proteins for many biological and 
therapeutic applications. For example, they provide an opportunity to install
post-translational modifications on proteins to determine their exact biological 
roles. Labelling of proteins in live cells with fluorescent dyes allows protein
uptake and intracellular trafficking to be tracked and also enables physiological
parameters to be measured optically. Through the conjugation of potent
cytotoxicants to antibodies, novel anti-cancer drugs with improved efficacy and
reduced side effects may be obtained. In this Perspective, we highlight the most 
exciting current and future applications of chemical site-selective protein
modification and consider which hurdles still need to be overcome for more
widespread use.

The functions of complex crystalline systems derived from supramolecular
biological and non-biological assemblies typically emerge from homochiral
programmed primary structures via first principles involving secondary, tertiary 
and quaternary structures. In contrast, heterochiral and racemic compounds yield 
disordered crystals, amorphous solids or liquids. Here, we report the
self-assembly of perylene bisimide derivatives in a supramolecular helix that in 
turn self-organizes in columnar hexagonal crystalline domains regardless of the
enantiomeric purity of the perylene bisimide. We show that both homochiral and
racemic perylene bisimide compounds, including a mixture of 21 diastereomers that
cannot be deracemized at the molecular level, self-organize to form single-handed
helical assemblies with identical single-crystal-like order. We propose that this
high crystalline order is generated via a cogwheel mechanism that disregards the 
chirality of the self-assembling building blocks. We anticipate that this
mechanism will facilitate access to previously inaccessible complex crystalline
systems from racemic and homochiral building blocks.

The Suzuki-Miyaura coupling has become one of the most important and prevalent
methods for the construction of C-C bonds. Although palladium catalysis has
historically dominated the field, the use of nickel catalysis has become
increasingly widespread because of its unique ability to cleave carbon-heteroatom
bonds that are unreactive towards other transition metals. We report the first
nickel-catalysed Suzuki-Miyaura coupling of amides, which proceeds by an uncommon
cleavage of the amide C-N bond after N-tert-butoxycarbonyl activation. The
methodology is mild, functional-group tolerant and can be strategically employed 
in sequential transition-metal-catalysed cross-coupling sequences to unite
heterocyclic fragments. These studies demonstrate that amides, despite
classically considered inert substrates, can be harnessed as synthons for use in 
reactions that form C-C bonds through cleavage of the C-N bond using non-precious
metal catalysis.

Cellulose, chitin and related polysaccharides are key renewable sources of
organic molecules and materials. However, poor solubility tends to hamper their
exploitation. Synthetic receptors could aid dissolution provided they are capable
of cooperative action, for example by multiple threading on a single
polysaccharide molecule. Here we report a synthetic receptor designed to form
threaded complexes (polypseudorotaxanes) with these natural polymers. The
receptor binds fragments of the polysaccharides in aqueous solution with high
affinities (K(a) up to 19,000 M(-1)), and is shown--by nuclear Overhauser effect 
spectroscopy--to adopt the threading geometry. Evidence from induced circular
dichroism and atomic force microscopy implies that the receptor also forms
polypseudorotaxanes with cellulose and its polycationic analogue chitosan. The
results hold promise for polysaccharide solubilization under mild conditions, as 
well as for new approaches to the design of biologically active molecules.

Pyrroles are structurally important heterocycles. However, the synthesis of
polysubstituted pyrroles is often challenging. Here, we report a multicomponent, 
Ti-catalysed formal [2+2+1] reaction of alkynes and diazenes for the oxidative
synthesis of penta- and trisubstituted pyrroles: a nitrenoid analogue to
classical Pauson-Khand-type syntheses of cyclopentenones. Given the scarcity of
early transition-metal redox catalysis, preliminary mechanistic studies are
presented. Initial stoichiometric and kinetic studies indicate that the mechanism
of this reaction proceeds through a formally Ti(II)/Ti(IV) redox catalytic cycle,
in which an azatitanacyclobutene intermediate, resulting from [2+2] alkyne + Ti
imido coupling, undergoes a second alkyne insertion followed by reductive
elimination to yield pyrrole and a Ti(II) species. The key component for
catalytic turnover is the reoxidation of the Ti(II) species to a Ti(IV) imido via
the disproportionation of an η(2)-diazene-Ti(II) complex.

Zeolites are porous aluminosilicate materials that have found applications in
many different technologies. However, although simulations suggest that there are
millions of possible zeolite topologies, only a little over 200 zeolite
frameworks of all compositions are currently known, of which about 50 are pure
silica materials. This is known as the zeolite conundrum--why have so few of all 
the possible structures been made? Several criteria have been formulated to
explain why most zeolites are unfeasible synthesis targets. Here we demonstrate
the synthesis of two such 'unfeasible' zeolites, IPC-9 and IPC-10, through the
assembly-disassembly-organization-reassembly mechanism. These new high-silica
zeolites have rare characteristics, such as windows that comprise odd-membered
rings. Their synthesis opens up the possibility of preparing other zeolites that 
have not been accessible by traditional solvothermal synthetic methods. We
envisage that these findings may lead to a step change in the number and types of
zeolites available for future applications.

Ring-opening polymerization (ROP) is a powerful synthetic methodology for the
chemical synthesis of technologically important biodegradable aliphatic
polyesters from cyclic esters or lactones. However, the bioderived five-membered 
γ-butyrolactone (γ-BL) is commonly referred as 'non-polymerizable' because of its
low strain energy. The chemical synthesis of poly(γ-butyrolactone) (PγBL) through
the ROP process has been realized only under ultrahigh pressure (20,000 atm,
160 °C) and only produces oligomers. Here we report that the ROP of γ-BL can,
with a suitable catalyst, proceed smoothly to high conversions (90%) under
ambient pressure to produce PγBL materials with a number-average molecular weight
up to 30 kg mol(-1) and with controlled linear and/or cyclic topologies.
Remarkably, both linear and cyclic PγBLs can be recycled back into the monomer in
quantitative yield by simply heating the bulk materials at 220 °C (linear
polymer) or 300 °C (cyclic polymer) for one hour, which thereby demonstrates the 
complete recyclability of PγBL.

Gels formed via metal-ligand coordination typically have very low branch
functionality, f, as they consist of ∼2-3 polymer chains linked to single metal
ions that serve as junctions. Thus, these materials are very soft and unable to
withstand network defects such as dangling ends and loops. We report here a new
class of gels assembled from polymeric ligands and metal-organic cages (MOCs) as 
junctions. The resulting 'polyMOC' gels are precisely tunable and may feature
increased branch functionality. We show two examples of such polyMOCs: a gel with
a low f based on a M2L4 paddlewheel cluster junction and a compositionally
isomeric one of higher f based on a M12L24 cage. The latter features large shear 
moduli, but also a very large number of elastically inactive loop defects that we
subsequently exchanged for functional ligands, with no impact on the gel's shear 
modulus. Such a ligand substitution is not possible in gels of low f, including
the M2L4-based polyMOC.

Transmembrane anion transporters (anionophores) have potential for new modes of
biological activity, including therapeutic applications. In particular they might
replace the activity of defective anion channels in conditions such as cystic
fibrosis. However, data on the biological effects of anionophores are scarce, and
it remains uncertain whether such molecules are fundamentally toxic. Here, we
report a biological study of an extensive series of powerful anion carriers.
Fifteen anionophores were assayed in single cells by monitoring anion transport
in real time through fluorescence emission from halide-sensitive yellow
fluorescent protein. A bis-(p-nitrophenyl)ureidodecalin shows especially
promising activity, including deliverability, potency and persistence.
Electrophysiological tests show strong effects in epithelia, close to those of
natural anion channels. Toxicity assays yield negative results in three cell
lines, suggesting that promotion of anion transport may not be deleterious to
cells. We therefore conclude that synthetic anion carriers are realistic
candidates for further investigation as treatments for cystic fibrosis.

Singlet fission is the spin-allowed conversion of a spin-singlet exciton into a
pair of spin-triplet excitons residing on neighbouring molecules. To rationalize 
this phenomenon, a multiexcitonic spin-zero triplet-pair state has been
hypothesized as an intermediate in singlet fission. However, the nature of the
intermediate states and the underlying mechanism of ultrafast fission have not
been elucidated experimentally. Here, we study a series of pentacene derivatives 
using ultrafast two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy and unravel the origin of
the states involved in fission. Our data reveal the crucial role of vibrational
degrees of freedom coupled to electronic excitations that facilitate the mixing
of multiexcitonic states with singlet excitons. The resulting manifold of
vibronic states drives sub-100 fs fission with unity efficiency. Our results
provide a framework for understanding singlet fission and show how the formation 
of vibronic manifolds with a high density of states facilitates fast and
efficient electronic processes in molecular systems.

The self-assembly of chemical entities represents a very attractive way to create
a large variety of ordered functional structures and complex matter. Although
much effort has been devoted to the preparation of supramolecular nanostructures 
based on different chemical building blocks, an understanding of the mechanisms
at play and the ability to monitor assembly processes and, in turn, control them 
are often elusive, which precludes a deep and comprehensive control of the final 
structures. Here the complex supramolecular landscape of a platinum(II) compound 
is characterized fully and controlled successfully through a combination of
supramolecular and photochemical approaches. The supramolecular assemblies
comprise two kinetic assemblies and their thermodynamic counterpart. The
monitoring of the different emission properties of the aggregates, used as a
fingerprint for each species, allows the real-time visualization of the evolving 
self-assemblies. The control of multiple supramolecular pathways will help the
design of complex systems in and out of their thermodynamic equilibrium.

The production of biodiesel from the transesterification of plant-derived
triglycerides with methanol has been commercialized extensively. Impure glycerol 
is obtained as a by-product at roughly one-tenth the mass of the biodiesel.
Utilization of this crude glycerol is important in improving the viability of the
overall process. Here we show that crude glycerol can be reacted with water over 
very simple basic or redox oxide catalysts to produce methanol in high yields,
together with other useful chemicals, in a one-step low-pressure process. Our
discovery opens up the possibility of recycling the crude glycerol produced
during biodiesel manufacture. Furthermore, we show that molecules containing at
least two hydroxyl groups can be converted into methanol, which demonstrates some
aspects of the generality of this new chemistry.

The α-alkylation of ketones and their derivatives by the addition of their
corresponding enolates to alkyl halides is a fundamental synthetic
transformation, but its utility is limited because the key bond-forming step
proceeds in a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution fashion. Here we describe how
an umpolung strategy that involves the addition of Grignard reagents to α-epoxy
N-sulfonyl hydrazones-directed by the alkoxide of the 1-azo-3-alkoxy propenes
formed in situ via base-induced ring opening of the epoxide-leads to the
syn-selective production of α-alkyl-β-hydroxy N-sulfonyl hydrazones with
α-quaternary centres. This transformation is remarkable in its ability to
incorporate an unprecedented range of carbon-based substituents, which include
primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl, as well as alkenyl, aryl, allenyl and
alkynyl groups. Subsequent hydrolysis of the β-hydroxy N-sulfonyl hydrazone
products produces the corresponding β-hydroxy ketones. In addition to hydrolysis,
the hydrazone products are poised to undergo numerous different known synthetic
transformations via well-established chemistry, which would provide access to a
wide array of useful structures.

Oxynitrides have been explored extensively in the past decade because of their
interesting properties, such as visible-light absorption, photocatalytic activity
and high dielectric permittivity. Their synthesis typically requires
high-temperature NH3 treatment (800-1,300 °C) of precursors, such as oxides, but 
the highly reducing conditions and the low mobility of N(3-) species in the
lattice place significant constraints on the composition and structure-and hence 
the properties-of the resulting oxynitrides. Here we show a topochemical route
that enables the preparation of an oxynitride at low temperatures (<500 °C),
using a perovskite oxyhydride as a host. The lability of H(-) in BaTiO3-xHx (x ≤ 
0.6) allows H(-)/N(3-) exchange to occur, and yields a room-temperature
ferroelectric BaTiO3-xN2x/3. This anion exchange is accompanied by a
metal-to-insulator crossover via mixed O-H-N intermediates. These findings
suggest that this 'labile hydride' strategy can be used to explore various
oxynitrides, and perhaps other mixed anionic compounds.

Aliphatic primary amines are a class of chemical feedstock essential to the
synthesis of higher-order nitrogen-containing molecules, commonly found in
biologically active compounds and pharmaceutical agents. New methods for the
construction of complex amines remain a continuous challenge to synthetic
chemists. Here, we outline a general palladium-catalysed strategy for the
functionalization of aliphatic C-H bonds within amino alcohols, an important
class of small molecule. Central to this strategy is the temporary conversion of 
catalytically incompatible primary amino alcohols into hindered secondary amines 
that are capable of undergoing a sterically promoted palladium-catalysed C-H
activation. Furthermore, a hydrogen bond between amine and catalyst intensifies
interactions around the palladium and orients the aliphatic amine substituents in
an ideal geometry for C-H activation. This catalytic method directly transforms
simple, easily accessible amines into highly substituted, functionally
concentrated and structurally diverse products, and can streamline the synthesis 
of biologically important amine-containing molecules.

Self-assembly by means of coordinative bond formation has opened up opportunities
for the high-yield synthesis of molecules with complex topologies. However, the
preparation of purely covalent molecular architectures in aqueous media has
remained a challenging task. Here, we present the preparation of a
three-dimensional catenane through a self-assembly process that relies on the
formation of dynamic hydrazone linkages in an acidic aqueous medium. The
quantitative synthesis process and the mechanically interlocked structure of the 
resulting catenane were established by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, X-ray
crystallography and HPLC studies. In addition, the labile hydrazone linkages of
the individual [2]catenane components may be 'locked' by increasing the pH of the
solution, yielding a relatively kinetically stable molecule. The present study
thus details a simple approach to the creation and control of complex molecular
architectures under reaction conditions that mimic biological milieux.

[Fe]-Hydrogenase catalyses the reversible hydrogenation of a
methenyltetrahydromethanopterin substrate, which is an intermediate step during
the methanogenesis from CO2 and H2. The active site contains an
iron-guanylylpyridinol cofactor, in which Fe(2+) is coordinated by two CO
ligands, as well as an acyl carbon atom and a pyridinyl nitrogen atom from a
3,4,5,6-substituted 2-pyridinol ligand. However, the mechanism of H2 activation
by [Fe]-hydrogenase is unclear. Here we report the reconstitution of
[Fe]-hydrogenase from an apoenzyme using two FeGP cofactor mimics to create
semisynthetic enzymes. The small-molecule mimics reproduce the ligand environment
of the active site, but are inactive towards H2 binding and activation on their
own. We show that reconstituting the enzyme using a mimic that contains a
2-hydroxypyridine group restores activity, whereas an analogous enzyme with a
2-methoxypyridine complex was essentially inactive. These findings, together with
density functional theory computations, support a mechanism in which the
2-hydroxy group is deprotonated before it serves as an internal base for
heterolytic H2 cleavage.

C-H bond oxidation reactions underscore the existing paradigm wherein high
reactivity and high selectivity are inversely correlated. The development of
catalysts capable of oxidizing strong aliphatic C(sp(3))-H bonds while displaying
chemoselectivity (that is, tolerance of more oxidizable functionality) remains an
unsolved problem. Here, we describe a catalyst, manganese
tert-butylphthalocyanine [Mn((t)BuPc)], that is an outlier to the
reactivity-selectivity paradigm. It is unique in its capacity to functionalize
all types of C(sp(3))-H bond intramolecularly, while displaying excellent
chemoselectivity in the presence of π functionality. Mechanistic studies indicate
that [Mn((t)BuPc)] transfers bound nitrenes to C(sp(3))-H bonds via a pathway
that lies between concerted C-H insertion, observed with reactive noble metals
such as rhodium, and stepwise radical C-H abstraction/rebound, as observed with
chemoselective base metals such as iron. Rather than achieving a blending of
effects, [Mn((t)BuPc)] aminates even 1° aliphatic and propargylic C-H bonds,
demonstrating reactivity and selectivity unusual for previously known catalysts.

The role of vibrational coherence-concerted vibrational motion on the
excited-state potential energy surface-in the isomerization of retinal in the
protein rhodopsin remains elusive, despite considerable experimental and
theoretical efforts. We revisited this problem with resonant ultrafast
heterodyne-detected transient-grating spectroscopy. The enhanced sensitivity that
this technique provides allows us to probe directly the primary photochemical
reaction of vision with sufficient temporal and spectral resolution to resolve
all the relevant nuclear dynamics of the retinal chromophore during
isomerization. We observed coherent photoproduct formation on a sub-50 fs
timescale, and recovered a host of vibrational modes of the retinal chromophore
that modulate the transient-grating signal during the isomerization reaction.
Through Fourier filtering and subsequent time-domain analysis of the transient
vibrational dynamics, the excited-state nuclear motions that drive the
isomerization reaction were identified, and comprise stretching, torsional and
out-of-plane wagging motions about the local C11=C12 isomerization coordinate.

Copper is a transition metal that plays critical roles in many life processes.
Controlling the cellular concentration and trafficking of copper offers a route
to disrupt these processes. Here we report small molecules that inhibit the human
copper-trafficking proteins Atox1 and CCS, and so provide a selective approach to
disrupt cellular copper transport. The knockdown of Atox1 and CCS or their
inhibition leads to a significantly reduced proliferation of cancer cells, but
not of normal cells, as well as to attenuated tumour growth in mouse models. We
show that blocking copper trafficking induces cellular oxidative stress and
reduces levels of cellular ATP. The reduced level of ATP results in activation of
the AMP-activated protein kinase that leads to reduced lipogenesis. Both effects 
contribute to the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation. Our results establish 
copper chaperones as new targets for future developments in anticancer therapies.

To understand the molecular origins of diseases caused by ultraviolet and visible
light, and also to develop photodynamic therapy, it is important to resolve the
mechanism of photoinduced DNA damage. Damage to DNA bound to a photosensitizer
molecule frequently proceeds by one-electron photo-oxidation of guanine, but the 
precise dynamics of this process are sensitive to the location and the
orientation of the photosensitizer, which are very difficult to define in
solution. To overcome this, ultrafast time-resolved infrared (TRIR) spectroscopy 
was performed on photoexcited ruthenium polypyridyl-DNA crystals, the atomic
structure of which was determined by X-ray crystallography. By combining the
X-ray and TRIR data we are able to define both the geometry of the reaction site 
and the rates of individual steps in a reversible photoinduced electron-transfer 
process. This allows us to propose an individual guanine as the reaction site
and, intriguingly, reveals that the dynamics in the crystal state are quite
similar to those observed in the solvent medium.

Vaccines have typically been prepared using whole organisms. These are normally
either attenuated bacteria or viruses that are live but have been altered to
reduce their virulence, or pathogens that have been inactivated and effectively
killed through exposure to heat or formaldehyde. However, using whole organisms
to elicit an immune response introduces the potential for infections arising from
a reversion to a virulent form in live pathogens, unproductive reactions to
vaccine components or batch-to-batch variability. Synthetic vaccines, in which a 
molecular antigen is conjugated to a carrier protein, offer the opportunity to
circumvent these problems. This Perspective will highlight the progress that has 
been achieved in developing synthetic vaccines using a variety of molecular
antigens. In particular, the different approaches used to develop conjugate
vaccines using peptide/proteins, carbohydrates and other small molecule haptens
as antigens are compared.

Csp(2)-Csp(2) cross-coupling reactions between arylboronic acid and aryl halides 
are widely used in both academia and industry and are strategically important in 
the development of new agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals. Csp(2)-Csp(3)
cross-coupling reactions have been developed, but enantioselective variations are
rare and simply retaining the stereochemistry is a problem. Here we report a
highly enantioselective Csp(2)-Csp(3) bond-forming method that couples
arylboronic acids to racemic allyl chlorides. Both enantiomers of a cyclic
chloride are converted into a single enantiomer of product via a dynamic kinetic 
asymmetric transformation. This Rh-catalysed method uses readily available and
inexpensive building blocks and is mild and broadly applicable. For
electron-deficient, electron-rich or ortho-substituted boronic acids better
results are obtained with racemic allyl bromides. Oxygen substitution in the
allyl halide is tolerated and the products can be functionalized to provide
diverse building blocks. The approach fills a significant gap in the methods for 
catalytic asymmetric synthesis.

Fullerene anions and cations have unique structural, electronic, magnetic and
chemical properties that make them substantially different from neutral
fullerenes. Although much theoretical effort has been devoted to characterizing
and predicting their properties, this has been limited to a fraction of isomeric 
forms, mostly for fullerene anions, and has practically ignored fullerene
cations. Here we show that the concepts of cage connectivity and frontier π
orbitals allow one to understand the relative stability of charged fullerene
isomers without performing elaborate quantum chemistry calculations. The latter
is not a trivial matter, as the number of possible isomers for a medium-sized
fullerene is many more than 100,000. The model correctly predicts the structures 
observed experimentally and explains why the isolated pentagon rule is often
violated for fullerene anions, but the opposite is found for fullerene cations.
These predictions are relevant in fields as diverse as astrophysics,
electrochemistry and supramolecular chemistry.

The role of internal molecular degrees of freedom, such as rotation, has scarcely
been explored experimentally in low-energy collisions despite their significance 
to cold and ultracold chemistry. Particularly important to astrochemistry is the 
case of the most abundant molecule in interstellar space, hydrogen, for which two
spin isomers have been detected, one of which exists in its rotational ground
state whereas the other is rotationally excited. Here we demonstrate that
quantization of molecular rotation plays a key role in cold reaction dynamics,
where rotationally excited ortho-hydrogen reacts faster due to a stronger
long-range attraction. We observe rotational state-dependent non-Arrhenius
universal scaling laws in chemi-ionization reactions of para-H2 and ortho-H2 by
He(2(3)P2), spanning three orders of magnitude in temperature. Different scaling 
laws serve as a sensitive gauge that enables us to directly determine the exact
nature of the long-range intermolecular interactions. Our results show that the
quantum state of the molecular rotor determines whether or not anisotropic
long-range interactions dominate cold collisions.

Several aggregation-prone proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases can
be modified by O-linked N-acetyl-glucosamine (O-GlcNAc) in vivo. One of these
proteins, α-synuclein, is a toxic aggregating protein associated with
synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease. However, the effect of
O-GlcNAcylation on α-synuclein is not clear. Here, we use synthetic protein
chemistry to generate both unmodified α-synuclein and α-synuclein bearing a
site-specific O-GlcNAc modification at the physiologically relevant threonine
residue 72. We show that this single modification has a notable and
substoichiometric inhibitory effect on α-synuclein aggregation, while not
affecting the membrane binding or bending properties of α-synuclein.
O-GlcNAcylation is also shown to affect the phosphorylation of α-synuclein in
vitro and block the toxicity of α-synuclein that was exogenously added to cells
in culture. These results suggest that increasing O-GlcNAcylation may slow the
progression of synucleinopathies and further support a general function for
O-GlcNAc in preventing protein aggregation.

The periodic layers and ordered nanochannels of covalent organic frameworks
(COFs) make these materials viable open catalytic nanoreactors, but their low
stability has precluded their practical implementation. Here we report the
synthesis of a crystalline porous COF that is stable against water, strong acids 
and strong bases, and we demonstrate its utility as a material platform for
structural design and functional development. We endowed a crystalline and porous
imine-based COF with stability by incorporating methoxy groups into its pore
walls to reinforce interlayer interactions. We subsequently converted the
resulting achiral material into two distinct chiral organocatalysts, with the
high crystallinity and porosity retained, by appending chiral centres and
catalytically active sites on its channel walls. The COFs thus prepared combine
catalytic activity, enantioselectivity and recyclability, which are attractive in
heterogeneous organocatalysis, and were shown to promote asymmetric C-C bond
formation in water under ambient conditions.

Controlling molecular interactions between bioinspired molecules can enable the
development of new materials with higher complexity and innovative properties.
Here we report on a dynamic system that emerges from the conformational
modification of an elastin-like protein by peptide amphiphiles and with the
capacity to access, and be maintained in, non-equilibrium for substantial periods
of time. The system enables the formation of a robust membrane that displays
controlled assembly and disassembly capabilities, adhesion and sealing to
surfaces, self-healing and the capability to undergo morphogenesis into tubular
structures with high spatiotemporal control. We use advanced microscopy along
with turbidity and spectroscopic measurements to investigate the mechanism of
assembly and its relation to the distinctive membrane architecture and the
resulting dynamic properties. Using cell-culture experiments with endothelial and
adipose-derived stem cells, we demonstrate the potential of this system to
generate complex bioactive scaffolds for applications such as tissue engineering.

Control of the direction of motion is an essential feature of biological rotary
motors and results from the intrinsic chirality of the amino acids from which the
motors are made. In synthetic autonomous light-driven rotary motors, point
chirality is transferred to helical chirality, and this governs their
unidirectional rotation. However, achieving directional rotary motion in an
achiral molecular system in an autonomous fashion remains a fundamental
challenge. Here, we report an achiral molecular motor in which the presence of a 
pseudo-asymmetric carbon atom proved to be sufficient for exclusive autonomous
disrotary motion of two appended rotor moieties. Isomerization around the two
double bonds enables both rotors to move in the same direction with respect to
their surroundings--like wheels on an axle--demonstrating that autonomous
unidirectional rotary motion can be achieved in a symmetric system.

Solar energy conversion in photovoltaics or photocatalysis involves light
harvesting, or sensitization, of a semiconductor or catalyst as a first step.
Rare elements are frequently used for this purpose, but they are obviously not
ideal for large-scale implementation. Great efforts have been made to replace the
widely used ruthenium with more abundant analogues like iron, but without much
success due to the very short-lived excited states of the resulting iron
complexes. Here, we describe the development of an
iron-nitrogen-heterocyclic-carbene sensitizer with an excited-state lifetime that
is nearly a thousand-fold longer than that of traditional iron polypyridyl
complexes. By the use of electron paramagnetic resonance, transient absorption
spectroscopy, transient terahertz spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations,
we show that the iron complex generates photoelectrons in the conduction band of 
titanium dioxide with a quantum yield of 92% from the (3)MLCT (metal-to-ligand
charge transfer) state. These results open up possibilities to develop solar
energy-converting materials based on abundant elements.

Epicolactone is a recently isolated fungal metabolite that is highly complex for 
its size, and yet racemic. With its array of quaternary stereocentres, high
degree of functionalization and intricate polycyclic structure, it poses a
considerable challenge to synthesis, a challenge that can be met by understanding
its biosynthetic origin. If drawn in a certain way, epicolactone reveals a
pattern that resembles purpurogallin, the archetype of ubiquitous natural
colourants formed via oxidative dimerization. Based on this insight, we designed 
a biomimetic synthesis of epicolactone that proceeds in only eight steps from
vanillyl alcohol. We have isolated a key intermediate that supports our
biosynthetic hypothesis and anticipate that an isomer of epicolactone stemming
from our synthetic efforts could also be found as a natural product.

The design and construction of biomimetic self-assembling systems is a
challenging yet potentially highly rewarding endeavour that contributes to the
development of new biomaterials, catalysts, drug-delivery systems and tools for
the manipulation of biological processes. Significant progress has been achieved 
by engineering self-assembling DNA-, protein- and peptide-based building units.
However, the design of entirely new, completely non-natural folded architectures 
that resemble biopolymers ('foldamers') and have the ability to self-assemble
into atomically precise nanostructures in aqueous conditions has proved
exceptionally challenging. Here we report the modular design, formation and
structural elucidation at the atomic level of a series of diverse quaternary
arrangements formed by the self-assembly of short amphiphilic α-helicomimetic
foldamers that bear proteinaceous side chains. We show that the final quaternary 
assembly can be controlled at the sequence level, which permits the programmed
formation of either discrete helical bundles that contain isolated cavities or
pH-responsive water-filled channels with controllable pore diameters.

The Catellani reaction--a palladium-catalysed C-H functionalization reaction
mediated by norbornene--was first reported in 1997. The capacity to functionalize
both the ortho and ipso positions of aryl halides in a single transformation held
great appeal. We reported an annulative Catellani reaction in 2000. Since then,
our two groups have explored the synthetic utility of this reaction and dramatic 
progress has been made by a number of groups in the past five years. Whereas the 
original Catellani reaction uses Pd(0) catalysts, recent studies have shown that 
Pd(II) catalysts can be used in combination with norbornene to effect (1) direct 
2-alkylation of indoles and pyrroles and (2) selective meta-C-H functionalization
of arenes bearing commonly used ortho-directing groups, thereby opening new
avenues for future research. We describe the most recent developments concerning 
the Pd-catalysed norbornene-mediated C-H functionalization of arenes, including
applications in natural products synthesis. We outline challenges and future
opportunities.

Multicomponent supramolecular systems could be used to prepare exciting new
functional materials, but it is often challenging to control the assembly across 
multiple length scales. Here we report a simple approach to forming patterned,
spatially resolved multicomponent supramolecular hydrogels. A multicomponent gel 
is first formed from two low-molecular-weight gelators and consists of two types 
of fibre, each formed by only one gelator. One type of fibre in this 'self-sorted
network' is then removed selectively by a light-triggered gel-to-sol transition. 
We show that the remaining network has the same mechanical properties as it would
have done if it initially formed alone. The selective irradiation of sections of 
the gel through a mask leads to the formation of patterned multicomponent
networks, in which either one or two networks can be present at a particular
position with a high degree of spatial control.

The development of general catalytic methods for the regio- and stereoselective
construction of chiral N-heterocycles in a diversity-oriented fashion remains a
formidable challenge in organic synthesis. N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis
has been shown to produce a variety of outcomes, but control of the reactivity
has rarely been demonstrated. Here we report a switchable catalytic activation of
enals with aromatic azomethine imines that provides high selectivity using NHC
organocatalysts. The original selectivity corresponds to the acidity of the base 
used in the reaction. The catalytically generated chiral homoenolate or enol
intermediate undergoes enantioselective annulation with electrophiles such as
N-iminoquinolinium ylides, N-iminoisoquinolinium ylides and β-N-iminocarboline
ylides. The good-to-high overall yields, high regioselectivities and excellent
enantioselectivities observed are controlled by the catalyst and reaction
conditions.

Biological systems use complex 'information-processing cores' composed of
molecular networks to coordinate their external environment and internal states. 
An example of this is the acquired, or adaptive, immune system (AIS), which is
composed of both humoral and cell-mediated components. Here we report the
step-by-step construction of a prototype mimic of the AIS that we call an
adaptive immune response simulator (AIRS). DNA and enzymes are used as simple
artificial analogues of the components of the AIS to create a system that
responds to specific molecular stimuli in vitro. We show that this network of
reactions can function in a manner that is superficially similar to the most
basic responses of the vertebrate AIS, including reaction sequences that mimic
both humoral and cellular responses. As such, AIRS provides guidelines for the
design and engineering of artificial reaction networks and molecular devices.

Site-selective C-H functionalization has emerged as an attractive tool for
derivatizing complex synthetic intermediates, but its use for late-stage
diversification is limited by the functional groups that can be introduced,
especially at unactivated sp(3)-hybridized positions. To overcome this, we
introduce a strategy that directly installs a sulfonyloxy group at a β-C-H bond
of a masked alcohol and subsequently employs nucleophilic substitution reactions 
to prepare various derivatives. Hydroxyl groups are widely found in bioactive
molecules and are thus readily available as synthetic handles. A directing group 
is easily added (and subsequently removed) from the alcohols such that a formal
site-selective β-C-H sulfonyloxylation of these alcohols is achieved.
Substitution reactions with carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and other nucleophiles then 
lead to diverse functionalizations that may help to streamline the synthesis of
complex analogues for drug discovery.

PEGylated proteins are a mainstay of the biopharmaceutical industry. Although the
use of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) to increase particle size, stability and
solubility is well-established, questions remain as to the structure of
PEG-protein conjugates. Here we report the structural characterization of a model
β-sheet protein (plastocyanin, 11.5 kDa) modified with a single PEG 5,000. An NMR
spectroscopy study of the PEGylated conjugate indicated that the protein and PEG 
behaved as independent domains. A crystal structure revealed an extraordinary
double-helical assembly of the conjugate, with the helices arranged orthogonally 
to yield a highly porous architecture. Electron density was not observed for the 
PEG chain, which indicates that it was disordered. The volume available per PEG
chain in the crystal was within 10% of the calculated random coil volume.
Together, these data support a minimal interaction between the protein and the
synthetic polymer. Our work provides new possibilities for understanding this
important class of protein-polymer hybrids and suggests a novel approach to
engineering protein assemblies.

Monosilane (SiH4) is far less well behaved than its carbon analogue methane
(CH4). It is a colourless gas that is industrially relevant as a source of
elemental silicon, but its pyrophoric and explosive nature makes its handling and
use challenging. Consequently, synthetic applications of SiH4 in academic
laboratories are extremely rare and methodologies based on SiH4 are
underdeveloped. Safe and controlled alternatives to the substituent
redistribution approaches of hydrosilanes are desirable and
cyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-ylsilanes where the cyclohexa-1,4-diene units serve as
placeholders for the hydrogen atoms have been identified as potent surrogates of 
SiH4. We disclose here that the commercially available Lewis acid
tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane, B(C6F5)3, is able to promote the release of the
Si-H bond catalytically while subsequently enabling the hydrosilylation of C-C
multiple bonds in the same pot. The net reactions are transition-metal-free
transfer hydrosilylations with SiH4 as a building block for the preparation of
various hydrosilanes.

Chemists have long sought sequence-controlled synthetic polymers that mimic
nature's biopolymers, but a practical synthetic route that enables absolute
control over polymer sequence and structure remains a key challenge. Here, we
report an iterative exponential growth plus side-chain functionalization (IEG+)
strategy that begins with enantiopure epoxides and facilitates the efficient
synthesis of a family of uniform >3 kDa macromolecules of varying sequence and
stereoconfiguration that are coupled to produce unimolecular polymers (>6 kDa)
with sequences and structures that cannot be obtained using traditional
polymerization techniques. Selective side-chain deprotection of three
hexadecamers is also demonstrated, which imbues each compound with the ability to
dissolve in water. We anticipate that these new macromolecules and the general
IEG+ strategy will find broad application as a versatile platform for the
scalable synthesis of sequence-controlled polymers.

The study of biomolecular interactions is central to an understanding of
function, malfunction and therapeutic modulation of biological systems, yet often
involves a compromise between sensitivity and accuracy. Many conventional
analytical steps and the procedures required to facilitate sensitive detection,
such as the incorporation of chemical labels, are prone to perturb the complexes 
under observation. Here we present a 'latent' analysis approach that uses
chemical and microfluidic tools to reveal, through highly sensitive detection of 
a labelled system, the behaviour of the physiologically relevant unlabelled
system. We implement this strategy in a native microfluidic diffusional sizing
platform, allowing us to achieve detection sensitivity at the attomole level,
determine the hydrodynamic radii of biomolecules that vary by over three orders
of magnitude in molecular weight, and study heterogeneous mixtures. We illustrate
these key advantages by characterizing a complex of an antibody domain in the
solution phase and under physiologically relevant conditions.

How do metal ions direct ribozyme folding?

Ribozymes, which carry out phosphoryl-transfer reactions, often require Mg(2+)
ions for catalytic activity. The correct folding of the active site and ribozyme 
tertiary structure is also regulated by metal ions in a manner that is not fully 
understood. Here we employ coarse-grained molecular simulations to show that
individual structural elements of the group I ribozyme from the bacterium
Azoarcus form spontaneously in the unfolded ribozyme even at very low Mg(2+)
concentrations, and are transiently stabilized by the coordination of Mg(2+) ions
to specific nucleotides. However, competition for scarce Mg(2+) and topological
constraints that arise from chain connectivity prevent the complete folding of
the ribozyme. A much higher Mg(2+) concentration is required for complete folding
of the ribozyme and stabilization of the active site. When Mg(2+) is replaced by 
Ca(2+) the ribozyme folds, but the active site remains unstable. Our results
suggest that group I ribozymes utilize the same interactions with specific metal 
ligands for both structural stability and chemical activity.

Singlet fission presents an attractive solution to overcome the Shockley-Queisser
limit by generating two triplet excitons from one singlet exciton. However,
although triplet excitons are long-lived, their transport occurs through a Dexter
transfer, making them slower than singlet excitons, which travel by means of a
Förster mechanism. A thorough understanding of the interplay between singlet
fission and exciton transport is therefore necessary to assess the potential and 
challenges of singlet-fission utilization. Here, we report a direct visualization
of exciton transport in single tetracene crystals using transient absorption
microscopy with 200 fs time resolution and 50 nm spatial precision. These
measurements reveal a new singlet-mediated transport mechanism for triplets,
which leads to an enhancement in effective triplet exciton diffusion of more than
one order of magnitude on picosecond to nanosecond timescales. These results
establish that there are optimal energetics of singlet and triplet excitons that 
benefit both singlet fission and exciton diffusion.

Vinyl polymers have been the focus of intensive research over the past few
decades and are attractive materials owing to their ease of synthesis and their
broad diversity of architectures, compositions and functionalities. Their
carbon-carbon backbones are extremely resistant to degradation, however, and this
property limits their uses. Degradable polymers are an important field of
research in polymer science and have been used in a wide range of applications
spanning from (nano)medicine to microelectronics and environmental protection.
The development of synthetic strategies to enable complete or partial degradation
of vinyl polymers is, therefore, of great importance because it will offer new
opportunities for the application of these materials. This Review captures the
most recent and promising approaches to the design of degradable vinyl polymers
and discusses the potential of these materials for biomedical applications.

Formaldehyde is universally used to fix tissue specimens, where it forms
hemiaminal and aminal adducts with biomolecules, hindering the ability to
retrieve molecular information. Common methods for removing these adducts involve
extended heating, which can cause extensive degradation of nucleic acids,
particularly RNA. Here, we show that water-soluble bifunctional catalysts
(anthranilates and phosphanilates) speed the reversal of formaldehyde adducts of 
mononucleotides over standard buffers. Studies with formaldehyde-treated RNA
oligonucleotides show that the catalysts enhance adduct removal, restoring
unmodified RNA at 37 °C even when extensively modified, while avoiding the high
temperatures that promote RNA degradation. Experiments with formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded cell samples show that the catalysis is compatible with common 
RNA extraction protocols, with detectable RNA yields increased by 1.5-2.4-fold
using a catalyst under optimized conditions and by 7-25-fold compared with a
commercial kit. Such catalytic strategies show promise for general use in
reversing formaldehyde adducts in clinical specimens.

Anthracyclines such as doxorubicin are used extensively in the treatment of
cancers. Anthraquinone-related angucyclines also exhibit antiproliferative
properties and have been proposed to operate via similar mechanisms, including
direct genome targeting. Here, we report the chemical synthesis of marmycin A and
the study of its cellular activity. The aromatic core was constructed by means of
a one-pot multistep reaction comprising a regioselective Diels-Alder
cycloaddition, and the complex sugar backbone was introduced through a
copper-catalysed Ullmann cross-coupling, followed by a challenging Friedel-Crafts
cyclization. Remarkably, fluorescence microscopy revealed that marmycin A does
not target the nucleus but instead accumulates in lysosomes, thereby promoting
cell death independently of genome targeting. Furthermore, a synthetic dimer of
marmycin A and the lysosome-targeting agent artesunate exhibited a synergistic
activity against the invasive MDA-MB-231 cancer cell line. These findings shed
light on the elusive pathways through which anthraquinone derivatives act in
cells, pointing towards unanticipated biological and therapeutic applications.

The structural complexity and diversity of natural products make them attractive 
sources for potential drug discovery, with their characteristics being derived
from the multi-step combination of enzymatic and non-enzymatic conversions of
intermediates in each biosynthetic pathway. Intermediates that exhibit
multipotent behaviour have great potential for use as starting points in
diversity-oriented synthesis. Inspired by the biosynthetic pathways that form
complex metabolites from simple intermediates, we developed a semi-synthetic
process that combines heterologous biosynthesis and artificial diversification.
The heterologous biosynthesis of fungal polyketide intermediates led to the
isolation of novel oligomers and provided evidence for ortho-quinonemethide
equivalency in their isochromene form. The intrinsic reactivity of the
isochromene polyketide enabled us to access various new chemical entities by
modifying and remodelling the polyketide core and through coupling with indole
molecules. We thus succeeded in generating exceptionally diverse pseudo-natural
polyketides through this process and demonstrated an advanced method of using
biosynthetic intermediates.

Graphene has shown much promise as an organic electronic material but, despite
recent achievements in the production of few-layer graphene, the quantitative
exfoliation of graphite into pristine single-layer graphene has remained one of
the main challenges in developing practical devices. Recently, reduced graphene
oxide has been recognized as a non-feasible alternative to graphene owing to
variable defect types and levels, and attention is turning towards reliable
methods for the high-throughput exfoliation of graphite. Here we report that
microwave irradiation of graphite suspended in molecularly engineered oligomeric 
ionic liquids allows for ultrahigh-efficiency exfoliation (93% yield) with a high
selectivity (95%) towards 'single-layer' graphene (that is, with thicknesses
<1 nm) in a short processing time (30 minutes). The isolated graphene sheets show
negligible structural deterioration. They are also readily redispersible in
oligomeric ionic liquids up to ~100 mg ml(-1), and form physical gels in which an
anisotropic orientation of graphene sheets, once induced by a magnetic field, is 
maintained.

The preparation of multifunctional chiral molecules can be greatly simplified by 
adopting a route via the sequential catalytic assembly of achiral building
blocks. The catalytic aldol assembly of prebiotic compounds into stereodefined
pentoses and hexoses is an as yet unmet challenge. Such a process would be of
remarkable synthetic utility and highly significant with regard to the origin of 
life. Pursuing an expedient enzymatic approach, here we use engineered
D-fructose-6-phosphate aldolase from Escherichia coli to prepare a series of
three- to six-carbon aldoses by sequential one-pot additions of glycolaldehyde.
Notably, the pertinent selection of the aldolase variant provides control of the 
sugar size. The stereochemical outcome of the addition was also altered to allow 
the synthesis of L-glucose and related derivatives. Such engineered biocatalysts 
may offer new routes for the straightforward synthesis of natural molecules and
their analogues that circumvent the intricate enzymatic pathways forged by
evolution.

In living ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), a
transition-metal-carbene complex polymerizes ring-strained olefins with very good
control of the molecular weight of the resulting polymers. Because one molecule
of the initiator is required for each polymer chain, however, this type of
polymerization is expensive for widespread use. We have now designed a
chain-transfer agent (CTA) capable of reducing the required amount of metal
complex while still maintaining full control over the living polymerization
process. This new method introduces a degenerative transfer process to ROMP. We
demonstrate that substituted cyclohexene rings are good CTAs, and thereby
preserve the 'living' character of the polymerization using catalytic quantities 
of the metal complex. The resulting polymers show characteristics of a living
polymerization, namely narrow molecular-weight distribution, controlled molecular
weights and block copolymer formation. This new technique provides access to
well-defined polymers for industrial, biomedical and academic use at a fraction
of the current costs and significantly reduced levels of residual ruthenium
catalyst.

Regioselective C-H bond transformations are potentially the most efficient method
for the synthesis of organic molecules. However, the presence of many C-H bonds
in organic molecules and the high activation barrier for these reactions make
these transformations difficult. Directing groups in the reaction substrate are
often used to control regioselectivity, which has been especially successful for 
the ortho-selective functionalization of aromatic substrates. Here, we describe
an iridium-catalysed meta-selective C-H borylation of aromatic compounds using a 
newly designed catalytic system. The bipyridine-derived ligand that binds iridium
contains a pendant urea moiety. A secondary interaction between this urea and a
hydrogen-bond acceptor in the substrate places the iridium in close proximity to 
the meta-C-H bond and thus controls the regioselectivity. (1)H NMR studies and
control experiments support the participation of hydrogen bonds in inducing
regioselectivity. Reversible direction of the catalyst through hydrogen bonds is 
a versatile concept for regioselective C-H transformations.

In the past few years, organic-inorganic halide perovskites have rapidly emerged 
as promising materials for photovoltaic applications, but simultaneously
achieving high performance and long-term stability has proved challenging. Here, 
we show a one-step solution-processing strategy using phosphonic acid ammonium
additives that results in efficient perovskite solar cells with enhanced
stability. We modify the surface of methylammonium lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3)
perovskite by spin-coating its precursor solution in the presence of
butylphosphonic acid 4-ammonium chloride. Morphological, structural and elemental
analyses show that the phosphonic acid ammonium additive acts as a crosslink
between neighbouring grains in the perovskite structure, through strong hydrogen 
bonding of the -PO(OH)2 and -NH3(+) terminal groups to the perovskite surface.
The additives facilitate the incorporation of the perovskite within a mesoporous 
TiO2 scaffold, as well as the growth of a uniform perovskite layer at the
surface, enhancing the material's photovoltaic performance from 8.8 to 16.7% as
well as its resistance to moisture.

Cytochrome P450 (P450) and chloroperoxidase (CPO) are thiolate-ligated haem
proteins that catalyse the activation of carbon hydrogen bonds. The principal
intermediate in these reactions is a ferryl radical species called compound I.
P450 compound I (P450-I) is significantly more reactive than CPO-I, which only
cleaves activated C-H bonds. To provide insight into the differing reactivities
of these intermediates, we examined CPO-I and P450-I using variable-temperature
Mössbauer and X-ray absorption spectroscopies. These measurements indicate that
the Fe-S bond is significantly shorter in P450-I than in CPO-I. This difference
in Fe-S bond lengths can be understood in terms of variations in the
hydrogen-bonding patterns within the 'cys-pocket' (a portion of the proximal
helix that encircles the thiolate ligand). Weaker hydrogen bonding in P450-I
results in a shorter Fe-S bond, which enables greater electron donation from the 
axial thiolate ligand. This observation may in part explain P450's greater
propensity for C-H bond activation.

Nuclear-electronic (vibronic) coupling is increasingly recognized as a mechanism 
of major importance in controlling the light-induced function of molecular
systems. It was recently shown that infrared light excitation of intramolecular
vibrations can radically change the efficiency of electron transfer, a
fundamental chemical process. We now extend and generalize the understanding of
this phenomenon by probing and perturbing vibronic coupling in several molecules 
in solution. In the experiments an ultrafast electronic-vibrational pulse
sequence is applied to a range of donor-bridge-acceptor Pt(II) trans-acetylide
assemblies, for which infrared excitation of selected bridge vibrations during
ultraviolet-initiated charge separation alters the yields of light-induced
product states. The experiments, augmented by quantum chemical calculations,
reveal a complex combination of vibronic mechanisms responsible for the observed 
changes in electron transfer rates and pathways. The study raises new fundamental
questions about the function of vibrational processes immediately following
charge transfer photoexcitation, and highlights the molecular features necessary 
for external vibronic control of excited-state processes.

Microcompartmentalization offers a high-throughput method for screening large
numbers of biocatalysts generated from genetic libraries. Here we present a
microcompartmentalization protocol for benchmarking the performance of whole-cell
biocatalysts. Gel capsules served as nanolitre reactors (nLRs) for the
cultivation and analysis of a library of Bacillus subtilis biocatalysts. The B.
subtilis cells, which were co-confined with E. coli sensor cells inside the nLRs,
converted the starting material cellobiose into the industrial product vitamin
B2. Product formation triggered a sequence of reactions in the sensor cells: (1) 
conversion of B2 into flavin mononucleotide (FMN), (2) binding of FMN by a RNA
riboswitch and (3) self-cleavage of RNA, which resulted in (4) the synthesis of a
green fluorescent protein (GFP). The intensity of GFP fluorescence was then used 
to isolate B. subtilis variants that convert cellobiose into vitamin B2 with
elevated efficiency. The underlying design principles of the assay are general
and enable the development of similar protocols, which ultimately will speed up
the optimization of whole-cell biocatalysts.

Amide-forming ligation reactions allow the chemical synthesis of proteins by the 
union of unprotected peptide segments, and enable the preparation of protein
derivatives not accessible by expression or bioengineering approaches. The native
chemical ligation (NCL) of thioesters and N-terminal cysteines is unquestionably 
the most successful approach, but is not ideal for all synthetic targets. Here we
describe the synthesis of an Fmoc-protected oxazetidine amino acid for use in the
α-ketoacid-hydroxylamine (KAHA) amide ligation. When incorporated at the
N-terminus of a peptide segment, this four-membered cyclic hydroxylamine can be
used for rapid serine-forming ligations with peptide α-ketoacids. This ligation
operates at low concentration (100 μM-5 mM) and mild temperatures (20-25 °C). The
utility of the reaction was demonstrated by the synthesis of S100A4, a 12 kDa
calcium-binding protein not easily accessible by NCL or other amide-forming
reactions due to its primary sequence and properties.

Interferences are genuine quantum phenomena that appear whenever two seemingly
distinct classical trajectories lead to the same outcome. They are common in
elastic scattering but are seldom observable in chemical reactions. Here we
report experimental measurements of the state-to-state angular distribution for
the H + D2 reaction using the 'photoloc' technique. For products in low
rotational and vibrational states, a characteristic oscillation pattern governs
backward scattering. The comparison between the experiments, rigorous quantum
calculations and classical trajectories on an accurate potential energy surface
allows us to trace the origin of that structure to the quantum interference
between different quasiclassical mechanisms, a phenomenon analogous to that
observed in the double-slit experiment.

The hallmark of enzymes from secondary metabolic pathways is the pairing of
powerful reactivity with exquisite site selectivity. The application of these
biocatalytic tools in organic synthesis, however, remains under-utilized due to
limitations in substrate scope and scalability. Here, we report how the
reactivity of a monooxygenase (PikC) from the pikromycin pathway is modified
through computationally guided protein and substrate engineering, and applied to 
the oxidation of unactivated methylene C-H bonds. Molecular dynamics and quantum 
mechanical calculations were used to develop a predictive model for substrate
scope, site selectivity and stereoselectivity of PikC-mediated C-H oxidation. A
suite of menthol derivatives was screened computationally and evaluated through
in vitro reactions, where each substrate adhered to the predicted models for
selectivity and conversion to product. This platform was also expanded beyond
menthol-based substrates to the selective hydroxylation of a variety of substrate
cores ranging from cyclic to fused bicyclic and bridged bicyclic compounds.

The ability to guide the assembly of nanosized objects reversibly with external
stimuli, in particular light, is of fundamental importance, and it contributes to
the development of applications as diverse as nanofabrication and controlled drug
delivery. However, all the systems described to date are based on nanoparticles
(NPs) that are inherently photoresponsive, which makes their preparation
cumbersome and can markedly hamper their performance. Here we describe a
conceptually new methodology to assemble NPs reversibly using light that does not
require the particles to be functionalized with light-responsive ligands. Our
strategy is based on the use of a photoswitchable medium that responds to light
in such a way that it modulates the interparticle interactions. NP assembly
proceeds quantitatively and without apparent fatigue, both in solution and in
gels. Exposing the gels to light in a spatially controlled manner allowed us to
draw images that spontaneously disappeared after a specific period of time.

Diels-Alderase-free, bis-pericyclic, [4+2] dimerization in the biosynthesis of

The natural product paracaseolide A is a tetracyclic dilactone containing six
adjacent stereocentres. Its skeleton occupies a unique structural space among the
>200,000 characterized secondary metabolites. Six different research groups have 
reported a chemical synthesis of this compound, five of which used a thermal, net
Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition and dehydration at 110 °C to access the target by
dimerization of a simple butenolide precursor. Here, we report that this
dimerization proceeds under much milder conditions and with a different
stereochemical outcome than previously recognized. This can be rationalized by
invoking a bis-pericyclic transition state. Furthermore, we find that spontaneous
epimerization, necessary to correct the configuration at one key stereocentre, is
viable and that natural paracaseolide A is racemic. Together, these facts point
to the absence of enzymatic catalysis (that is, Diels-Alderase activity) in the
cycloaddition and strongly suggest that a non-enzyme-mediated dimerization is the
actual event by which paracaseolide A is produced in nature.

The development of solid materials that can be reversibly interconverted by light
between forms with different physico-chemical properties is of great interest for
separation, catalysis, optoelectronics, holography, mechanical actuation and
solar energy conversion. Here, we describe a series of shape-persistent
azobenzene tetramers that form porous molecular crystals in their
E-configuration, the porosity of which can be tuned by changing the peripheral
substituents on the molecule. Efficient E→Z photoisomerization of the azobenzene 
units takes place in the solid state and converts the crystals into a non-porous 
amorphous melt phase. Crystallinity and porosity are restored upon Z→E
isomerization promoted by visible light irradiation or heating. We demonstrate
that the photoisomerization enables reversible on/off switching of optical
properties such as birefringence as well as the capture of CO2 from the gas
phase. The linear design, structural versatility and synthetic accessibility make
this new family of materials potentially interesting for technological
applications.

It is known that excitation by visible light of the singlet metal-to-ligand
charge-transfer ((1)MLCT) states of Fe(II) complexes leads to population of the
lowest-lying high-spin quintet state ((5)T) with unity quantum yield. Here we
investigate this so-called spin crossover (SCO) transition in aqueous
iron(II)tris(bipyridine). We use pump-probe transient absorption spectroscopy
with a high time resolution of <60 fs in the ultraviolet probe range, in which
the (5)T state absorbs, and of <40 fs in the visible probe range, in which both
the hot MLCT state and the (5)T state absorb. Our results show that the (5)T
state is impulsively populated in less than 50 fs, which is the time we measured 
for the depopulation of the MCLT manifold. We propose that non-totally-symmetric 
modes mediate the process, possibly high-frequency modes of the bipyridine (bpy) 
ligand. These results show that even though the SCO process in Fe(II) complexes
represents a strongly spin-forbidden (ΔS = 2) two-electron transition, spin
flipping occurs at near subvibrational times and is intertwined with the electron
and structural dynamics of the system.

Reactive intermediates are involved in many chemical transformations. However,
their characterization is a great challenge because of their short lifetimes and 
high reactivities. Arynes, formally derived from arenes by the removal of two
hydrogen atoms from adjacent carbon atoms, are prominent reactive intermediates
that have been hypothesized for more than a century. Their rich chemistry enables
a widespread use in synthetic chemistry, as they are advantageous building blocks
for the construction of polycyclic compounds that contain aromatic rings. Here,
we demonstrate the generation and characterization of individual polycyclic aryne
molecules on an ultrathin insulating film by means of low-temperature scanning
tunnelling microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Bond-order analysis suggests
that a cumulene resonance structure is the dominant one, and the aryne reactivity
is preserved at cryogenic temperatures. Our results provide important insights
into the chemistry of these elusive intermediates and their potential application
in the field of on-surface synthesis.

Development of a biologically active secondary metabolite into a useful medicine 
requires continuous access to meaningful quantities of material. Although any
chemical synthesis is broadly useful for its versatility, identification of a
synthesis route that can be economically scaled represents a greater challenge.
Here we report a concise synthesis of the neurotrophic trace metabolite
(-)-jiadifenolide and its production on a gram-scale. The brevity of the route
and the structural similarity of a key intermediate to many potent Illicium
terpenes make chemical synthesis the unquestionable method for accessing and
modifying these potential therapeutics.

Bioorthogonal catalysis broadens the functional possibilities of intracellular
chemistry. Effective delivery and regulation of synthetic catalytic systems in
cells are challenging due to the complex intracellular environment and catalyst
instability. Here, we report the fabrication of protein-sized bioorthogonal
nanozymes through the encapsulation of hydrophobic transition metal catalysts
into the monolayer of water-soluble gold nanoparticles. The activity of these
catalysts can be reversibly controlled by binding a supramolecular
cucurbit[7]uril 'gate-keeper' onto the monolayer surface, providing a biomimetic 
control mechanism that mimics the allosteric regulation of enzymes. The potential
of this gated nanozyme for use in imaging and therapeutic applications was
demonstrated through triggered cleavage of allylcarbamates for pro-fluorophore
activation and propargyl groups for prodrug activation inside living cells.

The ability to detect chirality gives stereochemically attuned nanosensors the
potential to revolutionize the study of biomolecular processes. Such devices may 
structurally characterize the mechanisms of protein-ligand binding, the
intermediates of amyloidogenic diseases and the effects of phosphorylation and
glycosylation. We demonstrate that single nanoparticle plasmonic reporters, or
nanotags, can enable a stereochemical response to be transmitted from a chiral
analyte to an achiral benzotriazole dye molecule in the vicinity of a plasmon
resonance from an achiral metallic nanostructure. The transfer of chirality was
verified by the measurement of mirror image surface enhanced resonance Raman
optical activity spectra for the two enantiomers of both ribose and tryptophan.
Computational modelling confirms these observations and reveals the novel
chirality transfer mechanism responsible. This is the first report of colloidal
metal nanoparticles in the form of single plasmonic substrates displaying an
intrinsic chiral sensitivity once attached to a chiral molecule.

To further our fundamental understanding of the nature and extent of covalency in
uranium-ligand bonding, and the benefits that this may have for the design of new
ligands for nuclear waste separation, there is burgeoning interest in the nature 
of uranium complexes with soft- and multiple-bond-donor ligands. Despite this,
there have so far been no examples of structurally authenticated molecular
uranium-arsenic bonds under ambient conditions. Here, we report molecular
uranium(IV)-arsenic complexes featuring formal single, double and triple U-As
bonding interactions. Compound formulations are supported by a range of
characterization techniques, and theoretical calculations suggest the presence of
polarized covalent one-, two- and threefold bonding interactions between uranium 
and arsenic in parent arsenide [U-AsH2], terminal arsinidene [U=AsH] and arsenido
[U≡AsK2] complexes, respectively. These studies inform our understanding of the
bonding of actinides with soft donor ligands and may be of use in future ligand
design in this area.

Crude oil currently provides much of the world's energy, but it is also the
source of many feedstock chemicals. Methodology for the conversion of biomass
into useful chemicals has often focused on either complete deoxygenation or the
production of high-volume platform chemicals. Here, we describe the
chemoselective partial reduction of silyl-protected C6O6-derived polyols to
produce a diverse set of oxygen-functionalized chiral synthons. The combination
of B(C6F5)3 and a tertiary silane efficiently generates a reactive equivalent of 
an electrophilic silylium ion (R3Si(+)) and a hydride (H(-)) reducing agent. The 
mechanism of oxygen loss does not involve a dehydrative elimination and thus
avoids ablation of stereochemistry. Neighbouring group participation and the
formation of cyclic intermediates is key to achieving selectivity in these
reactions and, where both primary and secondary C-O bonds are present, the
mechanism allows further control. The method provides--in one or two synthetic
steps--highly improved syntheses of many C6On synthons as well as several
previously undescribed products.

The analysis of cell-free nucleic acids (cfNAs), which are present at significant
levels in the blood of cancer patients, can reveal the mutational spectrum of a
tumour without the need for invasive sampling of the tissue. However, this
requires differentiation between the nucleic acids that originate from healthy
cells and the mutated sequences shed by tumour cells. Here we report an
electrochemical clamp assay that directly detects mutated sequences in patient
serum. This is the first successful detection of cfNAs without the need for
enzymatic amplification, a step that normally requires extensive sample
processing and is prone to interference. The new chip-based assay reads out the
presence of mutations within 15 minutes using a collection of oligonucleotides
that sequester closely related sequences in solution, and thus allow only the
mutated sequence to bind to a chip-based sensor. We demonstrate excellent levels 
of sensitivity and specificity and show that the clamp assay accurately detects
mutated sequences in a collection of samples taken from lung cancer and melanoma 
patients.

'Roaming' is a new and unusual class of reaction mechanism that has recently been
discovered in unimolecular dissociation reactions of isolated molecules in the
gas phase. It is characterized by frustrated bond cleavage, after which the two
incipient fragments 'roam' on a flat region of the potential energy surface
before reacting with one another. Here, we provide evidence that supports roaming
in the liquid phase. We are now able to explain previous solution-phase
experiments by comparing them with new ultrafast transient absorption data
showing the photoisomerization of gas-phase CHBr3. We see that, upon S0-S1
excitation, gas-phase CHBr3 isomerizes within 100 fs into the BrHCBr-Br species, 
which is identical to what has been observed in solution. Similar sub-100 fs
isomerization is now also observed for BBr3 and PBr3 in solution upon S1
excitation. Quantum chemical simulations of XBr3 (X = B, P or CH) suggest that
photochemical reactivity in all three cases studied is governed by S1/S0 conical 
intersections and can best be described as occurring through roaming-mediated
pathways.

The rapid and selective regulation of a target protein within living cells that
contain closely related family members is an outstanding challenge. Here we
introduce genetically directed bioorthogonal ligand tethering (BOLT) and
demonstrate selective inhibition (iBOLT) of protein function. In iBOLT,
inhibitor-conjugate/target protein pairs are created where the target protein
contains a genetically encoded unnatural amino acid with bioorthogonal reactivity
and the inhibitor conjugate contains a complementary bioorthogonal group. iBOLT
enables the first rapid and specific inhibition of MEK isozymes, and introducing 
photoisomerizable linkers in the inhibitor conjugate enables reversible, optical 
regulation of protein activity (photo-BOLT) in live mammalian cells. We
demonstrate that a pan kinase inhibitor conjugate allows selective and rapid
inhibition of the lymphocyte specific kinase, indicating the modularity and
scalability of BOLT. We anticipate that BOLT will enable the rapid and selective 
regulation of diverse proteins for which no selective small-molecule ligands
exist.

Hybridization of complementary sequences is one of the central tenets of nucleic 
acid chemistry; however, the unintended binding of closely related sequences
limits the accuracy of hybridization-based approaches to analysing nucleic acids.
Thermodynamics-guided probe design and empirical optimization of the reaction
conditions have been used to enable the discrimination of single-nucleotide
variants, but typically these approaches provide only an approximately 25-fold
difference in binding affinity. Here we show that simulations of the binding
kinetics are both necessary and sufficient to design nucleic acid probe systems
with consistently high specificity as they enable the discovery of an optimal
combination of thermodynamic parameters. Simulation-guided probe systems designed
against 44 sequences of different target single-nucleotide variants showed
between a 200- and 3,000-fold (median 890) higher binding affinity than their
corresponding wild-type sequences. As a demonstration of the usefulness of this
simulation-guided design approach, we developed probes that, in combination with 
PCR amplification, detect low concentrations of variant alleles (1%) in human
genomic DNA.

Borromean rings or links are topologically complex assemblies of three entangled 
rings where no two rings are interlinked in a chain-like catenane, yet the three 
rings cannot be separated. We report here a metallacycle complex whose
crystalline network forms the first example of a new class of entanglement. The
complex is formed from the self-assembly of CuBr2 with the
cyclotriveratrylene-scaffold ligand (±)-tris(iso-nicotinoyl)cyclotriguaiacylene. 
Individual metallacycles are interwoven into a two-dimensional chainmail network 
where each metallacycle exhibits multiple Borromean-ring-like associations with
its neighbours. This only occurs in the solid state, and also represents the
first example of a crystalline infinite chainmail two-dimensional network.
Crystals of the complex were twinned and have an unusual hollow tubular
morphology that is likely to result from a localized
dissolution-recrystallization process.

Adsorption-induced auto-amplification of enantiomeric excess on an achiral
surface.

The homochirality of biomolecules is a signature of life on Earth and has
significant implications in, for example, the production of pharmaceutical
compounds. It has been suggested that biomolecular homochirality may have arisen 
from the amplification of a spontaneously formed small enantiomeric excess
(e.e.). Many minerals exhibit naturally chiral surfaces and so adsorption has
been proposed as one possible mechanism for such an amplification of e.e. Here we
show that when gas-phase mixtures of D- and L-aspartic acid are exposed to an
achiral Cu(111) surface, a small e.e. in the gas phase, e.e.g, leads to an
amplification of the e.e. on the surface, e.e.s, under equilibrium conditions.
Adsorption-induced amplification of e.e. does not require a chiral surface. The
dependence of e.e.s on e.e.g has been modelled successfully using a Langmuir-like
adsorption isotherm that incorporates the formation of homochiral adsorbate
clusters on the surface.

A 'molecular shuttle' is an interlocked molecular assembly in which a macrocyclic
ring is able to move back and forth between two recognition sites. This
large-amplitude translational motion was first characterized in solution in 1991.
Since that report, many mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) have been
designed, synthesized and shown to mimic the complex functions of macroscopic
switches and machines. Here, we show that this fundamental concept-the
translational motion of a molecular shuttle-can be organized, initiated and made 
to operate inside a crystalline, solid-state material. A metal-organic framework 
(MOF) designated UWDM-4 was prepared that contains a rigid linker that is a
molecular shuttle. It was demonstrated by variable-temperature (1)H-(13)C
cross-polarization/magic-angle spinning (CP/MAS) and (13)C 2D exchange
correlation spectroscopy (EXSY) solid-state NMR at 21.1 T on a (13)C-enriched
sample that the macrocyclic ring undergoes rapid shuttling along the rigid axle
built between struts of the framework.

Molecular SiO2 and other simple silicon oxides have remained elusive despite the 
indispensable use of silicon dioxide materials in advanced electronic devices.
Owing to the great reactivity of silicon-oxygen double bonds, as well as the low 
oxidation state of silicon atoms, the chemistry of simple silicon oxides is
essentially unknown. We now report that the soluble disilicon compound, L:Si=Si:L
(where L: = :C{N(2,6-(i)Pr2C6H3)CH}2), can be directly oxidized by N2O and O2 to 
give the carbene-stabilized Si2O3 and Si2O4 moieties, respectively. The nature of
the silicon oxide units in these compounds is probed by spectroscopic methods,
complementary computations and single-crystal X-ray diffraction.

The emergence of an RNA catalyst capable of self-replication is considered a key 
transition in the origin of life. However, how such replicase ribozymes emerged
from the pools of short RNA oligomers arising from prebiotic chemistry and
non-enzymatic replication is unclear. Here we show that RNA polymerase ribozymes 
can assemble from simple catalytic networks of RNA oligomers no longer than 30
nucleotides. The entropically disfavoured assembly reaction is driven by
iterative freeze-thaw cycles, even in the absence of external activation
chemistry. The steep temperature and concentration gradients of such cycles
result in an RNA chaperone effect that enhances the otherwise only partially
realized catalytic potential of the RNA oligomer pool by an order of magnitude.
Our work outlines how cyclic physicochemical processes could have driven an
expansion of RNA compositional and phenotypic complexity from simple oligomer
pools.

In the search for improved energy storage, rechargeable metal-oxygen batteries
are very attractive owing to their reliance on molecular oxygen, which forms
oxides on discharge that decompose reversibly on charge. Much focus has been
directed at aprotic Li-O2 cells, but the aprotic Na-O2 system is of equal
interest because of its better reversibility. We report here on the critical role
and mechanism of phase-transfer catalysis in Na-O2 batteries. We find that it is 
solely responsible for the growth and dissolution of micrometre-sized cubic NaO2 
crystals and for the reversible cell capacity. In the absence of phase-transfer
catalysis, quasi-amorphous NaO2 films are formed and cells exhibit negligible
capacity. Electrochemical investigations provide a measure of the transportation 
of superoxide from the carbon electrode to the electrolyte phase by the phase
transfer catalyst. This leads to a new understanding of the mechanism of Na-O2
batteries that, significantly, extends to Li-O2 cells and explains their
different behaviour.

Artemisinin is an important antimalarial drug, but, at present, the environmental
and economic costs of its semi-synthetic production are relatively high. Most of 
these costs lie in the final chemical steps, which follow a complex acid- and
photo-catalysed route with oxygenation by both singlet and triplet oxygen. We
demonstrate that applying the principles of green chemistry can lead to
innovative strategies that avoid many of the problems in current photochemical
processes. The first strategy combines the use of liquid CO2 as solvent and a
dual-function solid acid/photocatalyst. The second strategy is an
ambient-temperature reaction in aqueous mixtures of organic solvents, where the
only inputs are dihydroartemisinic acid, O2 and light, and the output is pure,
crystalline artemisinin. Everything else-solvents, photocatalyst and aqueous
acid-can be recycled. Some aspects developed here through green chemistry are
likely to have wider application in photochemistry and other reactions.

The highest-energy stereoisomer of 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexafluorocyclohexane, in which
all of the fluorines are 'up', is prepared in a 12-step protocol. The molecule
adopts a classic chair conformation with alternate C-F bonds aligned triaxially, 
clustering three highly electronegative fluorine atoms in close proximity. This
generates a cyclohexane with a high molecular dipole (μ = 6.2 D), unusual in an
otherwise aliphatic compound. X-ray analysis indicates that the intramolecular
Fax···Fax distances (∼2.77 Å) are longer than the vicinal Fax···Feq- distances
(∼2.73 Å) suggesting a tension stabilizing the chair conformation. In the solid
state the molecules pack in an orientation consistent with electrostatic
ordering. Our synthesis of this highest-energy isomer demonstrates the properties
that accompany the placement of axial fluorines on a cyclohexane and the unusual 
property of a facially polarized ring in organic chemistry. Derivatives have
potential as new motifs for the design of functional organic molecules or for
applications in supramolecular chemistry design.

Tandem catalysis is a growing field that is beginning to yield important
scientific and technological advances toward new and more efficient catalytic
processes. 'One-pot' tandem reactions, where multiple catalysts and reagents,
combined in a single reaction vessel undergo a sequence of precisely staged
catalytic steps, are highly attractive from the standpoint of reducing both waste
and time. Orthogonal tandem catalysis is a subset of one-pot reactions in which
more than one catalyst is used to promote two or more mechanistically distinct
reaction steps. This Perspective summarizes and analyses some of the recent
developments and successes in orthogonal tandem catalysis, with particular focus 
on recent strategies to address catalyst incompatibility. We also highlight the
concept of thermodynamic leveraging by coupling multiple catalyst cycles to
effect challenging transformations not observed in single-step processes, and to 
encourage application of this technique to energetically unfavourable or
demanding reactions.

Supramolecular nesting of cyclic polymers.

Kondratuk DV, Perdigão LM, Esmail AM, O'Shea JN, Beton PH, Anderson HL.

Advances in template-directed synthesis make it possible to create artificial
molecules with protein-like dimensions, directly from simple components. These
synthetic macromolecules have a proclivity for self-organization that is
reminiscent of biopolymers. Here, we report the synthesis of monodisperse cyclic 
porphyrin polymers, with diameters of up to 21 nm (750 C–C bonds). The ratio of
the intrinsic viscosities for cyclic and linear topologies is 0.72, indicating
that these polymers behave as almost ideal flexible chains in solution. When
deposited on gold surfaces, the cyclic polymers display a new mode of
two-dimensional supramolecular organization, combining encapsulation and nesting;
one nanoring adopts a near-circular conformation, thus allowing a second nanoring
to be captured within its perimeter, in a tightly folded conformation. Scanning
tunnelling microscopy reveals that nesting occurs in combination with stacking
when nanorings are deposited under vacuum, whereas when they are deposited
directly from solution under ambient conditions there is stacking or nesting, but
not a combination of both.

Ligands that can bind selectively to proteins with single amino-acid point
mutations offer the potential to detect or treat an abnormal protein in the
presence of the wild type (WT). However, it is difficult to develop a selective
ligand if the point mutation is not associated with an addressable location, such
as a binding pocket. Here we report an all-chemical synthetic epitope-targeting
strategy that we used to discover a 5-mer peptide with selectivity for the
E17K-transforming point mutation in the pleckstrin homology domain of the Akt1
oncoprotein. A fragment of Akt1 that contained the E17K mutation and an
I19[propargylglycine] substitution was synthesized to form an addressable
synthetic epitope. Azide-presenting peptides that clicked covalently onto this
alkyne-presenting epitope were selected from a library using in situ screening.
One peptide exhibits a 10:1 in vitro selectivity for the oncoprotein relative to 
the WT, with a similar selectivity in cells. This 5-mer peptide was expanded into
a larger ligand that selectively blocks the E17K Akt1 interaction with its PIP3
(phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate) substrate.

The efficient extraction of (bio)molecules from fluid mixtures is vital for
applications ranging from target characterization in (bio)chemistry to
environmental analysis and biomedical diagnostics. Inspired by biological
processes that seamlessly synchronize the capture, transport and release of
biomolecules, we designed a robust chemomechanical sorting system capable of the 
concerted catch and release of target biomolecules from a solution mixture. The
hybrid system is composed of target-specific, reversible binding sites attached
to microscopic fins embedded in a responsive hydrogel that moves the cargo
between two chemically distinct environments. To demonstrate the utility of the
system, we focus on the effective separation of thrombin by synchronizing the
pH-dependent binding strength of a thrombin-specific aptamer with volume changes 
of the pH-responsive hydrogel in a biphasic microfluidic regime, and show a
non-destructive separation that has a quantitative sorting efficiency, as well as
the system's stability and amenability to multiple solution recycling.

Methods to attach polypeptides to lipid bilayers are often indirect and
ineffective, and can represent a substantial bottleneck in the formation of
functionalized lipid-based materials. Although the polyhistidine tag (his-tag)
has been transformative in its simplicity and efficacy in binding to immobilized 
metals, the successful application of this approach has been challenging in
physiological settings. Here we show that lipid bilayers containing
porphyrin-phospholipid conjugates that are chelated with cobalt, but not with
other metals, can effectively capture his-tagged proteins and peptides. The
binding follows a Co(II) to Co(III) transition and occurs within the sheltered
hydrophobic bilayer, resulting in an essentially irreversible attachment in serum
or in a million fold excess of competing imidazole. Using this approach we
anchored homing peptides into the bilayer of preformed and cargo-loaded liposomes
to enable tumour targeting without disrupting the bilayer integrity. As a further
demonstration, a synthetic protein fragment derived from the human
immunodeficiency virus was bound to immunogenic liposomes for potent antibody
generation for an otherwise non-antigenic peptide.

Streptococcal bacteria use peptide signals as a means of intraspecies
communication. These peptides can contain unusual post-translational
modifications, providing opportunities for expanding our understanding of
nature's chemical and biosynthetic repertoires. Here, we have combined tools from
natural products discovery and mechanistic enzymology to elucidate the structure 
and biosynthesis of streptide, a streptococcal macrocyclic peptide. We show that 
streptide bears an unprecedented post-translational modification involving a
covalent linkage between two unactivated carbons within the side chains of lysine
and tryptophan. The biosynthesis of streptide was addressed by genetic and
biochemical studies. The former implicated a new SPASM-domain-containing radical 
SAM enzyme StrB, while the latter revealed that StrB contains two [4Fe-4S]
clusters and installs the unusual lysine-to-tryptophan crosslink in a single
step. By intramolecularly stitching together the side chains of lysine and
tryptophan, StrB provides a new route for biosynthesizing macrocyclic peptides.

Phytochromes are bimodal photoswitches composed of a photosensor and an output
module. Photoactivation of the sensor is initiated by a double bond isomerization
of the tetrapyrrole chromophore and eventually leads to protein conformational
changes. Recently determined structural models of phytochromes identify
differences between the inactive and the signalling state but do not reveal the
mechanism of photosensor activation or deactivation. Here, we report a
vibrational spectroscopic study on bathy phytochromes that demonstrates that the 
formation of the photoactivated state and thus (de)activation of the output
module is based on proton translocations in the chromophore pocket coupling
chromophore and protein structural changes. These proton transfer steps,
involving the tetrapyrrole and a nearby histidine, also enable thermal
back-isomerization of the chromophore via keto-enol tautomerization to afford the
initial dark state. Thus, the same proton re-arrangements inducing the
(de)activation of the output module simultaneously initiate the reversal of this 
process, corresponding to a negative feedback mechanism.

The reversal of (anti)aromaticity in a molecule's triplet excited state compared 
with its closed-shell singlet ground state is known as Baird's rule and has
attracted the interest of synthetic, physical organic chemists and theorists
because of the potential to modulate the fundamental properties of highly
conjugated molecules. Here we show that two closely related bis-rhodium
hexaphyrins (R26H and R28H) containing [26] and [28] π-electron peripheries,
respectively, exhibit properties consistent with Baird's rule. In the ground
state, R26H exhibits a sharp Soret-like band and distinct Q-like bands
characteristic of an aromatic porphyrinoid, whereas R28H exhibits a broad
absorption spectrum without Q-like bands, which is typical of an antiaromatic
porphyrinoid. In contrast, the T-T absorption of R26H is broad, weak and
featureless, whereas that of R28H displays an intense and sharp Soret-like band. 
These spectral signatures, in combination with quantum chemical calculations, are
in line with qualitative expectations based on Baird's rule.

Members of the human microbiota are increasingly being correlated to human health
and disease states, but the majority of the underlying microbial metabolites that
regulate host-microbe interactions remain largely unexplored. Select strains of
Escherichia coli present in the human colon have been linked to the initiation of
inflammation-induced colorectal cancer through an unknown small-molecule-mediated
process. The responsible non-ribosomal peptide-polyketide hybrid pathway encodes 
'colibactin', which belongs to a largely uncharacterized family of small
molecules. Genotoxic small molecules from this pathway that are capable of
initiating cancer formation have remained elusive due to their high instability. 
Guided by metabolomic analyses, here we employ a combination of NMR spectroscopy 
and bioinformatics-guided isotopic labelling studies to characterize the
colibactin warhead, an unprecedented substituted spirobicyclic structure. The
warhead crosslinks duplex DNA in vitro, providing direct experimental evidence
for colibactin's DNA-damaging activity. The data support unexpected models for
both colibactin biosynthesis and its mode of action.

The search for improved heterogeneous catalysts is an important but difficult
task. Scaling relations between the adsorption energies of reaction intermediates
greatly facilitate the computational design of catalysts. However, this
methodology does not currently incorporate structure sensitivity and hence cannot
describe adequately the overall activity of realistic catalyst particles and
extended surfaces with several facets, edges and apices. Here, we generalize
scaling relations by examining twelve different low-index, stepped and kinked
surfaces of nine transition metals. This allows us to quantify the effect of the 
adsorption-site geometry on these relations, ensures a full prediction of their
parameters, and helps in identifying intrinsic thermodynamic restrictions to the 
performance of catalysts. The resulting fully predictable, structure-sensitive
scaling relations are a step towards the long-sought rational design of
multifaceted catalytic particles. Such a design can now target not only the
chemical nature of active materials but also the actual geometry of their active 
sites.

Post-translational modification of the histone proteins in chromatin plays a
central role in the epigenetic control of DNA-templated processes in eukaryotic
cells. Developing methods that enable the structure of histones to be manipulated
is, therefore, essential to understand the biochemical mechanisms that underlie
genomic regulation. Here we present a synthetic biology method to engineer
histones that bear site-specific modifications on cellular chromatin using
protein trans-splicing (PTS). We genetically fused the N-terminal fragment of
ultrafast split intein to the C terminus of histone H2B, which, on reaction with 
a complementary synthetic C intein, generated labelled histone. Using this
approach, we incorporated various non-native chemical modifications into
chromatin in vivo with temporal control. Furthermore, the time and concentration 
dependence of PTS performed in nucleo enabled us to examine differences in the
accessibility of the euchromatin and heterochromatin regions of the epigenome.
Finally, we used PTS to semisynthesize a native histone modification, H2BK120
ubiquitination, in isolated nuclei and showed that this can trigger downstream
epigenetic crosstalk of H3K79 methylation.

Fractals, being "exactly the same at every scale or nearly the same at different 
scales" as defined by Benoit B. Mandelbrot, are complicated yet fascinating
patterns that are important in aesthetics, mathematics, science and engineering. 
Extended molecular fractals formed by the self-assembly of small-molecule
components have long been pursued but, to the best of our knowledge, not
achieved. To tackle this challenge we designed and made two aromatic bromo
compounds (4,4″-dibromo-1,1':3',1″-terphenyl and
4,4‴-dibromo-1,1':3',1″:4″,1‴-quaterphenyl) to serve as building blocks. The
formation of synergistic halogen and hydrogen bonds between these molecules is
the driving force to assemble successfully a whole series of defect-free
molecular fractals, specifically Sierpiński triangles, on a Ag(111) surface below
80 K. Several critical points that govern the preparation of the molecular
Sierpiński triangles were scrutinized experimentally and revealed explicitly.
This new strategy may be applied to prepare and explore various planar molecular 
fractals at surfaces.

Weakness in a material, especially when challenged by chemical, mechanical or
physical stimuli, is often viewed as something extremely negative. There are
countless examples in which interesting-looking materials have been dismissed as 
being too unstable for an application. But instability with respect to a stimulus
is not always a negative point. In this Perspective we highlight situations where
weakness in a material can be used as a synthetic tool to prepare materials that,
at present, are difficult or even impossible to prepare using traditional
synthetic approaches. To emphasize the concept, we will draw upon examples in the
field of nanoporous materials, concentrating on metal-organic frameworks and
zeolites, but the general concepts are likely to be applicable across a wide
range of materials chemistry. In zeolite chemistry, there is a particular problem
with accessing hypothetical structures that this approach may solve.

Interlocked molecules possess properties and functions that depend upon their
intricate connectivity. In addition to the topologically trivial rotaxanes, whose
structures may be captured by a planar graph, the topologically non-trivial knots
and catenanes represent some of chemistry's most challenging synthetic targets
because of the three-dimensional assembly necessary for their construction. Here 
we report the synthesis of a cyclic [3]catenane, which consists of three mutually
interpenetrating rings, via an unusual synthetic route. Five distinct building
blocks self-assemble into a heteroleptic triangular framework composed of two
joined Fe(II)3L3 circular helicates. Subcomponent exchange then enables specific 
points in the framework to be linked together to generate the cyclic [3]catenane 
product. Our method represents an advance both in the intricacy of the
metal-templated self-assembly procedure and in the use of selective imine
exchange to generate a topologically complex product.

In molecular collisions, long-lived complexes may be formed that correspond to
quasi-bound states in the van der Waals potential and give rise to peaks in the
collision energy-dependent cross-sections. They are known as 'resonances' and
their experimental detection remains difficult because their signatures are
extremely challenging to resolve. Here, we show a complete characterization of
quantum-dynamical resonances occurring in CO-He inelastic collisions with
rotational CO(j = 0->1) excitation. Crossed-beam scattering experiments were
performed at collision energies as low as 4 cm(-1), equivalent to a temperature
of 4 K. Resonance structures in the measured cross-sections were identified by
comparison with quantum-mechanical calculations. The excellent agreement found
confirms that the potential energy surfaces describing the CO-He van der Waals
interaction are perfectly suitable for calculating state-to-state (de)excitation 
rate coefficients at the very low temperatures needed in chemical modelling of
the interstellar medium. We also computed these rate coefficients.

Light-emitting materials, especially those with tunable wavelengths, attract
considerable attention for applications in optoelectronic devices, fluorescent
probes, sensors and so on. Many species evaluated for these purposes either emit 
as a dilute solution or on aggregation, with the former often self-quenching at
high concentrations, and the latter falling dark when aggregation is disrupted.
Here we preserve emissive behaviour at both low- and high-concentration regimes
for two discrete supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs). These tetragonal
prismatic SCCs are self-assembled on mixing a metal acceptor,
Pt(PEt3)2(OSO2CF3)2, with two organic donors, a pyridyl-decorated
tetraphenylethylene and one of two benzene dicarboxylate species. The rigid
organization of these fluorescence-active ligands imparts an emissive behaviour
to dilute solutions of the resulting assemblies. Furthermore, on aggregation the 
prisms exhibit variable-wavelength visible-light emission, including rare
white-light emission in tetrahydrofuran. The favourable photophysical properties 
and solvent-dependent aggregation behaviour provide a means to tune emission
wavelengths.

The ab initio design of synthetic molecular receptors for a specific biomolecular
guest remains an elusive objective, particularly for targets such as
monosaccharides, which have very close structural analogues. Here we report a
powerful approach to produce receptors with very high selectivity for specific
monosaccharides and, as a demonstration, we develop a foldamer that selectively
encapsulates fructose. The approach uses an iterative design process that
exploits the modular structure of folded synthetic oligomer sequences in
conjunction with molecular modelling and structural characterization to inform
subsequent refinements. Starting from a first-principles design taking size,
shape and hydrogen-bonding ability into account and using the high predictability
of aromatic oligoamide foldamer conformations and their propensity to
crystallize, a sequence that binds to β-D-fructopyranose in organic solvents with
atomic-scale complementarity was obtained in just a few iterative modifications. 
This scheme, which mimics the adaptable construction of biopolymers from a
limited number of monomer units, provides a general protocol for the development 
of selective receptors.

In a typical hydrogen-producing photoelectrochemical cell (PEC), water reduction 
at the cathode (producing hydrogen) is accompanied by water oxidation at the
anode (producing oxygen). This anode reaction is, however, not kinetically
favourable. Here we investigate the possibility of utilizing solar energy for
biomass conversion by performing the oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF)
into 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) at the anode of a PEC. HMF is a key
intermediate in biomass conversion, and FDCA is an important monomer for the
production of numerous polymers. Using 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl as a 
mediator, we obtained a near-quantitative yield and 100% Faradaic efficiency at
ambient conditions without the use of precious-metal catalysts. This reaction is 
also thermodynamically and kinetically more favourable than water oxidation. Our 
results suggest that solar-driven biomass conversion can be a viable anode
reaction that has the potential to increase both the efficiency and the utility
of PECs constructed for solar-fuel production.

Forbidden reactions, such as those that violate orbital symmetry effects as
captured in the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, remain an ongoing challenge for
experimental characterization, because when the competing allowed pathway is
available the reactions are intrinsically difficult to trigger. Recent
developments in covalent mechanochemistry have opened the door to activating
otherwise inaccessible reactions. Here we report single-molecule force
spectroscopy studies of three mechanically induced reactions along both their
symmetry-allowed and symmetry-forbidden pathways, which enables us to quantify
just how 'forbidden' each reaction is. To induce reactions on the ~0.1 s
timescale of the experiments, the forbidden ring-opening reactions of
benzocyclobutene, gem-difluorocyclopropane and gem-dichlorocyclopropane require
approximately 130 pN less, 560 pN more and 1,000 pN more force, respectively,
than their corresponding allowed analogues. The results provide the first
experimental benchmarks for mechanically induced forbidden reactions, and in some
cases suggest revisions to prior computational predictions.

Chemists and material scientists have often focused on the properties of
previously reported compounds, but neglect numerous unreported but chemically
plausible compounds that could have interesting properties. For example, the
18-valence electron ABX family of compounds features examples of topological
insulators, thermoelectrics and piezoelectrics, but only 83 out of 483 of these
possible compounds have been made. Using first-principles thermodynamics we
examined the theoretical stability of the 400 unreported members and predict that
54 should be stable. Of those previously unreported 'missing' materials now
predicted to be stable, 15 were grown in this study; X-ray studies agreed with
the predicted crystal structure in all 15 cases. Among the predicted and
characterized properties of the missing compounds are potential transparent
conductors, thermoelectric materials and topological semimetals. This integrated 
process-prediction of functionality in unreported compounds followed by
laboratory synthesis and characterization-could be a route to the systematic
discovery of hitherto missing, realizable functional materials.

A minimal cell can be thought of as comprising informational, compartment-forming
and metabolic subsystems. To imagine the abiotic assembly of such an overall
system, however, places great demands on hypothetical prebiotic chemistry. The
perceived differences and incompatibilities between these subsystems have led to 
the widely held assumption that one or other subsystem must have preceded the
others. Here we experimentally investigate the validity of this assumption by
examining the assembly of various biomolecular building blocks from prebiotically
plausible intermediates and one-carbon feedstock molecules. We show that
precursors of ribonucleotides, amino acids and lipids can all be derived by the
reductive homologation of hydrogen cyanide and some of its derivatives, and thus 
that all the cellular subsystems could have arisen simultaneously through common 
chemistry. The key reaction steps are driven by ultraviolet light, use hydrogen
sulfide as the reductant and can be accelerated by Cu(I)-Cu(II) photoredox
cycling.

DNA nanotubes offer a high aspect ratio and rigidity, attractive attributes for
the controlled assembly of hierarchically complex linear arrays. It is highly
desirable to control the positioning of rungs along the backbone of the
nanotubes, minimize the polydispersity in their manufacture and reduce the
building costs. We report here a solid-phase synthesis methodology in which,
through a cyclic scheme starting from a 'foundation rung' specifically bound to
the surface, distinct rungs can be incorporated in a predetermined manner. Each
rung is orthogonally addressable. Using fluorescently tagged rungs,
single-molecule fluorescence studies demonstrated the robustness and structural
fidelity of the constructs and confirmed the incorporation of the rungs in
quantitative yield (>95%) at each step of the cycle. Prototype structures that
consisted of up to 20 repeat units, about 450 nm in contour length, were
constructed. Combined, the solid-phase synthesis strategy described and its
visualization through single-molecule spectroscopy show good promise for the
production of custom-made DNA nanotubes.

Supramolecular chemistry uses non-covalent interactions to coax molecules into
forming ordered assemblies. The construction of ordered materials with these
reversible bonds has led to dramatic innovations in organic electronics, polymer 
science and biomaterials. Here, we review how supramolecular strategies can
advance the burgeoning field of organic ferroelectricity. Ferroelectrics -
materials with a spontaneous and electrically reversible polarization - are
touted for use in non-volatile computer memories, sensors and optics.
Historically, this physical phenomenon has been studied in inorganic materials,
although some organic examples are known and strong interest exists to extend the
search for ferroelectric molecular systems. Other undiscovered applications
outside this regime could also emerge. We describe the key features necessary for
molecular and supramolecular dipoles in organic ferroelectrics and their
incorporation into ordered systems, such as porous frameworks and liquid
crystals. The goal of this Review is to motivate the development of innovative
supramolecular ferroelectrics that exceed the performance and usefulness of known
systems.

Lipids are critical components of membranes that could affect the properties of
membrane proteins, yet the precise compositions of lipids surrounding
membrane-embedded protein complexes is often difficult to discern. Here we report
that, for the heterodimeric ABC transporter TmrAB, the extent of delipidation can
be controlled by timed exposure to detergent. We subsequently characterize the
cohort of endogenous lipids that are extracted in contact with the membrane
protein complex, and show that with prolonged delipidation the number of neutral 
lipids is reduced in favour of their negatively charged counterparts. We show
that lipid A is retained by the transporter and that the extent of its binding
decreases during the catalytic cycle, implying that lipid A release is linked to 
adenosine tri-phosphate hydrolysis. Together, these results enable us to propose 
that a subset of annular lipids is invariant in composition, with negatively
charged lipids binding tightly to TmrAB, and imply a role for this exporter in
glycolipid translocation.

Alkali metals can react explosively with water and it is textbook knowledge that 
this vigorous behaviour results from heat release, steam formation and ignition
of the hydrogen gas that is produced. Here we suggest that the initial process
enabling the alkali metal explosion in water is, however, of a completely
different nature. High-speed camera imaging of liquid drops of a sodium/potassium
alloy in water reveals submillisecond formation of metal spikes that protrude
from the surface of the drop. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that on 
immersion in water there is an almost immediate release of electrons from the
metal surface. The system thus quickly reaches the Rayleigh instability limit,
which leads to a 'coulomb explosion' of the alkali metal drop. Consequently, a
new metal surface in contact with water is formed, which explains why the
reaction does not become self-quenched by its products, but can rather lead to
explosive behaviour.

In contrast to standard fragment-based drug discovery approaches, dual-display
DNA-encoded chemical libraries have the potential to identify fragment pairs that
bind simultaneously and benefit from the chelate effect. However, the technology 
has been limited by the difficulty in unambiguously decoding the ligand pairs
from large combinatorial libraries. Here we report a strategy that overcomes this
limitation and enables the efficient identification of ligand pairs that bind to 
a target protein. Small organic molecules were conjugated to the 5' and 3' ends
of complementary DNA strands that contain a unique identifying code. DNA
hybridization followed by an inter-strand code-transfer created a stable
dual-display DNA-encoded chemical library of 111,100 members. Using this approach
we report the discovery of a low micromolar binder to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein
and the affinity maturation of a ligand to carbonic anhydrase IX, an established 
marker of renal cell carcinoma. The newly discovered subnanomolar carbonic
anhydrase IX binder dramatically improved tumour targeting performance in vivo.

Chiral, dimeric natural products containing complex structures and interesting
biological properties have inspired chemists and biologists for decades. A
seven-step total synthesis of the axially chiral, dimeric tetrahydroxanthone
natural product rugulotrosin A is described. The synthesis employs a one-pot
Suzuki coupling/dimerization to generate the requisite 2,2'-biaryl linkage.
Highly selective point-to-axial chirality transfer was achieved using palladium
catalysis with achiral phosphine ligands. Single X-ray crystal diffraction data
were obtained to confirm both the atropisomeric configuration and absolute
stereochemistry of rugulotrosin A. Computational studies are described to
rationalize the atropselectivity observed in the key dimerization step.
Comparison of the crude fungal extract with synthetic rugulotrosin A and its
atropisomer verified that nature generates a single atropisomer of the natural
product.

Since its discovery in 1825, benzene has served as one of the most used and
indispensable building blocks of chemical compounds, ranging from pharmaceuticals
and agrochemicals to plastics and those used in organic electronic devices.
Benzene has six hydrogen atoms that can each be replaced by different
substituents, which means that the structural diversity of benzene derivatives is
intrinsically extraordinary. The number of possible substituted benzenes from n
different substituents is (2n + 2n(2) + 4n(3) + 3n(4) + n(6))/12. However, owing 
to a lack of general synthetic methods for making multisubstituted benzenes, this
potentially huge structural diversity has not been fully exploited. Here, we
describe a programmed synthesis of hexaarylbenzenes using C-H activation,
cross-coupling and [4+2] cycloaddition reactions. The present method allows for
the isolation and structure-property characterization of hexaarylbenzenes with
distinctive aryl substituents at all positions for the first time. Moreover, the 
established protocol can be applied to the synthesis of tetraarylnaphthalenes and
pentaarylpyridines.

Charge transport in molecular systems, including DNA, is involved in many basic
chemical and biological processes, and its understanding is critical if they are 
to be used in electronic devices. This important phenomenon is often described as
either coherent tunnelling over a short distance or incoherent hopping over a
long distance. Here, we show evidence of an intermediate regime where coherent
and incoherent processes coexist in double-stranded DNA. We measure charge
transport in single DNA molecules bridged to two electrodes as a function of DNA 
sequence and length. In general, the resistance of DNA increases linearly with
length, as expected for incoherent hopping. However, for DNA sequences with
stacked guanine-cytosine (GC) base pairs, a periodic oscillation is superimposed 
on the linear length dependence, indicating partial coherent transport. This
result is supported by the finding of strong delocalization of the highest
occupied molecular orbitals of GC by theoretical simulation and by modelling
based on the Büttiker theory of partial coherent charge transport.

A new intersection between reaction chemistry and electronic circuitry is
emerging from the ultraminiaturization of electronic devices. Over decades
chemists have developed a nuanced understanding of stereoelectronics to establish
how the electronic properties of molecules relate to their conformation; the
recent advent of single-molecule break-junction techniques provides the means to 
alter this conformation with a level of control previously unimagined. Here we
unite these ideas by demonstrating the first single-molecule switch that operates
through a stereoelectronic effect. We demonstrate this behaviour in
permethyloligosilanes with methylthiomethyl electrode linkers. The strong σ
conjugation in the oligosilane backbone couples the stereoelectronic properties
of the sulfur-methylene σ bonds that terminate the molecule. Theoretical
calculations support the existence of three distinct dihedral conformations that 
differ drastically in their electronic character. We can shift between these
three species by simply lengthening or compressing the molecular junction, and,
in doing so, we can switch conductance digitally between two states.

To develop advanced materials for electronic devices, it is of utmost importance 
to design organic building blocks with tunable functionality and to study their
properties at the molecular level. For organic electronic and photovoltaic
applications, the ability to vary the nature of charge carriers and so create
either electron donors or acceptors is critical. Here we demonstrate that charge 
carriers in single-molecule junctions can be tuned within a family of molecules
that contain electron-deficient thiophene-1,1-dioxide (TDO) building blocks.
Oligomers of TDO were designed to increase electron affinity and maintain
delocalized frontier orbitals while significantly decreasing the transport gap.
Through thermopower measurements we show that the dominant charge carriers change
from holes to electrons as the number of TDO units is increased. This results in 
a unique system in which the charge carrier depends on the backbone length, and
provides a new means to tune p- and n-type transport in organic materials.

The replication of nucleic acids is central to the origin of life. On the early
Earth, suitable non-equilibrium boundary conditions would have been required to
surmount the effects of thermodynamic equilibrium such as the dilution and
degradation of oligonucleotides. One particularly intractable experimental
finding is that short genetic polymers replicate faster and outcompete longer
ones, which leads to ever shorter sequences and the loss of genetic information. 
Here we show that a heat flux across an open pore in submerged rock concentrates 
replicating oligonucleotides from a constant feeding flow and selects for longer 
strands. Our experiments utilize the interplay of molecular thermophoresis and
laminar convection, the latter driving strand separation and exponential
replication. Strands of 75 nucleotides survive whereas strands half as long die
out, which inverts the above dilemma of the survival of the shortest. The
combined feeding, thermal cycling and positive length selection opens the door
for a stable molecular evolution in the long-term microhabitat of heated porous
rock.

In nature, complex terpene natural products are formed by the so-called
tail-to-head terpene (THT) cyclization. The cationic reaction cascade is promoted
efficiently in complex enzyme pockets, in which cationic intermediates and
transition states are stabilized. In solution, the reaction is hard to control
and man-made catalysts able to perform selective THT cyclizations are lacking. We
herein report the first example of a successful THT cyclization inside a
supramolecular structure. The basic mode of operation in cyclase enzymes was
mimicked successfully and a catalytic non-stop THT was achieved with geranyl
acetate as the substrate. The results presented have implications for the
postulated reaction mechanism in cyclase enzymes. Evidence indicates that the
direct isomerization of a geranyl cation to the cisoid isomer, which so far was
considered unlikely, is feasible.

5-Endo-trig cyclizations are generally considered to be kinetically unfavourable,
as described by Baldwin's rules. Consequently, observation of this mode of
reaction under kinetic control is rare. This is usually ascribed to challenges in
achieving appropriate approach trajectories for orbital overlap in the transition
state. Here, we describe a highly enantio- and diastereoselective route to
complex indanes bearing all-carbon quaternary stereogenic centres via a
5-endo-trig cyclization catalysed by a chiral ammonium salt. Through computation,
the preference for the formally disfavoured 5-endo-trig Michael reaction over the
formally favoured 5-exo-trig Dieckmann reaction is shown to result from
thermodynamic contributions to the innate selectivity of the nucleophilic group, 
which outweigh the importance of the approach trajectory as embodied by Baldwin's
rules. Our experimental and theoretical findings demonstrate that geometric and
stereoelectronic constraints may not be decisive in the observed outcome of
irreversible ring-closing reactions.

Graphene oxide (GO) films are known to be highly stable in water and this
property has made their use in membrane applications in solution possible.
However, this state of affairs is somewhat counterintuitive because GO sheets
become negatively charged on hydration and the membrane should disintegrate owing
to electrostatic repulsion. We have now discovered a long-overlooked reason
behind this apparent contradiction. Our findings show that neat GO membranes do, 
indeed, readily disintegrate in water, but the films become stable if they are
crosslinked by multivalent cationic metal contaminants. Such metal contaminants
can be introduced unintentionally during the synthesis and processing of GO, most
notably on filtration with anodized aluminium oxide filter discs that corrode to 
release significant amounts of aluminium ions. This finding has wide implications
in interpreting the processing-structure-property relationships of GO and other
lamellar membranes. We also discuss strategies to avoid and mitigate metal
contamination and demonstrate that this effect can be exploited to synthesize new
membrane materials.

Life is sustained by complex systems operating far from equilibrium and
consisting of a multitude of enzymatic reaction networks. The operating
principles of biology's regulatory networks are known, but the in vitro assembly 
of out-of-equilibrium enzymatic reaction networks has proved challenging,
limiting the development of synthetic systems showing autonomous behaviour. Here,
we present a strategy for the rational design of programmable functional reaction
networks that exhibit dynamic behaviour. We demonstrate that a network built
around autoactivation and delayed negative feedback of the enzyme trypsin is
capable of producing sustained oscillating concentrations of active trypsin for
over 65 h. Other functions, such as amplification, analog-to-digital conversion
and periodic control over equilibrium systems, are obtained by linking multiple
network modules in microfluidic flow reactors. The methodology developed here
provides a general framework to construct dissipative, tunable and robust
(bio)chemical reaction networks.

Stable guest-free porous molecular crystals are uncommon. By contrast, organic
molecular crystals with guest-occupied cavities are frequently observed, but
these cavities tend to be unstable and collapse on removal of the guests-this
feature has been referred to as 'virtual porosity'. Here, we show how we have
trapped the virtual porosity in an unstable low-density organic molecular crystal
by introducing a second molecule that matches the size and shape of the unstable 
voids. We call this strategy 'retro-engineering' because it parallels organic
retrosynthetic analysis, and it allows the metastable two-dimensional hexagonal
pore structure in an organic solvate to be trapped in a binary cocrystal. Unlike 
the crystal with virtual porosity, the cocrystal material remains single

As some of the oldest organic chemical reactions known, the ionic additions of
elemental halogens such as bromine and chlorine to alkenes are prototypical
examples of stereospecific reactions, typically delivering vicinal dihalides
resulting from anti-addition. Although the invention of enantioselective variants
is an ongoing challenge, the ability to overturn the intrinsic
anti-diastereospecificity of these transformations is also a largely unsolved
problem. Here, we describe the first catalytic, syn-stereospecific dichlorination
of alkenes, employing a group transfer catalyst based on a redox-active main
group element (selenium). With diphenyl diselenide (PhSeSePh) (5 mol%) as the
pre-catalyst, benzyltriethylammonium chloride (BnEt3NCl) as the chloride source
and an N-fluoropyridinium salt as the oxidant, a wide variety of functionalized
cyclic and acyclic 1,2-disubstituted alkenes, including simple allylic alcohols, 
deliver syn-dichlorides with exquisite stereocontrol. This methodology is
expected to find applications in streamlining the synthesis of polychlorinated
natural products such as the chlorosulfolipids.

Metal hydrides are key intermediates in the catalytic reduction of protons and
CO2 as well as in the oxidation of H2. In these reactions, electrons and protons 
are transferred to or from separate acceptors or donors in bidirectional
protoncoupled electron transfer (PCET) steps. The mechanistic interpretation of
PCET reactions of metal hydrides has focused on the stepwise transfer of
electrons and protons. A concerted transfer may, however, occur with a lower
reaction barrier and therefore proceed at higher catalytic rates. Here we
investigate the feasibility of such a reaction by studying the
oxidation–deprotonation reactions of a tungsten hydride complex. The rate
dependence on the driving force for both electron transfer and proton
transfer—employing different combinations of oxidants and bases—was used to
establish experimentally the concerted, bidirectional PCET of a metal-hydride
species. Consideration of the findings presented here in future catalyst designs 
may lead to more-efficient catalysts.

Fertilization of a mammalian egg initiates a series of 'zinc sparks' that are
necessary to induce the egg-to-embryo transition. Despite the importance of these
zinc-efflux events little is known about their origin. To understand the
molecular mechanism of the zinc spark we combined four physical approaches that
resolve zinc distributions in single cells: a chemical probe for dynamic
live-cell fluorescence imaging and a combination of scanning transmission
electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence
microscopy and three-dimensional elemental tomography for high-resolution
elemental mapping. We show that the zinc spark arises from a system of thousands 
of zinc-loaded vesicles, each of which contains, on average, 10(6) zinc atoms.
These vesicles undergo dynamic movement during oocyte maturation and exocytosis
at the time of fertilization. The discovery of these vesicles and the
demonstration that zinc sparks originate from them provides a quantitative
framework for understanding how zinc fluxes regulate cellular processes.

Supramolecular interactions are fundamental to host-guest binding in many
chemical and biological processes. Direct visualization of such supramolecular
interactions within host-guest systems is extremely challenging, but crucial to
understanding their function. We report a comprehensive study that combines
neutron scattering, synchrotron X-ray and neutron diffraction, and computational 
modelling to define the detailed binding at a molecular level of acetylene,
ethylene and ethane within the porous host NOTT-300. This study reveals
simultaneous and cooperative hydrogen-bonding, π···π stacking interactions and
intermolecular dipole interactions in the binding of acetylene and ethylene to
give up to 12 individual weak supramolecular interactions aligned within the host
to form an optimal geometry for the selective binding of hydrocarbons. We also
report the cooperative binding of a mixture of acetylene and ethylene within the 
porous host, together with the corresponding breakthrough experiments and
analysis of adsorption isotherms of gas mixtures.

Porphyrins and other tetrapyrrole macrocycles possess an impressive variety of
functional properties that have been exploited in natural and artificial systems.
Different metal centres incorporated within the tetradentate ligand are key for
achieving and regulating vital processes, including reversible axial ligation of 
adducts, electron transfer, light-harvesting and catalytic transformations.
Tailored substituents optimize their performance, dictating their arrangement in 
specific environments and mediating the assembly of molecular nanoarchitectures. 
Here we review the current understanding of these species at well-defined
interfaces, disclosing exquisite insights into their structural and chemical
properties, and also discussing methods by which to manipulate their
intramolecular and organizational features. The distinct characteristics arising 
from the interfacial confinement offer intriguing prospects for molecular science
and advanced materials. We assess the role of surface interactions with respect
to electronic and physicochemical characteristics, and describe in situ
metallation pathways, molecular magnetism, rotation and switching. The
engineering of nanostructures, organized layers, interfacial hybrid and
bio-inspired systems is also addressed.

The pseudopterosins are a family of diterpene marine natural products, which, by 
virtue of their interesting anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, have
attracted the attentions of many synthetic chemists. The most efficient syntheses
reported to date are 14 and 20 steps in the longest linear sequence for chiral
pool and enantioselective approaches, respectively, and all start with precursors
that are easily mapped onto the natural product structure. Here, we describe an
unconventional approach in which a chiral cross-conjugated hydrocarbon is used as
the starting material for a series of three cycloadditions. Our approach has led 
to a significant reduction in the step count required to access these interesting
natural products (10 steps chiral pool and 11 steps enantioselective).
Furthermore it demonstrates that cross-conjugated hydrocarbons, erroneously
considered by many to be too unstable and difficult to handle, are viable
precursors for natural product synthesis.

The search for therapeutic agents that bind specifically to precursor protein
conformations and inhibit amyloid assembly is an important challenge. Identifying
such inhibitors is difficult because many protein precursors of aggregation are
partially folded or intrinsically disordered, which rules out structure-based
design. Furthermore, inhibitors can act by a variety of mechanisms, including
specific or nonspecific binding, as well as colloidal inhibition. Here we report 
a high-throughput method based on ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry
(IMS-MS) that is capable of rapidly detecting small molecules that bind to
amyloid precursors, identifying the interacting protein species and defining the 
mode of inhibition. Using this method we have classified a variety of small
molecules that are potential inhibitors of human islet amyloid polypeptide
(hIAPP) aggregation or amyloid-beta 1-40 aggregation as specific, nonspecific,
colloidal or non-interacting. We also demonstrate the ability of IMS-MS to screen
for inhibitory small molecules in a 96-well plate format and use this to discover
a new inhibitor of hIAPP amyloid assembly.

The exceptional mechanical flexibility observed with certain organic crystals
defies the common perception of single crystals as brittle objects. Here, we
describe the morphostructural consequences of plastic deformation in crystals of 
hexachlorobenzene that can be bent mechanically at multiple locations to 360°
with retention of macroscopic integrity. This extraordinary plasticity proceeds
by segregation of the bent section into flexible layers that slide on top of each
other, thereby generating domains with slightly different lattice orientations.
Microscopic, spectroscopic and diffraction analyses of the bent crystal showed
that the preservation of crystal integrity when stress is applied on the (001)
face requires sliding of layers by breaking and re-formation of halogen-halogen
interactions. Application of stress on the (100) face, in the direction where
π···π interactions dominate the packing, leads to immediate crystal
disintegration. Within a broader perspective, this study highlights the yet
unrecognized extraordinary malleability of molecular crystals with strongly
anisotropic supramolecular interactions.

Enzymes are typically highly stereoselective catalysts that enforce a reactive
conformation on their native substrates. We report here a rare example in which
the substrate controls the stereoselectivity of an enzyme-catalysed Michael-type 
addition during the biosynthesis of lanthipeptides. These natural products
contain thioether crosslinks formed by a cysteine attack on dehydrated Ser and
Thr residues. We demonstrate that several lanthionine synthetases catalyse highly
selective anti-additions in which the substrate (and not the enzyme) determines
whether the addition occurs from the re or si face. A single point mutation in
the peptide substrate completely inverted the stereochemical outcome of the
enzymatic modification. Quantum mechanical calculations reproduced the
experimentally observed selectivity and suggest that conformational restraints
imposed by the amino-acid sequence on the transition states determine the face
selectivity of the Michael-type cyclization.

Given their high theoretical specific energy, lithium-oxygen batteries have
received enormous attention as possible alternatives to current state-of-the-art 
rechargeable Li-ion batteries. However, the maximum discharge capacity in
non-aqueous lithium-oxygen batteries is limited to a small fraction of its
theoretical value due to the build-up of insulating lithium peroxide (Li₂O₂), the
battery's primary discharge product. The discharge capacity can be increased if
Li₂O₂ forms as large toroidal particles rather than as a thin conformal layer.
Here, we show that trace amounts of electrolyte additives, such as H₂O, enhance
the formation of Li₂O₂ toroids and result in significant improvements in
capacity. Our experimental observations and a growth model show that the
solvating properties of the additives prompt a solution-based mechanism that is
responsible for the growth of Li₂O₂ toroids. We present a general formalism
describing an additive's tendency to trigger the solution process, providing a
rational design route for electrolytes that afford larger lithium-oxygen battery 
capacities.

Chemical functionalization of low-dimensional materials such as nanotubes,
nanowires and graphene leads to profound changes in their properties and is
essential for solubilizing them in common solvents. Covalent attachment of
functional groups is generally achieved at defect sites, which facilitate
electron transfer. Here, we describe a simple and general method for covalent
functionalization of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide nanosheets
(MoS₂, WS₂ and MoSe₂), which does not rely on defect engineering. The
functionalization reaction is instead facilitated by electron transfer between
the electron-rich metallic 1T phase and an organohalide reactant, resulting in
functional groups that are covalently attached to the chalcogen atoms of the
transition metal dichalcogenide. The attachment of functional groups leads to
dramatic changes in the optoelectronic properties of the material. For example,
we show that it renders the metallic 1T phase semiconducting, and gives it strong
and tunable photoluminescence and gate modulation in field-effect transistors.

The development of selective reactions that utilize easily available and abundant
precursors for the efficient synthesis of amines is a long-standing goal of
chemical research. Despite the centrality of amines in a number of important
research areas, including medicinal chemistry, total synthesis and materials
science, a general, selective and step-efficient synthesis of amines is still
needed. Here, we describe a set of mild catalytic conditions utilizing a single
copper-based catalyst that enables the direct preparation of three distinct and
important amine classes (enamines, α-chiral branched alkylamines and linear
alkylamines) from readily available alkyne starting materials with high levels of
chemo-, regio- and stereoselectivity. This methodology was applied to the
asymmetric synthesis of rivastigmine and the formal synthesis of several other
pharmaceutical agents, including duloxetine, atomoxetine, fluoxetine and
tolterodine.

Peptides that self-assemble into nanostructures are of tremendous interest for
biological, medical, photonic and nanotechnological applications. The enormous
sequence space that is available from 20 amino acids probably harbours many
interesting candidates, but it is currently not possible to predict
supramolecular behaviour from sequence alone. Here, we demonstrate computational 
tools to screen for the aqueous self-assembly propensity in all of the 8,000
possible tripeptides and evaluate these by comparison with known examples. We
applied filters to select for candidates that simultaneously optimize the
apparently contradicting requirements of aggregation propensity and
hydrophilicity, which resulted in a set of design rules for self-assembling
sequences. A number of peptides were subsequently synthesized and characterized, 
including the first reported tripeptides that are able to form a hydrogel at
neutral pH. These tools, which enable the peptide sequence space to be searched
for supramolecular properties, enable minimalistic peptide nanotechnology to
deliver on its promise.

Ever-growing energy needs and depleting fossil-fuel resources demand the pursuit 
of sustainable energy alternatives, including both renewable energy sources and
sustainable storage technologies. It is therefore essential to incorporate
material abundance, eco-efficient synthetic processes and life-cycle analysis
into the design of new electrochemical storage systems. At present, a few
existing technologies address these issues, but in each case, fundamental and
technological hurdles remain to be overcome. Here we provide an overview of the
current state of energy storage from a sustainability perspective. We introduce
the notion of sustainability through discussion of the energy and environmental
costs of state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries, considering elemental abundance,
toxicity, synthetic methods and scalability. With the same themes in mind, we
also highlight current and future electrochemical storage systems beyond
lithium-ion batteries. The complexity and importance of recycling battery
materials is also discussed.

Developing earth-abundant, non-platinum metal catalysts for high-value chemical
transformations is a critical challenge to contemporary chemical synthesis.
Dearomatization of pyridine derivatives is an important transformation to access 
a wide range of valuable nitrogenous natural products, pharmaceuticals and
materials. Here, we report an efficient 1,2-regioselective
organolanthanide-catalysed pyridine dearomatization process using pinacolborane, 
which is compatible with a broad range of pyridines and functional groups and
employs equimolar reagent stoichiometry. Regarding the mechanism, derivation of
the rate law from NMR spectroscopic and kinetic measurements suggests first order
in catalyst concentration, fractional order in pyridine concentration and inverse
first order in pinacolborane concentration, with C=N insertion into the La-H bond
as turnover-determining. An energetic span analysis affords a more detailed
understanding of experimental activity trends and the unusual kinetic behaviour, 
and proposes the catalyst 'resting' state and potential deactivation pathways.

When lithium-oxygen batteries discharge, O2 is reduced at the cathode to form
solid Li2O2. Understanding the fundamental mechanism of O2 reduction in aprotic
solvents is therefore essential to realizing their technological potential. Two
different models have been proposed for Li2O2 formation, involving either
solution or electrode surface routes. Here, we describe a single unified
mechanism, which, unlike previous models, can explain O2 reduction across the
whole range of solvents and for which the two previous models are limiting cases.
We observe that the solvent influences O2 reduction through its effect on the
solubility of LiO2, or, more precisely, the free energy of the reaction
LiO2(*) ⇌ Li(sol)(+) + O2(-)(sol) + ion pairs + higher aggregates (clusters). The
unified mechanism shows that low-donor-number solvents are likely to lead to
premature cell death, and that the future direction of research for
lithium-oxygen batteries should focus on the search for new, stable,
high-donor-number electrolytes, because they can support higher capacities and
can better sustain discharge.

The use of β-lactam antibiotics is compromised by resistance, which is provided
by β-lactamases belonging to both metallo (MBL)- and serine (SBL)-β-lactamase
subfamilies. The rhodanines are one of very few compound classes that inhibit
penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), SBLs and, as recently reported, MBLs. Here,
we describe crystallographic analyses of the mechanism of inhibition of the
clinically relevant VIM-2 MBL by a rhodanine, which reveal that the rhodanine
ring undergoes hydrolysis to give a thioenolate. The thioenolate is found to bind
via di-zinc chelation, mimicking the binding of intermediates in β-lactam
hydrolysis. Crystallization of VIM-2 in the presence of the intact rhodanine led 
to observation of a ternary complex of MBL, a thioenolate fragment and rhodanine.
The crystallographic observations are supported by kinetic and biophysical
studies, including (19)F NMR analyses, which reveal the rhodanine-derived
thioenolate to be a potent broad-spectrum MBL inhibitor and a lead structure for 
the development of new types of clinically useful MBL inhibitors.

Many molecular machines with controllable molecular-scale motors have been
developed. However, transmitting molecular movement to the macroscopic scale
remains a formidable challenge. Here we report a single crystal of a Ni complex
whose shape changes abruptly and reversibly in response to thermal changes at
around room temperature. Variable-temperature single-crystal X-ray diffraction
studies show that the crystalline shape change is induced by an unusual 90°
rotation of uniaxially aligned oxalate molecules. The oxalate dianions behave as 
molecular-scale rotors, with their movement propagated through the entire
crystalline material via intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Consequently, the
subnanometre-scale changes in the oxalate molecules are instantly amplified to a 
micrometre-scale contraction or expansion of the crystal, accompanied by a
thermal hysteresis loop. The shape change in the crystal was clearly detected
under an optical microscope. The large directional deformation and prompt
response suggest a role for this material in microscale or nanoscale thermal
actuators.

Natural products have long been a source of useful biological activity for the
development of new drugs. Their macromolecular targets are, however, largely
unknown, which hampers rational drug design and optimization. Here we present the
development and experimental validation of a computational method for the
discovery of such targets. The technique does not require three-dimensional
target models and may be applied to structurally complex natural products. The
algorithm dissects the natural products into fragments and infers potential
pharmacological targets by comparing the fragments to synthetic reference drugs
with known targets. We demonstrate that this approach results in confident
predictions. In a prospective validation, we show that fragments of the potent
antitumour agent archazolid A, a macrolide from the myxobacterium Archangium
gephyra, contain relevant information regarding its polypharmacology. Biochemical
and biophysical evaluation confirmed the predictions. The results obtained
corroborate the practical applicability of the computational approach to natural 
product 'de-orphaning'.

Natural proteins can be versatile building blocks for multimeric, self-assembling
structures. Yet, creating protein-based assemblies with specific geometries and
chemical properties remains challenging. Highly porous materials represent
particularly interesting targets for designed assembly. Here, we utilize a
strategy of fusing two natural protein oligomers using a continuous alpha-helical
linker to design a novel protein that self assembles into a 750 kDa, 225 Å
diameter, cube-shaped cage with large openings into a 130 Å diameter inner
cavity. A crystal structure of the cage showed atomic-level agreement with the
designed model, while electron microscopy, native mass spectrometry and small
angle X-ray scattering revealed alternative assembly forms in solution. These
studies show that accurate design of large porous assemblies with specific shapes
is feasible, while further specificity improvements will probably require
limiting flexibility to select against alternative forms. These results provide a
foundation for the design of advanced materials with applications in
bionanotechnology, nanomedicine and material sciences.

The stereocontrolled introduction of vicinal heteroatomic substituents into
organic molecules is one of the most powerful ways of adding value and function. 
Although many methods exist for the introduction of oxygen- and
nitrogen-containing substituents, the number of stereocontrolled methods for the 
introduction of sulfur-containing substituents pales by comparison. Previous
reports from our laboratories have described sulfenofunctionalizations of alkenes
that construct carbon-sulfur bonds vicinal to carbon-oxygen, carbon-nitrogen or
carbon-carbon bonds with high levels of diastereospecificity and
enantioselectivity. This process is enabled by the concept of Lewis-base
activation of Lewis acids, which provides activation of Group 16 electrophiles.
To provide a foundation for the expansion of substrate scope and improved
selectivities, we have undertaken a comprehensive study of the catalytically
active species. Insights gleaned from kinetic, crystallographic and computational
methods have led to the introduction of a new family of sulfenylating agents that
provide significantly enhanced selectivities.

5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC) is an oxidation product of 5-methylcytosine which
is present in the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of most mammalian cells. Reduction 
of hmC levels in DNA is a hallmark of cancers. Elucidating the dynamics of this
oxidation reaction and the lifetime of hmC in DNA is fundamental to understanding
hmC function. Using stable isotope labelling of cytosine derivatives in the DNA
of mammalian cells and ultrasensitive tandem liquid-chromatography mass
spectrometry, we show that the majority of hmC is a stable modification, as
opposed to a transient intermediate. In contrast with DNA methylation, which
occurs immediately during replication, hmC forms slowly during the first 30 hours
following DNA synthesis. Isotopic labelling of DNA in mouse tissues confirmed the
stability of hmC in vivo and demonstrated a relationship between global levels of
hmC and cell proliferation. These insights have important implications for
understanding the states of chemically modified DNA bases in health and disease.

Chemical understanding is driven by the experimental discovery of new compounds
and reactivity, and is supported by theory and computation that provide detailed 
physical insight. Although theoretical and computational studies have generally
focused on specific processes or mechanistic hypotheses, recent methodological
and computational advances harken the advent of their principal role in
discovery. Here we report the development and application of the ab initio
nanoreactor--a highly accelerated first-principles molecular dynamics simulation 
of chemical reactions that discovers new molecules and mechanisms without
preordained reaction coordinates or elementary steps. Using the nanoreactor, we
show new pathways for glycine synthesis from primitive compounds proposed to
exist on the early Earth, which provide new insight into the classic Urey-Miller 
experiment. These results highlight the emergence of theoretical and
computational chemistry as a tool for discovery, in addition to its traditional
role of interpreting experimental findings.

Halogen bonding (XB), the attractive interaction between an electron-deficient
halogen atom and a Lewis base, has undergone a dramatic development as an
intermolecular force analogous to hydrogen bonding (HB). However, its utilization
in the solution phase remains underdeveloped. Furthermore, the design of
receptors capable of strong and selective recognition of anions in water remains 
a significant challenge. Here we demonstrate the superiority of halogen bonding
over hydrogen bonding for strong anion binding in water, to the extent that
halide recognition by a simple acyclic mono-charged receptor is achievable.
Quantification of iodide binding by rotaxane hosts reveals the strong binding by 
the XB-rotaxane is driven exclusively by favourable enthalpic contributions
arising from the halogen-bonding interactions, whereas weaker association with
the HB-rotaxanes is entropically driven. These observations demonstrate the
unique nature of halogen bonding in water as a strong alternative interaction to 
the ubiquitous hydrogen bonding in molecular recognition and assembly.

Dynamic covalent chemistry relies on the formation of reversible covalent bonds
under thermodynamic control to generate dynamic combinatorial libraries. It
provides access to numerous types of complex functional architectures, and
thereby targets several technologically relevant applications, such as in drug
discovery, (bio)sensing and dynamic materials. In liquid media it was proved that
by taking advantage of the reversible nature of the bond formation it is possible
to combine the error-correction capacity of supramolecular chemistry with the
robustness of covalent bonding to generate adaptive systems. Here we show that
double imine formation between 4-(hexadecyloxy)benzaldehyde and different
α,ω-diamines as well as reversible bistransimination reactions can be achieved at
the solid/liquid interface, as monitored on the submolecular scale by in situ
scanning tunnelling microscopy imaging. Our modular approach enables the
structurally controlled reversible incorporation of various molecular components 
to form sophisticated covalent architectures, which opens up perspectives towards
responsive multicomponent two-dimensional materials and devices.

The disulfide bonds that form between two cysteine residues are important in
defining and rigidifying the structures of proteins and peptides. In polypeptides
containing multiple cysteine residues, disulfide isomerization can lead to
multiple products with different biological activities. Here, we describe the
development of a dithiol amino acid (Dtaa) that can form two disulfide bridges at
a single amino acid site. Application of Dtaas to a serine protease inhibitor and
a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor inhibitor that contain disulfide constraints
enhanced their inhibitory activities 40- and 7.6-fold, respectively. X-ray
crystallographic and NMR structure analysis show that the peptide ligands
containing Dtaas have retained their native tertiary structures. We furthermore
show that replacement of two cysteines by Dtaas can avoid the formation of
disulfide bond isomers. With these properties, Dtaas are likely to have broad
application in the rational design or directed evolution of peptides and proteins
with high activity and stability.

Oligonucleotide-based receptors or aptamers can interact with small molecules,
but the ability to achieve high-affinity and specificity of these interactions
depends strongly on functional groups or epitopes displayed by the binding
targets. Some classes of targets are particularly challenging: for example,
monosaccharides have scarce functionalities and no aptamers have been reported to
recognize, let alone distinguish from each other, glucose and other hexoses. Here
we report aptamers that differentiate low-epitope targets such as glucose,
fructose or galactose by forming ternary complexes with high-epitope organic
receptors for monosaccharides. In a follow-up example, we expand this method to
isolate high-affinity oligonucleotides against aromatic amino acids complexed in 
situ with a nonspecific organometallic receptor. The method is general and
enables broad clinical use of aptamers for the detection of small molecules in
mix-and-measure assays, as demonstrated by monitoring postprandial waves of
phenylalanine in human subjects.

The ability to assemble functional materials with precise spatial arrangements is
important for applications ranging from protein crystallography to photovoltaics.
Here, we describe a general framework for constructing two-dimensional crystals
with prescribed depths and sophisticated three-dimensional features. The crystals
are self-assembled from single-stranded DNA components called DNA bricks. We
demonstrate the experimental construction of DNA brick crystals that can grow to 
micrometre size in their lateral dimensions with precisely controlled depths up
to 80 nm. They can be designed to pack DNA helices at angles parallel or
perpendicular to the plane of the crystal and to display user-specified
sophisticated three-dimensional nanoscale features, such as continuous or
discontinuous cavities and channels.

2-Aminopurine (2 AP) is a fluorescent isomer of adenine and has a fluorescence
lifetime of ~11 ns in water. It is widely used in biochemical settings as a
site-specific fluorescent probe of DNA and RNA structure and base-flipping and
-folding. These assays assume that 2 AP is intrinsically strongly fluorescent.
Here, we show this not to be the case, observing that gas-phase, jet-cooled
2-aminopurine and 9-methyl-2-aminopurine have very short fluorescence lifetimes
(156 ps and 210 ps, respectively); they are, to all intents and purposes,
non-fluorescent. We find that the lifetime of 2-aminopurine increases
dramatically when it is part of a hydrate cluster, 2 AP · (H2O)n, where n = 1-3. 
Not only does it depend on the presence of water molecules, it also depends on
the specific hydrogen-bonding site to which they attach and on the number of H2O 
molecules at that site. We selectively microhydrate 2-aminopurine at its
sugar-edge, cis-amino or trans-amino sites and see that its fluorescence lifetime
increases by 4, 50 and 95 times (to 14.5 ns), respectively.

Perfluorarylborane Lewis acids catalyse the addition of silicon-hydrogen bonds
across C=C, C=N and C=O double bonds. This 'metal-free' hydrosilylation has been 
proposed to occur via borane activation of the silane Si-H bond, rather than
through classical Lewis acid/base adducts with the substrate. However, the key
borane/silane adduct had not been observed experimentally. Here it is shown that 
the strongly Lewis acidic, antiaromatic
1,2,3-tris(pentafluorophenyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrafluoro-1-boraindene forms an
observable, isolable adduct with triethylsilane. The equilibrium for adduct
formation was studied quantitatively through variable-temperature NMR
spectroscopic investigations. The interaction of the silane with the borane
occurs through the Si-H bond, as evidenced by trends in the Si-H coupling
constant and the infrared stretching frequency of the Si-H bond, as well as by
X-ray crystallography and theoretical calculations. The adduct's reactivity with 
nucleophiles demonstrates conclusively the role of this species in metal-free
'frustrated-Lewis-pair' hydrosilylation reactions.

We describe the synthesis of a [2]catenane that consists of two triply entwined
114-membered rings, a molecular link. The woven scaffold is a hexameric circular 
helicate generated by the assembly of six tris(bipyridine) ligands with six
iron(II) cations, with the size of the helicate promoted by the use of sulfate
counterions. The structure of the ligand extension directs subsequent covalent
capture of the catenane by ring-closing olefin metathesis. Confirmation of the
Star of David topology (two rings, six crossings) is provided by NMR
spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and X-ray crystallography. Extraction of the
iron(II) ions with tetrasodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate affords the wholly
organic molecular link. The self-assembly of interwoven circular frameworks of
controlled size, and their subsequent closure by multiple directed covalent
bond-forming reactions, provides a powerful strategy for the synthesis of
molecular topologies of ever-increasing complexity.

According to our present knowledge, the spontaneous resolution of racemic
mixtures of chiral molecules or chiral conformers of achiral molecules into
macroscopic chiral superstructures requires the confinement of these molecules in
a crystal lattice, on surfaces or in other well-ordered assemblies. Herein we
provide the first experimental evidence that mirror-symmetry breaking can also
take place at a liquid-liquid phase transition in isotropic liquids of achiral
molecules, even at relatively high temperatures around 200 °C. It is proposed
that cooperative segregation of enantiomorphic molecular conformations gives rise
to a conglomerate of two chiral and immiscible liquids. In these liquid
conglomerates a strong chiral amplification was observed, which led to degeneracy
from a stochastic distribution and eventually provided uniform chirality. We
anticipate that this work will contribute to the understanding of symmetry
breaking in soft matter and provide a new tool for the identification of
chirality traces, and possibly affect the discussion of the emergence of
chirality in prebiotic systems.

Integration into a soft material of all the molecular components necessary to
generate storable fuels is an interesting target in supramolecular chemistry. The
concept is inspired by the internal structure of photosynthetic organelles, such 
as plant chloroplasts, which colocalize molecules involved in light absorption,
charge transport and catalysis to create chemical bonds using light energy. We
report here on the light-driven production of hydrogen inside a hydrogel scaffold
built by the supramolecular self-assembly of a perylene monoimide amphiphile. The
charged ribbons formed can electrostatically attract a nickel-based catalyst, and
electrolyte screening promotes gelation. We found the emergent phenomenon that
screening by the catalyst or the electrolytes led to two-dimensional
crystallization of the chromophore assemblies and enhanced the electronic
coupling among the molecules. Photocatalytic production of hydrogen is observed
in the three-dimensional environment of the hydrogel scaffold and the material is
easily placed on surfaces or in the pores of solid supports.

Graphite intercalation compounds are formed by inserting guest molecules or ions 
between sp(2)-bonded carbon layers. These compounds are interesting as synthetic 
metals and as precursors to graphene. For many decades it has been thought that
graphite intercalation must involve host-guest charge transfer, resulting in
partial oxidation, reduction or covalent modification of the graphene sheets.
Here, we revisit this concept and show that graphite can be reversibly
intercalated by non-oxidizing Brønsted acids (phosphoric, sulfuric,
dichloroacetic and alkylsulfonic acids). The products are mixtures of graphite
and first-stage intercalation compounds. X-ray photoelectron and vibrational
spectra indicate that the graphene layers are not oxidized or reduced in the
intercalation process. These observations are supported by density functional
theory calculations, which indicate a dipolar interaction between the guest
molecules and the polarizable graphene sheets. The intercalated graphites readily
exfoliate in dimethylformamide to give suspensions of crystalline single- and
few-layer graphene sheets.

Redox-inactive metal ions that function as Lewis acids play pivotal roles in
modulating the reactivity of oxygen-containing metal complexes and
metalloenzymes, such as the oxygen-evolving complex in photosystem II and its
small-molecule mimics. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of
non-haem iron(III)-peroxo complexes that bind redox-inactive metal ions,
(TMC)Fe(III)-(μ,η(2):η(2)-O2)-M(n+) (M(n+) = Sr(2+), Ca(2+), Zn(2+), Lu(3+),
Y(3+) and Sc(3+); TMC, 1,4,8,11-tetramethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane).
We demonstrate that the Ca(2+) and Sr(2+) complexes showed similar
electrochemical properties and reactivities in one-electron oxidation or
reduction reactions. However, the properties and reactivities of complexes formed
with stronger Lewis acidities were found to be markedly different. Complexes that
contain Ca(2+) or Sr(2+) ions were oxidized by an electron acceptor to release
O2, whereas the release of O2 did not occur for complexes that bind stronger
Lewis acids. We discuss these results in the light of the functional role of the 
Ca(2+) ion in the oxidation of water to dioxygen by the oxygen-evolving complex.

Iron-sulfur clusters are a universal biological motif. They carry out electron
transfer, redox chemistry and even oxygen sensing, in diverse processes including
nitrogen fixation, respiration and photosynthesis. Their low-lying electronic
states are key to their remarkable reactivity, but they cannot be directly
observed. Here, we present the first ever quantum calculation of the electronic
levels of [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters free from any model assumptions. Our
results highlight the limitations of long-standing models of their electronic
structure. In particular, we demonstrate that the widely used Heisenberg double
exchange model underestimates the number of states by one to two orders of
magnitude, which can conclusively be traced to the absence of Fe dd excitations, 
thought to be important in these clusters. Furthermore, the electronic energy
levels of even the same spin are dense on the scale of vibrational fluctuations
and this provides a natural explanation for the ubiquity of these clusters in
catalysis in nature.

Classically, late transition-metal organometallic compounds promote multielectron
processes solely through the change in oxidation state of the metal centre. In
contrast, uranium typically undergoes single-electron chemistry. However, using
redox-active ligands can engage multielectron reactivity at this metal in analogy
to transition metals. Here we show that a redox-flexible pyridine(diimine) ligand
can stabilize a series of highly reduced uranium coordination complexes by
storing one, two or three electrons in the ligand. These species reduce
organoazides easily to form uranium-nitrogen multiple bonds with the release of
dinitrogen. The extent of ligand reduction dictates the formation of uranium
mono-, bis- and tris(imido) products. Spectroscopic and structural
characterization of these compounds supports the idea that electrons are stored
in the ligand framework and used in subsequent reactivity. Computational analyses
of the uranium imido products probed their molecular and electronic structures,
which facilitated a comparison between the bonding in the tris(imido) structure
and its tris(oxo) analogue.

Molecular adsorption is a fundamental phenomenon in porous materials and is
usually characterized by the efficiency and selectivity of molecular separations 
and reactions. However, for functional porous materials, analysis of the dynamic 
behaviour of molecular adsorbents is a major challenge. Here, we use in situ
single-crystal X-ray diffraction to analyse multi-step molecular adsorption in a 
crystalline nanochannel of a metal-macrocycle framework. The pore surface of the 
metal-macrocycle framework crystal contains five different enantiomerically
paired binding pockets, to which the adsorption of a
(1R)-1-(3-chlorophenyl)ethanol solution was monitored with time. The resulting
X-ray snapshot analyses suggest that the guest adsorption process takes a
two-step pathway before equilibrium, in which the guest molecule is temporarily
trapped by a neighbouring binding site. This demonstrates the potential for using
X-ray analyses to visualize a transient state during a non-covalent self-assembly
process.

Post-synthetic metallation is employed strategically to imbue metal-organic
frameworks (MOFs) with enhanced performance characteristics. However, obtaining
precise structural information for metal-centred reactions that take place within
the pores of these materials has remained an elusive goal, because of issues with
high symmetry in certain MOFs, lower initial crystallinity for some chemically
robust MOFs, and the reduction in crystallinity that can result from carrying out
post-synthetic reactions on parent crystals. Here, we report a new
three-dimensional MOF possessing pore cavities that are lined with vacant
di-pyrazole groups poised for post-synthetic metallation. These metallations
occur quantitatively without appreciable loss of crystallinity, thereby enabling 
examination of the products by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. To illustrate
the potential of this platform to garner fundamental insight into metal-catalysed
reactions in porous solids we use single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies to
structurally elucidate the reaction products of consecutive oxidative addition
and methyl migration steps that occur within the pores of the Rh-metallated MOF, 
1·[Rh(CO)2][Rh(CO)2Cl2].

Electron transfer (ET) is a fundamental process in a wide range of biological
systems, photovoltaics and molecular electronics. Therefore to understand the
relationship between molecular structure and ET properties is of prime
importance. For this purpose, photoinduced ET has been studied extensively using 
donor-bridge-acceptor molecules, in which π-conjugated molecular wires are
employed as bridges. Here, we demonstrate that carbon-bridged
oligo-p-phenylenevinylene (COPV), which is both rigid and flat, shows an 840-fold
increase in the ET rate compared with the equivalent flexible molecular bridges. 
A 120-fold rate enhancement is explained in terms of enhanced electronic coupling
between the electron donor and the electron acceptor because of effective
conjugation through the COPVs. The remainder of the rate enhancement is explained
by inelastic electron tunnelling through COPV caused by electron-vibration
coupling, unprecedented for organic molecular wires in solution at room
temperature. This type of nonlinear effect demonstrates the versatility and
potential practical utility of COPVs in molecular device applications.

Recent advances in the self-assembly of block copolymers have enabled the precise
fabrication of hierarchical nanostructures using low-cost solution-phase
protocols. However, the preparation of well-defined and complex planar
nanostructures in which the size is controlled in two dimensions (2D) has
remained a challenge. Using a series of platelet-forming block copolymers, we
have demonstrated through quantitative experiments that the living
crystallization-driven self-assembly (CDSA) approach can be extended to growth in
2D. We used 2D CDSA to prepare uniform lenticular platelet micelles of controlled
size and to construct precisely concentric lenticular micelles composed of
spatially distinct functional regions, as well as complex structures analogous to
nanoscale single- and double-headed arrows and spears. These methods represent a 
route to hierarchical nanostructures that can be tailored in 2D, with potential
applications as diverse as liquid crystals, diagnostic technology and composite
reinforcement.

Anion transporters based on small molecules have received attention as
therapeutic agents because of their potential to disrupt cellular ion
homeostasis. However, a direct correlation between a change in cellular chloride 
anion concentration and cytotoxicity has not been established for synthetic ion
carriers. Here we show that two pyridine diamide-strapped calix[4]pyrroles induce
coupled chloride anion and sodium cation transport in both liposomal models and
cells, and promote cell death by increasing intracellular chloride and sodium ion
concentrations. Removing either ion from the extracellular media or blocking
natural sodium channels with amiloride prevents this effect. Cell experiments
show that the ion transporters induce the sodium chloride influx, which leads to 
an increased concentration of reactive oxygen species, release of cytochrome c
from the mitochondria and apoptosis via caspase activation. However, they do not 
activate the caspase-independent apoptotic pathway associated with the
apoptosis-inducing factor. Ion transporters, therefore, represent an attractive
approach for regulating cellular processes that are normally controlled tightly
by homeostasis.

Microbial fermentation can rapidly provide potent compounds that can be easily
screened for biological activity, and the active components can be isolated. Its 
success in drug discovery has inspired extensive efforts to modulate and control 
the products. In this Article, we document a 'synthetic fermentation' of
bioactive, unnatural peptides 'grown' from small building blocks in water using
amide-forming ligations. No organisms, enzymes or reagents are needed. The
sequences, structures and compositions of the products can be modulated by
adjusting the building blocks and conditions. No specialized knowledge of organic
chemistry or handling of toxic material is required to produce complex organic
molecules. The 'fermentations' can be conducted in arrays and screened for
biological activity without isolation or workup. As a proof-of-concept, about
6,000 unnatural peptides were produced from just 23 building blocks, from which a
hepatitis C virus NS3/4A protease inhibitor with a half-maximum inhibitory
concentration of 1.0 μM was identified and characterized.

The structures and biological activities of natural products have often provided 
inspiration in drug discovery. The functional benefits of natural products to the
host organism steers the evolution of their biosynthetic pathways. Here, we
describe a discovery approach--which we term activity-directed synthesis--in
which reactions with alternative outcomes are steered towards functional
products. Arrays of catalysed reactions of α-diazo amides, whose outcome was
critically dependent on the specific conditions used, were performed. The
products were assayed at increasingly low concentration, with the results
informing the design of a subsequent reaction array. Finally, promising reactions
were scaled up and, after purification, submicromolar ligands based on two
scaffolds with no previous annotated activity against the androgen receptor were 
discovered. The approach enables the discovery, in tandem, of both bioactive
small molecules and associated synthetic routes, analogous to the evolution of
biosynthetic pathways to yield natural products.

New organic reactivity has often been discovered by happenstance. Several recent 
research efforts have attempted to leverage this to discover new reactions. In
this Review, we attempt to unify reported approaches to reaction discovery on the
basis of the practical and strategic principles applied. We concentrate on
approaches to reaction discovery as opposed to reaction development, though
conceptually groundbreaking approaches to identifying efficient catalyst systems 
are also considered. Finally, we provide a critical overview of the utility and
application of the reported methods from the perspective of a synthetic chemist, 
and consider the future of high-throughput screening in reaction discovery.

Pressure drastically alters the chemical and physical properties of materials and
allows structural phase transitions and chemical reactions to occur that defy
much of our understanding gained under ambient conditions. Particularly exciting 
is the high-pressure chemistry of xenon, which is known to react with hydrogen
and ice at high pressures and form stable compounds. Here, we show that
Ag16Al16Si24O8·16H2O (Ag-natrolite) irreversibly inserts xenon into its
micropores at 1.7 GPa and 250 °C, while Ag(+) is reduced to metallic Ag and
possibly oxidized to Ag(2+). In contrast to krypton, xenon is retained within the
pores of this zeolite after pressure release and requires heat to desorb. This
irreversible insertion and trapping of xenon in Ag-natrolite under moderate
conditions sheds new light on chemical reactions that could account for the xenon
deficiency relative to argon observed in terrestrial and Martian atmospheres.

The electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction is the limiting half-reaction for
low-temperature hydrogen fuel cells, and currently costly Pt-based
electrocatalysts are used to generate adequate rates. Although most other metals 
are not stable in typical acid-mediated cells, alkaline environments permit the
use of less costly electrodes, such as silver. Unfortunately, monometallic silver
is not sufficiently active for economical fuel cells. Herein we demonstrate the
design of low-cost Ag-Co surface alloy nanoparticle electrocatalysts for oxygen
reduction. Their performance relative to that of Pt is potential dependent, but
reaches over half the area-specific activity of Pt nanoparticle catalysts and is 
more than a fivefold improvement over pure silver nanoparticles at typical
operating potentials. The Ag-Co electrocatalyst was initially identified with
quantum chemical calculations and then synthesized using a novel technique that
generates a surface alloy, despite bulk immiscibility of the constituent
materials. Characterization studies support the hypothesis that the activity
improvement comes from a ligand effect, in which cobalt atoms perturb surface
silver sites.

Hydrogenases are nature's efficient catalysts for both the generation of energy
via oxidation of molecular hydrogen and the production of hydrogen via the
reduction of protons. However, their O2 sensitivity and deactivation at high
potential limit their applications in practical devices, such as fuel cells.
Here, we show that the integration of an O2-sensitive hydrogenase into a
specifically designed viologen-based redox polymer protects the enzyme from O2
damage and high-potential deactivation. Electron transfer between the
polymer-bound viologen moieties controls the potential applied to the active site
of the hydrogenase and thus insulates the enzyme from excessive oxidative stress.
Under catalytic turnover, electrons provided from the hydrogen oxidation reaction
induce viologen-catalysed O2 reduction at the polymer surface, thus providing
self-activated protection from O2. The advantages of this tandem protection are
demonstrated using a single-compartment biofuel cell based on an O2-sensitive
hydrogenase and H2/O2 mixed feed under anode-limiting conditions.

With its focus on synthetic reactions that are highly specific and reliable,
'click' chemistry has become a valuable tool for many scientific research areas
and applications. Combining the modular, covalently bonded nature of
click-chemistry linkages with an ability to reverse these linkages and reuse the 
constituent reactants in another click reaction, however, is a feature that is
not found in most click reactions. Here we show that triazolinedione compounds
can be used in click-chemistry applications. We present examples of simple and
ultrafast macromolecular functionalization, polymer-polymer linking and polymer
crosslinking under ambient conditions without the need for a catalyst. Moreover, 
when triazolinediones are combined with indole reaction partners, the reverse
reaction can also be induced at elevated temperatures, and the triazolinedione
reacted with a different reaction partner, reversibly or irreversibly dependent
on its exact nature. We have used this 'transclick' reaction to introduce
thermoreversible links into polyurethane and polymethacrylate materials, which
allows dynamic polymer-network healing, reshaping and recycling.

In planning organic syntheses, disconnections are most often made adjacent to
functional groups, which assist in C-C bond formation. For molecules devoid of
obvious functional groups this approach presents a problem, and so
functionalities must be installed temporarily and then removed. Here we present a
traceless strategy for organic synthesis that uses a boronic ester as such a
group in a one-pot lithiation-borylation-protodeboronation sequence. To realize
this strategy, we developed a methodology for the protodeboronation of alkyl
pinacol boronic esters that involves the formation of a boronate complex with a
nucleophile followed by oxidation with Mn(OAc)3 in the presence of the
hydrogen-atom donor 4-tert-butylcatechol. Iterative
lithiation-borylation-protodeboronation allows the coupling of smaller fragments 
to build-up long alkyl chains. We employed this strategy in the synthesis of
hydroxyphthioceranic acid, a key component of the cell-wall lipid of the virulent
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, in just 14 steps (longest linear sequence) with full 
stereocontrol.

DNA-protein conjugates are important in bioanalytical chemistry, molecular
diagnostics and bionanotechnology, as the DNA provides a unique handle to
identify, functionalize or otherwise manipulate proteins. To maintain protein
activity, conjugation of a single DNA handle to a specific location on the
protein is often needed. However, preparing such high-quality site-specific
conjugates often requires genetically engineered proteins, which is a laborious
and technically challenging approach. Here we demonstrate a simpler method to
create site-selective DNA-protein conjugates. Using a guiding DNA strand modified
with a metal-binding functionality, we directed a second DNA strand to the
vicinity of a metal-binding site of His6-tagged or wild-type metal-binding
proteins, such as serotransferrin, where it subsequently reacted with lysine
residues at that site. This method, DNA-templated protein conjugation,
facilitates the production of site-selective protein conjugates, and also
conjugation to IgG1 antibodies via a histidine cluster in the constant domain.

Small cationic amphiphilic α-helical peptides are emerging as agents for the
treatment of cancer and infection, but they are costly and display unfavourable
pharmacokinetics. Helical coordination complexes may offer a three-dimensional
scaffold for the synthesis of mimetic architectures. However, the high symmetry
and modest functionality of current systems offer little scope to tailor the
structure to interact with specific biomolecular targets, or to create libraries 
for phenotypic screens. Here, we report the highly stereoselective asymmetric
self-assembly of very stable, functionalized metallohelices. Their anti-parallel 
head-to-head-to-tail 'triplex' strand arrangement creates an amphipathic
functional topology akin to that of the active sub-units of, for example,
host-defence peptides and p53. The metallohelices display high,
structure-dependent toxicity to the human colon carcinoma cell-line HCT116
p53(++), causing dramatic changes in the cell cycle without DNA damage. They have
lower toxicity to human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MDA-MB-468) and, most
remarkably, they show no significant toxicity to the bacteria
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli.

Natural evolution relies on the improvement of biological entities by rounds of
diversification and selection. In the laboratory, directed evolution has emerged 
as a powerful tool for the development of new and improved biomolecules, but it
is limited by the enormous workload and cost of screening sufficiently large
combinatorial libraries. Here we describe the production of gel-shell beads
(GSBs) with the help of a microfluidic device. These hydrogel beads are
surrounded with a polyelectrolyte shell that encloses an enzyme, its encoding DNA
and the fluorescent reaction product. Active clones in these man-made
compartments can be identified readily by fluorescence-activated sorting at rates
>10(7) GSBs per hour. We use this system to perform the directed evolution of a
phosphotriesterase (a bioremediation catalyst) caged in GSBs and isolate a
20-fold faster mutant in less than one hour. We thus establish a practically
undemanding method for ultrahigh-throughput screening that results in functional 
hybrid composites endowed with evolvable protein components.

Experiments aimed at understanding ultrafast molecular processes are now routine,
and the notion that external laser fields can constitute an additional reagent is
also well established. The possibility of externally controlling a reaction with 
radiation increases immensely when its intensity is sufficiently high to distort 
the potential energy surfaces at which chemists conceptualize reactions take
place. Here we explore the transition from the weak- to the strong-field regimes 
of laser control for the dissociation of a polyatomic molecule, methyl iodide.
The control over the yield of the photodissociation reaction proceeds through the
creation of a light-induced conical intersection. The control of the velocity of 
the product fragments requires external fields with both high intensities and
short durations. This is because the mechanism by which control is exerted
involves modulating the potentials around the light-induced conical intersection,
that is, creating light-induced potentials.

The rise of graphene, a natural two-dimensional polymer (2DP) with topologically 
planar repeat units, has challenged synthetic chemistry, and has highlighted that
accessing equivalent covalently bonded sheet-like macromolecules has, until
recently, not been achieved. Here we show that non-centrosymmetric,
enantiomorphic single crystals of a simple-to-make monomer can be photochemically
converted into chiral 2DP crystals and cleanly reversed back to the monomer.
X-ray diffraction established unequivocal structural proof for this synthetic
2DP, which has an all-carbon scaffold and can be synthesized on the gram scale.
The monomer crystals are highly robust, can be easily grown to sizes greater than
1 mm and the resulting 2DP crystals exfoliated into nanometre-thin sheets. This
unique combination of features suggests that these 2DPs could find use in
membranes and nonlinear optics.

In contrast to the wide number and variety of available synthetic routes to
conventional linear polymers, the synthesis of two-dimensional polymers and
unambiguous proof of their structure remains a challenge. Two-dimensional
polymers-single-layered polymers that form a tiling network in exactly two
dimensions-have potential for use in nanoporous membranes and other applications.
Here, we report the preparation of a fluorinated hydrocarbon two-dimensional
polymer that can be exfoliated into single sheets, and its characterization by
high-resolution single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The procedure involves
three steps: preorganization in a lamellar crystal of a rigid monomer bearing
three photoreactive arms, photopolymerization of the crystalline monomers by
[4 + 4] cycloaddition, and isolation of individual two-dimensional polymer
sheets. This polymer is a molecularly thin (~1 nm) material that combines
precisely defined monodisperse pores of ~9 Å with a high pore density of
3.3 × 10(13) pores cm(-2). Atomic-resolution single-crystal X-ray structures of
the monomer, an intermediate dimer and the final crystalline two-dimensional
polymer were obtained and prove the single-crystal-to-single-crystal nature and
molecular precision of the two-dimensional photopolymerization.

But because electrons are omnipresent, catalysis by electrons often passes
unnoticed. In this Review, a simple analogy between acid/base catalysis and redox
catalysis is presented. Conceptually, the electron is a catalyst in much the same
way that a proton is a catalyst. The 'electron is a catalyst' paradigm unifies
mechanistically an assortment of synthetic transformations that otherwise have
little or no apparent relationship. Diverse radical cascades, including
unimolecular radical substitution reactions (SRN1-type chemistry), base-promoted 
homolytic aromatic substitutions (BHAS), radical Heck-type reactions, radical
cross-dehydrogenative couplings (CDC), direct arene trifluoromethylations and
radical alkoxycarbonylations, can all be viewed as electron-catalysed reactions.

Bridged ring systems are widely found in natural products, and successful
syntheses of them frequently feature intramolecular Diels-Alder reactions. These 
reactions are subclassified as either type I or type II depending on how the
diene motif is tethered to the rest of the substrate (type I are tethered at the 
1-position of the diene and type II at the 2-position). Although the type I
reaction has been used with great success, the molecular scaffolds accessible by 
the type II reactions are limited by the strain inherent in the formation of an
sp(2) carbon at a bridgehead position. Here, we describe a complementary approach
that provides access to these structures through the C-C activation of
cyclobutanones and their coupling with olefins. Various alkenes have been coupled
with cyclobutanones to provide a range of bridged skeletons. The ketone group of 
the products serves as a convenient handle for downstream functionalization.

Low-temperature fuel cells are limited by the oxygen reduction reaction, and
their widespread implementation in automotive vehicles is hindered by the cost of
platinum, currently the best-known catalyst for reducing oxygen in terms of both 
activity and stability. One solution is to decrease the amount of platinum
required, for example by alloying, but without detrimentally affecting its
properties. The alloy PtxY is known to be active and stable, but its synthesis in
nanoparticulate form has proved challenging, which limits its further study.
Herein we demonstrate the synthesis, characterization and catalyst testing of
model PtxY nanoparticles prepared through the gas-aggregation technique. The
catalysts reported here are highly active, with a mass activity of up to 3.05 A
mgPt(-1) at 0.9 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode. Using a variety of
characterization techniques, we show that the enhanced activity of PtxY over
elemental platinum results exclusively from a compressive strain exerted on the
platinum surface atoms by the alloy core.

After the discovery of fullerene-C60, it took almost two decades for the
possibility of boron-based fullerene structures to be considered. So far, there
has been no experimental evidence for these nanostructures, in spite of the
progress made in theoretical investigations of their structure and bonding. Here 
we report the observation, by photoelectron spectroscopy, of an all-boron
fullerene-like cage cluster at B40(-) with an extremely low electron-binding
energy. Theoretical calculations show that this arises from a cage structure with
a large energy gap, but that a quasi-planar isomer of B40(-) with two adjacent
hexagonal holes is slightly more stable than the fullerene structure. In
contrast, for neutral B40 the fullerene-like cage is calculated to be the most
stable structure. The surface of the all-boron fullerene, bonded uniformly via
delocalized σ and π bonds, is not perfectly smooth and exhibits unusual
heptagonal faces, in contrast to C60 fullerene.

The direct anti-Markovnikov addition of strong Brønsted acids to alkenes remains 
an unsolved problem in synthetic chemistry. Here, we report an efficient organic 
photoredox catalyst system for the addition of HCl, HF and also phosphoric and
sulfonic acids to alkenes, with complete regioselectivity. These transformations 
were developed using a photoredox catalyst in conjunction with a redox-active
hydrogen atom donor. The nucleophile counterion plays a critical role by ensuring
high reactivity, with 2,6-lutidinium salts typically furnishing the best results.
The nature of the redox-active hydrogen atom donor is also consequential, with
4-methoxythiophenol providing the best reactivity when 2,6-lutidinium salts are
used. A novel acridinium sensitizer provides enhanced reactivity within several
of the more challenging reaction manifolds. This Article demonstrates how
nucleophilic addition reactions mediated by photoredox catalysis can change the
way electrophilic and homofugal precursors are constructed.

Amiloride is a widely used diuretic that blocks epithelial sodium channels
(ENaCs). These heterotrimeric transmembrane proteins, assembled from β, γ and α
or δ subunits, effectively control water transport across epithelia and sodium
influx into non-epithelial cells. The functional role of δβγENaC in various
organs, including the human brain, is still poorly understood and no
pharmacological tools are available for the functional differentiation between α-
and δ-containing ENaCs. Here we report several photoswitchable versions of
amiloride. One compound, termed PA1, enables the optical control of ENaC
channels, in particular the δβγ isoform, by switching between blue and green
light, or by turning on and off blue light. PA1 was used to modify functionally
δβγENaC in amphibian and mammalian cells. We also show that PA1 can be used to
differentiate between δβγENaC and αβγENaC in a model for the human lung
epithelium.

Photosynthesis powers life on our planet. The basic photosynthetic architecture
consists of antenna complexes that harvest solar energy and reaction centres that
convert the energy into stable separated charge. In oxygenic photosynthesis, the 
initial charge separation occurs in the photosystem II reaction centre, the only 
known natural enzyme that uses solar energy to split water. Both energy transfer 
and charge separation in photosynthesis are rapid events with high quantum
efficiencies. In recent nonlinear spectroscopic experiments, long-lived
coherences have been observed in photosynthetic antenna complexes, and
theoretical work suggests that they reflect underlying electronic-vibrational
resonances, which may play a functional role in enhancing energy transfer. Here, 
we report the observation of coherent dynamics persisting on a picosecond
timescale at 77 K in the photosystem II reaction centre using two-dimensional
electronic spectroscopy. Supporting simulations suggest that the coherences are
of a mixed electronic-vibrational (vibronic) nature and may enhance the rate of
charge separation in oxygenic photosynthesis.

A diverse array of chiral organocatalysts have been developed that rely on
acid-base interactions to promote enantioselective ionic reactions via the
movement of electron pairs. The stereocontrol of radical reactions using
organocatalysts is an alternative approach, and several studies have shown that
synthetically useful reactivity can result by controlling the movement of single 
electrons. However, in these studies, it is still an acid-based organocatalyst
which forms a closed-shell intermediate with substrate prior to the radical
reaction and imparts chiral information, and use of a chiral organic radical
directly as catalyst has only rarely been explored. Here, we report the design of
an organic thiyl radical catalyst with a carefully designed chiral pocket
constructed around a chiral thiol precatalyst. The resulting catalyst was used to
effect highly diastereo- and enantioselective C-C bond-forming radical
cyclizations.

It is generally assumed that the hydrated electron occupies a quasi-spherical
cavity surrounded by only a few water molecules in its equilibrated state.
However, in the very moment of its generation, before water has had time to
respond to the extra charge, it is expected to be significantly larger in size.
According to a particle-in-a-box picture, the frequency of its absorption
spectrum is a sensitive measure of the initial size of the electronic
wavefunction. Here, using transient terahertz spectroscopy, we show that the
excess electron initially absorbs in the far-infrared at a frequency for which
accompanying ab initio molecular dynamics simulations estimate an initial
delocalization length of ≈ 40 Å. The electron subsequently shrinks due to
solvation and thereby leaves the terahertz observation window very quickly,
within ≈ 200 fs.

Supramolecular assembly can yield ordered structures by taking advantage of the
cumulative effect of multiple non-covalent interactions between adjacent
molecules. The thermodynamic origin of many self-assembled structures in water is
the balance between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments of the molecule.
Here, we show that this approach can be generalized to use solvophobic and
solvophilic segments of fully hydrophobic alkylated fullerene molecules. Addition
of n-alkanes results in their assembly--due to the antipathy of C60 towards
n-alkanes--into micelles and hexagonally packed gel-fibres containing insulated
C60 nanowires. The addition of pristine C60 instead directs the assembly into
lamellar mesophases by increasing the proportion of π-conjugated material in the 
mixture. The assembled structures contain a large fraction of optoelectronically 
active material and exhibit comparably high photoconductivities. This method is
shown to be applicable to several alkyl-π-conjugated molecules, and can be used
to construct organized functional materials with π-conjugated sections.

Single-molecule localization microscopy is used to construct super-resolution
images, but generally requires prior intense laser irradiation and in some cases 
additives, such as thiols, to induce on-off switching of fluorophores. These
requirements limit the potential applications of this methodology. Here, we
report a first-in-class spontaneously blinking fluorophore based on an
intramolecular spirocyclization reaction. Optimization of the intramolecular
nucleophile and rhodamine-based fluorophore (electrophile) provide a suitable
lifetime for the fluorescent open form, and equilibrium between the open form and
the non-fluorescent closed form. We show that this spontaneously blinking
fluorophore is suitable for single-molecule localization microscopy imaging deep 
inside cells and for tracking the motion of structures in living cells. We
further demonstrate the advantages of this fluorophore over existing
methodologies by applying it to nuclear pore structures located far above the
coverslip with a spinning-disk confocal microscope and for repetitive time-lapse 
super-resolution imaging of microtubules in live cells for up to 1 h.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a promising class of porous materials because
it is possible to mutually control their porous structure, composition and
functionality. However, it is still a challenge to predict the network topology
of such framework materials prior to their synthesis. Here we use a new rare
earth (RE) nonanuclear carboxylate-based cluster as an 18-connected molecular
building block to form a gea-MOF (gea-MOF-1) based on a (3,18)-connected net. We 
then utilized this gea net as a blueprint to design and assemble another MOF
(gea-MOF-2). In gea-MOF-2, the 18-connected RE clusters are replaced by
metal-organic polyhedra, peripherally functionalized so as to have the same
connectivity as the RE clusters. These metal-organic polyhedra act as
supermolecular building blocks when they form gea-MOF-2. The discovery of a
(3,18)-connected MOF followed by deliberate transposition of its topology to a
predesigned second MOF with a different chemical system validates the prospective
rational design of MOFs.

Nature has, through billions of years of evolution, assembled a multitude of
polymeric macromolecules capable of exquisite molecular recognition. This
functionality arises from the precise control exerted over their biosynthesis
that results in key residues being anchored in the appropriate positions to
interact with target substrates. Developing 'wholly synthetic' macromolecular
analogues that can mimic this behaviour presents a considerable challenge to
chemists, who lack the 'biological machinery' used in nature to assemble polymers
with such precision. In addressing this challenge, familiar chemical concepts,
such as combinatorial methods and supramolecular interactions, have been adapted 
for application in the macromolecular arena. Working from a limited set of
residues, synthetic macromolecules have been produced that display surprisingly
high binding affinities towards target proteins, even possessing useful in vivo
activities. These observations are all the more surprising when one considers the
heterogeneity inherent within these synthetic macromolecular receptors, and
provoke intriguing questions regarding our assumptions about the design of
receptors.

Studies of the Earth's atmosphere have shown that more than 90% of the expected
amount of Xe is depleted, a finding often referred to as the 'missing Xe
paradox'. Although several models for a Xe reservoir have been proposed, whether 
the missing Xe could be contained in the Earth's inner core has not yet been
answered. The key to addressing this issue lies in the reactivity of Xe with
Fe/Ni, the main constituents of the Earth's core. Here, we predict, through
first-principles calculations and unbiased structure searching techniques, a
chemical reaction of Xe with Fe/Ni at the temperatures and pressures found in the
Earth's core. We find that, under these conditions, Xe and Fe/Ni can form
intermetallic compounds, of which XeFe3 and XeNi3 are energetically the most
stable. This shows that the Earth's inner core is a natural reservoir for Xe
storage and provides a solution to the missing Xe paradox.

Adjuvants are materials added to vaccines to enhance the immunological response
to an antigen. QS-21 is a natural product adjuvant under investigation in
numerous vaccine clinical trials, but its use is constrained by scarcity,
toxicity, instability and an enigmatic molecular mechanism of action. Herein we
describe the development of a minimal QS-21 analogue that decouples adjuvant
activity from toxicity and provides a powerful platform for mechanistic
investigations. We found that the entire branched trisaccharide domain of QS-21
is dispensable for adjuvant activity and that the C4-aldehyde substituent,
previously proposed to bind covalently to an unknown cellular target, is also not
required. Biodistribution studies revealed that active adjuvants were retained
preferentially at the injection site and the nearest draining lymph nodes
compared with the attenuated variants. Overall, these studies have yielded
critical insights into saponin structure-function relationships, provided
practical synthetic access to non-toxic adjuvants, and established a platform for
detailed mechanistic studies.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables high-resolution non-invasive observation
of the anatomy and function of intact organisms. However, previous MRI reporters 
of key biological processes tied to gene expression have been limited by the
inherently low molecular sensitivity of conventional (1)H MRI. This limitation
could be overcome through the use of hyperpolarized nuclei, such as in the noble 
gas xenon, but previous reporters acting on such nuclei have been synthetic.
Here, we introduce the first genetically encoded reporters for hyperpolarized
(129)Xe MRI. These expressible reporters are based on gas vesicles (GVs),
gas-binding protein nanostructures expressed by certain buoyant microorganisms.
We show that GVs are capable of chemical exchange saturation transfer
interactions with xenon, which enables chemically amplified GV detection at
picomolar concentrations (a 100- to 10,000-fold improvement over comparable
constructs for (1)H MRI). We demonstrate the use of GVs as heterologously
expressed indicators of gene expression and chemically targeted exogenous labels 
in MRI experiments performed on living cells.

Biological systems rely on recyclable materials resources such as amino acids,
carbohydrates and nucleic acids. When biomaterials are damaged as a result of
aging or stress, tissues undergo repair by a depolymerization-repolymerization
sequence of remodelling. Integration of this concept into synthetic materials
systems may lead to devices with extended lifetimes. Here, we show that a
metastable polymer, end-capped poly(o-phthalaldehyde), undergoes mechanically
initiated depolymerization to revert the material to monomers. Trapping
experiments and steered molecular dynamics simulations are consistent with a
heterolytic scission mechanism. The obtained monomer was repolymerized by a
chemical initiator, effectively completing a depolymerization-repolymerization
cycle. By emulating remodelling of biomaterials, this model system suggests the
possibility of smart materials where aging or mechanical damage triggers
depolymerization, and orthogonal conditions regenerate the polymer when and where
necessary.

ABL1 tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKI) are front-line therapy for chronic
myelogenous leukaemia and are among the best-known examples of targeted cancer
therapeutics. However, the dynamic uptake into cells of TKIs of low molecular
weight and their intracellular behaviour is unknown because of the difficulty of 
observing non-fluorescent small molecules at subcellular resolution. Here we
report the direct label-free visualization and quantification of two TKI drugs
(imatinib and nilotinib) inside living cells using hyperspectral stimulated Raman
scattering imaging. Concentrations of both drugs were enriched over 1,000-fold in
lysosomes as a result of their lysosomotropic properties. In addition, low
solubility appeared to contribute significantly to the surprisingly large
accumulation of nilotinib. We further show that the lysosomal trapping of
imatinib was reduced more than tenfold when chloroquine is used simultaneously,
which suggests that chloroquine may increase the efficacy of TKIs through
lysosome-mediated drug-drug interaction in addition to the commonly proposed
autophagy-inhibition mechanism.

As long as 50 years ago theoretical calculations predicted that Möbius annulenes 
with only one π surface and one edge would exhibit peculiar electronic properties
and violate the Hückel rules. Numerous synthetic attempts notwithstanding, the
first singly twisted Möbius annulene was not prepared until 2003. Here we present
a general, rational strategy to synthesize triply or even more highly twisted
cyclic π systems. We apply this strategy to the preparation of a triply twisted
[24]dehydroannulene, the structure of which was confirmed by X-ray analysis. Our 
strategy is based on the topological transformation of 'twist' into 'writhe'. The
advantage is twofold: the product exhibits a lower degree of strain and
precursors can be designed that inherently include the writhe, which, after
cyclization, ends up in the Möbius product. With our strategy, triply twisted
systems are easier to prepare than their singly twisted counterparts.

Single-molecule approaches to chemical reaction analysis can provide information 
that is not accessible by studying ensemble systems. Changes in the molecular
structures of compounds tethered to the inner wall of a protein pore are known to
affect the current carried through the pore by aqueous ions under a fixed applied
potential. Here, we use this approach to study the substitution reactions of
arsenic(III) compounds with thiols, stretching the limits of the protein pore
technology to track the interconversion of seven reaction components in a network
that comprises interconnected Walden cycles. Single-molecule pathway analysis of 
'allowed' and 'forbidden' reactions reveals that sulfur-sulfur substitution
occurs with stereochemical inversion at the arsenic centre. Hence, we demonstrate
that the nanoreactor approach can be a valuable technique for the analysis of
dynamic reaction systems of relevance to biology.

Proton-conducting materials play a central role in many renewable energy and
bioelectronics technologies, including fuel cells, batteries and sensors. Thus,
much research effort has been expended to develop improved proton-conducting
materials, such as ceramic oxides, solid acids, polymers and metal-organic
frameworks. Within this context, bulk proton conductors from naturally occurring 
proteins have received somewhat less attention than other materials, which is
surprising given the potential modularity, tunability and processability of
protein-based materials. Here, we report proton conductivity for thin films
composed of reflectin, a cephalopod structural protein. Bulk reflectin has a
proton conductivity of ~2.6 × 10(-3) S cm(-1) at 65 °C, a proton transport
activation energy of ~0.2 eV and a proton mobility of ~7 × 10(-3) cm(2) V(-1)
s(-1). These figures of merit are similar to those reported for state-of-the-art 
artificial proton conductors and make it possible to use reflectin in
protein-based protonic transistors. Our findings may hold implications for the
next generation of biocompatible proton-conducting materials and protonic
devices.

Enzymatic haem and non-haem high-valent iron-oxo species are known to activate
strong C-H bonds, yet duplicating this reactivity in a synthetic system remains a
formidable challenge. Although instability of the terminal iron-oxo moiety is
perhaps the foremost obstacle, steric and electronic factors also limit the
activity of previously reported mononuclear iron(IV)-oxo compounds. In
particular, although nature's non-haem iron(IV)-oxo compounds possess high-spin S
= 2 ground states, this electronic configuration has proved difficult to achieve 
in a molecular species. These challenges may be mitigated within metal-organic
frameworks that feature site-isolated iron centres in a constrained, weak-field
ligand environment. Here, we show that the metal-organic framework Fe2(dobdc)
(dobdc(4-) = 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate) and its magnesium-diluted
analogue, Fe0.1Mg1.9(dobdc), are able to activate the C-H bonds of ethane and
convert it into ethanol and acetaldehyde using nitrous oxide as the terminal
oxidant. Electronic structure calculations indicate that the active oxidant is
likely to be a high-spin S = 2 iron(IV)-oxo species.

The cross-coupling of boronic acids and related derivatives with sp(2)
electrophiles (the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction) is one of the most powerful C-C bond 
formation reactions in synthesis, with applications that span pharmaceuticals,
agrochemicals and high-tech materials. Despite the breadth of its utility, the
scope of this Nobel prize-winning reaction is rather limited when applied to
aliphatic boronic esters. Primary organoboron reagents work well, but secondary
and tertiary boronic esters do not (apart from a few specific and isolated
examples). Through an alternative strategy, which does not involve using
transition metals, we have discovered that enantioenriched secondary and tertiary
boronic esters can be coupled to electron-rich aromatics with essentially
complete enantiospecificity. As the enantioenriched boronic esters are easily
accessible, this reaction should find considerable application, particularly in
the pharmaceutical industry where there is growing awareness of the importance
of, and greater clinical success in, creating biomolecules with three-dimensional
architectures.

Proteins fluctuate between alternative conformations, which presents a challenge 
for ligand discovery because such flexibility is difficult to treat
computationally owing to problems with conformational sampling and energy
weighting. Here we describe a flexible docking method that samples and weights
protein conformations using experimentally derived conformations as a guide. The 
crystallographically refined occupancies of these conformations, which are
observable in an apo receptor structure, define energy penalties for docking. In 
a large prospective library screen, we identified new ligands that target
specific receptor conformations of a cavity in cytochrome c peroxidase, and we
confirm both ligand pose and associated receptor conformation predictions by
crystallography. The inclusion of receptor flexibility led to ligands with new
chemotypes and physical properties. By exploiting experimental measures of loop
and side-chain flexibility, this method can be extended to the discovery of new
ligands for hundreds of targets in the Protein Data Bank for which similar
experimental information is available.

The route by which the complex and specific molecules of life arose from the
'prebiotic soup' remains an unsolved problem. Evolution provides a large part of 
the answer, but this requires molecules that can carry information (that is,
exist in many variants) and can replicate themselves. The process is commonplace 
in living organisms, but not so easy to achieve with simple chemical systems. It 
is especially difficult to contemplate in the chemical chaos of the prebiotic
world. Although popular in many quarters, the notion that RNA was the first
self-replicator carries many difficulties. Here, we present an alternative view, 
suggesting that there may be undiscovered self-replication mechanisms possible in
much simpler systems. In particular, we highlight the possibility of information 
coding through stereochemical configurations of substituents in organic polymers.
We also show that this coding system leads naturally to enantiopurity, solving
the apparent problem of biological homochirality.

The central role of mitochondria in metabolic pathways and in cell-death
mechanisms requires sophisticated signalling systems. Essential in this
signalling process is an array of lipid mediators derived from polyunsaturated
fatty acids. However, the molecular machinery for the production of oxygenated
polyunsaturated fatty acids is localized in the cytosol and their biosynthesis
has not been identified in mitochondria. Here we report that a range of
diversified polyunsaturated molecular species derived from a
mitochondria-specific phospholipid, cardiolipin (CL), is oxidized by the
intermembrane-space haemoprotein, cytochrome c. We show that a number of
oxygenated CL species undergo phospholipase A2-catalysed hydrolysis and thus
generate multiple oxygenated fatty acids, including well-known lipid mediators.
This represents a new biosynthetic pathway for lipid mediators. We demonstrate
that this pathway, which includes the oxidation of polyunsaturated CLs and
accumulation of their hydrolysis products (oxygenated linoleic, arachidonic acids
and monolysocardiolipins), is activated in vivo after acute tissue injury.

Analogous to the complex membranes found in cellular organelles, such as the
endoplasmic reticulum, the inverse cubic mesophases of lipids and their colloidal
forms (cubosomes) possess internal networks of water channels arranged in
crystalline order, which provide a unique nanospace for membrane-protein
crystallization and guest encapsulation. Polymeric analogues of cubosomes formed 
by the direct self-assembly of block copolymers in solution could provide new
polymeric mesoporous materials with a three-dimensionally organized internal maze
of large water channels. Here we report the self-assembly of amphiphilic
dendritic-linear block copolymers into polymer cubosomes in aqueous solution. The
presence of precisely defined bulky dendritic blocks drives the block copolymers 
to form spontaneously highly curved bilayers in aqueous solution. This results in
the formation of colloidal inverse bicontinuous cubic mesophases. The internal
networks of water channels provide a high surface area with tunable surface
functional groups that can serve as anchoring points for large guests such as
proteins and enzymes.

Mechanisms of prebiotic compartmentalization are central to providing insights
into how protocellular systems emerged on the early Earth. Protocell models are
based predominantly on the membrane self-assembly of fatty-acid vesicles,
although membrane-free scenarios that involve liquid-liquid microphase separation
(coacervation) have also been considered. Here we integrate these alternative
models of prebiotic compartmentalization and develop a hybrid protocell model
based on the spontaneous self-assembly of a continuous fatty-acid membrane at the
surface of preformed coacervate microdroplets prepared from cationic
peptides/polyelectrolytes and adenosine triphosphate or
oligo/polyribonucleotides. We show that the coacervate-supported membrane is
multilamellar, and mediates the selective uptake or exclusion of small and large 
molecules. The coacervate interior can be disassembled without loss of membrane
integrity, and fusion and growth of the hybrid protocells can be induced under
conditions of high ionic strength. Our results highlight how notions of
membrane-mediated compartmentalization, chemical enrichment and internalized
structuration can be integrated in protocell models via simple chemical and
physical processes.

Directed self-assembly of small molecules in living systems could enable a myriad
of applications in biology and medicine, and already this has been used widely to
synthesize supramolecules and nano/microstructures in solution and in living
cells. However, controlling the self-assembly of synthetic small molecules in
living animals is challenging because of the complex and dynamic in vivo
physiological environment. Here we employ an optimized first-order bioorthogonal 
cyclization reaction to control the self-assembly of a fluorescent small
molecule, and demonstrate its in vivo applicability by imaging caspase-3/7
activity in human tumour xenograft mouse models of chemotherapy. The fluorescent 
nanoparticles assembled in situ were imaged successfully in both apoptotic cells 
and tumour tissues using three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy.
This strategy combines the advantages offered by small molecules with those of
nanomaterials and should find widespread use for non-invasive imaging of enzyme
activity in vivo.

Soft materials that exhibit stimuli-responsive behaviour under aqueous conditions
(such as supramolecular hydrogels composed of self-assembled nanofibres) have
many potential biological applications. However, designing a macroscopic response
to structurally complex biochemical stimuli in these materials still remains a
challenge. Here we show that redox-responsive peptide-based hydrogels have the
ability to encapsulate enzymes and still retain their activities. Moreover,
cooperative coupling of enzymatic reactions with the gel response enables us to
construct unique stimuli-responsive soft materials capable of sensing a variety
of disease-related biomarkers. The programmable gel-sol response (even to
biological samples) is visible to the naked eye. Furthermore, we built Boolean
logic gates (OR and AND) into the hydrogel-enzyme hybrid materials, which were
able to sense simultaneously plural specific biochemicals and execute a
controlled drug release in accordance with the logic operation. The intelligent
soft materials that we have developed may prove valuable in future medical
diagnostics or treatments.

The metabolite (-)-lomaiviticin A, which contains two
diazotetrahydrobenzo[b]fluorene (diazofluorene) functional groups, inhibits the
growth of cultured human cancer cells at nanomolar-picomolar concentrations;
however, the mechanism responsible for the potent cytotoxicity of this natural
product is not known. Here we report that (-)-lomaiviticin A nicks and cleaves
plasmid DNA by a pathway that is independent of reactive oxygen species and iron,
and that the potent cytotoxicity of (-)-lomaiviticin A arises from the induction 
of DNA double-strand breaks (dsbs). In a plasmid cleavage assay, the ratio of
single-strand breaks (ssbs) to dsbs is 5.3 ± 0.6:1. Labelling studies suggest
that this cleavage occurs via a radical pathway. The structurally related
isolates (-)-lomaiviticin C and (-)-kinamycin C, which contain one diazofluorene,
are demonstrated to be much less effective DNA cleavage agents, thereby providing
an explanation for the enhanced cytotoxicity of (-)-lomaiviticin A compared to
that of other members of this family.

Two-coordinate boron cations (R2B(+)), referred to as borinium ions, are chemical
species in which the boron bears only four valence electrons, and that are
isoelectronic with hypothetical carbon dications (R2C(2+)). Although
lone-pair-donating substituents such as amino groups have enabled the isolation
of several borinium ions, diarylated and dialkylated borinium derivatives remain 
entirely unexplored. Here, we present the synthesis, structure and reactivity of 
the dimesitylborinium ion, which displays unexpectedly high thermal stability.
X-ray crystallography and (11)B NMR spectroscopy, supported by density functional
theory calculations, reveal that the borinium ion adopts a linear two-coordinate 
structure in both the solid state and in solution. The boron centre is stabilized
by pπ bonding from the mesityl groups and is free from coordination by the
counterion or solvent molecules. This diarylborinium ion possesses exceptional
Lewis acidity, accepting a pair of electrons from CO2 to cause an unusual
deoxygenation reaction.

Exciton fission is a process that occurs in certain organic materials whereby one
singlet exciton splits into two independent triplets. In photovoltaic devices
these two triplet excitons can each generate an electron, producing quantum
yields per photon of >100% and potentially enabling single-junction power
efficiencies above 40%. Here, we measure fission dynamics using ultrafast
photoinduced absorption and present a first-principles expression that
successfully reproduces the fission rate in materials with vastly different
structures. Fission is non-adiabatic and Marcus-like in weakly interacting
systems, becoming adiabatic and coupling-independent at larger interaction
strengths. In neat films, we demonstrate fission yields near unity even when
monomers are separated by >5 Å. For efficient solar cells, however, we show that 
fission must outcompete charge generation from the singlet exciton. This work
lays the foundation for tailoring molecular properties like solubility and energy
level alignment while maintaining the high fission yield required for
photovoltaic applications.

The inherent modularity of polypeptides, oligonucleotides and oligosaccharides
has been harnessed to achieve generalized synthesis platforms. Importantly, like 
these other targets, most small-molecule natural products are biosynthesized via 
iterative coupling of bifunctional building blocks. This suggests that many small
molecules also possess inherent modularity commensurate with systematic building 
block-based construction. Supporting this hypothesis, here we report that the
polyene motifs found in >75% of all known polyene natural products can be
synthesized using just 12 building blocks and one coupling reaction. Using the
same general retrosynthetic algorithm and reaction conditions, this platform
enabled both the synthesis of a wide range of polyene frameworks that covered all
of this natural-product chemical space and the first total syntheses of the
polyene natural products asnipyrone B, physarigin A and neurosporaxanthin
b-D-glucopyranoside. Collectively, these results suggest the potential for a more
generalized approach to making small molecules in the laboratory.

Criegee intermediates, which are carbonyl oxides produced when ozone reacts with 
unsaturated hydrocarbons, play an important role in the formation of OH and
organic acids in the atmosphere, but they have eluded direct detection until
recently. Reactions that involve Criegee intermediates are not understood fully
because data based on their direct observation are limited. We used transient
infrared absorption spectroscopy to probe directly the decay kinetics of
formaldehyde oxide (CH2OO) and found that it reacts with itself extremely
rapidly. This fast self-reaction is a result of its zwitterionic character.
According to our quantum-chemical calculations, a cyclic dimeric intermediate
that has the terminal O atom of one CH2OO bonded to the C atom of the other CH2OO
is formed with large exothermicity before further decomposition to 2H2CO +
O2((1)Δg). We suggest that the inclusion of this previously overlooked rapid
reaction in models may affect the interpretation of previous laboratory
experiments that involve Criegee intermediates.

Carbon nanostructures that feature two-dimensional extended nanosheets are
important components for technological applications such as high-performance
composites, lithium-ion storage, photovoltaics and nanoelectronics. Chemical
functionalization would render such structures better processable and more suited
for tailored applications, but typically this is precluded by the high
temperatures needed to prepare the nanosheets. Here, we report direct access to
functional carbon nanosheets of uniform thickness at room temperature. We used
amphiphiles that contain hexayne segments as metastable carbon precursors and
self-assembled these into ordered monolayers at the air/water interface.
Subsequent carbonization by ultraviolet irradiation in ambient conditions
resulted in the quantitative carbonization of the hexayne sublayer. Carbon
nanosheets prepared in this way retained their surface functionalization and
featured an sp(2)-rich amorphous carbon structure comparable to that usually
obtained on annealing above 800 °C. Moreover, they exhibited a molecularly
defined thickness of 1.9 nm, were mechanically self-supporting over several
micrometres and had macroscopic lateral dimensions on the order of centimetres.

Multicomponent reactions allow for more bond-forming events per synthetic
operation, enabling more step- and time-economical conversion of simple starting 
materials to complex and thus value-added targets. These processes invariably
require that reactivity be relayed from intermediate to intermediate over several
mechanistic steps until a termination event produces the final product. Here, we 
report a multicomponent process in which a novel 1,2,3-butatriene equivalent
(TMSBO: TMSCH2C≡CCH2OH) engages chemospecifically as a two-carbon alkyne
component in a metal-catalysed [5 + 2] cycloaddition with a vinylcyclopropane to 
produce an intermediate cycloadduct. Under the reaction conditions, this
intermediate undergoes a remarkably rapid 1,4-Peterson elimination, producing a
reactive four-carbon diene intermediate that is readily intercepted in either a
metal-catalysed or thermal [4 + 2] cycloaddition. TMSBO thus serves as an
yne-to-diene transmissive reagent coupling two powerful and convergent
cycloadditions--the homologous Diels-Alder and Diels-Alder
cycloadditions--through a vinylogous Peterson elimination, and enabling flexible 
access to diverse polycycles.

Large-scale utilization of solar-energy resources will require considerable
advances in energy-storage technologies to meet ever-increasing global energy
demands. Other than liquid fuels, existing energy-storage materials do not
provide the requisite combination of high energy density, high stability, easy
handling, transportability and low cost. New hybrid solar thermal fuels, composed
of photoswitchable molecules on rigid, low-mass nanostructures, transcend the
physical limitations of molecular solar thermal fuels by introducing local
sterically constrained environments in which interactions between chromophores
can be tuned. We demonstrate this principle of a hybrid solar thermal fuel using 
azobenzene-functionalized carbon nanotubes. We show that, on composite bundling, 
the amount of energy stored per azobenzene more than doubles from 58 to 120 kJ
mol(-1), and the material also maintains robust cyclability and stability. Our
results demonstrate that solar thermal fuels composed of molecule-nanostructure
hybrids can exhibit significantly enhanced energy-storage capabilities through
the generation of template-enforced steric strain.

Recently, the cytosine modifications 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and
5-formylcytosine (5fC) were found to exist in the genomic deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA) of a wide range of mammalian cell types. It is now important to understand 
their role in normal biological function and disease. Here we introduce reduced
bisulfite sequencing (redBS-Seq), a quantitative method to decode 5fC in DNA at
single-base resolution, based on a selective chemical reduction of 5fC to 5hmC
followed by bisulfite treatment. After extensive validation on synthetic and
genomic DNA, we combined redBS-Seq and oxidative bisulfite sequencing (oxBS-Seq) 
to generate the first combined genomic map of 5-methylcytosine, 5hmC and 5fC in
mouse embryonic stem cells. Our experiments revealed that in certain genomic
locations 5fC is present at comparable levels to 5hmC and 5mC. The combination of
these chemical methods can quantify and precisely map these three cytosine
derivatives in the genome and will help provide insights into their function.

In the chromatographic separation of enantiomers the order of elution is
determined by the strength of diasteromeric interactions between the components
of the mixture and a chiral stationary phase. For analytical purposes, it is
ideal to have the minor component elute first, whereas in the preparative mode a 
faster elution of the major component is desirable. Here we describe a stationary
phase constructed from a polyacetylene that bears 2,2'-bisphenol-derived side
chains in which chirality can be switched in the solid state prior to use. Both
the macromolecular helicity of the polymer backbone and the axial chirality of
the side chains can be switched in the solid state by interaction with a chiral
alcohol, but importantly are maintained after removal of the chiral alcohol
because of a memory effect. The chiral stationary phase thus prepared was used to
separate the enantiomers of trans-stilbene oxide with the enantiomer elution
order determined by the preseparation treatment.

In water-oxidizing photosynthetic organisms, light absorption generates a
powerfully oxidizing chlorophyll complex (P680(•+)) in the photosystem II
reaction centre. This is reduced via an electron transfer pathway from the
manganese-containing water-oxidizing catalyst, which includes an electron
transfer relay comprising a tyrosine (Tyr)-histidine (His) pair that features a
hydrogen bond between a phenol group and an imidazole group. By rapidly reducing 
P680(•+), the relay is thought to mitigate recombination reactions, thereby
ensuring a high quantum yield of water oxidation. Here, we show that an
artificial reaction centre that features a benzimidazole-phenol model of the
Tyr-His pair mimics both the short-internal hydrogen bond in photosystem II and, 
using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, the thermal relaxation that
accompanies proton-coupled electron transfer. Although this artificial system is 
much less complex than the natural one, theory suggests that it captures the
essential features that are important in the function of the relay.

Non-mechanical nano- and microscale pumps that function without the aid of an
external power source and provide precise control over the flow rate in response 
to specific signals are needed for the development of new autonomous nano- and
microscale systems. Here we show that surface-immobilized enzymes that are
independent of adenosine triphosphate function as self-powered micropumps in the 
presence of their respective substrates. In the four cases studied (catalase,
lipase, urease and glucose oxidase), the flow is driven by a gradient in fluid
density generated by the enzymatic reaction. The pumping velocity increases with 
increasing substrate concentration and reaction rate. These rechargeable pumps
can be triggered by the presence of specific analytes, which enables the design
of enzyme-based devices that act both as sensor and pump. Finally, we show
proof-of-concept enzyme-powered devices that autonomously deliver small molecules
and proteins in response to specific chemical stimuli, including the release of
insulin in response to glucose.

Since the first report of thiol-based self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) 30 years
ago, these structures have been examined in a huge variety of applications. The
oxidative and thermal instabilities of these systems are widely known, however,
and are an impediment to their widespread commercial use. Here, we describe the
generation of N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-based SAMs on gold that demonstrate
considerably greater resistance to heat and chemical reagents than the
thiol-based counterparts. This increased stability is related to the increased
strength of the gold-carbon bond relative to that of a gold-sulfur bond, and to a
different mode of bonding in the case of the carbene ligand. Once bound to gold, 
NHCs are not displaced by thiols or thioethers, and are stable to high
temperatures, boiling water, organic solvents, pH extremes, electrochemical
cycling above 0 V and 1% hydrogen peroxide. In particular, benzimidazole-derived 
carbenes provide films with the highest stabilities and evidence of short-range
molecular ordering. Chemical derivatization can be employed to adjust the surface
properties of NHC-based SAMs.

Warped carbon-rich molecules have captured the imagination of scientists across
many disciplines. Owing to their promising materials properties and challenging
synthesis, strained hydrocarbons are attractive targets that push the limits of
synthetic methods and molecular design. Herein we report the synthesis and
characterization of [5]cycloparaphenylene ([5]CPP), a carbon nanohoop that can be
envisaged as an open tubular fragment of C60, the equator of C70 fullerene and
the unit cycle of a [5,5] armchair carbon nanotube. Given its calculated
119 kcal mol(-1) strain energy and severely distorted benzene rings, this
synthesis, which employs a room-temperature macrocyclization of a diboronate
precursor, single-electron reduction and elimination, is remarkably mild and high
yielding (27% over three steps). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data were
obtained to confirm its geometry and previously disputed benzenoid character.
First and second pseudoreversible oxidation and reduction events were observed
via cyclic voltammetry. The ease of synthesis, high solubility and narrowest
optical HOMO/LUMO gap of any para-polyphenylene synthesized make [5]CPP a
desirable new material for organic electronics.

The ability to introduce different biophysical probes into defined positions in
target proteins will provide powerful approaches for interrogating protein
structure, function and dynamics. However, methods for site-specifically
incorporating multiple distinct unnatural amino acids are hampered by their low
efficiency. Here we provide a general solution to this challenge by developing an
optimized orthogonal translation system that uses amber and evolved
quadruplet-decoding transfer RNAs to encode numerous pairs of distinct unnatural 
amino acids into a single protein expressed in Escherichia coli with a
substantial increase in efficiency over previous methods. We also provide a
general strategy for labelling pairs of encoded unnatural amino acids with
different probes via rapid and spontaneous reactions under physiological
conditions. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by genetically directing
the labelling of several pairs of sites in calmodulin with fluorophores and
probing protein structure and dynamics by Förster resonance energy transfer.

The participation of the valence orbitals of actinides in bonding has been
debated for decades. Recent experimental and computational investigations
demonstrated the involvement of 6p, 6d and/or 5f orbitals in bonding. However,
structural and spectroscopic data, as well as theory, indicate a decrease in
covalency across the actinide series, and the evidence points to highly ionic,
lanthanide-like bonding for late actinides. Here we show that chemical
differentiation between californium and lanthanides can be achieved by using
ligands that are both highly polarizable and substantially rearrange on
complexation. A ligand that suits both of these desired properties is polyborate.
We demonstrate that the 5f, 6d and 7p orbitals are all involved in bonding in a
Cf(III) borate, and that large crystal-field effects are present. Synthetic,
structural and spectroscopic data are complemented by quantum mechanical
calculations to support these observations.

In any artificial photosynthetic system, the oxidation of water to molecular
oxygen provides the electrons needed for the reduction of protons or carbon
dioxide to a fuel. Understanding how this four-electron reaction works in detail 
is important for the development of improved robust catalysts made of
Earth-abundant materials, like first-row transition-metal oxides. Here, using
time-resolved Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and under reaction
conditions, we identify intermediates of water oxidation catalysed by an abundant
metal-oxide catalyst, cobalt oxide (Co3O4). One intermediate is a surface
superoxide (three-electron oxidation intermediate absorbing at 1,013 cm(-1)),
whereas a second observed intermediate is attributed to an oxo Co(IV) site
(one-electron oxidation intermediate absorbing at 840 cm(-1)). The temporal
behaviour of the intermediates reveals that they belong to different catalytic
sites. Knowledge of the structure and kinetics of surface intermediates will
enable the design of improved metal-oxide materials for more efficient water
oxidation catalysis.

Employing small molecules or chemical reagents to modulate the function of an
intracellular protein, particularly in a gain-of-function fashion, remains a
challenge. In contrast to inhibitor-based loss-of-function approaches, methods
based on a gain of function enable specific signalling pathways to be activated
inside a cell. Here we report a chemical rescue strategy that uses a
palladium-mediated deprotection reaction to activate a protein within living
cells. We identify biocompatible and efficient palladium catalysts that cleave
the propargyl carbamate group of a protected lysine analogue to generate a free
lysine. The lysine analogue can be genetically and site-specifically incorporated
into a protein, which enables control over the reaction site. This deprotection
strategy is shown to work with a range of different cell lines and proteins. We
further applied this biocompatible protection group/catalyst pair for caging and 
subsequent release of a crucial lysine residue in a bacterial Type III effector
protein within host cells, which reveals details of its virulence mechanism.

Porous materials are attractive for separation and catalysis-these applications
rely on selective interactions between host materials and guests. In
metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), these interactions can be controlled through a
flexible structural response to the presence of guests. Here we report a MOF that
consists of glycyl-serine dipeptides coordinated to metal centres, and has a
structure that evolves from a solvated porous state to a desolvated non-porous
state as a result of ordered cooperative, displacive and conformational changes
of the peptide. This behaviour is driven by hydrogen bonding that involves the
side-chain hydroxyl groups of the serine. A similar cooperative closure
(reminiscent of the folding of proteins) is also displayed with multipeptide
solid solutions. For these, the combination of different sequences of amino acids
controls the framework's response to the presence of guests in a nonlinear way.
This functional control can be compared to the effect of single-point mutations
in proteins, in which exchange of single amino acids can radically alter
structure and function.

Nature is a valuable source of inspiration in the design of catalysts, and
various approaches are used to elucidate the mechanism of hydrogenases, the
enzymes that oxidize or produce H2. In FeFe hydrogenases, H2 oxidation occurs at 
the H-cluster, and catalysis involves H2 binding on the vacant coordination site 
of an iron centre. Here, we show that the reversible oxidative inactivation of
this enzyme results from the binding of H2 to coordination positions that are
normally blocked by intrinsic CO ligands. This flexibility of the coordination
sphere around the reactive iron centre confers on the enzyme the ability to avoid
harmful reactions under oxidizing conditions, including exposure to O2. The
versatile chemistry of the diiron cluster in the natural system might inspire the
design of novel synthetic catalysts for H2 oxidation.

Quantum phenomena in the translational motion of reactants, which are usually
negligible at room temperature, can dominate reaction dynamics at low
temperatures. In such cold conditions, even the weak centrifugal force is enough 
to create a potential barrier that keeps reactants separated. However, reactions 
may still proceed through tunnelling because, at low temperatures, wave-like
properties become important. At certain de Broglie wavelengths, the colliding
particles can become trapped in long-lived metastable scattering states, leading 
to sharp increases in the total reaction rate. Here, we show that these
metastable states are responsible for a dramatic, order-of-magnitude-strong,
quantum kinetic isotope effect by measuring the absolute Penning ionization
reaction rates between hydrogen isotopologues and metastable helium down to 0.01 
K. We demonstrate that measurements of a single isotope are insufficient to
constrain ab initio calculations, making the kinetic isotope effect in the cold
regime necessary to remove ambiguity among possible potential energy surfaces.

Although carbon dioxide has attracted broad interest as a renewable carbon
feedstock, its use as a monomer in copolymerization with olefins has long been an
elusive endeavour. A major obstacle for this process is that the propagation step
involving carbon dioxide is endothermic; typically, attempted reactions between
carbon dioxide and an olefin preferentially yield olefin homopolymerization. Here
we report a strategy to circumvent the thermodynamic and kinetic barriers for
copolymerizations of carbon dioxide and olefins by using a metastable lactone
intermediate, 3-ethylidene-6-vinyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is formed by
the palladium-catalysed condensation of carbon dioxide and 1,3-butadiene.
Subsequent free-radical polymerization of the lactone intermediate afforded
polymers of high molecular weight with a carbon dioxide content of 33 mol% (29
wt%). Furthermore, the protocol was applied successfully to a one-pot
copolymerization of carbon dioxide and 1,3-butadiene, and one-pot
terpolymerizations of carbon dioxide, butadiene and another 1,3-diene. This
copolymerization technique provides access to a new class of polymeric materials 
made from carbon dioxide.

The use of methanol as a fuel and chemical feedstock could become very important 
in the development of a more sustainable society if methanol could be efficiently
obtained from the direct reduction of CO2 using solar-generated hydrogen. If
hydrogen production is to be decentralized, small-scale CO2 reduction devices are
required that operate at low pressures. Here, we report the discovery of a Ni-Ga 
catalyst that reduces CO2 to methanol at ambient pressure. The catalyst was
identified through a descriptor-based analysis of the process and the use of
computational methods to identify Ni-Ga intermetallic compounds as stable
candidates with good activity. We synthesized and tested a series of catalysts
and found that Ni5Ga3 is particularly active and selective. Comparison with
conventional Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts revealed the same or better methanol
synthesis activity, as well as considerably lower production of CO. We suggest
that this is a first step towards the development of small-scale low-pressure
devices for CO2 reduction to methanol.

The chemistry of the Group 13 metals is dominated by the +1 and +3 oxidation
states, and simple monomeric M(II) species are typically short-lived, highly
reactive species. Here we report the first thermally robust monomeric MX2
radicals of gallium, indium and thallium. By making use of sterically demanding
boryl substituents, compounds of the type M(II)(boryl)2 (M = Ga, In, Tl) can be
synthesized. These decompose above 130 °C and are amenable to structural
characterization in the solid state by X-ray crystallography. Electron
paramagnetic resonance and computational studies reveal a dominant metal-centred 
character for all three radicals (>70% spin density at the metal). M(II) species 
have been invoked as key short-lived intermediates in well-known
electron-transfer processes; consistently, the chemical behaviour of these novel 
isolated species reveals facile one-electron shuttling processes at the metal
centre.

Interest in saturated N-heterocycles as scaffolds for the synthesis of bioactive 
molecules is increasing. Reliable and predictable synthetic methods for the
preparation of these compounds, especially medium-sized rings, are limited. We
describe the development of SnAP (Sn amino protocol) reagents for the
transformation of aldehydes into seven-, eight- and nine-membered saturated
N-heterocycles. This process occurs under mild, room-temperature conditions and
offers exceptional substrate scope and functional-group tolerance. Air- and
moisture-stable SnAP reagents are prepared on a multigram scale from inexpensive 
starting materials by simple reaction sequences. These new reagents and processes
allow widely available aryl, heteroaryl and aliphatic aldehydes to be converted
into diverse N-heterocycles, including diazepanes, oxazepanes, diazocanes,
oxazocanes and hexahydrobenzoxazonines, by a single synthetic operation.

Enzymes fold into unique three-dimensional structures, which underlie their
remarkable catalytic properties. The requirement to adopt a stable, folded
conformation is likely to contribute to their relatively large size (>10,000 Da).
However, much shorter peptides can achieve well-defined conformations through the
formation of amyloid fibrils. To test whether short amyloid-forming peptides
might in fact be capable of enzyme-like catalysis, we designed a series of
seven-residue peptides that act as Zn(2+)-dependent esterases. Zn(2+) helps
stabilize the fibril formation, while also acting as a cofactor to catalyse acyl 
ester hydrolysis. These results indicate that prion-like fibrils are able to not 
only catalyse their own formation, but they can also catalyse chemical reactions.
Thus, they might have served as intermediates in the evolution of modern-day
enzymes. These results also have implications for the design of self-assembling
nanostructured catalysts including ones containing a variety of biological and
non-biological metal ions.

In vitro compartmentalization of biochemical reaction networks is a crucial step 
towards engineering artificial cell-scale devices and systems. At this scale the 
dynamics of molecular systems becomes stochastic, which introduces several
engineering challenges and opportunities. Here we study a programmable
transcriptional oscillator system that is compartmentalized into microemulsion
droplets with volumes between 33 fl and 16 pl. Simultaneous measurement of large 
populations of droplets reveals major variations in the amplitude, frequency and 
damping of the oscillations. Variability increases for smaller droplets and
depends on the operating point of the oscillator. Rather than reflecting the
stochastic kinetics of the chemical reaction network itself, the variability can 
be attributed to the statistical variation of reactant concentrations created
during their partitioning into droplets. We anticipate that robustness to
partitioning variability will be a critical challenge for engineering cell-scale 
systems, and that highly parallel time-series acquisition from microemulsion
droplets will become a key tool for characterization of stochastic circuit
function.

Mass spectrometry is a vital tool for molecular characterization, and the allied 
technique of ion mobility is enhancing many areas of (bio)chemical analysis.
Strong synergy arises between these two techniques because of their ability to
ascertain complementary information about gas-phase ions. Ion mobility separates 
ions (from small molecules up to megadalton protein complexes) based on their
differential mobility through a buffer gas. Ion mobility-mass spectrometry
(IM-MS) can thus act as a tool to separate complex mixtures, to resolve ions that
may be indistinguishable by mass spectrometry alone, or to determine structural
information (for example rotationally averaged cross-sectional area),
complementary to more traditional structural approaches. Finally, IM-MS can be
used to gain insights into the conformational dynamics of a system, offering a
unique means of characterizing flexibility and folding mechanisms. This Review
critically describes how IM-MS has been used to enhance various areas of chemical
and biophysical analysis.

Identifying and understanding the active sites responsible for reaction turnover 
is critical to developing improved catalysts. For the hydrogen-evolution reaction
(HER), MoS2 has been identified as an active non-noble-metal-based catalyst.
However, only edge sites turnover the reaction because the basal planes are
catalytically inert. In an effort to develop a scalable HER catalyst with an
increased number of active sites, herein we report a Mo-S catalyst (supported
thiomolybdate [Mo3S13](2-) nanoclusters) in which most sulfur atoms in the
structure exhibit a structural motif similar to that observed at MoS2 edges.
Supported sub-monolayers of [Mo3S13](2-) nanoclusters exhibited excellent HER
activity and stability in acid. Imaging at the atomic scale with scanning
tunnelling microscopy allowed for direct characterization of these supported
catalysts. The [Mo3S13](2-) nanoclusters reported herein demonstrated excellent
turnover frequencies, higher than those observed for other non-precious metal
catalysts synthesized by a scalable route.

Dye-sensitized solar cells have gained widespread attention in recent years
because of their low production costs, ease of fabrication and tunable optical
properties, such as colour and transparency. Here, we report a molecularly
engineered porphyrin dye, coded SM315, which features the prototypical structure 
of a donor-π-bridge-acceptor and both maximizes electrolyte compatibility and
improves light-harvesting properties. Linear-response, time-dependent density
functional theory was used to investigate the perturbations in the electronic
structure that lead to improved light harvesting. Using SM315 with the
cobalt(II/III) redox shuttle resulted in dye-sensitized solar cells that exhibit 
a high open-circuit voltage VOC of 0.91 V, short-circuit current density JSC of
18.1 mA cm(-2), fill factor of 0.78 and a power conversion efficiency of 13%.

Uranyl (UO2(2+)), the predominant aerobic form of uranium, is present in the
ocean at a concentration of ~3.2 parts per 10(9) (13.7 nM); however, the
successful enrichment of uranyl from this vast resource has been limited by the
high concentrations of metal ions of similar size and charge, which makes it
difficult to design a binding motif that is selective for uranyl. Here we report 
the design and rational development of a uranyl-binding protein using a
computational screening process in the initial search for potential
uranyl-binding sites. The engineered protein is thermally stable and offers very 
high affinity and selectivity for uranyl with a Kd of 7.4 femtomolar (fM) and
>10,000-fold selectivity over other metal ions. We also demonstrated that the
uranyl-binding protein can repeatedly sequester 30-60% of the uranyl in synthetic
sea water. The chemical strategy employed here may be applied to engineer other
selective metal-binding proteins for biotechnology and remediation applications.

A key goal of nanotechnology is the development of artificial machines capable of
converting molecular movement into macroscopic work. Although conversion of light
into shape changes has been reported and compared to artificial muscles, real
applications require work against an external load. Here, we describe the design,
synthesis and operation of spring-like materials capable of converting light
energy into mechanical work at the macroscopic scale. These versatile materials
consist of molecular switches embedded in liquid-crystalline polymer springs. In 
these springs, molecular movement is converted and amplified into controlled and 
reversible twisting motions. The springs display complex motion, which includes
winding, unwinding and helix inversion, as dictated by their initial shape.
Importantly, they can produce work by moving a macroscopic object and mimicking
mechanical movements, such as those used by plant tendrils to help the plant
access sunlight. These functional materials have potential applications in
micromechanical systems, soft robotics and artificial muscles.

Stereoelectronic complementarity between the active site of an enzyme and the
transition state of a reaction is one of the tenets of enzyme catalysis. This
report illustrates the principles of enzyme catalysis (first proposed by Pauling 
and Jencks) through a well-defined model system that has been fully characterized
crystallographically, computationally and kinetically. Catalysis of the
bowl-to-bowl inversion processes that pertain to corannulene is achieved by
combining ground-state destabilization and transition-state stabilization within 
the cavity of an extended tetracationic cyclophane. This synthetic receptor
fulfils a role reminiscent of a catalytic antibody by stabilizing the planar
transition state for the bowl-to-bowl inversion of (ethyl)corannulene (which
accelerates this process by a factor of ten at room temperature) by an
induced-fit mechanism first formulated by Koshland.

Just as light scattering from an object results in diffraction patterns, the
quantum mechanical nature of molecules can lead to the diffraction of matter
waves during molecular collisions. This behaviour manifests itself as rapid
oscillatory structures in measured differential cross-sections, and such
observable features are sensitive probes of molecular interaction potentials.
However, these structures have proved challenging to resolve experimentally.
Here, we use a Stark decelerator to form a beam of state-selected and
velocity-controlled NO radicals and measure state-to-state differential
cross-sections for inelastic collisions of NO with He, Ne and Ar atoms using
velocity map imaging. The monochromatic velocity distribution of the NO beam
produced scattering images with unprecedented sharpness and angular resolution,
thereby fully resolving quantum diffraction oscillations. We found excellent
agreement with quantum close-coupling scattering calculations for these benchmark
systems.

Rotary ATPases play fundamental roles in energy conversion as their catalytic
rotation is associated with interdomain fluctuations and heterogeneity of
conformational states. Using ion mobility mass spectrometry we compared the
conformational dynamics of the intact ATPase from Thermus thermophilus with those
of its membrane and soluble subcomplexes. Our results define regions with
enhanced flexibility assigned to distinct subunits within the overall assembly.
To provide a structural context for our experimental data we performed molecular 
dynamics simulations and observed conformational changes of the peripheral stalks
that reflect their intrinsic flexibility. By isolating complexes at different
phases of cell growth and manipulating nucleotides, metal ions and pH during
isolation, we reveal differences that can be related to conformational changes in
the Vo complex triggered by ATP binding. Together these results implicate
nucleotides in modulating flexibility of the stator components and uncover
mechanistic detail that underlies operation and regulation in the context of the 
holoenzyme.

Biological light-driven proton pumps use light to move protons across a cell
membrane, creating a proton gradient. Although photochromic compounds such as
spiropyrans can reversibly convert between two structures with differing pKa
values, spiropyrans have not been used to generate either a light-driven proton
pump or an electrical current. Here, we report an artificial light-harvesting
system based on a supported liquid membrane doped with a spiropyran. Irradiating 
the membrane with ultraviolet light induces a ring-opening reaction, converting
spiropyran to merocyanine, whereas irradiation with visible light induces the
reverse reaction. When the membrane is irradiated with ultraviolet and visible
light on opposite sides, H(+) is taken up by merocyanine, carried through the
polymeric membrane and released on the other side. We show that this system
produces a light-induced proton flux, an electrical current with an efficiency of
∼0.12%, an open-circuit voltage of ∼210 mV and a membrane gradient of ∼3.6 ΔpH
units. Alternating the sides illuminated with ultraviolet and visible light
generates an alternating current.

The observation of persistent oscillatory signals in multidimensional spectra of 
protein-pigment complexes has spurred a debate on the role of coherence-assisted 
electronic energy transfer as a key operating principle in photosynthesis.
Vibronic coupling has recently been proposed as an explanation for the long
lifetime of the observed spectral beatings. However, photosynthetic systems are
inherently complicated, and tractable studies on simple molecular compounds are
needed to fully understand the underlying physics. In this work, we present
measurements and calculations on a solvated molecular homodimer with clearly
resolvable oscillations in the corresponding two-dimensional spectra. Through
analysis of the various contributions to the nonlinear response, we succeed in
isolating the signal due to inter-exciton coherence. We find that although
calculations predict a prolongation of this coherence due to vibronic coupling,
the combination of dynamic disorder and vibrational relaxation leads to a
coherence decay on a timescale comparable to the electronic dephasing time.

Various conventional reactions in polymer chemistry have been translated to the
supramolecular domain, yet it has remained challenging to devise living
supramolecular polymerization. To achieve this, self-organization occurring far
from thermodynamic equilibrium--ubiquitously observed in nature--must take place.
Prion infection is one example that can be observed in biological systems. Here, 
we present an 'artificial infection' process in which porphyrin-based monomers
assemble into nanoparticles, and are then converted into nanofibres in the
presence of an aliquot of the nanofibre, which acts as a 'pathogen'. We have
investigated the assembly phenomenon using isodesmic and cooperative models and
found that it occurs through a delicate interplay of these two aggregation
pathways. Using this understanding of the mechanism taking place, we have
designed a living supramolecular polymerization of the porphyrin-based monomers. 
Despite the fact that the polymerization is non-covalent, the reaction kinetics
are analogous to that of conventional chain growth polymerization, and the
supramolecular polymers were synthesized with controlled length and narrow
polydispersity.

The copolymerization of ethylene with polar monomers is a major challenge when it
comes to the manufacture of materials with potential for a wide range of
commercial applications. In the chemical industry, free-radical polymerization is
used to make a large proportion of such copolymers, but the forcing conditions
result in a lack of fine control over the architecture of the products. Herein we
introduce a synthetic tool, effective under mild experimental conditions, for the
precision design of unprecedented ethylene- and polar-monomer-based copolymers.
We demonstrate how an organocobalt species can control the growth of the
copolymer chains, their composition and the monomer distribution throughout the
chain. By fine tuning the ethylene pressure during polymerization and by
exploiting a unique reactive mode of the end of the organometallic chain, novel
block-like copolymer structures can be prepared. This highly versatile synthetic 
platform provides access to a diverse range of polymer materials.

Reductive elimination of carbon-carbon bonds occurs in numerous metal-catalysed
reactions. This process is well documented for a variety of transition metal
complexes. However, carbon-carbon bond reductive elimination from a limited
number of Au(III) complexes has been shown to be a slow and prohibitive process
that generally requires elevated temperatures. Herein we show that oxidation of a
series of mono- and bimetallic Au(I) aryl complexes at low temperature generates 
observable Au(III) and Au(II) intermediates. We also show that aryl-aryl bond
reductive elimination from these oxidized species is not only among the fastest
observed for any transition metal, but is also mechanistically distinct from
previously studied alkyl-alkyl and aryl-alkyl reductive eliminations from
Au(III).

Chemical functionalization of graphene is promising for a variety of
next-generation technologies. Although graphene oxide (GO) is a versatile
material in this direction, its use is limited by the production of metastable,
chemically inhomogeneous and spatially disordered GO structures under current
synthetic protocols, which results in poor optoelectronic properties. Here, we
present a mild thermal annealing procedure, with no chemical treatments involved,
to manipulate as-synthesized GO on a large scale to enhance sheet properties with
the oxygen content preserved. Using experiments supported by atomistic
calculations, we demonstrate that GO structures undergo a phase transformation
into prominent oxidized and graphitic domains by temperature-driven oxygen
diffusion. Consequently, as-synthesized GO that absorbs mainly in the ultraviolet
region becomes strongly absorbing in the visible region, photoluminescence is
blue shifted and electronic conductivity increases by up to four orders of
magnitude. Our thermal processing method offers a suitable way to tune and
enhance the properties of GO, which creates opportunities for various
applications.

There have been numerous developments in C-H activation reactions in the past
decade. Attracted by the ability to functionalize molecules directly at
ostensibly unreactive C-H bonds, chemists have discovered reaction conditions
that enable reactions of C(sp(2))-H and C(sp(3))-H bonds with a variety of
coupling partners. Despite these advances, the development of suitable ligands
that enable catalytic C(sp(3))-H bond functionalization remains a significant
challenge. Herein we report the discovery of a mono-N-protected amino acid ligand
that enables Pd(II)-catalysed coupling of γ-C(sp(3))-H bonds in triflyl-protected
amines with arylboron reagents. Remarkably, no background reaction was observed
in the absence of ligand. A variety of amine substrates and arylboron reagents
were cross-coupled using this method. Arylation of optically active substrates
derived from amino acids also provides a potential route for preparing
non-proteinogenic amino acids.

The prototypical F + H2 → HF + H reaction possesses a substantial energetic
barrier (~800 K) and might therefore be expected to slow to a negligible rate at 
low temperatures. It is, however, the only source of interstellar HF, which has
been detected in a wide range of cold (10-100 K) environments. In fact, the
reaction does take place efficiently at low temperatures due to
quantum-mechanical tunnelling. Rate constant measurements at such temperatures
have essentially been limited to fast barrierless reactions, such as those
between two radicals. Using uniform supersonic hydrogen flows we can now report
direct experimental measurements of the rate of this reaction down to a
temperature of 11 K, in remarkable agreement with state-of-the-art quantum
reactive scattering calculations. The results will allow a stronger link to be
made between observations of interstellar HF and the abundance of the most common
interstellar molecule, H2, and hence a more accurate estimation of the total mass
of astronomical objects.

Screening of small-molecule libraries is an important aspect of probe and drug
discovery science. Numerous authors have suggested that bioactive natural
products are attractive starting points for such libraries because of their
structural complexity and sp(3)-rich character. Here, we describe the
construction of a screening library based on representative members of four
families of biologically active alkaloids (Stemonaceae, the structurally related 
cyclindricine and lepadiformine families, lupin and Amaryllidaceae). In each
case, scaffolds were based on structures of the naturally occurring compounds or 
a close derivative. Scaffold preparation was pursued following the development of
appropriate enabling chemical methods. Diversification provided 686 new compounds
suitable for screening. The libraries thus prepared had structural
characteristics, including sp(3) content, comparable to a basis set of
representative natural products and were highly rule-of-five compliant.

The properties of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) make them good candidates for
next-generation electronic materials. Whereas 'top-down' methods, such as the
lithographical patterning of graphene and the unzipping of carbon nanotubes, give
mixtures of different GNRs, structurally well-defined GNRs can be made using a
'bottom-up' organic synthesis approach through solution-mediated or
surface-assisted cyclodehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, non-planar
polyphenylene precursors were first 'built up' from small molecules, and then
'graphitized' and 'planarized' to yield GNRs. However, fabrication of processable
and longitudinally well-extended GNRs has remained a major challenge. Here we
report a bottom-up solution synthesis of long (>200 nm) liquid-phase-processable 
GNRs with a well-defined structure and a large optical bandgap of 1.88 eV.
Self-assembled monolayers of GNRs can be observed by scanning probe microscopy,
and non-contact time-resolved terahertz conductivity measurements reveal
excellent charge-carrier mobility within individual GNRs. Such structurally
well-defined GNRs may prove useful for fundamental studies of graphene
nanostructures, as well as the development of GNR-based nanoelectronics.

The ubiquitous nature of C-H bonds in organic molecules makes them attractive as 
a target for rapid complexity generation, but brings with it the problem of
achieving selective reactions. In developing new methodologies for C-H
functionalization, alkenes are an attractive starting material because of their
abundance and low cost. Here we describe the conversion of 1-alkenes into
1,4-diols. The method involves the installation of a new Si,N-type chelating
auxiliary group on the alkene followed by iridium-catalysed C-H silylation of an 
unactivated δ-C(sp(3))-H bond to produce a silolane intermediate. Oxidation of
the C-Si bonds affords a 1,4-diol. The method is demonstrated to have broad scope
and good functional group compatibility by application to the selective
1,4-oxygenation of several natural products and derivatives.

Malaria is an infectious disease caused by parasites of the genus Plasmodium,
which leads to approximately one million deaths per annum worldwide. Chemical
validation of new antimalarial targets is urgently required in view of rising
resistance to current drugs. One such putative target is the enzyme
N-myristoyltransferase, which catalyses the attachment of the fatty acid
myristate to protein substrates (N-myristoylation). Here, we report an integrated
chemical biology approach to explore protein myristoylation in the major human
parasite P. falciparum, combining chemical proteomic tools for identification of 
the myristoylated and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteome with
selective small-molecule N-myristoyltransferase inhibitors. We demonstrate that
N-myristoyltransferase is an essential and chemically tractable target in malaria
parasites both in vitro and in vivo, and show that selective inhibition of
N-myristoylation leads to catastrophic and irreversible failure to assemble the
inner membrane complex, a critical subcellular organelle in the parasite life

Selectivity in chemical reactions that form complex molecular architectures from 
simpler precursors is usually rationalized by comparing competing
transition-state structures that lead to different possible products. Herein we
describe a system for which a single transition-state structure leads to the
formation of many isomeric products via pathways that feature multiple sequential
bifurcations. The reaction network described connects the pimar-15-en-8-yl cation
to miltiradiene, a tricyclic diterpene natural product, and isomers via
cyclizations and/or rearrangements. The results suggest that the selectivity of
the reaction is controlled by (post-transition-state) dynamic effects, that is,
how the carbocation structure changes in response to the distribution of energy
in its vibrational modes. The inherent dynamical effects revealed herein
(characterized through quasiclassical direct dynamics calculations using density 
functional theory) have implications not only for the general principles of
selectivity prediction in systems with complex potential energy surfaces, but
also for the mechanisms of terpene synthase enzymes and their evolution. These
findings redefine the challenges faced by nature in controlling the biosynthesis 
of complex natural products.

Despite the remarkable progress made in the self-assembly of nano- and microscale
architectures with well-defined sizes and shapes, a self-organization-based
synthesis of hollow toroids has, so far, proved to be elusive. Here, we report
the synthesis of polymer microrings made from rectangular, flat and rigid-core
monomers with anisotropically predisposed alkene groups, which are crosslinked
with each other by dithiol linkers using thiol-ene photopolymerization. The
resulting hollow toroidal structures are shape-persistent and mechanically robust
in solution. In addition, their size can be tuned by controlling the initial
monomer concentrations, an observation that is supported by a theoretical
analysis. These hollow microrings can encapsulate guest molecules in the
intratoroidal nanospace, and their peripheries can act as templates for circular 
arrays of metal nanoparticles.

Following extensive evidence for the formation of four-stranded DNA G-quadruplex 
structures in vitro, DNA G-quadruplexes have been observed within human cells.
Although chemically distinct, RNA can also fold in vitro into G-quadruplex
structures that are highly stable because of the 2'-hydroxyl group. However, RNA 
G-quadruplexes have not yet been reported in cells. Here, we demonstrate the
visualization of RNA G-quadruplex structures within the cytoplasm of human cells 
using a G-quadruplex structure-specific antibody. We also demonstrate that small 
molecules that bind to G-quadruplexes in vitro can trap endogenous RNA
G-quadruplexes when applied to cells. Furthermore, a small molecule that exhibits
a preference for RNA G-quadruplexes rather than DNA G-quadruplexes in biophysical
experiments also shows the same selectivity within a cellular context. Our
findings provide substantive evidence for RNA G-quadruplex formation in the human
transcriptome, and corroborate the selectivity and application of stabilizing
ligands that target G-quadruplexes within a cellular context.

Mass spectrometry is the primary analytical technique used to characterize the
complex oligosaccharides that decorate cell surfaces. Monosaccharide building
blocks are often simple epimers, which when combined produce diastereomeric
glycoconjugates indistinguishable by mass spectrometry. Structure elucidation
frequently relies on assumptions that biosynthetic pathways are highly conserved.
Here, we show that biosynthetic enzymes can display unexpected promiscuity, with 
human glycosyltransferase pp-α-GanT2 able to utilize both uridine diphosphate
N-acetylglucosamine and uridine diphosphate N-acetylgalactosamine, leading to the
synthesis of epimeric glycopeptides in vitro. Ion-mobility mass spectrometry
(IM-MS) was used to separate these structures and, significantly, enabled
characterization of the attached glycan based on the drift times of the
monosaccharide product ions generated following collision-induced dissociation.
Finally, ion-mobility mass spectrometry following fragmentation was used to
determine the nature of both the reducing and non-reducing glycans of a series of
epimeric disaccharides and the branched pentasaccharide Man3 glycan,
demonstrating that this technique may prove useful for the sequencing of complex 
oligosaccharides.

To access architecturally complex natural products, chemists usually devise a
customized synthetic strategy for constructing a single target skeleton. In
contrast, biosynthetic assembly lines often employ divergent intramolecular
cyclizations of a polyunsaturated common intermediate to produce diverse arrays
of scaffolds. With the aim of integrating such biogenetic strategies, we show the
development of an artificial divergent assembly line generating unprecedented
numbers of scaffold variations of terpenoid indole alkaloids. This approach not
only allows practical access to multipotent intermediates, but also enables
systematic diversification of skeletal, stereochemical and functional group
properties without structural simplification of naturally occurring alkaloids.
Three distinct modes of [4+2] cyclizations and two types of redox-mediated
annulations provided divergent access to five skeletally distinct scaffolds
involving iboga-, aspidosperma-, andranginine- and ngouniensine-type skeletons
and a non-natural variant within six to nine steps from tryptamine. The
efficiency of our approach was demonstrated by successful total syntheses of
(±)-vincadifformine, (±)-andranginine and (-)-catharanthine.

Nitrogen, one of the most abundant elements in nature, forms the highly stable N2
molecule in its elemental state. In contrast, polynitrogen compounds comprising
only nitrogen atoms are rare, and no molecular crystal made of these compounds
has been prepared. Here, we predict the existence of such a molecular solid,
consisting of N8 molecules, that is metastable even at ambient pressure. In the
solid state, the N8 monomers retain the same structure and bonding pattern as
those they adopt in the gas phase. The interactions that bind N8 molecules
together are weak van der Waals and electrostatic forces. The solid is, according
to calculations, more stable than a previously reported polymeric nitrogen solid,
including at low pressure (below 20 GPa). The structure and properties of the N8 
molecular crystal are discussed and a possible preparation strategy is suggested.

The development of a general catalytic method for the direct and stereoselective 
construction of contiguous all-carbon quaternary stereocentres remains a
formidable challenge in chemical synthesis. Here, we report a highly enantio- and
diastereoselective [3+2] annulation reaction of 5-vinyloxazolidinones and
activated trisubstituted alkenes catalysed by a palladium complex bearing a newly
devised phosphine ligand with a chiral ammonium salt component, which enables the
single-step construction of three contiguous stereocentres, including vicinal
all-carbon quaternary stereocentres, in a five-membered heterocyclic framework.
This stereoselective cycloaddition protocol relies on the remarkable ability of
the chiral ligand to rigorously control the absolute stereochemistry of each
chiral centre associated with the multiple bond-forming events, and provides a
reliable catalytic process for the asymmetric synthesis of densely functionalized
pyrrolidines.

Although the local environment of a molecule can play an important role in its
chemistry, rarely has it been examined experimentally at the level of individual 
molecules. Here we report the precise control of intramolecular hydrogen-transfer
(tautomerization) reactions in single molecules using scanning tunnelling
microscopy. By placing, with atomic precision, a copper adatom close to a
porphycene molecule, we found that the tautomerization rates could be tuned up
and down in a controlled fashion, surprisingly also at rather large separations. 
Furthermore, we extended our study to molecular assemblies in which even the
arrangement of the pyrrolic hydrogen atoms in the neighbouring molecule
influences the tautomerization reaction in a given porphycene, with positive and 
negative cooperativity effects. Our results highlight the importance of
controlling the environment of molecules with atomic precision and demonstrate
the potential to regulate processes that occur in a single molecule.

The aromatic ene reaction.

Author information:

The ene reaction is a pericyclic process in which an alkene with an allylic
hydrogen atom (the ene donor) reacts with a second unsaturated species (the
enophile) to form a new product with a transposed π-bond. The aromatic ene
reaction, in which the alkene component is embedded in an aromatic ring, has only
been reported in a few (four) instances and has proceeded in low yield (≤6%).
Here, we show efficient aromatic ene reactions in which a thermally generated
aryne intermediate engages a pendant m-alkylarene substituent to produce a
dearomatized isotoluene, itself another versatile but rare reactive intermediate.
Our experiments were guided by computational studies that revealed structural
features conducive to the aromatic ene process. We proceeded to identify a
cascade comprising three reactions: (1) hexadehydro-Diels-Alder (for aryne
generation), (2) intramolecular aromatic ene and (3) bimolecular Alder ene. The
power of this cascade is evident from the structural complexity of the final
products, the considerable scope, and the overall efficiency of these multistage,
reagent- and by-product-free, single-pot transformations.

The human APOBEC3 proteins are a family of DNA-editing enzymes that play an
important role in the innate immune response against retroviruses and
retrotransposons. APOBEC3G is a member of this family that inhibits HIV-1
replication in the absence of the viral infectivity factor Vif. Inhibition of HIV
replication occurs by both deamination of viral single-stranded DNA and a
deamination-independent mechanism. Efficient deamination requires rapid binding
to and dissociation from ssDNA. However, a relatively slow dissociation rate is
required for the proposed deaminase-independent roadblock mechanism in which
APOBEC3G binds the viral template strand and blocks reverse
transcriptase-catalysed DNA elongation. Here, we show that APOBEC3G initially
binds ssDNA with rapid on-off rates and subsequently converts to a slowly
dissociating mode. In contrast, an oligomerization-deficient APOBEC3G mutant did 
not exhibit a slow off rate. We propose that catalytically active monomers or
dimers slowly oligomerize on the viral genome and inhibit reverse transcription.

There is currently great interest in the development of multistep catalytic
processes in which one or several catalysts act sequentially to rapidly build
complex molecular structures. Many enzymes--often the inspiration for new
synthetic transformations--are capable of processing a single substrate through a
chain of discrete, mechanistically distinct catalytic steps. Here, we describe an
approach to emulate the efficiency of these natural reaction cascades within a
synthetic catalyst by the temporal separation of catalytic activities. In this
approach, a single catalyst exhibits multiple catalytic activities sequentially, 
allowing for the efficient processing of a substrate through a cascade pathway.
Application of this design strategy has led to the development of a method to
effect the anti-Markovnikov (linear-selective) reductive functionalization of
terminal alkynes. The strategy of temporal separation may facilitate the
development of other efficient synthetic reaction cascades.

Simulations can provide tremendous insight into the atomistic details of
biological mechanisms, but micro- to millisecond timescales are historically only
accessible on dedicated supercomputers. We demonstrate that cloud computing is a 
viable alternative that brings long-timescale processes within reach of a broader
community. We used Google's Exacycle cloud-computing platform to simulate two
milliseconds of dynamics of a major drug target, the G-protein-coupled receptor
β2AR. Markov state models aggregate independent simulations into a single
statistical model that is validated by previous computational and experimental
results. Moreover, our models provide an atomistic description of the activation 
of a G-protein-coupled receptor and reveal multiple activation pathways. Agonists
and inverse agonists interact differentially with these pathways, with profound
implications for drug design.

Bacteria deploy a range of chemistries to regulate their behaviour and respond to
their environment. Quorum sensing is one method by which bacteria use chemical
reactions to modulate pre-infection behaviour such as surface attachment.
Polymers that can interfere with bacterial adhesion or the chemical reactions
used for quorum sensing are therefore a potential means to control bacterial
population responses. Here, we report how polymeric 'bacteria sequestrants',
designed to bind to bacteria through electrostatic interactions and therefore
inhibit bacterial adhesion to surfaces, induce the expression of
quorum-sensing-controlled phenotypes as a consequence of cell clustering. A
combination of polymer and analytical chemistry, biological assays and
computational modelling has been used to characterize the feedback between
bacteria clustering and quorum sensing signalling. We have also derived design
principles and chemical strategies for controlling bacterial behaviour at the
population level.

Rapid assembly of complex cyclopentanes employing chiral, α,β-unsaturated
acylammonium intermediates.

Liu G, Shirley ME, Van KN, McFarlin RL, Romo D.

With the intention of improving synthetic efficiency, organic chemists have
turned to bioinspired organocascade or domino processes that generate multiple
bonds and stereocentres in a single operation. However, despite the great
importance of substituted cyclopentanes, given their prevalence in complex
natural products and pharmaceutical agents, the rapid, enantioselective assembly 
of these carbocycles lags behind cyclohexanes. Here, we describe a
Michael-aldol-β-lactonization organocascade process for the synthesis of complex 
cyclopentanes utilizing chiral α,β-unsaturated acylammonium intermediates,
readily generated by activation of commodity unsaturated acid chlorides with
chiral isothiourea catalysts. This efficient methodology enables the construction
of two C-C bonds, one C-O bond, two rings and up to three contiguous stereogenic 
centres delivering complex cyclopentanes with high levels of relative and
absolute stereocontrol. Our results suggest that α,β-unsaturated acylammonium
intermediates have broad utility for the design of organocascade and
multicomponent processes, with the latter demonstrated by a
Michael-Michael-aldol-β-lactonization.

The ability to repair damage spontaneously, which is termed self-healing, is an
important survival feature in nature because it increases the lifetime of most
living creatures. This feature is highly desirable for rechargeable batteries
because the lifetime of high-capacity electrodes, such as silicon anodes, is
shortened by mechanical fractures generated during the cycling process. Here,
inspired by nature, we apply self-healing chemistry to silicon microparticle
(SiMP) anodes to overcome their short cycle-life. We show that anodes made from
low-cost SiMPs (~3-8 µm), for which stable deep galvanostatic cycling was
previously impossible, can now have an excellent cycle life when coated with a
self-healing polymer. We attain a cycle life ten times longer than state-of-art
anodes made from SiMPs and still retain a high capacity (up to ~3,000 mA h
g(-1)). Cracks and damage in the coating during cycling can be healed
spontaneously by the randomly branched hydrogen-bonding polymer used.

Mechanoresponsive polymers hold great technological potential in drug delivery,
'smart' optical systems and microelectromechanical systems. However, hysteresis
and fatigue (associated with large-scale polymer chain rearrangement) are often
problematic. Here, we describe a polyarylamide film that contains
s-dibenzocyclooctadiene (DBCOD), which can generate unconventional and completely
reversible thermal contraction under low-energy stimulation. The films exhibit a 
giant negative thermal expansion coefficient of approximately -1,200 ppm K(-1) at
ambient or near-ambient temperatures, much higher than any known
negative-thermal-expansion materials under similar operating conditions.
Mechanical characterization, calorimetry, spectroscopic analysis and
density-functional theory calculations all point to the conformational change of 
the DBCOD moiety, from the thermodynamic global energy minimum (twist-boat) to a 
local minimum (chair), as the origin of this abnormal thermal shrinkage. This
newly identified, low-energy-driven, thermally agile molecular subunit opens a
new pathway to creating near-infrared-based macromolecular switches and motors,
and for ambient thermal energy storage and conversion.

The design of larger architectures from smaller molecular building blocks by
element-element coupling reactions is one of the key concerns of synthetic
chemistry, so a number of strategies were developed for this bottom-up approach. 
A general scheme is the coupling of two elements with opposing polarity or that
of two radicals. Here, we show that a B-B coupling reaction is possible between
two boron analogues of the ethyl cation, resulting in the formation of an
unprecedented dicationic tetraborane. The bonding properties in the rhomboid B₄
core of the product can be described as two B-B units connected by three-centre, 
two-electron bonds, sharing the short diagonal. Our discovery might lead the way 
to the long sought-after boron chain polymers with a structure similar to the
silicon chains in β-SiB₃. Moreover, the reaction is a prime textbook example of
the influence of multiple-centre bonding on reactivity.

Many metal-containing compounds, and some metal-free compounds, will bind carbon 
monoxide. However, only a handful of metal-containing compounds have been shown
to induce the coupling of two or more CO molecules, potentially a method for the 
use of CO as a one-carbon-atom building block for the synthesis of organic
molecules. In this work, CO was added to a boron-boron triple bond at room
temperature and atmospheric pressure, resulting in a compound into which four
equivalents of CO are incorporated: a flat, bicyclic, bis(boralactone). By the
controlled addition of one CO to the diboryne compound, an intermediate in the CO
coupling reaction was isolated and structurally characterized. Electrochemical
measurements confirm the strongly reducing nature of the diboryne compound.

Singlet exciton fission, the spin-conserving process that produces two triplet
excited states from one photoexcited singlet state, is a means to circumvent the 
Shockley-Queisser limit in single-junction solar cells. Although the process
through which singlet fission occurs is not well characterized, some local order 
is thought to be necessary for intermolecular coupling. Here, we report a triplet
yield of 200% and triplet formation rates approaching the diffusion limit in
solutions of bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl (TIPS)) pentacene. We observe a
transient bound excimer intermediate, formed by the collision of one photoexcited
and one ground-state TIPS-pentacene molecule. The intermediate breaks up when the
two triplets separate to each TIPS-pentacene molecule. This efficient system is a
model for future singlet-fission materials and for disordered device components
that produce cascades of excited states from sunlight.

Mechanisms of molecular self-replication have the potential to shed light on the 
origins of life. In particular, self-replication through RNA-catalysed templated 
RNA synthesis is thought to have supported a primordial 'RNA world'. However,
existing polymerase ribozymes lack the capacity to synthesize RNAs approaching
their own size. Here, we report the in vitro evolution of such catalysts directly
in the RNA-stabilizing medium of water ice, which yielded RNA polymerase
ribozymes specifically adapted to sub-zero temperatures and able to synthesize
RNA in ices at temperatures as low as -19 °C. The combination of cold-adaptive
mutations with a previously described 5' extension operating at ambient
temperatures enabled the design of a first polymerase ribozyme capable of
catalysing the accurate synthesis of an RNA sequence longer than itself (adding
up to 206 nucleotides), an important stepping stone towards RNA self-replication.

The emergent properties that arise from self-assembly and molecular recognition
phenomena are a direct consequence of non-covalent interactions. Gas-phase
measurements and computational methods point to the dominance of dispersion
forces in molecular association, but solvent effects complicate the unambiguous
quantification of these forces in solution. Here, we have used synthetic
molecular balances to measure interactions between apolar alkyl chains in 31
organic, fluorous and aqueous solvent environments. The experimental interaction 
energies are an order of magnitude smaller than estimates of dispersion forces
between alkyl chains that have been derived from vaporization enthalpies and
dispersion-corrected calculations. Instead, it was found that cohesive
solvent-solvent interactions are the major driving force behind apolar
association in solution. The results suggest that theoretical models that
implicate important roles for dispersion forces in molecular recognition events
should be interpreted with caution in solvent-accessible systems.

Readily programmable chemical networks are important tools as the scope of
chemistry expands from individual molecules to larger molecular systems. Although
many complex systems are constructed using conventional organic and inorganic
chemistry, the programmability of biological molecules such as nucleic acids
allows for precise, high-throughput and automated design, as well as simple,
rapid and robust implementation. Here we show that systematic and quantitative
control over the diffusivity and reactivity of DNA molecules yields highly
programmable chemical reaction networks (CRNs) that execute at the macroscale. In
particular, we designed and implemented non-enzymatic DNA circuits capable of
performing pattern-transformation algorithms such as edge detection. We also
showed that it is possible to fine-tune and multiplex such circuits. We believe
these strategies will provide programmable platforms on which to prototype CRNs, 
discover bottom-up construction principles and generate patterns in materials.

In recent years, single-molecule and single-particle fluorescence microscopy has 
emerged as a tool to investigate chemical systems. After an initial lag of over a
decade with respect to biophysical studies, this powerful imaging technique is
now revealing mechanisms of 'classical' organic reactions, spatial distribution
of chemical reactivity on surfaces and the phase of active catalysts. The recent 
advance into commercial imaging systems obviates the need for home-built laser
systems and thus opens this technique to traditionally trained synthetic
chemists. We discuss the requisite photophysical and chemical properties of
fluorescent reporters and highlight the main challenges in applying
single-molecule techniques to chemical questions. The goal of this Perspective is
to provide a snapshot of an emerging multidisciplinary field and to encourage
broader use of this young experimental approach that aids the observation of
chemical reactions as depicted in many textbooks: molecule by molecule.

Vitamins are hypothesized to be relics of an RNA world, and were probably
participants in RNA-mediated primordial metabolism. If catalytic RNAs, or
ribozymes, could harness vitamin cofactors to aid their function in a manner
similar to protein enzymes, it would enable them to catalyse a much larger set of
chemical reactions. The cofactor thiamin diphosphate, a derivative of vitamin B1 
(thiamin), is used by enzymes to catalyse difficult metabolic reactions,
including decarboxylation of stable α-keto acids such as pyruvate. Here, we
report a ribozyme that uses free thiamin to decarboxylate a pyruvate-based
suicide substrate (LnkPB). Thiamin conjugated to biotin was used to isolate
catalytic individuals from a pool of random-sequence RNAs attached to LnkPB.
Analysis of a stable guanosine adduct obtained via digestion of an RNA sequence
(clone dc4) showed the expected decarboxylation product. The discovery of a
prototypic thiamin-utilizing ribozyme has implications for the role of RNA in
orchestrating early metabolic cycles.

Conjugated polymers offer potential for many diverse applications, but we still
lack a fundamental microscopic understanding of their electronic structure.
Elementary photoexcitations (excitons) span only a few nanometres of a molecule, 
which itself can extend over microns, and how their behaviour is affected by
molecular dimensions is not immediately obvious. For example, where is the
exciton formed within a conjugated segment and is it always situated on the same 
repeat units? Here, we introduce structurally rigid molecular spoked wheels, 6 nm
in diameter, as a model of extended π conjugation. Single-molecule fluorescence
reveals random exciton localization, which leads to temporally varying emission
polarization. Initially, this random localization arises after every photon
absorption event because of temperature-independent spontaneous symmetry
breaking. These fast fluctuations are slowed to millisecond timescales after
prolonged illumination. Intramolecular heterogeneity is revealed in cryogenic
spectroscopy by jumps in transition energy, but emission polarization can also
switch without a spectral jump occurring, which implies long-range homogeneity in
the local dielectric environment.

Eukaryotic subcellular membrane systems, such as the nuclear envelope or
endoplasmic reticulum, present a rich array of architecturally and
compositionally complex supramolecular targets that are as yet inaccessible. Here
we describe layer-by-layer phospholipid membrane assembly on microfluidic
droplets, a route to structures with defined compositional asymmetry and
lamellarity. Starting with phospholipid-stabilized water-in-oil droplets trapped 
in a static droplet array, lipid monolayer deposition proceeds as oil/water-phase
boundaries pass over the droplets. Unilamellar vesicles assembled layer-by-layer 
support functional insertion both of purified and of in situ expressed membrane
proteins. Synthesis and chemical probing of asymmetric unilamellar and
double-bilayer vesicles demonstrate the programmability of both membrane
lamellarity and lipid-leaflet composition during assembly. The immobilized
vesicle arrays are a pragmatic experimental platform for biophysical studies of
membranes and their associated proteins, particularly complexes that assemble and
function in multilamellar contexts in vivo.

Solvents can significantly alter the rates and selectivity of liquid-phase
organic reactions, often hindering the development of new synthetic routes or, if
chosen wisely, facilitating routes by improving rates and selectivities. To
address this challenge, a systematic methodology is proposed that quickly
identifies improved reaction solvents by combining quantum mechanical
computations of the reaction rate constant in a few solvents with a
computer-aided molecular design (CAMD) procedure. The approach allows the
identification of a high-performance solvent within a very large set of possible 
molecules. The validity of our CAMD approach is demonstrated through application 
to a classical nucleophilic substitution reaction for the study of solvent
effects, the Menschutkin reaction. The results were validated successfully by in 
situ kinetic experiments. A space of 1,341 solvents was explored in silico, but
required quantum-mechanical calculations of the rate constant in only nine
solvents, and uncovered a solvent that increases the rate constant by 40%.

In processive catalysis, a catalyst binds to a substrate and remains bound as it 
performs several consecutive reactions, as exemplified by DNA polymerases.
Processivity is essential in nature and is often mediated by a clamp-like
structure that physically tethers the catalyst to its (polymeric) template. In
the case of the bacteriophage T4 replisome, a dedicated clamp protein acts as a
processivity mediator by encircling DNA and subsequently recruiting its
polymerase. Here we use this DNA-binding protein to construct a biohybrid
catalyst. Conjugation of the clamp protein to a chemical catalyst with
sequence-specific oxidation behaviour formed a catalytic clamp that can be loaded
onto a DNA plasmid. The catalytic activity of the biohybrid catalyst was
visualized using a procedure based on an atomic force microscopy method that
detects and spatially locates oxidized sites in DNA. Varying the experimental
conditions enabled switching between processive and distributive catalysis and
influencing the sliding direction of this rotaxane-like catalyst.

Molecules labelled with the unnatural isotope fluorine-18 are used for positron
emission tomography. Currently, this molecular imaging technology is not
exploited at its full potential because many (18)F-labelled probes are
inaccessible or notoriously difficult to produce. Typical challenges associated
with (18)F radiochemistry are the short half-life of (18)F (<2 h), the use of
sub-stoichiometric amounts of (18)F, relative to the precursor and other
reagents, as well as the limited availability of parent (18)F sources of suitable
reactivity ([(18)F]F(-) and [(18)F]F2). There is a high-priority demand for
general methods allowing access to [(18)F]CF3-substituted molecules for
application in pharmaceutical discovery programmes. We report the development of 
a process for the late-stage [(18)F]trifluoromethylation of (hetero)arenes from
[(18)F]fluoride using commercially available reagents and (hetero)aryl iodides.
This [(18)F]CuCF3-based protocol benefits from a large substrate scope and is
characterized by its operational simplicity.

The ability of liquid water to dissipate energy efficiently through ultrafast
vibrational relaxation plays a key role in the stabilization of reactive
intermediates and the outcome of aqueous chemical reactions. The vibrational
couplings that govern energy relaxation in H2O remain difficult to characterize
because of the limitations of current methods to visualize inter- and
intramolecular motions simultaneously. Using a new sub-70 fs broadband
mid-infrared source, we performed two-dimensional infrared, transient absorption 
and polarization anisotropy spectroscopy of H2O by exciting the OH stretching
transition and characterizing the response from 1,350 cm(-1) to 4,000 cm(-1).
These spectra reveal vibrational transitions at all frequencies simultaneous to
the excitation, including pronounced cross-peaks to the bend vibration and a
continuum of induced absorptions to combination bands that are not present in
linear spectra. These observations provide evidence for strong mixing of inter-
and intramolecular vibrations in liquid H2O, and illustrate the shortcomings of
traditional relaxation models.

The mechanical behaviour of molecular machines differs greatly from that of their
macroscopic counterparts. This applies particularly when considering concepts
such as friction and lubrication, which are key to optimizing the operation of
macroscopic machinery. Here, using time-resolved vibrational spectroscopy and
NMR-lineshape analysis, we show that for molecular machinery consisting of
hydrogen-bonded components the relative motion of the components is accelerated
strongly by adding small amounts of water. The translation of a macrocycle along 
a thread and the rotation of a molecular wheel around an axle both accelerate
significantly on the addition of water, whereas other protic liquids have much
weaker or opposite effects. We tentatively assign the superior accelerating
effect of water to its ability to form a three-dimensional hydrogen-bond network 
between the moving parts of the molecular machine. These results may indicate a
more general phenomenon that helps explain the function of water as the
'lubricant of life'.

Bacterial resistance is a major problem in the modern world, stemming in part
from the build-up of antibiotics in the environment. Novel molecular approaches
that enable an externally triggered increase in antibiotic activity with high
spatiotemporal resolution and auto-inactivation are highly desirable. Here we
report a responsive, broad-spectrum, antibacterial agent that can be temporally
activated with light, whereupon it auto-inactivates on the scale of hours. The
use of such a 'smart' antibiotic might prevent the build-up of active
antimicrobial material in the environment. Reversible optical control over active
drug concentration enables us to obtain pharmacodynamic information. Precisely
localized control of activity is achieved, allowing the growth of bacteria to be 
confined to defined patterns, which has potential for the development of
treatments that avoid interference with the endogenous microbial population in
other parts of the organism.

Surfaces decorated with uniformly dispersed catalytically active nanoparticles
play a key role in many fields, including renewable energy and catalysis.
Typically, these structures are prepared by deposition techniques, but
alternatively they could be made by growing the nanoparticles in situ directly
from the (porous) backbone support. Here we demonstrate that growing nano-size
phases from perovskites can be controlled through judicious choice of
composition, particularly by tuning deviations from the ideal ABO3 stoichiometry.
This non-stoichiometry facilitates a change in equilibrium position to make
particle exsolution much more dynamic, enabling the preparation of
compositionally diverse nanoparticles (that is, metallic, oxides or mixtures) and
seems to afford unprecedented control over particle size, distribution and
surface anchorage. The phenomenon is also shown to be influenced strongly by
surface reorganization characteristics. The concept exemplified here may serve in
the design and development of more sophisticated oxide materials with advanced
functionality across a range of possible domains of application.

The past two decades have seen far-reaching progress in the development of
microfluidic systems for use in the chemical and biological sciences. Here we
assess the utility of microfluidic reactor technology as a tool in chemical
synthesis in both academic research and industrial applications. We highlight the
successes and failures of past research in the field and provide a catalogue of
chemistries performed in a microfluidic reactor. We then assess the current
roadblocks hindering the widespread use of microfluidic reactors from the
perspectives of both synthetic chemistry and industrial application. Finally, we 
set out seven challenges that we hope will inspire future research in this field.

The trioxacarcins are polyoxygenated, structurally complex natural products that 
potently inhibit the growth of cultured human cancer cells. Here we describe
syntheses of trioxacarcin A, DC-45-A1 and structural analogues by late-stage
stereoselective glycosylation reactions of fully functionalized, differentially
protected aglycon substrates. Key issues addressed in this work include the
identification of an appropriate means to activate and protect each of the two
2-deoxysugar components, trioxacarcinose A and trioxacarcinose B, as well as a
viable sequencing of the glycosidic couplings. The convergent, component-based
sequence we present allows for rapid construction of structurally diverse,
synthetic analogues that would be inaccessible by any other means, in amounts
required to support biological evaluation. Analogues that arise from the
modification of four of five modular components are assembled in 11 steps or
fewer. The majority of these are found to be active in antiproliferative assays
using cultured human cancer cells.

Although fullerenes were discovered nearly three decades ago, the mechanism of
their formation remains a mystery. Many versions of the classic 'bottom-up'
formation mechanism have been advanced, starting with C2 units that build up to
form chains and rings of carbon atoms and ultimately form those well-known
isolated fullerenes (for example, I(h)-C60). In recent years, evidence from
laboratory and interstellar observations has emerged to suggest a 'top-down'
mechanism, whereby small isolated fullerenes are formed via shrinkage of giant
fullerenes generated from graphene sheets. Here, we present molecular structural 
evidence for this top-down mechanism based on metal carbide metallofullerenes
M2C2@C1(51383)-C84 (M = Y, Gd). We propose that the unique asymmetric
C1(51383)-C84 cage with destabilizing fused pentagons is a preserved 'missing
link' in the top-down mechanism, and in well-established rearrangement steps can 
form many well-known, high-symmetry fullerene structures that account for the
majority of solvent-extractable metallofullerenes.

In organic chemistry, compounds with adjacent alkene and carbene functionalities 
(vinyl carbenes) are studied widely as fleeting intermediates and in the
coordination sphere of transition metals. Stable derivatives of vinyl carbenes
remain elusive, including the corresponding heavier group 14 homologues. Here we 
report the isolation and full characterization of a base-stabilized silicon
version of a vinyl carbene that features a silicon-silicon double bond as well as
a silylene functionality, coordinated by an N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC). In
solution, the intensely green disilenyl silylene adduct exists in equilibrium
with the corresponding silicon analogue of a cyclopropene and free NHC, which was
quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and ultraviolet-visible
spectroscopy. The reversibility of this process raises exciting possibilities for
the preparation of extended conjugated π systems of silicon.

Nature uses a combination of non-covalent interactions to create a hierarchy of
complex systems from simple building blocks. One example is the selective
association of the hydrophobic side chains that are a strong determinant of
protein organization. Here, we report a parallel mode of assembly in DNA
nanotechnology. Dendritic alkyl-DNA conjugates are hybridized to the edges of a
DNA cube. When four amphiphiles are on one face, the hydrophobic residues of two 
neighbouring cubes engage in an intermolecular 'handshake', resulting in a dimer.
When there are eight amphiphiles (four on the top and bottom cube faces,
respectively), they engage in an intramolecular 'handshake' inside the cube. This
forms the first example of a monodisperse micelle within a DNA nanostructure that
encapsulates small molecules and releases them by DNA recognition. Creating a
three-dimensional pattern of hydrophobic patches, like side chains in proteins,
can result in specific, directed association of hydrophobic domains with
orthogonal interactions to DNA base-pairing.

A prerequisite for successful screening campaigns in drug discovery or chemical
genetics is the availability of structurally and thus functionally diverse
compound libraries. Diversity-oriented synthesis (DOS) provides strategies for
the generation of such libraries, of which the build/couple/pair (B/C/P)
algorithm is the most frequently used. We have developed an advanced B/C/P
strategy that incorporates multidimensional coupling. In this approach,
structural diversity is not only defined by the nature of the building blocks
employed, but also by the linking motif installed during the coupling reaction.
We applied this step-efficient approach in a DOS of a library that consisted of
73 macrocyclic compounds based around 59 discrete scaffolds. The macrocycles
prepared cover a broad range of different molecular shapes, as illustrated by
principal moment-of-inertia analysis. This demonstrates the capability of the
advanced B/C/P strategy using multidimensional coupling for the preparation of
structurally diverse compound collections.

The long-range communication of information, exemplified by signal transduction
through membrane-bound receptors, is a central biochemical function. Reversible
binding of a messenger ligand induces a local conformational change that is
relayed through the receptor, inducing a chemical effect typically several
nanometres from the binding site. We report a synthetic receptor mimic that
transmits structural information from a boron-based ligand binding site to a
spectroscopic reporter located more than 2 nm away. Reversible binding of a diol 
ligand to the N-terminal binding site induces a screw-sense preference in a
helical oligo(aminoisobutyric acid) foldamer, which is relayed to a reporter
group at the remote C-terminus, communicating information about the structure and
stereochemistry of the ligand. The reversible nature of boronate esterification
was exploited to switch the receptor sequentially between left- and right-handed 
helices, while the exquisite conformational sensitivity of the helical relay
allowed the reporter to differentiate even between purine and pyrimidine
nucleosides as ligands.

The periodicity of the elements and the non-reactivity of the inner-shell
electrons are two related principles of chemistry, rooted in the atomic shell
structure. Within compounds, Group I elements, for example, invariably assume the
+1 oxidation state, and their chemical properties differ completely from those of
the p-block elements. These general rules govern our understanding of chemical
structures and reactions. Here, first-principles calculations show that, under
pressure, caesium atoms can share their 5p electrons to become formally oxidized 
beyond the +1 state. In the presence of fluorine and under pressure, the
formation of CsF(n) (n > 1) compounds containing neutral or ionic molecules is
predicted. Their geometry and bonding resemble that of isoelectronic XeF(n)
molecules, showing a caesium atom that behaves chemically like a p-block element 
under these conditions. The calculated stability of the CsF(n) compounds shows
that the inner-shell electrons can become the main components of chemical bonds.

Semiconducting carbon nanotubes promise a broad range of potential applications
in optoelectronics and imaging, but their photon-conversion efficiency is
relatively low. Quantum theory suggests that nanotube photoluminescence is
intrinsically inefficient because of low-lying 'dark' exciton states. Here we
demonstrate the significant brightening of nanotube photoluminescence (up to
28-fold) through the creation of an optically allowed defect state that resides
below the predicted energy level of the dark excitons. Emission from this new
state generates a photoluminescence peak that is red-shifted by as much as 254
meV from the nanotube's original excitonic transition. We also found that the
attachment of electron-withdrawing substituents to carbon nanotubes
systematically drives this defect state further down the energy ladder. Our
experiments show that the material's photoluminescence quantum yield increases
exponentially as a function of the shifted emission energy. This work lays the
foundation for chemical control of defect quantum states in low-dimensional
carbon materials.

The activation of the α-carbons of carboxylic esters and related carbonyl
compounds to generate enolate equivalents as nucleophiles is one of the most
powerful strategies in organic synthesis. We reasoned that the horizons of
chemical synthesis could be greatly expanded if the typically inert β-carbons of 
saturated esters could be used as nucleophiles. However, despite the rather
significant fundamental and practical values, direct use of the β-carbons of
saturated carbonyl compounds as nucleophiles remains elusive. Here we report the 
catalytic activation of simple saturated ester β-carbons as nucleophiles
(β-carbon activation) using N-heterocyclic carbene organocatalysts. The
catalytically generated nucleophilic β-carbons undergo enantioselective reactions
with electrophiles such as enones and imines. Given the proven rich chemistry of 
ester α-carbons, we expect this catalytic activation mode for saturated ester
β-carbons to open a valuable new arena for new and useful reactions and synthetic
strategies.

An emerging strategy for making ordered materials is modular construction, which 
connects preformed molecular subunits to neighbours through interactions of
properly selected reactive sites. This strategy has yielded remarkable materials,
including metal-organic frameworks joined by coordinative bonds, supramolecular
networks linked by strong non-covalent interactions, and covalent organic
frameworks in which atoms of carbon and other light elements are bonded
covalently. However, the strategy has not yet produced covalently bonded organic 
materials in the form of large single crystals. Here we show that such materials 
can result from reversible self-addition polymerizations of suitably designed
monomers. In particular, monomers with four tetrahedrally oriented nitroso groups
polymerize to form diamondoid azodioxy networks that can be fully characterized
by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. This work forges a strong new link between
polymer science and supramolecular chemistry by showing how predictably ordered
covalent or non-covalent structures can both be built using a single modular
strategy.

Catalytic reactions that enable the formation of new bonds to carbon centres play
a pervasive role in the state-of-the-art synthesis of organic molecules and
macromolecules. In contrast, the development of analogous processes as routes to 
main group compounds and materials has been much slower. Nevertheless, recent
advances have led to a broad expansion of this field and now allow access to a
wide range of catenated structures based on elements across the p block. These
breakthroughs have already impacted areas such as hydrogen storage and transfer, 
functional inorganic polymers and ceramic thin films. Dehydrogenation and
dehydrocoupling processes are particularly well developed and may be mediated by 
either transition metal or main group catalysts. Such pathways represent an
increasingly attractive and convenient alternative to traditional routes, such as
salt metathesis and reductive coupling reactions. An overview of this emerging
area is presented in this Review with a focus on recent developments and future
challenges.

On the cooperative formation of non-hydrogen-bonded water at molecular
hydrophobic interfaces.

The unique structural, dynamical and chemical properties of air/water and
oil/water interfaces are thought to play a key role in various biological,
geological and environmental processes. For example, non-hydrogen-bonded
('dangling') OH groups--which create surface defects in water's hydrogen bonding 
network and are experimentally detected at both macroscopic (air/water or
oil/water) and microscopic (dissolved hydrophobic molecule) interfaces--are
thought to catalyse some chemical reactions. However, how the size, curvature or 
charge of the exposed hydrophobic surface influences water's propensity to form
dangling OH defects has not yet been established quantitatively. Here we use
Raman multivariate curve resolution to probe spectroscopically the hydrophobic
hydration shell and, using a statistical multisite analysis, we show that such
interfacial dangling OH structures are entropically stabilized and their
formation is cooperative (the probability that a non-hydrogen-bonded OH group
will form depends nonlinearly on the hydrophobic surface area). We thus expose an
important difference between the chemical properties of molecular and macroscopic
oil/water interfaces.

Carbohydrates and natural products serve essential roles in nature, and also
provide core scaffolds for pharmaceutical agents and vaccines. However, the
inherent complexity of these molecules imposes significant synthetic hurdles for 
their selective functionalization and derivatization. Nature has, in part,
addressed these issues by employing enzymes that are able to orient and activate 
substrates within a chiral pocket, which increases dramatically both the rate and
selectivity of organic transformations. In this article we show that similar
proximity effects can be utilized in the context of synthetic catalysts to
achieve general and predictable site-selective functionalization of complex
molecules. Unlike enzymes, our catalysts apply a single reversible covalent bond 
to recognize and bind to specific functional group displays within substrates. By
combining this unique binding selectivity and asymmetric catalysis, we are able
to modify the less reactive axial positions within monosaccharides and natural
products.

Conditionally fluorescent molecular probes for detecting single base changes in
double-stranded DNA.

Small variations in nucleic acid sequences can have far-reaching phenotypic
consequences. Reliably distinguishing closely related sequences is therefore
important for research and clinical applications. Here, we demonstrate that
conditionally fluorescent DNA probes are capable of distinguishing variations of 
a single base in a stretch of target DNA. These probes use a novel programmable
mechanism in which each single nucleotide polymorphism generates two
thermodynamically destabilizing mismatch bubbles rather than the single mismatch 
formed during typical hybridization-based assays. Up to a 12,000-fold excess of a
target that contains a single nucleotide polymorphism is required to generate the
same fluorescence as one equivalent of the intended target, and detection works
reliably over a wide range of conditions. Using these probes we detected point
mutations in a 198 base-pair subsequence of the Escherichia coli rpoB gene. That 
our probes are constructed from multiple oligonucleotides circumvents synthesis
limitations and enables long continuous DNA sequences to be probed.

The catalytic activity of gold depends on particle size, with the reactivity
increasing as the particle diameter decreases. However, investigations into
behaviour in the subnanometre regime (where gold exists as small clusters of a
few atoms) began only recently with advances in synthesis and characterization
techniques. Here we report an easy method to prepare isolated gold atoms
supported on functionalized carbon nanotubes and their performance in the
oxidation of thiophenol with O2. We show that single gold atoms are not active,
but they aggregate under reaction conditions into gold clusters of low atomicity 
that exhibit a catalytic activity comparable to that of sulfhydryl oxidase
enzymes. When clusters grow into larger nanoparticles, catalyst activity drops to
zero. Theoretical calculations show that gold clusters are able to activate
thiophenol and O2 simultaneously, and larger nanoparticles are passivated by
strongly adsorbed thiolates. The combination of both reactants activation and
facile product desorption makes gold clusters excellent catalysts.

Enantioselective silyl protection of alcohols promoted by a combination of chiral

Catalytic enantioselective monosilylations of diols and polyols furnish valuable 
alcohol-containing molecules in high enantiomeric purity. These transformations, 
however, require high catalyst loadings (20-30 mol%) and long reaction times (2-5
days). Here, we report that a counterintuitive strategy involving the use of an
achiral co-catalyst structurally similar to the chiral catalyst provides an
effective solution to this problem. A combination of seemingly competitive Lewis 
basic molecules can function in concert such that one serves as an achiral
nucleophilic promoter and the other performs as a chiral Brønsted base. On the
addition of 7.5-20 mol% of a commercially available N-heterocycle
(5-ethylthiotetrazole), reactions typically proceed within one hour, and deliver 
the desired products in high yields and enantiomeric ratios. In some instances,
there is no reaction in the absence of the achiral base, yet the presence of the 
achiral co-catalyst gives rise to facile formation of products in high
enantiomeric purity.

Sub-ångström-resolution crystallography reveals physical distortions that enhance

It is recognized widely that enzymes promote reactions by providing a pathway
that proceeds through a transition state of lower energy. In principle, further
rate enhancements could be achieved if intermediates are prevented from relaxing 
to their lowest energy state, and thereby reduce the barrier to the subsequent
transition state. Here, we report sub-ångström-resolution crystal structures of
genuine covalent reaction intermediates of transketolase. These structures reveal
a pronounced out-of-plane distortion of over 20° for the covalent bond that links
cofactor and substrate, and a specific elongation of the scissile substrate
carbon-carbon bond (d > 1.6 Å). To achieve these distortions, the protein's
conformation appears to prevent relaxation of a substrate-cofactor intermediate. 
The results implicate a reduced barrier to the subsequent step that is consistent
with an intermediate of raised energy and leads to a more efficient overall
process.

Mechanochemical strengthening of a synthetic polymer in response to typically

High shear stresses are known to trigger destructive bond-scission reactions in
polymers. Recent work has shown that the same shear forces can be used to
accelerate non-destructive reactions in mechanophores along polymer backbones,
and it is demonstrated here that such mechanochemical reactions can be used to
strengthen a polymer subjected to otherwise destructive shear forces.
Polybutadiene was functionalized with dibromocyclopropane mechanophores, whose
mechanical activation generates allylic bromides that are crosslinked in situ by 
nucleophilic substitution reactions with carboxylates. The crosslinking is
activated efficiently by shear forces both in solvated systems and in bulk
materials, and the resulting covalent polymer networks possess moduli that are
orders-of-magnitude greater than those of the unactivated polymers. These
molecular-level responses and their impact on polymer properties have
implications for the design of materials that, like biological materials,
actively remodel locally as a function of their physical environment.

Photochemical activity of a key donor-acceptor complex can drive stereoselective

Asymmetric catalytic variants of sunlight-driven photochemical processes hold
extraordinary potential for the sustainable preparation of chiral molecules.
However, the involvement of short-lived electronically excited states inherent to
any photochemical reaction makes it challenging for a chiral catalyst to dictate 
the stereochemistry of the products. Here, we report that readily available
chiral organic catalysts, with well-known utility in thermal asymmetric
processes, can also confer a high level of stereocontrol in synthetically
relevant intermolecular carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions driven by visible
light. A unique mechanism of catalysis is proposed, wherein the catalyst is
involved actively in both the photochemical activation of the substrates (by
inducing the transient formation of chiral electron donor-acceptor complexes) and
the stereoselectivity-defining event. We use this approach to enable
transformations that are extremely difficult under thermal conditions, such as
the asymmetric α-alkylation of aldehydes with alkyl halides, the formation of
all-carbon quaternary stereocentres and the control of remote stereochemistry.

Understanding the abundances of molecules in dense interstellar clouds requires
knowledge of the rates of gas-phase reactions between uncharged species. However,
because of the low temperatures within these clouds, reactions with an activation
barrier were considered too slow to play an important role. Here we show that,
despite the presence of a barrier, the rate coefficient for the reaction between 
the hydroxyl radical (OH) and methanol--one of the most abundant organic
molecules in space--is almost two orders of magnitude larger at 63 K than
previously measured at ∼200 K. We also observe the formation of the methoxy
radical product, which was recently detected in space. These results are
interpreted by the formation of a hydrogen-bonded complex that is sufficiently
long-lived to undergo quantum-mechanical tunnelling to form products. We
postulate that this tunnelling mechanism for the oxidation of organic molecules
by OH is widespread in low-temperature interstellar environments.

Graphite, the most stable form of elemental carbon, consists of pure carbon
sheets stacked upon one another like reams of paper. Individual sheets, known as 
graphene, prefer planar geometries as a consequence of the hexagonal
honeycomb-like arrangements of trigonal carbon atoms that comprise their
two-dimensional networks. Defects in the form of non-hexagonal rings in such
networks cause distortions away from planarity. Herein we report an extreme
example of this phenomenon. A 26-ring C80H30 nanographene that incorporates five 
seven-membered rings and one five-membered ring embedded in a hexagonal lattice
was synthesized by stepwise chemical methods, isolated, purified and fully
characterized spectroscopically. Its grossly warped structure was revealed by

Frustrated Lewis pairs are compounds containing both Lewis acidic and Lewis basic
moieties, where the formation of an adduct is prevented by steric hindrance. They
are therefore highly reactive, and have been shown to be capable of heterolysis
of molecular hydrogen, a property that has led to their use in hydrogenation
reactions of polarized multiple bonds. Here, we describe a general approach to
the hydrogenation of alkynes to cis-alkenes under mild conditions using the
unique ansa-aminohydroborane as a catalyst. Our approach combines several
reactions as the elementary steps of the catalytic cycle: hydroboration
(substrate binding), heterolytic hydrogen splitting (typical
frustrated-Lewis-pair reactivity) and facile intramolecular protodeborylation
(product release). The mechanism is verified by experimental and computational
studies.

Ultrafast above-threshold dynamics of the radical anion of a prototypical quinone
electron-acceptor.

Quinones feature prominently as electron acceptors in nature. Their
electron-transfer reactions are often highly exergonic, for which Marcus theory
predicts reduced electron-transfer rates because of a free-energy barrier that
occurs in the inverted region. However, the electron-transfer kinetics that
involve quinones can appear barrierless. Here, we consider the intrinsic
properties of the para-benzoquinone radical anion, which serves as the
prototypical electron-transfer reaction product involving a quinone-based
acceptor. Using time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and ab initio
calculations, we show that excitation at 400 and 480 nm yields excited states
that are unbound with respect to electron loss. These excited states are shown to
decay on a sub-40 fs timescale through a series of conical intersections with
lower-lying excited states, ultimately to form the ground anionic state and avoid
autodetachment. From an isolated electron-acceptor perspective, this ultrafast
stabilization mechanism accounts for the ability of para-benzoquinone to capture 
and retain electrons.

Since the discovery of crown ethers, macrocycles have been recognized as powerful
platforms for supramolecular chemistry. Although their numbers and variations are
now legion, macrocycles that are simple to make using high-yielding reactions in 
one pot and on the multigram scale are rare. Here we present such a discovery
obtained during the creation of a C5-symmetric cyanostilbene 'campestarene'
macrocycle, cyanostar, that employs Knoevenagel condensations in the preparation 
of its cyanostilbene repeat unit. In the solid state, cyanostars form π-stacked
dimers constituted of chiral P and M enantiomers. The electropositive central
cavity stabilizes anions with CH hydrogen-bonding units that are activated by
electron-withdrawing cyano groups. In solution, the cyanostar shows high-affinity
binding as 2:1 sandwich complexes, log β2 ≈ 12 and ΔG ≈ -70 kJ mol(-1), of large 
anions (BF4(-), ClO4(-) and PF6(-)) usually considered weakly coordinating. The
cyanostar's size preference allowed formation of an unprecedented [3]rotaxane
templated around a dialkylphosphate.

Anti-aromatic compounds, as well as small cyclic alkynes or carbynes, are
particularly challenging synthetic goals. The combination of their destabilizing 
features hinders attempts to prepare molecules such as pentalyne, an 8π-electron 
anti-aromatic bicycle with extremely high ring strain. Here we describe the
facile synthesis of osmapentalyne derivatives that are thermally viable, despite 
containing the smallest angles observed so far at a carbyne carbon. The compounds
are characterized using X-ray crystallography, and their computed energies and
magnetic properties reveal aromatic character. Hence, the incorporation of the
osmium centre not only reduces the ring strain of the parent pentalyne, but also 
converts its Hückel anti-aromaticity into Craig-type Möbius aromaticity in the
metallapentalynes. The concept of aromaticity is thus extended to five-membered
rings containing a metal-carbon triple bond. Moreover, these metal-aromatic
compounds exhibit unusual optical effects such as near-infrared photoluminescence
with particularly large Stokes shifts, long lifetimes and aggregation
enhancement.

Single-molecule fluorescence techniques have emerged as a powerful approach to
understanding complex biological systems. However, a challenge researchers still 
face is the limited photostability of nearly all organic fluorophores, including 
the cyanine and Alexa dyes. We report a new, monovalent probe that emits in the
far-red region of the visible spectrum with properties desirable for
single-molecule optical imaging. This probe is based on a ring-fused
boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) core that is conjugated to a polyglycerol dendrimer
(PGD). The dendrimer makes the hydrophobic fluorophore water-soluble. This probe 
exhibits excellent brightness, with an emission maximum of 705 nm. We have
observed strikingly long and stable emission from individual PGD-BODIPY probes,
even in the absence of anti-fading agents such as Trolox, a combined
oxidizing-reducing agent often used in single-molecule studies for improving the 
photostability of common imaging probes. These interesting properties greatly
simplify use of the fluorophore.

The Janus-faced role of external forces in mechanochemical disulfide bond
cleavage.

Recent force microscopy measurements on the mechanically activated cleavage of a 
protein disulfide bond through reaction with hydroxide ions revealed that for
forces greater than 0.5 nN, the acceleration of the reaction rate is
substantially reduced. Here, using ab initio simulations, we trace this
'reactivity switch' back to a dual role played by the mechanical force, which
leads to antagonistic effects. On the one hand, the force performs work on the
system, and thereby accelerates the reaction. On the other hand, the force also
induces a conformational distortion that involves the S-S-C-C dihedral angle,
which drives the disulfide into a conformation that is shielded against
nucleophilic attack because of steric hindrance. The discovery of force-induced
conformational changes that steer chemical reactivity provides a new key concept 
that is expected to be relevant beyond this specific case, for example in
understanding how 'disulfide switches' regulate protein function and for the
rational design of mechanoresponsive materials.

The Daphniphyllum alkaloids are a large class of natural products isolated from a
genus of evergreen plants widely used in Chinese herbal medicine. They display a 
remarkable range of biological activities, including anticancer, antioxidant, and
vasorelaxation properties as well as elevation of nerve growth factor.
Daphenylline is a structurally unique member among the predominately aliphatic
Daphniphyllum alkaloids, and contains a tetrasubstituted arene moiety mounted on 
a sterically compact hexacyclic scaffold. Herein, we describe the first total
synthesis of daphenylline. A gold-catalysed 6-exo-dig cyclization reaction and a 
subsequent intramolecular Michael addition reaction, inspired by Dixon's seminal 
work, were exploited to construct the bridged 6,6,5-tricyclic motif of the
natural product at an early stage, and the aromatic moiety was forged through a
photoinduced olefin isomerization/6π-electrocyclization cascade followed by an
oxidative aromatization process.

Single-molecule magnets are compounds that exhibit magnetic bistability caused by
an energy barrier for the reversal of magnetization (relaxation). Lanthanide
compounds are proving promising as single-molecule magnets: recent studies show
that terbium phthalocyanine complexes possess large energy barriers, and
dysprosium and terbium complexes bridged by an N2(3-) radical ligand exhibit
magnetic hysteresis up to 13 K. Magnetic relaxation is typically controlled by
single-ion factors rather than magnetic exchange (whether one or more 4f ions are
present) and proceeds through thermal relaxation of the lowest excited states.
Here we report polylanthanide alkoxide cage complexes, and their doped
diamagnetic yttrium analogues, in which competing relaxation pathways are
observed and relaxation through the first excited state can be quenched. This
leads to energy barriers for relaxation of magnetization that exceed 800 K. We
investigated the factors at the lanthanide sites that govern this behaviour.

Catalytic carbon-carbon bond formation based on cross-coupling reactions plays a 
central role in the production of natural products, pharmaceuticals,
agrochemicals and organic materials. Coupling reactions of a variety of
organometallic reagents and organic halides have changed the face of modern
synthetic chemistry. However, the high reactivity and poor selectivity of common 
organolithium reagents have largely prohibited their use as a viable partner in
direct catalytic cross-coupling. Here we report that in the presence of a
Pd-phosphine catalyst, a wide range of alkyl-, aryl- and heteroaryl-lithium
reagents undergo selective cross-coupling with aryl- and alkenyl-bromides. The
process proceeds quickly under mild conditions (room temperature) and avoids the 
notorious lithium halogen exchange and homocoupling. The preparation of key
alkyl-, aryl- and heterobiaryl intermediates reported here highlights the
potential of these cross-coupling reactions for medicinal chemistry and material 
science.

It is a long-standing goal to understand the reaction mechanisms of catalytic
metalloenzymes at an entangled many-electron level, but this is hampered by the
exponential complexity of quantum mechanics. Here, by exploiting the special
structure of physical quantum states and using the density matrix renormalization
group, we compute near-exact many-electron wavefunctions of the Mn4CaO5 cluster
of photosystem II, with more than 1 × 10(18) quantum degrees of freedom. This is 
the first treatment of photosystem II beyond the single-electron picture of
density functional theory. Our calculations support recent modifications to the
structure determined by X-ray crystallography. We further identify multiple
low-lying energy surfaces associated with the structural distortion seen using
X-ray crystallography, highlighting multistate reactivity in the chemistry of the
cluster. Direct determination of Mn spin-projections from our wavefunctions
suggests that current candidates that have been recently distinguished using
parameterized spin models should be reassessed. Through entanglement maps, we
reveal rich information contained in the wavefunctions on bonding changes in the 
cycle.

Capsular polysaccharides form the outermost protective layer around many
Gram-negative bacteria. Antibiotics aimed directly at weakening this layer are
not yet available. In pathogenic Escherichia coli E69, a protein, Wza, forms a
pore in the outer membrane that transports K30 capsular polysaccharide from its
site of synthesis to the outside of the cell. This therefore represents a
prospective antibiotic target. Here we test a variety of grommet-like mimics of
K30 capsular polysaccharide on wild-type Wza and on mutant open forms of the pore
by electrical recording in planar lipid bilayers. The most effective glycomimetic
was the unnatural cyclic octasaccharide octakis(6-deoxy-6-amino)cyclomaltooctaose
(am8γCD), which blocks the α-helix barrel of Wza, a site that is directly
accessible from the external medium. This glycomimetic inhibited K30
polysaccharide transport in live E. coli E69. With the protective outer membrane 
disrupted, the bacteria can be recognized and killed by the human immune system.

The properties of zeolites, and thus their suitability for different
applications, are intimately connected with their structures. Synthesizing
specific architectures is therefore important, but has remained challenging. Here
we report a top-down strategy that involves the disassembly of a parent zeolite, 
UTL, and its reassembly into two zeolites with targeted topologies, IPC-2 and
IPC-4. The three zeolites are closely related as they adopt the same layered
structure, and they differ only in how the layers are connected. Choosing
different linkers gives rise to different pore sizes, enabling the synthesis of
materials with predetermined pore architectures. The structures of the resulting 
zeolites were characterized by interpreting the X-ray powder-diffraction patterns
through models using computational methods; IPC-2 exhibits orthogonal 12- and
ten-ring channels, and IPC-4 is a more complex zeolite that comprises orthogonal 
ten- and eight-ring channels. We describe how this method enables the preparation
of functional materials and discuss its potential for targeting other new

Manganese porphyrins have been extensively investigated as model systems for the 
natural enzyme cytochrome P450 and as synthetic oxidation catalysts. Here, we
report single-molecule studies of the multistep reaction of manganese porphyrins 
with molecular oxygen at a solid/liquid interface, using a scanning tunnelling
microscope (STM) under environmental control. The high lateral resolution of the 
STM, in combination with its sensitivity to subtle differences in the electronic 
properties of molecules, allowed the detection of at least four distinct reaction
species. Real-space and real-time imaging of reaction dynamics enabled the
observation of active sites, immobile on the experimental timescale. Conversions 
between the different species could be tuned by the composition of the atmosphere
(argon, air or oxygen) and the surface bias voltage. By means of extensive
comparison of the results to those obtained by analogous solution-based
chemistry, we assigned the observed species to the starting compound, reaction
intermediates and products.

The development of nanocarriers that selectively release guest molecules on
sensing a particular biological signal is being actively pursued in nanomedicine 
for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Here we report a protein-based
nanocarrier that opens in the presence of intracellular adenosine-5'-triphosphate
(ATP). The nanocarrier consists of multiple barrel-shaped chaperonin units
assembled through coordination with Mg(2+) into a tubular structure that protects
guest molecules against biological degradation. When its surface is
functionalized with a boronic acid derivative, the nanocarrier is able to enter
cells. The hydrolysis of intracellular ATP into adenosine-5'-diphosphate (ADP)
induces conformational changes of the chaperonin units, which in turns generate a
mechanical force that leads to the disassembly of the tube and release of the
guests. This scission occurs with a sigmoidal dependence on ATP concentration,
which means that the nanocarrier can differentiate biological environments in
terms of the concentration of ATP for selective guest release. Furthermore,
biodistribution tests reveal preferential accumulation of the nanocarriers in a
tumour tissue.

The development of transition metal-catalysed cross-coupling reactions has
greatly influenced the manner in which the synthesis of complex organic molecules
is approached. A wide variety of methods are now available for the formation of
C(sp(2))-C(sp(2)) bonds, and more recent work has focused on the use of C(sp(3)) 
electrophiles and nucleophiles. The use of secondary and tertiary alkyl
nucleophiles in cross-coupling reactions remains a challenge because of the
propensity of these alkyl groups to isomerize under the reaction conditions.
Here, we report the development of a general Pd-catalysed process for the
stereoretentive cross-coupling of secondary alkyl azastannatrane nucleophiles
with aryl chlorides, bromides, iodides and triflates. Coupling partners with a
wide range of electronic characteristics are well tolerated. The reaction occurs 
with minimal isomerization of the secondary alkyltin nucleophile, and with
retention of absolute configuration. This process constitutes the first general
method to use secondary alkyltin reagents in cross-coupling reactions.

The spectral linewidth of an ensemble of fluorescent emitters is dictated by the 
combination of single-emitter linewidths and sample inhomogeneity. For
semiconductor nanocrystals, efforts to tune ensemble linewidths for optical
applications have focused primarily on eliminating sample inhomogeneities,
because conventional single-molecule methods cannot reliably build accurate
ensemble-level statistics for single-particle linewidths. Photon-correlation
Fourier spectroscopy in solution (S-PCFS) offers a unique approach to
investigating single-nanocrystal spectra with large sample statistics and high
signal-to-noise ratios, without user selection bias and at fast timescales. With 
S-PCFS, we directly and quantitatively deconstruct the ensemble linewidth into
contributions from the average single-particle linewidth and from sample
inhomogeneity. We demonstrate that single-particle linewidths vary significantly 
from batch to batch and can be synthetically controlled. These findings delineate
the synthetic challenges facing underdeveloped nanomaterials such as InP and InAs
core-shell particles and introduce new avenues for the synthetic optimization of 
fluorescent nanoparticles.

In contrast to the rapidity with which scientific information is published, the
application of new knowledge often remains slow, and we believe this to be
particularly true of newly developed synthetic organic chemistry methodology.
Consequently, methods to assess and identify robust chemical reactions are
desirable, and would directly facilitate the application of newly reported
synthetic methodology to complex synthetic problems. Here, we describe a simple
process for assessing the likely scope and limitations of a chemical reaction
beyond the idealized reaction conditions initially reported. Using simple methods
and common analytical techniques we demonstrate a rapid assessment of an
established chemical reaction, and also propose a simplified analysis that may be
reported alongside new synthetic methodology.

To understand the yield and patterns of damage in aqueous condensed matter,
including biological systems, it is essential to identify the initial products
subsequent to the interaction of high-energy radiation with liquid water. Until
now, the observation of several fast reactions induced by energetic particles in 
water was not possible on their characteristic timescales. Therefore, some of the
reaction intermediates involved, particularly those that require nuclear motion, 
were not considered when describing radiation chemistry. Here, through a combined
experimental and theoretical study, we elucidate the ultrafast proton dynamics in
the first few femtoseconds after X-ray core-level ionization of liquid water. We 
show through isotope analysis of the Auger spectra that proton-transfer dynamics 
occur on the same timescale as electron autoionization. Proton transfer leads to 
the formation of a Zundel-type intermediate [HO*···H···H2O](+), which further
ionizes to form a so-far unnoticed type of dicationic charge-separated species
with high internal energy. We call the process proton-transfer mediated charge
separation.

Methods to stabilize and retain enzyme activity in the gastrointestinal tract are
investigated rarely because of the difficulty of protecting proteins from an
environment that has evolved to promote their digestion. Preventing the
degradation of enzymes under these conditions, however, is critical for the
development of new protein-based oral therapies. Here we show that covalent
conjugation to polymers can stabilize orally administered therapeutic enzymes at 
different locations in the gastrointestinal tract. Architecturally and
functionally diverse polymers are used to protect enzymes sterically from
inactivation and to promote interactions with mucin on the stomach wall. Using
this approach the in vivo activity of enzymes can be sustained for several hours 
in the stomach and/or in the small intestine. These findings provide new insight 
and a firm basis for the development of new therapeutic and imaging strategies
based on orally administered proteins using a simple and accessible technology.

Single-molecule magnets that contain one spin centre may represent the smallest
possible unit for spin-based computational devices. Such applications, however,
require the realization of molecules with a substantial energy barrier for spin
inversion, achieved through a large axial magnetic anisotropy. Recently,
significant progress has been made in this regard by using lanthanide centres
such as terbium(III) and dysprosium(III), whose anisotropy can lead to extremely 
high relaxation barriers. We contend that similar effects should be achievable
with transition metals by maintaining a low coordination number to restrict the
magnitude of the d-orbital ligand-field splitting energy (which tends to hinder
the development of large anisotropies). Herein we report the first two-coordinate
complex of iron(I), [Fe(C(SiMe3)3)2](-), for which alternating current magnetic
susceptibility measurements reveal slow magnetic relaxation below 29 K in a zero 
applied direct-current field. This S =  complex exhibits an effective
spin-reversal barrier of Ueff = 226(4) cm(-1), the largest yet observed for a
single-molecule magnet based on a transition metal, and displays magnetic
blocking below 4.5 K.

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), tubular molecular entities that consist of
sp(2)-hybridized carbon atoms, are currently produced as mixtures that contain
tubes of various diameters and different sidewall structures. The electronic and 
optical properties of CNTs are determined by their diameters and sidewall
structures and so a controlled synthesis of uniform-diameter, single-chirality
CNTs-a significant chemical challenge-would provide access to pure samples with
predictable properties. Here we report a rational bottom-up approach to
synthesize structurally uniform CNTs using carbon nanorings (cycloparaphenylenes)
as templates and ethanol as the carbon source. The average diameter of the CNTs
formed is close to that of the carbon nanorings used, which supports the
operation of a 'growth-from-template' mechanism in CNT formation. This bottom-up 
organic chemistry approach is intrinsically different from other conventional
approaches to making CNTs and, if it can be optimized sufficiently, offers a
route to the programmable synthesis of structurally uniform CNTs.

Conformational changes are known to be able to drive an enzyme through its
catalytic cycle, allowing, for example, substrate binding or product release.
However, the influence of protein motions on the chemical step is a controversial
issue. One proposal is that the simple equilibrium fluctuations incorporated into
transition-state theory are insufficient to account for the catalytic effect of
enzymes and that protein motions should be treated dynamically. Here, we propose 
the use of free-energy surfaces, obtained as a function of both a chemical
coordinate and an environmental coordinate, as an efficient way to elucidate the 
role of protein structure and motions during the reaction. We show that the
structure of the protein provides an adequate environment for the progress of the
reaction, although a certain degree of flexibility is needed to attain the full
catalytic effect. However, these motions do not introduce significant dynamical
corrections to the rate constant and can be described as equilibrium
fluctuations.

The reduction of gaseous nitrogen is a challenge for industrial, biological and
synthetic chemists. Major goals include understanding the formation of ammonia
for agriculture, and forming N-C and N-Si bonds for the synthesis of fine
chemicals. The iron-molybdenum active site of the enzyme nitrogenase has inspired
chemists to explore iron and molybdenum complexes in transformations related to
N2 reduction. This area of research has gained significant momentum, and the past
two years have witnessed a number of significant advances in synthetic Fe-N2 and 
Mo-N2 chemistry. Furthermore, the identities of all atoms in the iron-molybdenum 
cofactor of nitrogenase have finally been elucidated, and the discovery of a
carbide has generated new questions and targets for coordination chemists. This
Perspective summarizes the recent work on iron and molydenum complexes, and
highlights the opportunities for continued research.

Molecularly well-defined homogeneous catalysts are known for a wide variety of
chemical transformations. The effect of small changes in molecular structure can 
be studied in detail and used to optimize many processes. However, many
industrial processes require heterogeneous catalysts because of their stability, 
ease of separation and recyclability, but these are more difficult to control on 
a molecular level. Here, we describe the conversion of homogeneous cobalt
complexes into heterogeneous cobalt oxide catalysts via immobilization and
pyrolysis on activated carbon. The catalysts thus produced are useful for the
industrially important reduction of nitroarenes to anilines. The ligand
indirectly controls the selectivity and activity of the recyclable catalyst and
catalyst optimization can be performed at the level of the solution-phase
precursor before conversion into the active heterogeneous catalyst.

Although several strategies are now available to produce functional
microcompartments analogous to primitive cell-like structures, little progress
has been made in generating protocell constructs with self-controlled membrane
permeability. Here we describe the preparation of water-dispersible colloidosomes
based on silica nanoparticles and delineated by a continuous semipermeable
inorganic membrane capable of self-activated, electrostatically gated
permeability. We use crosslinking and covalent grafting of a pH-responsive
copolymer to generate an ultrathin elastic membrane that exhibits selective
release and uptake of small molecules. This behaviour, which depends on the
charge of the copolymer coronal layer, serves to trigger enzymatic
dephosphorylation reactions specifically within the protocell aqueous interior.
This system represents a step towards the design and construction of alternative 
types of artificial chemical cells and protocell models based on spontaneous
processes of inorganic self-organization.

Mg(2+) is essential for RNA folding and catalysis. However, for the first 1.5
billion years of life on Earth RNA inhabited an anoxic Earth with abundant and
benign Fe(2+). We hypothesize that Fe(2+) was an RNA cofactor when iron was
abundant, and was substantially replaced by Mg(2+) during a period known as the
'great oxidation', brought on by photosynthesis. Here, we demonstrate that
reversing this putative metal substitution in an anoxic environment, by removing 
Mg(2+) and replacing it with Fe(2+), expands the catalytic repertoire of RNA.
Fe(2+) can confer on some RNAs a previously uncharacterized ability to catalyse
single-electron transfer. We propose that RNA function, in analogy with protein
function, can be understood fully only in the context of association with a range
of possible metals. The catalysis of electron transfer, requisite for metabolic
activity, may have been attenuated in RNA by photosynthesis and the rise of O2.

An excess of elemental sulfur is generated annually from hydrodesulfurization in 
petroleum refining processes; however, it has a limited number of uses, of which 
one example is the production of sulfuric acid. Despite this excess, the
development of synthetic and processing methods to convert elemental sulfur into 
useful chemical substances has not been investigated widely. Here we report a
facile method (termed 'inverse vulcanization') to prepare chemically stable and
processable polymeric materials through the direct copolymerization of elemental 
sulfur with vinylic monomers. This methodology enabled the modification of sulfur
into processable copolymer forms with tunable thermomechanical properties, which 
leads to well-defined sulfur-rich micropatterned films created by imprint
lithography. We also demonstrate that these copolymers exhibit comparable
electrochemical properties to elemental sulfur and could serve as the active
material in Li-S batteries, exhibiting high specific capacity (823 mA h g(-1) at 
100 cycles) and enhanced capacity retention.

Natural products have a venerable history of, and enduring potential for the
discovery of useful biological activity. To fully exploit this, the development
of chemical methodology that can functionalize unique sites within these complex 
structures is highly desirable. Here, we describe the use of
rhodium(II)-catalysed C-H amination reactions developed by Du Bois to carry out
simultaneous structure-activity relationship studies and arming (alkynylation) of
natural products at 'unfunctionalized' positions. Allylic and benzylic C-H bonds 
in the natural products undergo amination while olefins undergo aziridination,
and tertiary amine-containing natural products are converted to amidines by a C-H
amination-oxidation sequence or to hydrazine sulfamate zwitterions by an unusual 
N-amination. The alkynylated derivatives are ready for conversion into cellular
probes that can be used for mechanism-of-action studies. Chemo- and
site-selectivity was studied with a diverse library of natural products. For one 
of these-the marine-derived anticancer diterpene, eupalmerin acetate-quantitative
proteome profiling led to the identification of several protein targets in HL-60 
cells, suggesting a polypharmacological mode of action.

The interaction between a viral capsid and its genome governs crucial steps in
the life cycle of a virus, such as assembly and genome uncoating. Tuning
cargo-capsid interactions is also essential for successful design and cargo
delivery in engineered viral systems. Here we investigate the interplay between
cargo and capsid for the picorna-like Triatoma virus using a combined native mass
spectrometry and atomic force microscopy approach. We propose a topology and
assembly model in which heterotrimeric pentons that consist of five copies of
structural proteins VP1, VP2 and VP3 are the free principal units of assembly.
The interpenton contacts are established primarily by VP2. The dual role of the
genome is first to stabilize the densely packed virion and, second, on an
increase in pH to trigger uncoating by relaxing the stabilizing interactions with
the capsid. Uncoating occurs through a labile intermediate state of the virion
that reversibly disassembles into pentons with the concomitant release of protein
VP4.

The advent of Darwinian evolution required the emergence of molecular mechanisms 
for the heritable variation of fitness. One model for such a system involves
competing protocell populations, each consisting of a replicating genetic polymer
within a replicating vesicle. In this model, each genetic polymer imparts a
selective advantage to its protocell by, for example, coding for a catalyst that 
generates a useful metabolite. Here, we report a partial model of such nascent
evolutionary traits in a system that consists of fatty-acid vesicles containing a
dipeptide catalyst, which catalyses the formation of a second dipeptide. The
newly formed dipeptide binds to vesicle membranes, which imparts enhanced
affinity for fatty acids and thus promotes vesicle growth. The catalysed
dipeptide synthesis proceeds with higher efficiency in vesicles than in free
solution, which further enhances fitness. Our observations suggest that, in a
replicating protocell with an RNA genome, ribozyme-catalysed peptide synthesis
might have been sufficient to initiate Darwinian evolution.

The non-aqueous Li-air (O2) battery is receiving intense interest because its
theoretical specific energy exceeds that of Li-ion batteries. Recharging the
Li-O2 battery depends on oxidizing solid lithium peroxide (Li2O2), which is
formed on discharge within the porous cathode. However, transporting charge
between Li2O2 particles and the solid electrode surface is at best very difficult
and leads to voltage polarization on charging, even at modest rates. This is a
significant problem facing the non-aqueous Li-O2 battery. Here we show that
incorporation of a redox mediator, tetrathiafulvalene (TTF), enables recharging
at rates that are impossible for the cell in the absence of the mediator. On
charging, TTF is oxidized to TTF(+) at the cathode surface; TTF(+) in turn
oxidizes the solid Li2O2, which results in the regeneration of TTF. The mediator 
acts as an electron-hole transfer agent that permits efficient oxidation of solid
Li2O2. The cell with the mediator demonstrated 100 charge/discharge cycles.

The nature and extent of covalency in uranium bonding is still unclear compared
with that of transition metals, and there is great interest in studying
uranium-ligand multiple bonds. Although U=O and U=NR double bonds (where R is an 
alkyl group) are well-known analogues to transition-metal oxo and imido
complexes, the uranium(VI)-nitride triple bond has long remained a synthetic
target in actinide chemistry. Here, we report the preparation of a
uranium(VI)-nitride triple bond. We highlight the importance of (1) ancillary
ligand design, (2) employing mild redox reactions instead of harsh photochemical 
methods that decompose transiently formed uranium(VI) nitrides, (3) an
electrostatically stabilizing sodium ion during nitride installation, (4)
selecting the right sodium sequestering reagent, (5) inner versus outer sphere
oxidation and (6) stability with respect to the uranium oxidation state.
Computational analyses suggest covalent contributions to U≡N triple bonds that
are surprisingly comparable to those of their group 6 transition-metal nitride
counterparts.

In most radicals the singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) is the
highest-energy occupied molecular orbital (HOMO); however, in a small number of
reported compounds this is not the case. In the present work we expand
significantly the scope of this phenomenon, known as SOMO-HOMO energy-level
conversion, by showing that it occurs in virtually any distonic radical anion
that contains a sufficiently stabilized radical (aminoxyl, peroxyl, aminyl)
non-π-conjugated with a negative charge (carboxylate, phosphate, sulfate).
Moreover, regular orbital order is restored on protonation of the anionic
fragment, and hence the orbital configuration can be switched by pH. Most
importantly, our theoretical and experimental results reveal a dramatically
higher radical stability and proton acidity of such distonic radical anions.
Changing radical stability by 3-4 orders of magnitude using pH-induced orbital
conversion opens a variety of attractive industrial applications, including
pH-switchable nitroxide-mediated polymerization, and it might be exploited in
nature.

Progress in nanocrystal synthesis and self-assembly enables the formation of
highly ordered superlattices. Recent studies focused on spherical particles with 
tunable attraction and polyhedral particles with anisotropic shape, and excluded 
volume repulsion, but the effects of shape on particle interaction are only
starting to be exploited. Here we present a joint experimental-computational
multiscale investigation of a class of highly faceted planar lanthanide fluoride 
nanocrystals (nanoplates, nanoplatelets). The nanoplates self-assemble into
long-range ordered tilings at the liquid-air interface formed by a hexane wetting
layer. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we demonstrate that their assembly can be
understood from maximization of packing density only in a first approximation.
Explaining the full phase behaviour requires an understanding of nanoplate-edge
interactions, which originate from the atomic structure, as confirmed by density 
functional theory calculations. Despite the apparent simplicity in particle
geometry, the combination of shape-induced entropic and edge-specific energetic
effects directs the formation and stabilization of unconventional long-range
ordered assemblies not attainable otherwise.

Synthetic polymers exhibit diverse and useful properties and influence most
aspects of modern life. Many polymerization methods provide linear or branched
macromolecules, frequently with outstanding functional-group tolerance and
molecular weight control. In contrast, extending polymerization strategies to
two-dimensional periodic structures is in its infancy, and successful examples
have emerged only recently through molecular framework, surface science and
crystal engineering approaches. In this Review, we describe successful 2D
polymerization strategies, as well as seminal research that inspired their
development. These methods include the synthesis of 2D covalent organic
frameworks as layered crystals and thin films, surface-mediated polymerization of
polyfunctional monomers, and solid-state topochemical polymerizations. Early
application targets of 2D polymers include gas separation and storage,
optoelectronic devices and membranes, each of which might benefit from
predictable long-range molecular organization inherent to this macromolecular
architecture.

Low-molecular-weight gels show great potential for application in fields ranging 
from the petrochemical industry to healthcare and tissue engineering. These
supramolecular gels are often metastable materials, which implies that their
properties are, at least partially, kinetically controlled. Here we show how the 
mechanical properties and structure of these materials can be controlled directly
by catalytic action. We show how in situ catalysis of the formation of gelator
molecules can be used to accelerate the formation of supramolecular hydrogels,
which drastically enhances their resulting mechanical properties. Using acid or
nucleophilic aniline catalysis, it is possible to make supramolecular hydrogels
with tunable gel-strength in a matter of minutes, under ambient conditions,
starting from simple soluble building blocks. By changing the rate of formation
of the gelator molecules using a catalyst, the overall rate of gelation and the
resulting gel morphology are affected, which provides access to metastable gel
states with improved mechanical strength and appearance despite an identical
gelator composition.

The conversion of biomass into fuels and chemical feedstocks is one part of a
drive to reduce the world's dependence on crude oil. For transportation fuels in 
particular, wholesale replacement of a fuel is logistically problematic, not
least because of the infrastructure that is already in place. Here, we describe
the catalytic defunctionalization of a series of biomass-derived molecules to
provide linear alkanes suitable for use as transportation fuels. These
biomass-derived molecules contain a variety of functional groups, including
olefins, furan rings and carbonyl groups. We describe the removal of these in
either a stepwise process or a one-pot process using common reagents and
catalysts under mild reaction conditions to provide n-alkanes in good yields and 
with high selectivities. Our general synthetic approach is applicable to a range 
of precursors with different carbon content (chain length). This allows the
selective generation of linear alkanes with carbon chain lengths between eight
and sixteen carbons.

The identification of new reactions expands our knowledge of chemical reactivity 
and enables new synthetic applications. Accelerating the pace of this discovery
process remains challenging. We describe a highly effective and simple platform
for screening a large number of potential chemical reactions in order to discover
and optimize previously unknown catalytic transformations, thereby revealing new 
chemical reactivity. Our strategy is based on labelling one of the reactants with
a polyaromatic chemical tag, which selectively undergoes a
photoionization/desorption process upon laser irradiation, without the assistance
of an external matrix, and enables rapid mass spectrometric detection of any
products originating from such labelled reactants in complex reaction mixtures
without any chromatographic separation. This method was successfully used for
high-throughput discovery and subsequent optimization of two previously unknown
benzannulation reactions.

Hypervalency in XeF₂ and isoelectronic complexes is generally understood in terms
of the Rundle-Pimentel model (which invokes a three-centre/four-electron
molecular system) or its valence bond version as proposed by Coulson, which
replaced the old expanded octet model of Pauling. However, the Rundle-Pimentel
model is not always successful in describing such complexes and has been shown to
be oversimplified. Here using ab initio valence bond theory coupled to quantum
Monte Carlo methods, we show that the Rundle-Pimentel model is insufficient by
itself in accounting for the great stability of XeF₂, and that charge-shift
bonding, wherein the large covalent-ionic interaction energy has the dominant
role, is a major stabilizing factor. The energetic contribution of the old
expanded octet model is also quantified and shown to be marginal. Generalizing to
isoelectronic systems such as ClF₃, SF₄, PCl₅ and others, it is suggested that
charge-shift bonding is necessary, in association with the Rundle-Pimentel model,
for hypervalent analogues of XeF₂ to be strongly bonded.

The tatanans are members of a novel class of complex sesquilignan natural
products recently isolated from the rhizomes of Acorus tatarinowii Schott plants.
Tatanans A, B and C have previously been reported to have potent
glucokinase-activating properties that exceed the in vitro activity of known
synthetic antidiabetic agents. Here, using a series of sequential
[3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangements, we report the total synthesis of tatanan A in
13 steps and 13% overall yield. We also complete a concise enantioselective total
synthesis of more complex, atropisomeric tatanans B and C via a distinct
convergent strategy based on a palladium-catalysed diastereotopic aromatic group 
differentiation (12 steps, 4% and 8% overall yield, respectively). A plausible
biosynthetic relationship between acyclic tatanan A and spirocyclic tatanans B
and C is proposed and probed experimentally. With sufficient quantities of the
natural products in hand, we undertake a detailed functional characterization of 
the biological activities of tatanans A-C. Contrary to previous reports, our
assays utilizing pure recombinant human enzyme demonstrate that tatanans do not
function as allosteric activators of glucokinase.

Hydrogen is essential to several key industrial processes and could play a major 
role as an energy carrier in a future 'hydrogen economy'. Although the majority
of the world's hydrogen supply currently comes from the reformation of fossil
fuels, its generation from water using renewables-generated power could provide a
hydrogen source without increasing atmospheric CO₂ levels. Conventional water
electrolysis produces H₂ and O₂ simultaneously, such that these gases must be
generated in separate spaces to prevent their mixing. Herein, using the
polyoxometalate H₃PMo₁₂O₄₀, we introduce the concept of the
electron-coupled-proton buffer (ECPB), whereby O₂ and H₂ can be produced at
separate times during water electrolysis. This could have advantages in
preventing gas mixing in the headspaces of high-pressure electrolysis cells, with
implications for safety and electrolyser degradation. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that temporally separated O₂ and H₂ production allows greater flexibility
regarding the membranes and electrodes that can be used in water-splitting cells.

The advancement of techniques that can probe the behaviour of individual
nanoscopic objects is of paramount importance in various disciplines, including
photonics and electronics. As it provides images with a spatiotemporal
resolution, four-dimensional electron microscopy, in principle, should enable the
visualization of single-nanoparticle structural dynamics in real and reciprocal
space. Here, we demonstrate the selectivity and sensitivity of the technique by
visualizing the spin crossover dynamics of single, isolated metal-organic
framework nanocrystals. By introducing a small aperture in the microscope, it was
possible to follow the phase transition and the associated structural dynamics
within a single particle. Its behaviour was observed to be distinct from that
imaged by averaging over ensembles of heterogeneous nanoparticles. The approach
reported here has potential applications in other nanosystems and those that
undergo (bio)chemical transformations.

A plausible process for non-enzymatic RNA replication would greatly simplify
models of the transition from prebiotic chemistry to simple biology. However, all
known conditions for the chemical copying of an RNA template result in the
synthesis of a complementary strand that contains a mixture of 2'-5' and 3'-5'
linkages, rather than the selective synthesis of only 3'-5' linkages as found in 
contemporary RNA. Here we show that such backbone heterogeneity is compatible
with RNA folding into defined three-dimensional structures that retain molecular 
recognition and catalytic properties and, therefore, would not prevent the
evolution of functional RNAs such as ribozymes. Moreover, the same backbone
heterogeneity lowers the melting temperature of RNA duplexes that would otherwise
be too stable for thermal strand separation. By allowing copied strands to
dissociate, this heterogeneity may have been one of the essential features that
allowed RNA to emerge as the first biopolymer.

The recent synthesis of pyrimidine ribonucleoside-2',3'-cyclic phosphates under
prebiotically plausible conditions has strengthened the case for the involvement 
of ribonucleic acid (RNA) at an early stage in the origin of life. However, a
prebiotic conversion of these weakly activated monomers, and their purine
counterparts, to the 3',5'-linked RNA polymers of extant biochemistry has been
lacking (previous attempts led only to short oligomers with mixed linkages). Here
we show that the 2'-hydroxyl group of oligoribonucleotide-3'-phosphates can be
chemoselectively acetylated in water under prebiotically credible conditions,
which allows rapid and efficient template-directed ligation. The 2'-O-acetyl
group at the ligation junction of the product RNA strand can be removed under
conditions that leave the internucleotide bonds intact. Remarkably, acetylation
of mixed oligomers that possess either 2'- or 3'-terminal phosphates is selective
for the 2'-hydroxyl group of the latter. This newly discovered chemistry thus
suggests a prebiotic route from ribonucleoside-2',3'-cyclic phosphates to
predominantly 3',5'-linked RNA via partially 2'-O-acetylated RNA.

Inner-phase chemical reactions of guest molecules encapsulated in a
macromolecular cavity give fundamental insight into the relative stabilization of
transition states by the surrounding walls of the host, thereby modelling the
situation of substrates in enzymatic binding pockets. Although in solution
several examples of inner-phase reactions are known, the use of cucurbiturils as 
macrocyclic hosts and bicyclic azoalkanes as guests has now enabled a systematic 
mass spectrometric investigation of inner-phase reactions in the gas phase, where
typically the supply of thermal energy results in dissociation of the
supramolecular host-guest assembly. The results reveal a sensitive interplay in
which attractive and repulsive van der Waals interactions between the differently
sized hosts and guests need to be balanced with a constrictive binding to allow
thermally activated chemical reactions to compete with dissociation. The results 
are important for the understanding of supramolecular reactivity and have
implications for catalysis.

The beginning of the twenty-first century has witnessed significant advances in
the field of C-H bond activation, and this transformation is now an established
piece in the synthetic chemists' toolbox. This methodology has the potential to
be used in many different areas of chemistry, for example it provides a perfect
opportunity for the late-stage diversification of various kinds of organic
scaffolds, ranging from relatively small molecules like drug candidates, to
complex polydisperse organic compounds such as polymers. In this way, C-H
activation approaches enable relatively straightforward access to a plethora of
analogues or can help to streamline the lead-optimization phase. Furthermore,
synthetic pathways for the construction of complex organic materials can now be
designed that are more atom- and step-economical than previous methods and, in
some cases, can be based on synthetic disconnections that are just not possible
without C-H activation. This Perspective highlights the potential of
metal-catalysed C-H bond activation reactions, which now extend beyond the field 
of traditional synthetic organic chemistry.

The development of an efficient catalytic process that mimics the enzymatic
function of alcohol dehydrogenase is critical for using biomass alcohols for both
the production of H2 as a chemical energy carrier and fine chemicals under
waste-free conditions. Dehydrogenation of alcohol-water mixtures into their
corresponding acids with molecular hydrogen as the sole by-product from the
reaction can be catalysed by a ruthenium complex with a chelating bis(olefin)
diazadiene ligand. This complex, [K(dme)2][Ru(H)(trop2dad)], stores up to two
equivalents of hydrogen intramolecularly, and catalyses the production of H2 from
alcohols in the presence of water and a base under homogeneous conditions. The
conversion of a MeOH-H2O mixture proceeds selectively to CO2/H2 gas formation
under neutral conditions, thereby allowing the use of the entire hydrogen content
(12% by weight). Isolation and characterization of the ruthenium complexes from
these reactions suggested a mechanistic scenario in which the trop2dad ligand
behaves as a chemically 'non-innocent' co-operative ligand.

Chain alignment can significantly influence the macroscopic properties of a
polymeric material, but no general and versatile methodology has yet been
reported to obtain highly ordered crystalline packing of polymer chains, with
high stability. Here, we disclose a strategy that relies on 'ordered crosslinks' 
to produce polymeric materials that exhibit a crystalline arrangement. Divinyl
crosslinkers (2,5-divinyl-terephthalate) were first embedded, as substitutional
ligands, into the structure of a porous coordination polymer (PCP),
[Cu(terephthalate)triethylenediamine0.5]n. A representative vinyl monomer,
styrene, was subsequently polymerized inside the channels of the host PCP. The
polystyrene chains that form within the PCP channels also crosslink with the
divinyl species. This bridges together the polymer chains of adjacent channels
and ensures that, on selective removal of the PCP, the polymer chains remain
aligned. Indeed, the resulting material exhibits long-range order and is stable
to thermal and solvent treatments, as demonstrated by X-ray powder diffraction
and transmission electron microscopy.

Packing constraints and precise placement of functional groups are the reason
that organic molecules in the crystalline state often display unusual physical or
chemical properties not observed in solution. Here we report a
single-crystal-to-single-crystal dimerization of a bromodiacetylene that involves
unusually large atom displacements as well as the cleavage and formation of
several bonds. Density functional theory computations support a mechanism in
which the dimerization is initiated by a [2 + 1] photocycloaddition favoured by
the nature of carbon-carbon short contacts in the crystal structure. The reaction
proceeded up to the theoretical degree of conversion without loss of
crystallinity, and it was also performed on a preparative scale with good yield. 
Moreover, it represents the first synthetic pathway to
(E)-1,2-dibromo-1,2-diethynylethenes, which could serve as synthetic
intermediates for the preparation of molecular carbon scaffolds. Our findings
both extend the scope of single-crystal-to-single-crystal reactions and highlight
their potential as a synthetic tool for complex transformations.

Although nitrogenase enzymes routinely convert molecular nitrogen into ammonia
under ambient temperature and pressure, this reaction is currently carried out
industrially using the Haber-Bosch process, which requires extreme temperatures
and pressures to activate dinitrogen. Biological fixation occurs through
dinitrogen and reduced NxHy species at multi-iron centres of compounds bearing
sulfur ligands, but it is difficult to elucidate the mechanistic details and to
obtain stable model intermediate complexes for further investigation. Metal-based
synthetic models have been applied to reveal partial details, although most
models involve a mononuclear system. Here, we report a diiron complex bridged by 
a bidentate thiolate ligand that can accommodate HN=NH. Following reductions and 
protonations, HN=NH is converted to NH3 through pivotal intermediate complexes
bridged by N2H3(-) and NH2(-) species. Notably, the final ammonia release was
effected with water as the proton source. Density functional theory calculations 
were carried out, and a pathway of biological nitrogen fixation is proposed.

Elementary three-atom systems provide stringent tests of the accuracy of ab
initio theory. One such important reaction, O((3)P) + H2 → OH(X(2)Π) + H, has
eluded detailed experimental study because of its high activation barrier. In
this reaction, both the ground-state reactant atom and product diatomic molecule 
have open-shell character, which introduces the intriguing complication of
non-Born-Oppenheimer effects in both the entrance and the exit channels. These
effects may be probed experimentally in both the fine-structure and the Λ-doublet
splittings of the OH product. We have used laser-induced fluorescence to measure 
OD internal product-state distributions from the analogous reaction of O((3)P)
with D2, enabled by a unique high-energy O((3)P) source. We find that the OD (ν' 
= 0) product is rotationally highly excited, in excellent agreement with earlier 
theoretical predictions. However, the distributions over the OD(X(2)Π)
fine-structure and Λ-doublet states, diagnostic of electronic non-adiabaticity in
the reaction, challenge the prevailing theoretical understanding.

The benzoquinone ansamycin geldanamycin and its derivatives are inhibitors of
heat shock protein Hsp90, an emerging target for novel therapeutic agents both in
cancer and in neurodegeneration. However, the toxicity of these compounds to
normal cells has been ascribed to reaction with thiol nucleophiles at the quinone
19-position. We reasoned that blocking this position would ameliorate toxicity,
and that it might also enforce a favourable conformational switch of the
trans-amide group into the cis-form required for protein binding. Here, we report
an efficient synthesis of such 19-substituted compounds and realization of our
hypotheses. Protein crystallography established that the new compounds bind to
Hsp90 with, as expected, a cis-amide conformation. Studies on Hsp90 inhibition in
cells demonstrated the molecular signature of Hsp90 inhibitors: decreases in
client proteins with compensatory increases in other heat shock proteins in both 
human breast cancer and dopaminergic neural cells, demonstrating their potential 
for use in the therapy of cancer or neurodegenerative diseases.

The development of hydrogen-based energy sources as viable alternatives to
fossil-fuel technologies has revolutionized clean energy production using fuel
cells. However, to date, the slow rate of the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR)
in alkaline environments has hindered advances in alkaline fuel cell systems.
Here, we address this by studying the trends in the activity of the HOR in
alkaline environments. We demonstrate that it can be enhanced more than fivefold 
compared to state-of-the-art platinum catalysts. The maximum activity is found
for materials (Ir and Pt₀.₁Ru₀.₉) with an optimal balance between the active
sites that are required for the adsorption/dissociation of H₂ and for the
adsorption of hydroxyl species (OHad). We propose that the more oxophilic sites
on Ir (defects) and PtRu material (Ru atoms) electrodes facilitate the adsorption
of OHad species. Those then react with the hydrogen intermediates (Had) that are 
adsorbed on more noble surface sites.

Redox-inactive metals are found in biological and heterogeneous water oxidation
catalysts, but, at present, their roles in catalysis are not well understood.
Here, we report a series of high-oxidation-state tetranuclear-dioxido clusters
comprising three manganese centres and a redox-inactive metal (M).
Crystallographic studies show an unprecedented Mn3M(µ4-O)(µ2-O) core that remains
intact on changing M or the manganese oxidation state. Electrochemical studies
reveal that the reduction potentials span a window of 700 mV and are dependent on
the Lewis acidity of the second metal. With the pKa of the redox-inactive
metal-aqua complex as a measure of Lewis acidity, these compounds demonstrate a
linear dependence between reduction potential and acidity with a slope of ∼100 mV
per pKa unit. The Sr(2+) and Ca(2+) compounds show similar potentials, an
observation that correlates with the behaviour of the oxygen-evolving complex of 
photosystem II, which is active only if one of these two metals is present.

The translation of DNA sequences into corresponding biopolymers enables the
production, function and evolution of the macromolecules of life. In contrast,
methods to generate sequence-defined synthetic polymers with similar levels of
control have remained elusive. Here, we report the development of a DNA-templated
translation system that enables the enzyme-free translation of DNA templates into
sequence-defined synthetic polymers that have no necessary structural
relationship with nucleic acids. We demonstrate the efficiency,
sequence-specificity and generality of this translation system by oligomerizing
building blocks including polyethylene glycol, α-(D)-peptides, and β-peptides in 
a DNA-programmed manner. Sequence-defined synthetic polymers with molecular
weights of 26 kDa containing 16 consecutively coupled building blocks and 90
densely functionalized β-amino acid residues were translated from DNA templates
using this strategy. We integrated the DNA-templated translation system developed
here into a complete cycle of translation, coding sequence replication, template 
regeneration and re-translation suitable for the iterated in vitro selection of
functional sequence-defined synthetic polymers unrelated in structure to nucleic 
acids.

The energy-efficient separation of chemical feedstocks is a major sustainability 
challenge. Porous extended frameworks such as zeolites or metal-organic
frameworks are one potential solution to this problem. Here, we show that organic
molecules, rather than frameworks, can separate other organic molecules by size
and shape. A molecular organic cage is shown to separate a common aromatic
feedstock (mesitylene) from its structural isomer (4-ethyltoluene) with an
unprecedented perfect specificity for the latter. This specificity stems from the
structure of the intrinsically porous cage molecule, which is itself synthesized 
from a derivative of mesitylene. In other words, crystalline organic molecules
are used to separate other organic molecules. The specificity is defined by the
cage structure alone, so this solid-state 'shape sorting' is, uniquely, mirrored 
for cage molecules in solution. The behaviour can be understood from a
combination of atomistic simulations for individual cage molecules and
solid-state molecular dynamics simulations.

Ultrathin two-dimensional nanosheets of layered transition metal dichalcogenides 
(TMDs) are fundamentally and technologically intriguing. In contrast to the
graphene sheet, they are chemically versatile. Mono- or few-layered TMDs -
obtained either through exfoliation of bulk materials or bottom-up syntheses -
are direct-gap semiconductors whose bandgap energy, as well as carrier type (n-
or p-type), varies between compounds depending on their composition, structure
and dimensionality. In this Review, we describe how the tunable electronic
structure of TMDs makes them attractive for a variety of applications. They have 
been investigated as chemically active electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution
and hydrosulfurization, as well as electrically active materials in
opto-electronics. Their morphologies and properties are also useful for energy
storage applications such as electrodes for Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors.

Allenes are molecules based on three carbons connected by two cumulated
carbon-carbon double bonds. Given their axially chiral nature and unique
reactivity, substituted allenes have a variety of applications in organic
chemistry as key synthetic intermediates and directly as part of biologically
active compounds. Although the demands for these motivated many endeavours to
make axially chiral, substituted allenes by exercising asymmetric catalysis, the 
catalytic asymmetric synthesis of fully substituted ones (tetrasubstituted
allenes) remained largely an unsolved issue. The fundamental obstacle to solving 
this conundrum is the lack of a simple synthetic transformation that provides
tetrasubstituted allenes in the action of catalysis. We report herein a strategy 
to overcome this issue by the use of a phase-transfer-catalysed asymmetric
functionalization of 1-alkylallene-1,3-dicarboxylates with N-arylsulfonyl imines 
and benzylic and allylic bromides.

Supramolecular chemistry has recently emerged as a promising way to modulate
protein functions, but devising molecules that will interact with a protein in
the desired manner is difficult as many competing interactions exist in a
biological environment (with solvents, salts or different sites for the target
biomolecule). We now show that lysine-specific molecular tweezers bind to a
14-3-3 adapter protein and modulate its interaction with partner proteins. The
tweezers inhibit binding between the 14-3-3 protein and two partner proteins--a
phosphorylated (C-Raf) protein and an unphosphorylated one (ExoS)--in a
concentration-dependent manner. Protein crystallography shows that this effect
arises from the binding of the tweezers to a single surface-exposed lysine
(Lys214) of the 14-3-3 protein in the proximity of its central channel, which
normally binds the partner proteins. A combination of structural analysis and
computer simulations provides rules for the tweezers' binding preferences, thus
allowing us to predict their influence on this type of protein-protein
interactions.

The increasing energy needs of society have led to a search for technologies that
can tap carbon-neutral and sustainable energy sources, such as solar and wind.
Using properly designed catalysts, such sources can also be used to create fuels 
such as hydrogen; however, a significant barrier to the use of hydrogen as an
energy carrier is the need for an inexpensive and efficient catalyst for its
oxidation. The oxidation of hydrogen is the process by which electricity is
produced in low-temperature fuel cells, and the best catalyst for this is
platinum-a precious metal of low abundance. Here we report a molecular complex of
iron (an abundant and inexpensive metal) as a rationally designed electrocatalyst
for the oxidation of H(2) at room temperature, with turnover frequencies of
0.66-2.0 s(-1) and low overpotentials of 160-220 mV. This iron complex,
Cp(C(6)F(5))Fe(P((t)Bu)(2)N(Bn)(2))(H), has pendent amines in the diphosphine
ligand that function as proton relays.

Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a protein that plays a crucial role in
diverse cellular functions, from wound healing to bone regeneration. However, a
major obstacle to the widespread application of bFGF is its inherent instability 
during storage and delivery. Here, we describe the stabilization of bFGF by
covalent conjugation with a heparin-mimicking polymer, a copolymer consisting of 
styrene sulfonate units and methyl methacrylate units bearing poly(ethylene
glycol) side chains. The bFGF conjugate of this polymer retained bioactivity
after synthesis and was stable to a variety of environmentally and
therapeutically relevant stressors--such as heat, mild and harsh acidic
conditions, storage and proteolytic degradation--unlike native bFGF. Following
the application of stress, the conjugate was also significantly more active than 
the control conjugate system in which the styrene sulfonate units were omitted
from the polymer structure. This research has important implications for the
clinical use of bFGF and for the stabilization of heparin-binding growth factors 
in general.

Trans-to-cis isomerization, the key reaction in photoactive proteins, usually
cannot occur through the standard one-bond-flip mechanism. Owing to spatial
constraints imposed by a protein environment, isomerization probably proceeds
through a volume-conserving mechanism in which highly choreographed atomic
motions are expected, the details of which have not yet been observed directly.
Here we employ time-resolved X-ray crystallography to visualize structurally the 
isomerization of the p-coumaric acid chromophore in photoactive yellow protein
with a time resolution of 100 ps and a spatial resolution of 1.6 Å. The structure
of the earliest intermediate (I(T)) resembles a highly strained transition state 
in which the torsion angle is located halfway between the trans- and cis-isomers.
The reaction trajectory of I(T) bifurcates into two structurally distinct cis
intermediates via hula-twist and bicycle-pedal pathways. The bifurcating reaction
pathways can be controlled by weakening the hydrogen bond between the chromophore
and an adjacent residue through E46Q mutation, which switches off the
bicycle-pedal pathway.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are among the most attractive porous materials
known today. Their miniaturization to the nanoscale--into nanoMOFs--is expected
to serve myriad applications from drug delivery to membranes, to open up novel
avenues to more traditional storage and catalysis applications, and to enable the
creation of sophisticated superstructures. Here, we report the use of
spray-drying as a versatile methodology to assemble nanoMOFs, yielding spherical 
hollow superstructures with diameters smaller than 5 µm. This strategy
conceptually mimics the emulsions used by chemists to confine the synthesis of
materials, but does not require secondary immiscible solvents or surfactants. We 
demonstrate that the resulting spherical, hollow superstructures can be processed
into stable colloids, whose disassembly by sonication affords discrete,
homogeneous nanoMOFs. This spray-drying strategy enables the construction of
multicomponent MOF superstructures, and the encapsulation of guest species within
these superstructures. We anticipate that this will provide new routes to
capsules, reactors and composite materials.

High-throughput screening is the dominant method used to identify lead compounds 
in drug discovery. As such, the makeup of screening libraries largely dictates
the biological targets that can be modulated and the therapeutics that can be
developed. Unfortunately, most compound-screening collections consist principally
of planar molecules with little structural or stereochemical complexity,
compounds that do not offer the arrangement of chemical functionality necessary
for the modulation of many drug targets. Here we describe a novel, general and
facile strategy for the creation of diverse compounds with high structural and
stereochemical complexity using readily available natural products as synthetic
starting points. We show through the evaluation of chemical properties (which
include fraction of sp(3) carbons, ClogP and the number of stereogenic centres)
that these compounds are significantly more complex and diverse than those in
standard screening collections, and we give guidelines for the application of
this strategy to any suitable natural product.

Large π-conjugated molecules, when in contact with a metal surface, usually
retain a finite electronic gap and, in this sense, stay semiconducting. In some
cases, however, the metallic character of the underlying substrate is seen to
extend onto the first molecular layer. Here, we develop a chemical rationale for 
this intriguing phenomenon. In many reported instances, we find that the
conjugation length of the organic semiconductors increases significantly through 
the bonding of specific substituents to the metal surface and through the
concomitant rehybridization of the entire backbone structure. The molecules at
the interface are thus converted into different chemical species with a strongly 
reduced electronic gap. This mechanism of surface-induced aromatic stabilization 
helps molecules to overcome competing phenomena that tend to keep the metal Fermi
level between their frontier orbitals. Our findings aid in the design of stable
precursors for metallic molecular monolayers, and thus enable new routes for the 
chemical engineering of metal surfaces.

Four-stranded G-quadruplex nucleic acid structures are of great interest as their
high thermodynamic stability under near-physiological conditions suggests that
they could form in cells. Here we report the generation and application of an
engineered, structure-specific antibody employed to quantitatively visualize DNA 
G-quadruplex structures in human cells. We show explicitly that G-quadruplex
formation in DNA is modulated during cell-cycle progression and that endogenous
G-quadruplex DNA structures can be stabilized by a small-molecule ligand.
Together these findings provide substantive evidence for the formation of
G-quadruplex structures in the genome of mammalian cells and corroborate the
application of stabilizing ligands in a cellular context to target G-quadruplexes
and intervene with their function.

The anti-AIDS drug rilpivirine undergoes conformational changes to bind HIV-1
reverse transcriptase (RT), which is an essential enzyme for the replication of
HIV. These changes allow it to retain potency against mutations that otherwise
would render the enzyme resistant. Here we report that water molecules play an
essential role in this binding process. Femtosecond experiments and theory expose
the molecular level dynamics of rilpivirine bound to HIV-1 RT. Two nitrile
substituents, one on each arm of the drug, are used as vibrational probes of the 
structural dynamics within the binding pocket. Two-dimensional vibrational echo
spectroscopy reveals that one nitrile group is unexpectedly hydrogen-bonded to a 
mobile water molecule, not identified in previous X-ray structures. Ultrafast
nitrile-water dynamics are confirmed by simulations. A higher (1.51 Å) resolution
X-ray structure also reveals a water-drug interaction network. Maintenance of a
crucial anchoring hydrogen bond may help retain the potency of rilpivirine
against pocket mutations despite the structural variations they cause.

Inhibition of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) represents a significant
challenge because it is unclear how they can be effectively and selectively
targeted using small molecules. Achieving this goal is critical given the
defining role of these interactions in biological processes. A rational approach 
to inhibitor design based on the secondary structure at the interface is the
focus of much research, and different classes of designed ligands have emerged,
some of which effectively and selectively disrupt targeted PPIs. This Review
discusses the relevance of PPIs and, in particular, the importance of
α-helix-mediated PPIs to chemical biology and drug discovery with a focus on
designing inhibitors, including constrained peptides, foldamers and
proteomimetic-derived ligands. In doing so, key challenges and major advances in 
developing generic approaches for the elaboration of PPI inhibitors are
highlighted. The challenges faced in developing such ligands as drug leads--and
how criteria applied to these may differ from conventional small-molecule
drugs--are summarized.

The pyrrole heterocycle is a prominent chemical motif and is found widely in
natural products, drugs, catalysts and advanced materials. Here we introduce a
sustainable iridium-catalysed pyrrole synthesis in which secondary alcohols and
amino alcohols are deoxygenated and linked selectively via the formation of C-N
and C-C bonds. Two equivalents of hydrogen gas are eliminated in the course of
the reaction, and alcohols based entirely on renewable resources can be used as
starting materials. The catalytic synthesis protocol tolerates a large variety of
functional groups, which includes olefins, chlorides, bromides, organometallic
moieties, amines and hydroxyl groups. We have developed a catalyst that operates 
efficiently under mild conditions.

The ideal fluorescent probe for bioimaging is bright, absorbs at long wavelengths
and can be implemented flexibly in living cells and in vivo. However, the design 
of synthetic fluorophores that combine all of these properties has proved to be
extremely difficult. Here, we introduce a biocompatible near-infrared
silicon-rhodamine probe that can be coupled specifically to proteins using
different labelling techniques. Importantly, its high permeability and
fluorogenic character permit the imaging of proteins in living cells and tissues,
and its brightness and photostability make it ideally suited for live-cell
super-resolution microscopy. The excellent spectroscopic properties of the probe

The oxidation of alcohols to carboxylic acids is an important industrial reaction
used in the synthesis of bulk and fine chemicals. Most current processes are
performed by making use of either stoichiometric amounts of toxic oxidizing
agents or the use of pressurized dioxygen. Here, we describe an alternative
dehydrogenative pathway effected by water and base with the concomitant
generation of hydrogen gas. A homogeneous ruthenium complex catalyses the
transformation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acid salts at low catalyst
loadings (0.2 mol%) in basic aqueous solution. A consequence of this finding
could be a safer and cleaner process for the synthesis of carboxylic acids and
their derivatives at both laboratory and industrial scales.

The ability of supramolecular host-guest complexes to catalyse organic reactions 
collaboratively with an enzyme is an important goal in the research and discovery
of synthetic enzyme mimics. Herein we present a variety of catalytic tandem
reactions that employ esterases, lipases or alcohol dehydrogenases and gold(I) or
ruthenium(II) complexes encapsulated in a Ga(4)L(6) tetrahedral supramolecular
cluster. The host-guest complexes are tolerated well by the enzymes and, in the
case of the gold(I) host-guest complex, show improved reactivity relative to the 
free cationic guest. We propose that supramolecular encapsulation of
organometallic complexes prevents their diffusion into the bulk solution, where
they can bind amino-acid residues on the proteins and potentially compromise
their activity. Our observations underline the advantages of the supramolecular
approach and suggest that encapsulation of reactive complexes may provide a
general strategy for carrying out classic organic reactions in the presence of
biocatalysts.

A divergent approach to the synthesis of the yohimbinoid alkaloids venenatine and

The yohimbinoid alkaloids continue to receive considerable attention from the
synthetic community because of their interesting chemical structures and varied
biological activity. Although there are several elegant syntheses of certain
members of this group of alkaloids, a truly unified approach has yet to be
developed. In short, general approaches to this compound class are hampered by a 
lack of complete control in setting the C(3) stereocentre at a late stage.
Herein, we report that a functionalized hydrindanone enables a divergent strategy
that builds on existing precedent to address this long-standing challenge.
Utilizing an aminonitrile intermediate, the stereochemistry at C(3) of the
yohimbinoid skeleton can be controlled effectively in a Pictet-Spengler reaction.
We applied this approach to the first total syntheses of the C(3) epimeric
natural products venenatine and alstovenine.

Transition-metal catalysis is founded on the principle that electron donation
from a metal to a ligand is accepted by an antibonding orbital of the ligand,
thereby weakening one of the bonds in the ligand. Without this, the initial step 
of bond activation in many catalytic processes would simply not occur. This
concept is enshrined in the well-accepted Dewar-Chatt-Duncanson model of
transition-metal bonding. We present herein experimental and computational
evidence for the first true violation of the Dewar-Chatt-Duncanson bonding model,
found in a π-diborene complex in which an electron-rich group 10 metal donates
electrons into an empty bonding π orbital on the ligand, and thereby strengthens 
the bond. The complex is also the first transition-metal complex to contain a
bound diborene, a species not isolated before, either in its free form or bound
to a metal.

Mechanical forces along a polymer backbone can be used to bring about remarkable 
reactivity in embedded mechanically active functional groups, but little
attention has been paid to how a given polymer backbone delivers that force to
the reactant. Here, single-molecule force spectroscopy was used to directly
quantify and compare the forces associated with the ring opening of gem-dibromo
and gem-dichlorocyclopropanes affixed along the backbone of cis-polynorbornene
and cis-polybutadiene. The critical force for isomerization drops by about
one-third in the polynorbornene scaffold relative to polybutadiene. The root of
the effect lies in more efficient chemomechanical coupling through the
polynorbornene backbone, which acts as a phenomenological lever with greater
mechanical advantage than polybutadiene. The experimental results are supported
computationally and provide the foundation for a new strategy by which to
engineer mechanochemical reactivity.

Developing efficient catalytic processes to convert methane into useful
feedstocks relies critically upon devising new coupling processes that use
abundant, thermodynamically 'mild' oxidants together with selective catalysts. We
report here on elemental sulfur as a promising 'soft' oxidant for selective
methane conversion to ethylene over MoS(2), RuS(2), TiS(2), PdS and Pd/ZrO(2)
catalysts. Experiments and density functional theory reveal that methane
conversion is directly correlated with surface metal-sulfur bond strengths.
Surfaces with weakly bound sulfur are more basic and activate methane C-H bonds
more readily. In contrast, experimental and theoretical selectivities scale
inversely with surface metal-sulfur bond strengths, and surfaces with the
strongest metal-sulfur bonds afford the highest ethylene selectivities. High
CH(4)/S ratios, short contact times and the provision of a support maximizes the 
coupling of CH(x) intermediates and selectivity to ethylene, because these
conditions yield surfaces with stronger metal-sulfur bonding (for example,
Pd(16)S(7)), which suppresses the over-oxidation of methane.

Enzymatic catalysis and homogeneous catalysis offer complementary means to
address synthetic challenges, both in chemistry and in biology. Despite its
attractiveness, the implementation of concurrent cascade reactions that combine
an organometallic catalyst with an enzyme has proven challenging because of the
mutual inactivation of both catalysts. To address this, we show that
incorporation of a d(6)-piano stool complex within a host protein affords an
artificial transfer hydrogenase (ATHase) that is fully compatible with and
complementary to natural enzymes, thus enabling efficient concurrent tandem
catalysis. To illustrate the generality of the approach, the ATHase was combined 
with various NADH-, FAD- and haem-dependent enzymes, resulting in orthogonal
redox cascades. Up to three enzymes were integrated in the cascade and combined
with the ATHase with a view to achieving (i) a double stereoselective amine
deracemization, (ii) a horseradish peroxidase-coupled readout of the transfer
hydrogenase activity towards its genetic optimization, (iii) the formation of
L-pipecolic acid from L-lysine and (iv) regeneration of NADH to promote a
monooxygenase-catalysed oxyfunctionalization reaction.

Chemical and structural transformations have long been carried out by milling.
Such mechanochemical steps are now ubiquitous in a number of industries (such as 
the pharmaceutical, chemical and metallurgical industries), and are emerging as
excellent environmentally friendly alternatives to solution-based syntheses.
However, mechanochemical transformations are typically difficult to monitor in
real time, which leaves a large gap in the mechanistic understanding required for
their development. We now report the real-time study of mechanochemical
transformations in a ball mill by means of in situ diffraction of high-energy
synchrotron X-rays. Focusing on the mechanosynthesis of metal-organic frameworks,
we have directly monitored reaction profiles, the formation of intermediates, and
interconversions of framework topologies. Our results reveal that
mechanochemistry is highly dynamic, with reaction rates comparable to or greater 
than those in solution. The technique also enabled us to probe directly how
catalytic additives recently introduced in the mechanosynthesis of metal-organic 
frameworks, such as organic liquids or ionic species, change the reactivity
pathways and kinetics.

Xenon, which is quite inert under ambient conditions, may become reactive under
pressure. The possibility of the formation of stable xenon oxides and silicates
in the interior of the Earth could explain the atmospheric missing xenon paradox.
Using an ab initio evolutionary algorithm, we predict the existence of
thermodynamically stable Xe-O compounds at high pressures (XeO, XeO(2) and XeO(3)
become stable at pressures above 83, 102 and 114 GPa, respectively). Our
calculations indicate large charge transfer in these oxides, suggesting that
large electronegativity difference and high pressure are the key factors
favouring the formation of xenon compounds. However, xenon compounds cannot exist
in the Earth's mantle: xenon oxides are unstable in equilibrium with the metallic
iron occurring in the lower mantle, and xenon silicates are predicted to
decompose spontaneously at all mantle pressures (<136 GPa). However, it is
possible that xenon atoms may be retained at defects in mantle silicates and
oxides.

The pyridine heterocycle continues to play a vital role in the development of
human medicines. More than 100 currently marketed drugs contain this privileged
unit, which remains highly sought after synthetically. We report an efficient
means to access di- and trisubstituted pyridines in an efficient and highly
controlled manner using transient 3,4-pyridyne intermediates. Previous efforts to
employ 3,4-pyridynes for the construction of substituted pyridines were hampered 
by a lack of regiocontrol or the inability to later manipulate an adjacent
directing group. The strategy relies on the use of proximal halide or sulfamate
substituents to perturb pyridyne distortion, which in turn governs
regioselectivities in nucleophilic addition and cycloaddition reactions. After
trapping of the pyridynes generated in situ, the neighbouring directing groups
may be removed or exploited using versatile metal-catalysed cross-coupling
reactions. This methodology now renders 3,4-pyridynes as useful synthetic
building blocks for the creation of highly decorated derivatives of the
medicinally privileged pyridine heterocycle.

The viability of a hydrogen economy depends on the design of efficient catalytic 
systems based on earth-abundant elements. Innovative breakthroughs for hydrogen
evolution based on molecular tetraimine cobalt compounds have appeared in the
past decade. Here we show that such a diimine-dioxime cobalt catalyst can be
grafted to the surface of a carbon nanotube electrode. The resulting
electrocatalytic cathode material mediates H(2) generation (55,000 turnovers in
seven hours) from fully aqueous solutions at low-to-medium overpotentials. This
material is remarkably stable, which allows extensive cycling with preservation
of the grafted molecular complex, as shown by electrochemical studies, X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. This clearly
indicates that grafting provides an increased stability to these cobalt
catalysts, and suggests the possible application of these materials in the
development of technological devices.

Supramolecular gels are topical soft materials involving the reversible formation
of fibrous aggregates using non-covalent interactions. There is significant
interest in controlling the properties of such materials by the formation of
multicomponent systems, which exhibit non-additive properties emerging from
interaction of the components. The use of hydrogen bonding to assemble
supramolecular gels in organic solvents is well established. In contrast, the use
of halogen bonding to trigger supramolecular gel formation in a two-component gel
('co-gel') is essentially unexplored, and forms the basis for this study. Here,
we show that halogen bonding between a pyridyl substituent in a bis(pyridyl urea)
and 1,4-diiodotetrafluorobenzene brings about gelation, even in polar media such 
as aqueous methanol and aqueous dimethylsulfoxide. This demonstrates that halogen
bonding is sufficiently strong to interfere with competing gel-inhibitory
interactions and create a 'tipping point' in gel assembly. Using this concept, we
have prepared a halogen bond donor bis(urea) gelator that forms co-gels with
halogen bond acceptors.

One of the key challenges in chemistry is to break and form bonds selectively in 
complex organic molecules that possess a range of different functional groups. To
do this at the single-molecule level not only provides an opportunity to create
custom nanoscale devices, but offers opportunities for the in-depth study of how 
the molecular electronic structure changes in individual reactions. Here we use a
scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) to induce a sequence of targeted bond
dissociation and formation steps in single thiol-based π-conjugated molecules
adsorbed on a NiAl(110) surface. Furthermore, the electronic resonances of the
resulting species were measured by spatially resolved electronic spectroscopy at 
each reaction step. Specifically, the STM was used to cleave individual acetyl
groups and to form Au-S bonds by manipulating single Au atoms. A detailed
understanding of the Au-S bond and its non-local influence is fundamentally
important for determining the electron transport in thiol-based molecular
junction.

A 'clusters-in-liquid' method for calculating infrared spectra identifies the
proton-transfer mode in acidic aqueous solutions.

In liquid water the transfer of an excess proton between two water molecules
occurs through the Zundel cation, H(2)O···H(+)···OH(2). The proton-transfer mode 
is the asymmetric stretch of the central O···H(+)···O moiety, but there is no
consensus on its identification in the infrared spectra of acidic aqueous
solutions. Also, in experiments with protonated gas-phase water clusters, its
position shifts with cluster size, which makes its relationship with solution
spectra unclear. Here we introduce a 'clusters-in-liquid' approach for
calculating the infrared spectrum from any set of charges, even single protons.
We apply this procedure to multistate empirical valence-bond trajectories of
protonated liquid water and to ab initio molecular dynamics of the protonated
water dimer and hexamer in the gas phase. The calculated proton-transfer mode is 
manifested in both systems as a peak near 1,740 cm(-1), in quantitative agreement
with a band of similar frequency in the experimental infrared spectrum of
protonated water clusters.

Fragment-based ligand and drug discovery predominantly employs sp(2)-rich
compounds covering well-explored regions of chemical space. Despite the ease with
which such fragments can be coupled, this focus on flat compounds is widely cited
as contributing to the attrition rate of the drug discovery process. In contrast,
biologically validated natural products are rich in stereogenic centres and
populate areas of chemical space not occupied by average synthetic molecules.
Here, we have analysed more than 180,000 natural product structures to arrive at 
2,000 clusters of natural-product-derived fragments with high structural
diversity, which resemble natural scaffolds and are rich in sp(3)-configured
centres. The structures of the cluster centres differ from previously explored
fragment libraries, but for nearly half of the clusters representative members
are commercially available. We validate their usefulness for the discovery of
novel ligand and inhibitor types by means of protein X-ray crystallography and
the identification of novel stabilizers of inactive conformations of p38α MAP
kinase and of inhibitors of several phosphatases.

Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes are among the most important
phenomena that control a variety of chemical and biological transformations.
Although extensively studied in a variety of natural systems and discrete metal
complexes, PCET mechanisms are less well codified in the case of purely organic
compounds. Here we report that a planar β,β'-phenylene-bridged hexaphyrin
(1.0.1.0.1.0), a 24 π-electron antiaromatic species termed rosarin, displays
unique redox reactivity on protonation. Specifically, treatment with acid (for
example, HI) yields a 26 π-electron aromatic triprotonated monocationic species
that is produced spontaneously via an intermediate-but stable-25 π-electron
non-aromatic triprotonated monoradical dication. This latter species is also
produced on treatment of the original 24 π-electron antiaromatic starting
material with HCl or HBr. The stepwise nature of the proton-coupled reduction
observed in the planar rosarin stands in marked contrast to that seen for
non-annulated rosarins and other ostensibly antiaromatic expanded porphyrinoids.

Multicyclic peptides are emerging as an exciting platform for drug and targeted
ligand discovery owing to their expected greater target
affinity/selectivity/stability versus linear or monocyclic peptides. However,
although the precise pairing of cysteine residues in proteins is routinely
achieved in nature, the rational pairing of cysteine residues within polypeptides
is a long-standing challenge for the preparation of multicyclic species
containing several disulfide bridges. Here, we present an efficient and
straightforward approach for directing the intermolecular and intramolecular
pairing of cysteine residues within peptides using a minimal CXC motif.
Orthogonal disulfide pairing can be exploited in complex redox media to
rationally produce dimeric peptides and bi/tricyclic peptides from fully reduced 
peptides containing 1-6 cysteine residues. This strategy, which does not rely on 
extensive manipulation of the primary sequence, post-translational modification
or protecting groups, should greatly benefit the development of multicyclic
peptide therapeutics and targeting ligands.

The batch synthesis of inorganic clusters can be both time consuming and limited 
by a lack of reproducibility. Flow-system approaches, now common in organic
synthesis, have not been utilized widely for the synthesis of clusters. Herein we
combine an automated flow process with multiple batch crystallizations for the
screening and scale up of syntheses of polyoxometalates and manganese-based
single-molecule magnets. Scale up of the synthesis of these architectures was
achieved by programming a multiple-pump reactor system to vary reaction
conditions sequentially, and thus explore a larger parameter space in a shorter
time than conventionally possible. Also, the potential for using the array as a
discovery tool is demonstrated. Successful conditions for product isolation were 
identified easily from the array of reactions, and a direct route to 'scale up'
was then immediately available simply by continuous application of these flow
conditions. In all cases, large quantities of phase-pure material were obtained
and the time taken for the discovery, repetition and scale up decreased.

New porous materials such as zeolites, metal-organic frameworks and
mesostructured oxides are of immense practical utility for gas storage,
separations and heterogeneous catalysis. Their extended pore structures enable
selective uptake of molecules or can modify the product selectivity
(regioselectivity or enantioselectivity) of catalyst sites contained within.
However, diffusion within pores can be problematic for biomass and fine
chemicals, and not all catalyst classes can be readily synthesized with pores of 
the correct dimensions. Here, we present a novel approach that adds reactant
selectivity to existing, non-porous oxide catalysts by first grafting the
catalyst particles with single-molecule sacrificial templates, then partially
overcoating the catalyst with a second oxide through atomic layer deposition.
This technique is used to create sieving layers of Al(2)O(3) (thickness,
0.4-0.7 nm) with 'nanocavities' (<2 nm in diameter) on a TiO(2) photocatalyst.
The additional layers result in selectivity (up to 9:1) towards less hindered
reactants in otherwise unselective, competitive photocatalytic oxidations and
transfer hydrogenations.

High-valent oxo-metal complexes are involved in key biochemical processes of
selective oxidation and removal of xenobiotics. The catalytic properties of
cytochrome P-450 and soluble methane monooxygenase enzymes are associated with
oxo species on mononuclear iron haem and diiron non-haem platforms, respectively.
Bio-inspired chemical systems that can reproduce the fascinating ability of these
enzymes to oxidize the strongest C-H bonds are the focus of intense scrutiny. In 
this context, the development of highly oxidizing diiron macrocyclic catalysts
requires a structural determination of the elusive active species and elucidation
of the reaction mechanism. Here we report the preparation of an
Fe(IV)(µ-nitrido)Fe(IV) = O tetraphenylporphyrin cation radical species at
-90 °C, characterized by ultraviolet-visible, electron paramagnetic resonance and
Mössbauer spectroscopies and by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. This
species exhibits a very high activity for oxygen-atom transfer towards alkanes,
including methane. These findings provide a foundation on which to develop
efficient and clean oxidation processes, in particular transformations of the
strongest C-H bonds.

Oxatriquinanes are fused, tricyclic oxonium ions that are known to have
exceptional stability compared to simple alkyl oxonium salts. C-O bonds in ethers
are generally ∼1.43 Å in length, but oxatriquinane has been found to have C-O
bond lengths of 1.54 Å. A search of the Cambridge Structural Database turned up
no bona fide C-O bond length exceeding this value. Computational modelling of
oxatriquinane alongside other alkyl oxonium ions indicated that the electronic
consequences of molecular strain were primarily responsible for the observed bond
elongation. We also show that substitution of the oxatriquinane ring system with 
alkyl groups of increasing steric demand pushes the C-O bond to unheard of
distances, culminating in a tert-butyl derivative at a predicted 1.60 Å. Chemical
synthesis and an X-ray crystallographic study of these compounds validated the
results of the modelling work and, finally, an extraordinary 1.622 Å C-O bond was
observed in 1,4,7-tri-tert-butyloxatriquinane.

Discrete molecular compounds that exhibit both magnetization hysteresis and slow 
magnetic relaxation below a characteristic 'blocking' temperature are known as
single-molecule magnets. These are promising for applications including memory
devices and quantum computing, but require higher spin-inversion barriers and
hysteresis temperatures than currently achieved. After twenty years of research
confined to the d-block transition metals, scientists are moving to the f-block
to generate these properties. We have now prepared, by cation-promoted
self-assembly, a large 5f-3d U(12)Mn(6) cluster that adopts a wheel topology and 
exhibits single-molecule magnet behaviour. This uranium-based molecular wheel
shows an open magnetic hysteresis loop at low temperature, with a non-zero
coercive field (below 4 K) and quantum tunnelling steps (below 2.5 K), which
suggests that uranium might indeed provide a route to magnetic storage devices.
This molecule also represents an interesting model for actinide nanoparticles
occurring in the environment and in spent fuel separation cycles.

The lithium–O2 ‘semi-fuel’ cell based on the reversible reaction of Li and O2 to 
form Li2O2 can theoretically provide energy densities that exceed those of Li-ion
cells by up to a factor of five. A key limitation that differentiates it from
other lithium batteries is that it requires effective catalysts (or ‘promoters’) 
to enable oxygen reduction and evolution. Here, we report the synthesis of a
novel metallic mesoporous oxide using surfactant templating that shows promising 
catalytic activity and results in a cathode with a high reversible capacity of
10,000 mAh g(−1) (∼1,000 mAh g(−1) with respect to the total electrode weight
including the peroxide product). This oxide also has a lower charge potential for
oxygen evolution from Li2O2 than pure carbon. The properties are explained by the
high fraction of surface defect active sites in the metallic oxide, and its
unique morphology and variable oxygen stoichiometry. This strategy for creating
porous metallic oxides may pave the way to new cathode architectures for the
Li–O2 cell.

Site-selective functionalizations of complex small molecules can generate
targeted derivatives with exceptional step efficiency, but general strategies for
maximizing selectivity in this context are rare. Here, we report that
site-selectivity can be tuned by simply modifying the electronic nature of the
reagents. A Hammett analysis is consistent with linking this phenomenon to the
Hammond postulate: electronic tuning to a more product-like transition state
amplifies site-discriminating interactions between a reagent and its substrate.
This strategy transformed a minimally site-selective acylation reaction into a
highly selective and thus preparatively useful one. Electronic tuning of both an 
acylpyridinium donor and its carboxylate counterion further promoted
site-divergent functionalizations. With these advances, we achieve a range of
modifications to just one of the many hydroxyl groups appended to the ion
channel-forming natural product amphotericin B. Thus, electronic tuning of
reagents represents an effective strategy for discovering and optimizing
site-selective functionalization reactions.

Selectivity in the catalytic functionalization of complex molecules is a major
challenge in chemical synthesis. The problem is magnified when there are several 
possible stereochemical outcomes and when similar functional groups occur
repeatedly within the same molecule. Selective polyene oxidation provides an
archetypical example of this challenge. Historically, enzymatic catalysis has
provided the only precedents. Although non-enzymatic catalysts that meet some of 
these challenges became known, a comprehensive solution has remained elusive.
Here, we describe low molecular weight peptide-based catalysts, discovered
through a combinatorial synthesis and screening protocol, that exhibit site- and 
enantioselective oxidation of certain positions of various isoprenols. This
diversity-based approach, which exhibits features reminiscent of the directed
evolution of enzymes, delivers catalysts that compare favourably to the
state-of-the-art for the asymmetric oxidation of these compounds. Moreover, the
approach culminated in catalysts that exhibit alternative-site selectivity in
comparison to oxidation catalysts previously described.

The hydroxyl radical (OH) is one of the most interesting molecules in molecular
dynamics. In particular, inelastic collisions of free radicals such as OH are
profoundly important in environments ranging from combustion to astrochemistry.
However, measuring the velocities of OH molecules in specific internal quantum
states has proven to be very difficult. A method that can provide this important 
information is velocity-map imaging. Although this technique is very widely
applicable in principle, it does require a sensitive and selective
laser-ionization scheme. Here we show that, under the right conditions,
velocity-map imaging can be applied to the study of the inelastic scattering of
OH using crossed-molecular-beam methods. We measure fully quantum-state-specified
product angular distributions for OH collisions with helium and argon. The
agreement between exact close-coupling quantum scattering calculations on ab
initio potential energy surfaces and experimental data is generally very
satisfactory, except for scattering in the most forward directions.

The dynamic chemical diversity of elements, ions and molecules that form the
basis of life offers both a challenge and an opportunity for study.
Small-molecule fluorescent probes can make use of selective, bioorthogonal
chemistries to report on specific analytes in cells and in more complex
biological specimens. These probes offer powerful reagents to interrogate the
physiology and pathology of reactive chemical species in their native
environments with minimal perturbation to living systems. This Review presents a 
survey of tools and tactics for using such probes to detect biologically
important chemical analytes. We highlight design criteria for effective chemical 
tools for use in biological applications as well as gaps for future exploration.

A combination of the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis could 
enable the development of sustainable catalysts with novel reactivity and
selectivity. Although heterogeneous catalysts are often recycled more easily than
their homogeneous counterparts, they can be difficult to apply in traditional
organic reactions and modification of their properties towards a desired
reactivity is, at best, complex. In contrast, tuning the properties of
homogeneous catalysts by, for example, modifying the ligands that coordinate a
metal centre is better understood. Here, using olefin cyclopropanation reactions 
catalysed by dendrimer-encapsulated Au nanoclusters as examples, we demonstrate
that changing the dendrimer properties allows the catalytic reactivity to be
tuned in a similar fashion to ligand modification in a homogeneous catalyst.
Furthermore, we show that these heterogeneous catalysts employed in a fixed-bed
flow reactor allow fine control over the residence time of the reactants and thus
enables the control over product distribution in a way that is not easily
available for homogeneous catalysts.

RNA performs important cellular functions in contemporary life forms. Its ability
to act both as a catalyst and a storage mechanism for genetic information is also
an important part of the RNA world hypothesis. Compartmentalization within modern
cells allows the local concentration of RNA to be controlled and it has been
suggested that this was also important in early life forms. Here, we mimic
intracellular compartmentalization and macromolecular crowding by partitioning
RNA in an aqueous two-phase system (ATPS). We show that the concentration of RNA 
is enriched by up to 3,000-fold in the dextran-rich phase of a polyethylene
glycol/dextran ATPS and demonstrate that this can lead to approximately 70-fold
increase in the rate of ribozyme cleavage. This rate enhancement can be tuned by 
the relative volumes of the two phases in the ATPS. Our observations support the 
importance of compartmentalization in the attainment of function in an RNA World 
as well as in modern biology.

Industrially, the artificial fixation of atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia is
carried out using the Haber-Bosch process, but this process requires high
temperatures and pressures, and consumes more than 1% of the world's power
production. Therefore the search is on for a more environmentally benign process 
that occurs under milder conditions. Here, we report that a Ru-loaded electride
[Ca(24)Al(28)O(64)](4+)(e(-))(4) (Ru/C12A7:e(-)), which has high
electron-donating power and chemical stability, works as an efficient catalyst
for ammonia synthesis. Highly efficient ammonia synthesis is achieved with a
catalytic activity that is an order of magnitude greater than those of other
previously reported Ru-loaded catalysts and with almost half the reaction
activation energy. Kinetic analysis with infrared spectroscopy reveals that
C12A7:e(-) markedly enhances N(2) dissociation on Ru by the back donation of
electrons and that the poisoning of ruthenium surfaces by hydrogen adatoms can be
suppressed effectively because of the ability of C12A7:e(-) to store hydrogen
reversibly.

The amyloid protein aggregation associated with diseases such as Alzheimer's,
Parkinson's and type II diabetes (among many others) features a bewildering
variety of β-sheet-rich structures in transition from native proteins to ordered 
oligomers and fibres. The variation in the amino-acid sequences of the
β-structures presents a challenge to developing a model system of β-sheets for
the study of various amyloid aggregates. Here, we introduce a family of robust
β-sheet macrocycles that can serve as a platform to display a variety of
heptapeptide sequences from different amyloid proteins. We have tailored these
amyloid β-sheet mimics (ABSMs) to antagonize the aggregation of various amyloid
proteins, thereby reducing the toxicity of amyloid aggregates. We describe the
structures and inhibitory properties of ABSMs containing amyloidogenic peptides
from the amyloid-β peptide associated with Alzheimer's disease,
β(2)-microglobulin associated with dialysis-related amyloidosis, α-synuclein
associated with Parkinson's disease, islet amyloid polypeptide associated with
type II diabetes, human and yeast prion proteins, and Tau, which forms
neurofibrillary tangles.

Bistable compounds that exist in two interchangeable phases under identical
conditions can act as switches under external stimuli. Among such switchable
materials, coordination complexes have energy levels (or phases) that are
determined by the electronic states of their constituent metal ions and ligands. 
They can exhibit multiple bistabilities and hold promise in the search for
multifaceted materials that display different properties in different phases,
accessible through the application of contrasting external stimuli. Molecular
systems that exhibit both thermo- and photoinduced magnetic bistabilities are
excellent candidates for such systems. Here we describe a cyanide-bridged [CoFe] 
one-dimensional chiral coordination polymer that displays both magnetic and
electric bistabilities in the same temperature range. Both the electric and
magnetic switching probably arise from the same electron-transfer coupled
spin-transition phenomenon, which enables the reversible conversion between an
insulating diamagnetic phase and either a semiconducting paramagnetic
(thermoinduced) or a type of ferromagnetic single-chain magnet (photoinduced)
state.

Non-stop carbocationic polycyclizations of isoprenoids have been called the most 
complex chemical reactions occurring in nature. We describe a strategy for the
initiation of tail-to-head polycyclization that relies on the sequestration of
the counteranion away from the carbocation, which allows full propagation of the 
cationic charge. If the anion is mobile, Coulombic forces hold this species in
close proximity to the carbocation and cause preemptive termination through
elimination. Anion sequestration is crucial for effecting the biomimetic
synthesis of complex and unstable terpenes, including the highly strained
funebrenes. This study illustrates the deleterious role of the counterion in
tail-to-head carbocationic polycyclization reactions, which to the best of our
knowledge has not been rigorously explored. These observations are also expected 
to find use in the design and control of cationic polycyclization along
biosynthetic pathways that have previously been inaccessible in bulk solvent.

A plausible consequence of the rugged folding energy landscapes inherent to
biomolecules is that there may be more than one functionally competent folded
state. Indeed, molecule-to-molecule variations in the folding dynamics of enzymes
and ribozymes have recently been identified in single-molecule experiments, but
without systematic quantification or an understanding of their structural origin.
Here, using concepts from glass physics and complementary clustering analysis, we
provide a quantitative method to analyse single-molecule fluorescence resonance
energy transfer (smFRET) data, thereby probing the isomerization dynamics of
Holliday junctions, which display such heterogeneous dynamics over a long
observation time (T(obs) ≈ 40 s). We show that the ergodicity of Holliday
junction dynamics is effectively broken and that their conformational space is
partitioned into a folding network of kinetically disconnected clusters. Theory
suggests that the persistent heterogeneity of Holliday junction dynamics is a
consequence of internal multiloops with varying sizes and flexibilities frozen by
Mg(2+) ions. An annealing experiment using Mg(2+) pulses lends support to this
idea by explicitly showing that interconversions between trajectories with
different patterns can be induced.

De novo proteins provide a unique opportunity to investigate the
structure-function relationships of metalloproteins in a minimal, well-defined
and controlled scaffold. Here, we describe the rational programming of function
in a de novo designed di-iron carboxylate protein from the Due Ferri family.
Originally created to catalyse the O(2)-dependent, two-electron oxidation of
hydroquinones, the protein was reprogrammed to catalyse the selective
N-hydroxylation of arylamines by remodelling the substrate access cavity and
introducing a critical third His ligand to the metal-binding cavity. Additional
second- and third-shell modifications were required to stabilize the His ligand
in the core of the protein. These structural changes resulted in at least a
10(6)-fold increase in the relative rate between the arylamine N-hydroxylation
and hydroquinone oxidation reactions. This result highlights the potential for
using de novo proteins as scaffolds for future investigations of the geometric
and electronic factors that influence the catalytic tuning of di-iron active
sites.

Prebiotic synthesis of simple sugars by photoredox systems chemistry.

A recent synthesis of activated pyrimidine ribonucleotides under prebiotically
plausible conditions relied on mixed oxygenous and nitrogenous systems chemistry.
As it stands, this synthesis provides support for the involvement of RNA in the
origin of life, but such support would be considerably strengthened if the sugar 
building blocks for the synthesis--glycolaldehyde and glyceraldehyde--could be
shown to derive from one carbon feedstock molecules using similarly mixed
oxygenous and nitrogenous systems chemistry. Here, we show that these sugars can 
be formed from hydrogen cyanide by ultraviolet irradiation in the presence of
cyanometallates in a remarkable systems chemistry process. Using copper cyanide
complexes, the process operates catalytically to disproportionate hydrogen
cyanide, first generating the sugars and then sequestering them as simple
derivatives.

Understanding the mechanism by which porous solids trap harmful gases such as
CO(2) and SO(2) is essential for the design of new materials for their selective 
removal. Materials functionalized with amine groups dominate this field, largely 
because of their potential to form carbamates through H(2)N(δ(-))···C(δ(+))O(2)
interactions, thereby trapping CO(2) covalently. However, the use of these
materials is energy-intensive, with significant environmental impact. Here, we
report a non-amine-containing porous solid (NOTT-300) in which hydroxyl groups
within pores bind CO(2) and SO(2) selectively. In situ powder X-ray diffraction
and inelastic neutron scattering studies, combined with modelling, reveal that
hydroxyl groups bind CO(2) and SO(2) through the formation of
O=C(S)=O(δ(-))···H(δ(+))-O hydrogen bonds, which are reinforced by weak
supramolecular interactions with C-H atoms on the aromatic rings of the
framework. This offers the potential for the application of new
'easy-on/easy-off' capture systems for CO(2) and SO(2) that carry fewer economic 
and environmental penalties.

Recent years have witnessed the introduction of spatiotemporal spectroscopy for
the characterization of catalysts at work at previously unattainable resolution
and sensitivity. They have revealed that heterogeneous catalysts are more
heterogeneous than often expected. Dynamic changes in the nature of active sites,
such as their distribution and accessibility, occur both between and within
particles. Scientists now have micro- and nanospectroscopic methods at hand to
improve the understanding of catalyst heterogeneities and exploit them in
catalyst design. Here we review the latest developments within this lively field.
The trends include detection of single particles or molecules, super-resolution
imaging, the transition from two- to three-dimensional imaging, selective
staining, integration of spectroscopy with electron microscopy or scanning probe 
methods, and measuring under realistic reaction conditions. Such experimental
approaches change the hitherto somewhat static picture of heterogeneous catalysis
into one that acknowledges that catalysts behave almost like living
objects--explaining why many characterization methods from the life sciences are 
being incorporated into catalysis research.

Radical reactions are a powerful class of chemical transformations. However, the 
formation of radical species to initiate these reactions has often required the
use of stoichiometric amounts of toxic reagents, such as tributyltin hydride.
Recently, the use of visible-light-mediated photoredox catalysis to generate
radical species has become popular, but the scope of these radical precursors has
been limited. Here, we describe the identification of reaction conditions under
which photocatalysts such as fac-Ir(ppy)3 can be utilized to form radicals from
unactivated alkyl, alkenyl and aryl iodides. The generated radicals undergo
reduction via hydrogen atom abstraction or reductive cyclization. The reaction
protocol utilizes only inexpensive reagents, occurs under mild reaction
conditions, and shows exceptional functional group tolerance. Reaction efficiency
is maintained upon scale-up and decreased catalyst loading, and the reaction time
can be significantly shortened when the reaction is performed in a flow reactor.

Membrane proteins mediate a variety of cellular responses to extracellular
signals. Although membrane proteins are studied intensively for their values as
disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets, in situ investigation of the binding 
kinetics of membrane proteins with their ligands has been a challenge.
Traditional approaches isolate membrane proteins and then study them ex situ,
which does not reflect accurately their native structures and functions. We
present a label-free plasmonic microscopy method to map the local binding
kinetics of membrane proteins in their native environment. This analytical method
can perform simultaneous plasmonic and fluorescence imaging, and thus make it
possible to combine the strengths of both label-based and label-free techniques
in one system. Using this method, we determined the distribution of membrane
proteins on the surface of single cells and the local binding kinetic constants
of different membrane proteins. Furthermore, we studied the polarization of the
membrane proteins on the cell surface during chemotaxis.

The energy barrier in singlet fission can be overcome through coherent coupling
and entropic gain.

One strategy to improve solar-cell efficiency is to generate two excited
electrons from just one photon through singlet fission, which is the conversion
of a singlet (S(1)) into two triplet (T(1)) excitons. For efficient singlet
fission it is believed that the cumulative energy of the triplet states should be
no more than that of S(1). However, molecular analogues that satisfy this
energetic requirement do not show appreciable singlet fission, whereas
crystalline tetracene displays endothermic singlet fission with near-unity
quantum yield. Here we probe singlet fission in tetracene by directly following
the intermediate multiexciton (ME) state. The ME state is isoenergetic with
2 × T(1), but fission is not activated thermally. Rather, an S(1) ⇔ ME
superposition formed through a quantum-coherent process allows access to the
higher-energy ME. We attribute entropic gain in crystalline tetracene as the
driving force for the subsequent decay of S(1) ⇔ ME into 2 × T(1), which leads to
a high singlet-fission yield.

The identification and differentiation of a large number of distinct molecular
species with high temporal and spatial resolution is a major challenge in
biomedical science. Fluorescence microscopy is a powerful tool, but its
multiplexing ability is limited by the number of spectrally distinguishable
fluorophores. Here, we used (deoxy)ribonucleic acid (DNA)-origami technology to
construct submicrometre nanorods that act as fluorescent barcodes. We demonstrate
that spatial control over the positioning of fluorophores on the surface of a
stiff DNA nanorod can produce 216 distinct barcodes that can be decoded
unambiguously using epifluorescence or total internal reflection fluorescence
microscopy. Barcodes with higher spatial information density were demonstrated
via the construction of super-resolution barcodes with features spaced by ∼40 nm.
One species of the barcodes was used to tag yeast surface receptors, which
suggests their potential applications as in situ imaging probes for diverse
biomolecular and cellular entities in their native environments.

A major challenge in the implementation of laboratory-designed catalysts is the
scale-up into technically relevant forms. Advanced characterization is essential 
to understand and optimize catalyst assembly and function in industrial reactors.
This Article presents an integrated approach to visualizing millimetre-sized
extrudates and granules of a hierarchical MFI-type zeolite, displaying trimodal
networks of micropores (0.56 nm), intracrystalline mesopores (∼10 nm) and
macropores (∼200-300 nm). As exemplified for the conversion of methanol to
olefins, the hierarchical zeolite yields a superior performance compared to its
conventional analogue. The combination of dedicated specimen preparation with
state-of-the-art optical, X-ray and electron-based microscopic and tomographic
techniques proves a powerful methodology to reveal otherwise inaccessible
information regarding structural organization over the whole range of length
scales. It is expected that these tools will play a crucial role in the
rationalization of scale-up principles in catalyst development.

Small organic and metal-containing molecules (molecular mass <1,000) can catalyse
synthetically useful reactions with the high levels of stereoselectivity
typically associated with macromolecular enzymatic catalysts. Whereas enzymes are
generally understood to accelerate reactions and impart selectivity as they
stabilize specific transition structures through networks of cooperative
interactions, enantioselectivity with chiral, small-molecule catalysts is
rationalized typically by the steric destabilization of all but one dominant
pathway. However, it is increasingly apparent that stabilizing effects also play 
an important role in small-molecule catalysis, although the mechanistic
characterization of such systems is rare. Here, we show that arylpyrrolidino
amido thiourea catalysts catalyse the enantioselective nucleophilic ring opening 
of episulfonium ions by indoles. Evidence is provided for the selective
transition-state stabilization of the major pathway by the thiourea catalyst in
the rate- and selectivity-determining step. Enantioselectivity is achieved
through a network of attractive anion binding, cation-π and hydrogen-bond
interactions between the catalyst and the reacting components in the
transition-structure assembly.

During the formation of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), metal centres can
coordinate with the intended organic linkers, but also with solvent molecules. In
this case, subsequent activation by removal of the solvent molecules creates
unsaturated 'open' metal sites known to have a strong affinity for CO(2)
molecules, but their interactions are still poorly understood. Common force
fields typically underestimate by as much as two orders of magnitude the
adsorption of CO(2) in open-site Mg-MOF-74, which has emerged as a promising MOF 
for CO(2) capture. Here we present a systematic procedure to generate force
fields using high-level quantum chemical calculations. Monte Carlo simulations
based on an ab initio force field generated for CO(2) in Mg-MOF-74 shed some
light on the interpretation of thermodynamic data from flue gas in this material.
The force field describes accurately the chemistry of the open metal sites, and
is transferable to other structures. This approach may serve in molecular
simulations in general and in the study of fluid-solid interactions.

Early diagnosis of tuberculosis can dramatically reduce both its transmission and
the associated death rate. The extremely slow growth rate of the causative
pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), however, makes this challenging at
the point of care, particularly in resource-limited settings. Here we report the 
use of BlaC (an enzyme naturally expressed/secreted by tubercle bacilli) as a
marker and the design of BlaC-specific fluorogenic substrates as probes for Mtb
detection. These probes showed an enhancement by 100-200 times in fluorescence
emission on BlaC activation and a greater than 1,000-fold selectivity for BlaC
over TEM-1 β-lactamase, an important factor in reducing false-positive diagnoses.
Insight into the BlaC specificity was revealed by successful co-crystallization
of the probe/enzyme mutant complex. A refined green fluorescent probe (CDG-OMe)
enabled the successful detection of live pathogen in less than ten minutes, even 
in unprocessed human sputum. This system offers the opportunity for the rapid,
accurate detection of very low numbers of Mtb for the clinical diagnosis of
tuberculosis in sputum and other specimens.

The success of solar fuel technology relies on the development of efficient
catalysts that can oxidize or reduce water. All molecular water-oxidation
catalysts reported thus far are transition-metal complexes, however, here we
report catalytic water oxidation to give oxygen by a fully organic compound, the 
N(5)-ethylflavinium ion, Et-Fl(+). Evolution of oxygen was detected during bulk
electrolysis of aqueous Et-Fl(+) solutions at several potentials above +1.9 V
versus normal hydrogen electrode. The catalysis was found to occur on glassy
carbon and platinum working electrodes, but no catalysis was observed on
fluoride-doped tin-oxide electrodes. Based on spectroelectrochemical results and 
preliminary calculations with density functional theory, one possible mechanistic
route is proposed in which the oxygen evolution occurs from a peroxide
intermediate formed between the oxidized flavin pseudobase and the oxidized
carbon electrode. These findings offer an organic alternative to the traditional 
water-oxidation catalysts based on transition metals.

Emerging trends in drug discovery are prompting a renewed interest in natural
products as a source of chemical diversity and lead structures. However, owing to
the structural complexity of many natural compounds, the synthesis of derivatives
is not easily realized. Here, we demonstrate a conceptually new approach using
oligonucleotides as aptameric protective groups. These block several
functionalities by non-covalent interactions in a complex molecule and enable the
highly chemo- and regioselective derivatization (>99%) of natural antibiotics in 
a single synthetic step with excellent conversions of up to 83%. This technique
reveals an important structure-activity relationship in neamine-based antibiotics
and should help both to accelerate the discovery of new biologically active
structures and to avoid potentially costly and cumbersome synthetic routes.

Virus-like particles (VLPs) have emerged as important and versatile architectures
for chemical manipulation in the development of functional hybrid nanostructures.
Here we demonstrate a successful site-selective initiation of atom-transfer
radical polymerization reactions to form an addressable polymer constrained
within the interior cavity of a VLP. Potentially, this protein-polymer hybrid of 
P22 and cross-linked poly(2-aminoethyl methacrylate) could be useful as a new
high-density delivery vehicle for the encapsulation and delivery of
small-molecule cargos. In particular, the encapsulated polymer can act as a
scaffold for the attachment of small functional molecules, such as fluorescein
dye or the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent
Gd-diethylenetriaminepentacetate, through reactions with its pendant primary
amine groups. Using this approach, a significant increase in the labelling
density of the VLP, compared to that of previous modifications of VLPs, can be
achieved. These results highlight the use of multimeric protein-polymer
conjugates for their potential utility in the development of VLP-based MRI
contrast agents with the possibility of loading other cargos.

Imidazole, a subunit of histidine, plays a crucial role in proton-relay processes
that are important for various biological activities, such as metal efflux, viral
replication and photosynthesis. We show here how an imidazolyl ring incorporated 
into a rotary switch based on a hydrazone enables a switching cascade that
involves proton relay between two different switches. The switching process
starts with a single input, zinc(II), that initiates an E/Z isomerization in the 
hydrazone system through a coordination-coupled proton transfer. The resulting
imidazolium ring is unusually acidic and, through proton relay, activates the E/Z
isomerization of a non-coordinating pyridine-containing hydrazone switch. We
hypothesize that the reduction in the acid dissociation constant of the
imidazolium ring results from a combination of electrostatic and conformational
effects, the study of which might help elucidate the proton-coupled
electron-transfer mechanism in photosynthetic bacteria.

Biochemical systems are adaptable, capable of reconstitution at all levels to
achieve the functions associated with life. Synthetic chemical systems are more
limited in their ability to reorganize to achieve new functions; they can
reconfigure to bind an added substrate (template effect) or one binding event may
modulate a receptor's affinity for a second substrate (allosteric effect). Here
we describe a synthetic chemical system that is capable of structural
reconstitution on receipt of one anionic signal (perchlorate) to create a tight
binding pocket for another anion (chloride). The complex, barrel-like structure
of the chloride receptor is templated by five perchlorate anions. This
second-order templation phenomenon allows chemical networks to be envisaged that 
express more complex responses to chemical signals than is currently feasible.

Self-sorting on surfaces is one of the big challenges that must be addressed in
preparing the organic materials of the future. Here, we introduce a theoretical
framework for templated self-sorting on surfaces, and validate it experimentally.
In our approach, the transcription of two-dimensional information encoded in a
monolayer on the surface into three-dimensional supramolecular architectures is
quantified by the intrinsic templation efficiency, a thickness-independent value 
describing the fidelity of transcription per layer. The theoretical prediction
that exceedingly high intrinsic efficiencies will be needed to experimentally
observe templated self-sorting is then confirmed experimentally. Intrinsic
templation efficiencies of up to 97%, achieved with a newly introduced templated 
synthesis strategy, result in maximal 47% effective templation efficiency at a
thickness of 70 layers. The functional relevance of surface-templated
self-sorting and meaningful dependences of templation efficiencies on structural 
modifications are demonstrated.

In heterogeneous catalysis, rates with Arrhenius-like temperature dependence are 
ubiquitous. Compensation phenomena, which arise from the linear correlation
between the apparent activation energy and the logarithm of the apparent
pre-exponential factor, are also common. Here, we study the origin of
compensation and find a similar dependence on the rate-limiting surface coverage 
term for each Arrhenius parameter. This result is derived from an experimental
determination of the surface coverage of oxygen and chlorine species using
temporal analysis of products and prompt gamma activation analysis during HCl
oxidation to Cl(2) on a RuO(2) catalyst. It is also substantiated by theory. We
find that compensation phenomena appear when the effect on the apparent
activation energy caused by changes in surface coverage is balanced out by the
entropic configuration contributions of the surface. This result sets a new
paradigm in understanding the interplay of compensation effects with the kinetics
of heterogeneously catalysed processes.

Reactions with the unstable and highly reactive zwitterionic intermediates
generated in processes catalysed by transition metals are providing new
opportunities for molecular constructions. Insertion reactions involve the
collapse of zwitterionic intermediates, but trapping them would allow structural 
elaborations that are not currently available. To synthesize complex molecules in
this manner, reactive electrophiles can be used to trap the zwitterionic
intermediates. Here, we describe the use of imines, activated by chiral
organocatalysts, and a highly efficient integrated rhodium and chiral Brønsted
acid co-catalysed process to trap zwitterionic intermediates that have been
proposed previously to undergo a formal C-H insertion reaction, allowing us to
obtain polyfunctionalized indole and oxindole derivatives in a single step with
excellent diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity.

Graphene has exceptional electronic, optical, mechanical and thermal properties, 
which provide it with great potential for use in electronic, optoelectronic and
sensing applications. The chemical functionalization of graphene has been
investigated with a view to controlling its electronic properties and
interactions with other materials. Covalent modification of graphene by organic
diazonium salts has been used to achieve these goals, but because graphene
comprises only a single atomic layer, it is strongly influenced by the underlying
substrate. Here, we show a stark difference in the rate of electron-transfer
reactions with organic diazonium salts for monolayer graphene supported on a
variety of substrates. Reactions proceed rapidly for graphene supported on SiO(2)
and Al(2)O(3) (sapphire), but negligibly on alkyl-terminated and hexagonal boron 
nitride (hBN) surfaces, as shown by Raman spectroscopy. We also develop a model
of reactivity based on substrate-induced electron-hole puddles in graphene, and
achieve spatial patterning of chemical reactions in graphene by patterning the
substrate.

Binding carbohydrates from water is a difficult task, even for the natural
carbohydrate-binding proteins known as lectins. The design of synthetic lectin
mimics is correspondingly challenging, especially if good selectivities are
required. In previous work we showed that success is possible, but only for
complex polycyclic architectures that require lengthy and low-yielding syntheses;
for example, one glucose-selective system was made in 21 steps and only 0.1%
overall yield. Here we report the discovery of a simple monocyclic host that
matches the earlier designs, but is far more accessible as it is prepared in just
five steps and 23% overall yield. The new synthetic lectin binds glucose with
excellent selectivity versus other common monosaccharides (for example, ~50:1
versus galactose) and sufficient affinity for glucose sensing at the
concentrations found in blood. It also features a built-in signalling system in
the form of strong and guest-dependent fluorescence emission. The effectiveness
and simplicity of this molecule suggests the potential for development into a new
methodology for practical glucose monitoring.

Hydrogen bonds are key constituents of biomolecular structures, and their
response to external perturbations may reveal important insights about the most
stable components of a structure. NMR spectroscopy can probe hydrogen bond
deformations at very high resolution through hydrogen bond scalar couplings
(HBCs). However, the small size of HBCs has so far prevented a comprehensive
quantitative characterization of protein hydrogen bonds as a function of the
basic thermodynamic parameters of pressure and temperature. Using a newly
developed pressure cell, we have now mapped pressure- and temperature-dependent
changes of 31 hydrogen bonds in ubiquitin by measuring HBCs with very high
precision. Short-range hydrogen bonds are only moderately perturbed, but many
hydrogen bonds with large sequence separations (high contact order) show greater 
changes. In contrast, other high-contact-order hydrogen bonds remain virtually
unaffected. The specific stabilization of such topologically important
connections may present a general principle with which to achieve protein
stability and to preserve structural integrity during protein function.

Bryostatin is a unique lead in the development of potentially transformative
therapies for cancer, Alzheimer's disease and the eradication of HIV/AIDS.
However, the clinical use of bryostatin has been hampered by its limited supply, 
difficulties in accessing clinically relevant derivatives, and side effects.
Here, we address these problems through the step-economical syntheses of seven
members of a new family of designed bryostatin analogues using a highly
convergent Prins-macrocyclization strategy. We also demonstrate for the first
time that such analogues effectively induce latent HIV activation in vitro with
potencies similar to or better than bryostatin. Significantly, these analogues
are up to 1,000-fold more potent in inducing latent HIV expression than
prostratin, the current clinical candidate for latent virus induction. This study
provides the first demonstration that designed, synthetically accessible
bryostatin analogues could serve as superior candidates for the eradication of
HIV/AIDS through induction of latent viral reservoirs in conjunction with current
antiretroviral therapy.

Organic semiconducting materials based on polymers and molecular systems
containing an electronically delocalized structure are the basis of emerging
optoelectronic technologies such as plastic solar cells and flexible transistors.
For isolated molecules, guidelines exist that rely on the molecular formula to
tailor the frontier (highest occupied or lowest unoccupied) molecular orbital
energy levels and optical absorption profiles. Much less control can be achieved 
over relevant properties, however, as one makes the transition to the ensemble
behaviour characteristic of the solid state. Polymeric materials are also
challenging owing to the statistical description of the average number of repeat 
units. Here we draw attention to the limitations of molecular formulae as
predictive tools for achieving properties relevant to device performances.
Illustrative examples highlight the relevance of organization across multiple
length scales, and how device performances--although relevant for practical
applications--poorly reflect the success of molecular design.

Antibiotics play a significant role in human health because of their ability to
treat life-threatening bacterial infections. The growing problems with antibiotic
resistance have made the development of new antibiotics a World Health
Organization priority. Marinomycin A is a member of a new class of
bis-salicylate-containing polyene macrodiolides, which have potent antibiotic
activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and
vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. Herein, we describe a triply
convergent synthesis of this agent using the salicylate as a novel molecular
switch for the chemoselective construction of the macrodiolide. This strategy
raises new questions regarding the biosynthetic role of the salicylate and its
potential impact on the mechanism of action of these types of agents. For
instance, in contrast to penicillin, which enhances the electrophilicity of the
cyclic amide through ring strain, salicylates reduce the electrophilicity of the 
aryl ester through an intramolecular resonance-assisted hydrogen bond to provide 
an amide surrogate.

Organic semiconductors are suitable candidates for printable, flexible and
large-area electronics. Alongside attaining an improved device performance, to
confer a multifunctional nature to the employed materials is key for
organic-based logic applications. Here we report on the engineering of an
electronic structure in a semiconducting film by blending two molecular
components, a photochromic diarylethene derivative and a poly(3-hexylthiophene)
(P3HT) matrix, to attain phototunable and bistable energy levels for the P3HT's
hole transport. As a proof-of-concept we exploited this blend as a semiconducting
material in organic thin-film transistors. The device illumination at defined
wavelengths enabled reversible tuning of the diarylethene's electronic states in 
the blend, which resulted in modulation of the output current. The device
photoresponse was found to be in the microsecond range, and thus on a
technologically relevant timescale. This modular blending approach allows for the
convenient incorporation of various molecular components, which opens up
perspectives on multifunctional devices and logic circuits.

Transition-metal-arene complexes such as bis(benzene)chromium
Cr(η(6)-C(6)H(6))(2) are historically important to d-orbital bonding theory and
have modern importance in organic synthesis, catalysis and organic spintronics.
In investigations of f-block chemistry, however, arenes are invariably used as
solvents rather than ligands. Here, we show that simple uranium complexes UX(3)
(X = aryloxide, amide) spontaneously disproportionate, transferring an electron
and X-ligand, allowing the resulting UX(2) to bind and reduce arenes, forming
inverse sandwich molecules [X(2)U(µ-η(6):η(6)-arene)UX(2)] and a UX(4)
by-product. Calculations and kinetic studies suggest a 'cooperative
small-molecule activation' mechanism involving spontaneous arene reduction as an 
X-ligand is transferred. These mild reaction conditions allow functionalized
arenes such as arylsilanes to be incorporated. The bulky UX(3) are also inert to 
reagents such as boranes that would react with the traditional harsh reaction
conditions, allowing the development of a new in situ arene C-H bond
functionalization methodology converting C-H to C-B bonds.

Dissecting the mechanisms of a class of chemical glycosylation using primary ¹³C

Although arguably the most important reaction in glycoscience, chemical
glycosylations are among the least well understood of organic chemical reactions,
resulting in an unnecessarily high degree of empiricism and a brake on rational
development in this critical area. To address this problem, primary (13)C kinetic
isotope effects have now been determined for the formation of β- and α-manno- and
glucopyranosides using a natural abundance NMR method. In contrast to the common 
current assumption, for three of the four cases studied the experimental and
computed values are indicative of associative displacement of the intermediate
covalent glycosyl trifluoromethanesulfonates. For the formation of the
α-mannopyranosides, the experimentally determined KIE differs significantly from 
that computed for an associative displacement, which is strongly suggestive of a 
dissociative mechanism that approaches the intermediacy of a glycosyl
oxocarbenium ion. The application of analogous experiments to other glycosylation
systems should shed further light on their mechanisms and thus assist in the
design of better reactions conditions with improved stereoselectivity.

Supramolecular assemblies that interact with light have recently garnered much
interest as well-defined nanoscale materials for electronic excitation energy
collection and transport. However, to control such complex systems it is
essential to understand how their various parts interact and whether these
interactions result in coherently shared excited states (excitons) or in
diffusive energy transport between them. Here, we address this by studying a
model system consisting of two concentric cylindrical dye aggregates in a
light-harvesting nanotube. Through selective chemistry we are able to
unambiguously determine the supramolecular origin of the observed excitonic
transitions. These results required the development of a new theoretical model of
the supramolecular structure of the assembly. Our results demonstrate that the
two cylinders of the nanotube have distinct spectral responses and are best
described as two separate, weakly coupled excitonic systems. Understanding such
interactions is critical to the control of energy transfer on a molecular scale, 
a goal in various applications ranging from artificial photosynthesis to
molecular electronics.

Catalytic asymmetric conjugate addition reactions with organometallic reagents
are powerful reactions in synthetic chemistry. Procedures that use non-stabilized
carbanions have been developed extensively, but these suffer from a number of
limitations that prevent their use in many situations. Here, we report that
alkylmetal species generated in situ from alkenes can be used in highly
enantioselective 1,4-addition initiated by a copper catalyst. Using alkenes as
starting materials is desirable because they are readily available and have
favourable properties when compared to pre-made organometallics. High levels of
enantioselectivity are observed at room temperature in a range of solvents, and
the reaction tolerates functional groups that are not compatible with comparable 
methods-a necessary prerequisite for efficient and protecting-group-free
strategies for synthesis.

Diagnostic technologies that can provide the simultaneous detection of nucleic
acids for gene expression, proteins for host response and small molecules for
profiling the human metabolome will have a significant advantage in providing
comprehensive patient monitoring. Molecular sensors that report changes in the
electrostatics of a sensor's surface on analyte binding have shown unprecedented 
sensitivity in the detection of charged biomolecules, but do not lend themselves 
to the detection of small molecules, which do not carry significant charge. Here,
we introduce the neutralizer displacement assay that allows charge-based sensing 
to be applied to any class of molecule irrespective of the analyte charge. The
neutralizer displacement assay starts with an aptamer probe bound to a
neutralizer. When analyte binding occurs the neutralizer is displaced, which
results in a dramatic change in the surface charge for all types of analytes. We 
have tested the sensitivity, speed and specificity of this system in the
detection of a panel of molecules: (deoxy)ribonucleic acid, ribonucleic acid,
cocaine, adenosine triphosphate and thrombin.

The concept of geometrical constraints and steric hindrance in reactions is
implanted deeply in a chemist's 'chemical intuition'. However, until now a true
three-dimensional view of these steric effects has not been realized
experimentally for any chemical reaction in full. Here we report the complete
three-dimensional characterization of the sterics of a benchmark polyatomic
reaction by measuring the dependence of the product state-resolved angular
distributions on the spatial alignment of the reactive bond in a crossed
molecular beam experiment. The results prove the existence of two distinct
microscopic reaction mechanisms. Detailed analysis reveals that the origin of the
stereodynamics in the HCl(ν = 0) + CD(3)(0(0)) product channel can be captured by
a textbook line-of-centres collision model. In contrast, a time-delay pathway,
which includes a sharp switch from in-plane to out-of-plane scattering in the
forwards direction, appears to be operative in forming the excited HCl(ν = 1) +
CD(3)(0(0)) product pair.

The excision of hydrogen from an aliphatic carbon chain to produce an isolated
olefin (desaturation) without overoxidation is one of the most impressive and
powerful biosynthetic transformations for which there are no simple and mild
laboratory substitutes. The versatility of olefins and the range of reactions
they undergo are unsurpassed in functional group space. Thus, the conversion of a
relatively inert aliphatic system into its unsaturated counterpart could open new
possibilities in retrosynthesis. In this article, the invention of a directing
group to achieve such a transformation under mild, operationally simple,
metal-free conditions is outlined. This 'portable desaturase' (Tz(o)Cl) is a
bench-stable, commercial entity (Aldrich, catalogue number L510092) that is
facile to install on alcohol and amine functionalities to ultimately effect
remote desaturation, while leaving behind a synthetically useful tosyl group.

The ruthenium complex [Ru(phen)(2)(dppz)](2+) (where phen is phenanthroline and
dppz dipyridophenazine is known as a 'light switch' complex because its
luminescence in solution is significantly enhanced in the presence of DNA. This
property is poised to serve in diagnostic and therapeutic applications, but its
binding mode with DNA needs to be elucidated further. Here, we describe the
crystal structures of the Λ enantiomer bound to two oligonucleotide duplexes. The
dppz ligand intercalates symmetrically and perpendicularly from the minor groove 
of the d(CCGGTACCGG)(2) duplex at the central TA/TA step, but not at the central 
AT/AT step of d(CCGGATCCGG)(2). In both structures, however, a second ruthenium
complex links the duplexes through the combination of a shallower angled
intercalation into the C(1)C(2)/G(9)G(10) step at the end of the duplex, and
semi-intercalation into the G(3)G(4) step of an adjacent duplex. The TA/TA
specificity of the perpendicular intercalation arises from the packing of
phenanthroline ligands against the adenosine residue.

DNA mismatches represent a novel target in the development of diagnostics and
therapeutics for cancer, because deficiencies in DNA mismatch repair are
implicated in cancers, and cells that are repair-deficient show a high frequency 
of mismatches. Metal complexes with bulky intercalating ligands serve as probes
for DNA mismatches. Here, we report the high-resolution (0.92 Å) crystal
structure of the ruthenium 'light switch' complex Δ-[Ru(bpy)(2)dppz](2+) (bpy =
2,2'-bipyridine and dppz = dipyridophenazine), which is known to show
luminescence on binding to duplex DNA, bound to both mismatched and well-matched 
sites in the oligonucleotide 5'-(dCGGAAATTACCG)(2)-3' (underline denotes AA
mismatches). Two crystallographically independent views reveal that the complex
binds mismatches through metalloinsertion, ejecting both mispaired adenosines.
Additional ruthenium complexes are intercalated at well-matched sites, creating
an array of complexes in the minor groove stabilized by stacking interactions
between bpy ligands and extruded adenosines. This structure attests to the
generality of metalloinsertion and metallointercalation as DNA binding modes.

Despite the tremendous advances of the past four decades, chemists are far from
being able to use chiral catalysts to control the stereoselectivity of any
desired reaction. New concepts for the construction and mode of operation of
chiral catalysts have the potential to open up previously inaccessible reaction
space. The recognition and categorization of distinct approaches seems to play a 
role in triggering rapid exploration of new territory. This Review both reflects 
on the origins as well as details a selection of the latest examples of an area
that has advanced considerably within the past five years or so: the use of
chiral anions in asymmetric catalysis. Defining reactions as involving chiral
anions is a difficult task owing to uncertainties over the exact catalytic
mechanisms. Nevertheless, we attempt to provide an overview of the breadth of
reactions that could reasonably fall under this umbrella.

Although dominating the consumer electronics markets as the power source of
choice for popular portable devices, the common lithium battery is not yet suited
for use in sustainable electrified road transport. The development of advanced,
higher-energy lithium batteries is essential in the rapid establishment of the
electric car market. Owing to its exceptionally high energy potentiality, the
lithium-air battery is a very appealing candidate for fulfilling this role.
However, the performance of such batteries has been limited to only a few
charge-discharge cycles with low rate capability. Here, by choosing a suitable
stable electrolyte and appropriate cell design, we demonstrate a lithium-air
battery capable of operating over many cycles with capacity and rate values as
high as 5,000 mAh g(carbon)(-1) and 3 A g(carbon)(-1), respectively. For this
battery we estimate an energy density value that is much higher than those
offered by the currently available lithium-ion battery technology.

Acenes can be thought of as one-dimensional strips of graphene and they have the 
potential to be used in the next generation of electronic devices. However,
because acenes larger than pentacene have been found to be unstable, it was
generally accepted that they would not be particularly useful materials under
normal conditions. Here, we show that, by using a physical vapour-transport
method, platelet-shaped crystals of hexacene can be prepared from a monoketone
precursor. These crystals are stable in the dark for a long period of time under 
ambient conditions. In the crystal, the molecules are arranged in herringbone
arrays, quite similar to that observed for pentacene. A field-effect transistor
made using a single crystal of hexacene displayed a hole mobility significantly
higher than that of pentacene. This result suggests that it might be instructive 
to further explore the potential of other higher acenes.

Describing the kinetics of polymer reactions, such as the formation of loops and 
hairpins in nucleic acids or polypeptides, is complicated by the structural
dynamics of their chains. Although both intramolecular reactions, such as
cyclization, and intermolecular reactions have been studied extensively, both
experimentally and theoretically, there is to date no exact explicit analytical
treatment of transport-limited polymer reaction kinetics, even in the case of the
simplest (Rouse) model of monomers connected by linear springs. We introduce a
new analytical approach to calculate the mean reaction time of polymer reactions 
that encompasses the non-Markovian dynamics of monomer motion. This requires that
the conformational statistics of the polymer at the very instant of reaction be
determined, which provides, as a by-product, new information on the reaction
path. We show that the typical reactive conformation of the polymer is more
extended than the equilibrium conformation, which leads to reaction times
significantly shorter than predicted by the existing classical Markovian theory.

Only a handful of elements are able to be controllably homocatenated (that is, to
be formed into one- or two-dimensional chains or rings of the element), because
most have weak element-element bonds. Boron forms strong B-B bonds, but its
favourable cluster formation makes homocatenation very difficult. Recently, the
coupling of borylene (:BR) ligands on a metal was predicted computationally. We
have brought this prediction to fruition experimentally, and extended it by
adding two further borylene units, stepwise forming a B(4) chain bound to a metal
under mild conditions. This complex is a useful model for understanding the
metal-boron interactions required to promote transition of the boron atoms from
borylene ligands to oligoborane networks bound side-on. The concept shows great
promise for the controlled construction of one-dimensional boron chains.

Nature uses mechanochemical transduction processes to achieve diverse and vital
functions, such as hearing, cellular adhesion and gating of ion channels. One
fascinating example of biological mechanotransduction is the emission of light on
mechanical stimulation. However, molecular-level transduction of force into
luminescence in a synthetic system remains a challenge. Here, we show that
bis(adamantyl)-1,2-dioxetane emits visible light when force is applied to a
polymer chain or network in which this unit is incorporated. Bright-blue
luminescence was observed on sonication of solutions of dioxetane-containing
linear polymers and on the straining of polymer networks with dioxetane
crosslinkers. Light is emitted from the adamantanone-excited state that forms on 
opening of the four-membered dioxetane ring. Increased sensitivity and colour
tuning were achieved by energy transfer to suitable acceptors. High spatial and
temporal resolutions highlight the potential to study the failure of polymeric
materials in unprecedented detail.

Coupling reactions of nitrogen atoms represent elementary steps to many important
heterogeneously catalysed reactions, such as the Haber-Bosch process or the
selective catalytic reduction of NO(x) to give N(2). For molecular nitrido (and
related oxo) complexes, it is well established that the intrinsic reactivity, for
example nucleophilicity or electrophilicity of the nitrido (or oxo) ligand, can
be attributed to M-N (M-O) ground-state bonding. In recent years, nitrogen
(oxygen)-centred radical reactivity was ascribed to the possible redox
non-innocence of nitrido (oxo) ligands. However, unequivocal spectroscopic
characterization of such transient nitridyl {M=N(•)} (or oxyl {M-O(•)}) complexes
remained elusive. Here we describe the synthesis and characterization of the
novel, closed-shell and open-shell square-planar iridium nitrido complexes
[IrN(L(t-Bu))](+) and [IrN(L(t-Bu))] (L(t-Bu)=N(CHCHP-t-Bu(2))(2)). Spectroscopic
characterization and quantum chemical calculations for [IrN(L(t-Bu))] indicate a 
considerable nitridyl, {Ir=N(•)}, radical character. The clean formation of
Ir(I)-N(2) complexes via binuclear coupling is rationalized in terms of nitrido
redox non-innocence in [IrN(L(t-Bu))].

Light-driven molecular motors convert light into mechanical energy through
excited-state reactions. Unidirectional rotary molecular motors based on chiral
overcrowded alkenes operate through consecutive photochemical and thermal steps. 
The thermal (helix inverting) step has been optimized successfully through
variations in molecular structure, but much less is known about the photochemical
step, which provides power to the motor. Ultimately, controlling the efficiency
of molecular motors requires a detailed picture of the molecular dynamics on the 
excited-state potential energy surface. Here, we characterize the primary events 
that follow photon absorption by a unidirectional molecular motor using ultrafast
fluorescence up-conversion measurements with sub 50 fs time resolution. We
observe an extraordinarily fast initial relaxation out of the Franck-Condon
region that suggests a barrierless reaction coordinate. This fast molecular
motion is shown to be accompanied by the excitation of coherent excited-state
structural motion. The implications of these observations for manipulating motor 
efficiency are discussed.

The tunicamycins are archetypal nucleoside antibiotics targeting bacterial
peptidoglycan biosynthesis and eukaryotic protein N-glycosylation. Understanding 
the biosynthesis of their unusual carbon framework may lead to variants with
improved selectivity. Here, we demonstrate in vitro recapitulation of key
sugar-manipulating enzymes from this pathway. TunA is found to exhibit unusual
regioselectivity in the reduction of a key α,β-unsaturated ketone. The product of
this reaction is shown to be the preferred substrate for TunF--an epimerase that 
converts the glucose derivative to a galactose. In Streptomyces strains in which 
another gene (tunB) is deleted, the biosynthesis is shown to stall at this
exo-glycal product. These investigations confirm the combined TunA/F activity and
delineate the ordering of events in the metabolic pathway. This is the first time
these surprising exo-glycal intermediates have been seen in biology. They suggest
that construction of the aminodialdose core of tunicamycin exploits their enol
ether motif in a mode of C-C bond formation not previously observed in nature, to
create an 11-carbon chain.

Solvents have a profound influence on chemical reactions in solution and have
long been used to control their outcome. Such effects are generally considered to
be governed by thermodynamics; however, little is known about the steric effects 
of solvent molecules. Here, we probe the influence of individual solvent
molecules on reaction dynamics and present results on the atomistic dynamics of a
microsolvated chemical reaction--the fundamentally important nucleophilic
substitution reaction. We study the reaction of OH(-) with CH(3)I using a
technique that combines crossed-beam imaging with a cold source of microsolvated 
reactants. Our results reveal several distinct reaction mechanisms for different 
degrees of solvation; surprisingly, the classical co-linear substitution
mechanism only dominates the dynamics for mono-solvated reactants. We analyse the
relative importance of the different mechanisms using ab initio calculations and 
show that the steric characteristics are at least as relevant as the energetics
in understanding the influence of solvent molecules in such microsolvated
reactions.

Small molecules that recognize protein surfaces are important tools for modifying
protein interaction properties. Since the 1980s, several thousand studies
concerning calixarenes and host-guest interactions have been published. Although 
there is growing interest in protein-calixarene interactions, only limited
structural information has been available to date. We now report the crystal
structure of a protein-calixarene complex. The water-soluble
p-sulfonatocalix[4]arene is shown to bind the lysine-rich cytochrome c at three
different sites. Binding curves obtained from NMR titrations reveal an
interaction process that involves two or more binding sites. Together, the data
indicate a dynamic complex in which the calixarene explores the surface of
cytochrome c. In addition to providing valuable information on protein
recognition, the data also indicate that the calixarene is a mediator of
protein-protein interactions, with potential applications in generating
assemblies and promoting crystallization.

The solubility characteristics of 40-70% of new drug candidates are so poor that 
they cannot be formulated on their own, so new methods for increasing drug
solubility are highly prized. Here, we describe a new class of general-purpose
solubilizing agents-acyclic cucurbituril-type containers-which increase the
solubility of ten insoluble drugs by a factor of between 23 and 2,750 by forming 
container-drug complexes. The containers exhibit low in vitro toxicity in human
liver, kidney and monocyte cell lines, and outbred Swiss Webster mice tolerate
high doses of the container without sickness or weight loss. Paclitaxel
solubilized by the acyclic cucurbituril-type containers kills cervical and
ovarian cancer cells more efficiently than paclitaxel alone. The acyclic
cucurbituril-type containers preferentially bind cationic and aromatic drugs, but
also solubilize neutral drugs such as paclitaxel, and represent an attractive
extension of cyclodextrin-based technology for drug solubilization and delivery.

The oxidation of water to O(2) is a key challenge in the production of chemical
fuels from electricity. Although several catalysts have been developed for this
reaction, substantial challenges remain towards the ultimate goal of an
efficient, inexpensive and robust electrocatalyst. Reported here is the first
copper-based catalyst for electrolytic water oxidation. Copper-bipyridine-hydroxo
complexes rapidly form in situ from simple commercially available copper salts
and bipyridine at high pH. Cyclic voltammetry of these solutions at pH 11.8-13.3 
shows large, irreversible currents, indicative of catalysis. The production of
O(2) is demonstrated both electrochemically and with a fluorescence probe.
Catalysis occurs at about 750 mV overpotential. Electrochemical, electron
paramagnetic resonance and other studies indicate that the catalyst is a soluble 
molecular species, that the dominant species in the catalytically active
solutions is (2,2'-bipyridine)Cu(OH)(2) and that this is among the most rapid
homogeneous water-oxidation catalysts, with a turnover frequency of ~100 s(-1).

Segregation and templating approaches have been honed by billions of years of
evolution to direct many complex biological processes. Nature uses segregation to
improve biochemical control by organizing reactants into defined, well-regulated 
environments, and the transfer of genetic information is a primary function of
templating. The ribosome, wherein messenger RNA is translated into polypeptides, 
combines both techniques to allow for ideal biopolymer syntheses. Herein is
presented a biomimetic segregation/templating approach to synthetic radical
polymerization. Polymerization of a nucleobase-containing vinyl monomer in the
presence of a complementary block copolymer template of low molecular weight
yields high molecular weight (M(w) up to ~400,000 g mol(-1)), extremely low
polydispersity (≤1.08) daughter polymers. Control is attained by segregation of
propagating radicals in discrete micelle cores (via cooperative assembly of
dynamic template polymers). Significantly reduced bimolecular termination,
combined with controlled propagation along a defined number of templates, ensures
unprecedented control to afford well-defined high molecular weight polymers.

The construction of soft and processable organic material able to display
metallic conduction properties-a large density of freely moving charges-is a
major challenge for electronics. Films of doped conjugated polymers are widely
used as semiconductor devices, but metallic-type transport in the bulk of such
materials remains extremely rare. On the other hand, single-walled carbon
nanotubes can exhibit remarkably low contact resistances with related large
currents, but are intrinsically very difficult to isolate and process. Here, we
describe the self-assembly of supramolecular organic nanowires between two
metallic electrodes, from a solution of triarylamine derivative, under the
simultaneous action of light and electric field triggers. They exhibit a
combination of large conductivity values (>5 × 10(3) S m(-1)) and a low interface
resistance (<2 × 10(-4) Ω m). Moreover, the resistance of nanowires in series
with metal interfaces systematically decreases when the temperature is lowered to
1.5 K, revealing an intrinsic metallic behaviour.

The redesign of enzymes to produce catalysts for a predefined transformation
remains a major challenge in protein engineering. Here, we describe the
structure-based engineering of methylaspartate ammonia lyase (which in nature
catalyses the conversion of 3-methylaspartate to ammonia and 2-methylfumarate) to
accept a variety of substituted amines and fumarates and catalyse the asymmetric 
synthesis of aspartic acid derivatives. We obtained two single-active-site
mutants, one exhibiting a wide nucleophile scope including structurally diverse
linear and cyclic alkylamines and one with broad electrophile scope including
fumarate derivatives with alkyl, aryl, alkoxy, aryloxy, alkylthio and arylthio
substituents at the C2 position. Both mutants have an enlarged active site that
accommodates the new substrates while retaining the high stereo- and
regioselectivity of the wild-type enzyme. As an example, we demonstrate a highly 
enantio- and diastereoselective synthesis of threo-3-benzyloxyaspartate (an
important inhibitor of neuronal excitatory glutamate transporters in the brain).

Conventional chiral ligands rely on the use of a covalently constructed, single
chiral molecule embedded with coordinative functional groups. Here, we report a
new strategy for the design of a chiral ligand for asymmetric transition-metal
catalysis; our approach is based on the development of an achiral cationic
ammonium-phosphine hybrid ligand paired with a chiral binaphtholate anion. This
ion-paired chiral ligand imparts a remarkable stereocontrolling ability to its
palladium complex, which catalyses a highly enantioselective allylic alkylation
of α-nitrocarboxylates. By exploiting the possible combinations of the achiral
onium entities with suitable coordinative functionalities and readily available
chiral acids, this approach should contribute to the development of a broad range
of metal-catalysed, stereoselective chemical transformations.

The development of polymers that can spontaneously repair themselves after
mechanical damage would significantly improve the safety, lifetime, energy
efficiency and environmental impact of man-made materials. Most approaches to
self-healing materials require the input of external energy, healing agents,
solvent or plasticizer. Despite intense research in this area, the synthesis of a
stiff material with intrinsic self-healing ability remains a key challenge. Here,
we show a design of multiphase supramolecular thermoplastic elastomers that
combine high modulus and toughness with spontaneous healing capability. The
designed hydrogen-bonding brush polymers self-assemble into a hard-soft
microphase-separated system, combining the enhanced stiffness and toughness of
nanocomposites with the self-healing capability of dynamic supramolecular
assemblies. In contrast to previous self-healing polymers, this new system
spontaneously self-heals as a single-component solid material at ambient
conditions, without the need for any external stimulus, healing agent,
plasticizer or solvent.

Neat liquid phosphoric acid (H(3)PO(4)) has the highest intrinsic proton
conductivity of any known substance and is a useful model for understanding
proton transport in other phosphate-based systems in biology and clean energy
technologies. Here, we present an ab initio molecular dynamics study that
reveals, for the first time, the microscopic mechanism of this high proton
conductivity. Anomalously fast proton transport in hydrogen-bonded systems
involves a structural diffusion mechanism in which intramolecular proton transfer
is driven by specific hydrogen bond rearrangements in the surrounding
environment. Aqueous media transport excess charge defects through local hydrogen
bond rearrangements that drive individual proton transfer reactions. In contrast,
strong, polarizable hydrogen bonds in phosphoric acid produce coupled proton
motion and a pronounced protic dielectric response of the medium, leading to the 
formation of extended, polarized hydrogen-bonded chains. The interplay between
these chains and a frustrated hydrogen-bond network gives rise to the high proton
conductivity.

The dynamics of mechanically interlocked molecules such as rotaxanes and
catenanes have been studied in solution as examples of rudimentary molecular
switches and machines, but in this medium, the molecules are randomly dispersed
and their motion incoherent. As a strategy for achieving a higher level of
molecular organization, we have constructed a metal-organic framework material
using a [2]rotaxane as the organic linker and binuclear Cu(II) units as the
nodes. Activation of the as-synthesized material creates a void space inside the 
rigid framework that allows the soft macrocyclic ring of the [2]rotaxane to
rotate rapidly, unimpeded by neighbouring molecular components.
Variable-temperature (13)C and (2)H solid-state NMR experiments are used to
characterize the nature and rate of the dynamic processes occurring inside this
unique material. These results provide a blueprint for the future creation of
solid-state molecular switches and molecular machines based on mechanically
interlocked molecules.

Thiolate-protected gold surfaces and interfaces, relevant for self-assembled
monolayers of organic molecules on gold, for passivated gold nanoclusters and for
molecule-gold junctions, are archetypal systems in various fields of current
nanoscience research, materials science, inorganic chemistry and surface science.
Understanding this interface at the nanometre scale is essential for a wide range
of potential applications for site-specific bioconjugate labelling and sensing,
drug delivery and medical therapy, functionalization of gold surfaces for
sensing, molecular recognition and molecular electronics, and gold nanoparticle
catalysis. During the past five years, considerable experimental and theoretical 
advances have furthered our understanding of the molecular structure of the
gold-sulfur interface in these systems. This Review discusses the recent progress
from the viewpoint of theory and computations, with connections to relevant
experiments.

Across chemical disciplines, an interest in developing artificial water splitting
to O(2) and H(2), driven by sunlight, has been motivated by the need for
practical and environmentally friendly power generation without the consumption
of fossil fuels. The central issue in light-driven water splitting is the
efficiency of the water oxidation, which in the best-known catalysts falls short 
of the desired level by approximately two orders of magnitude. Here, we show that
it is possible to close that 'two orders of magnitude' gap with a rationally
designed molecular catalyst [Ru(bda)(isoq)(2)]
(H(2)bda = 2,2'-bipyridine-6,6'-dicarboxylic acid; isoq = isoquinoline). This
speeds up the water oxidation to an unprecedentedly high reaction rate with a
turnover frequency of >300 s(-1). This value is, for the first time, moderately
comparable with the reaction rate of 100-400 s(-1) of the oxygen-evolving complex
of photosystem II in vivo.

Biomacromolecules that are challenging for the usual structural techniques can be
studied with atomic resolution by solid-state NMR spectroscopy. However, the
paucity of distance restraints >5 Å, traditionally derived from measurements of
magnetic dipole-dipole couplings between protein nuclei, is a major bottleneck
that hampers such structure elucidation efforts. Here, we describe a general
approach that enables the rapid determination of global protein fold in the solid
phase via measurements of nuclear paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PREs) in 
several analogues of the protein of interest containing covalently attached
paramagnetic tags, without the use of conventional internuclear distance
restraints. The method is demonstrated using six cysteine-EDTA-Cu(2+) mutants of 
the 56-residue B1 immunoglobulin-binding domain of protein G, for which ~230
longitudinal backbone (15)N PREs corresponding to distances of ~10-20 Å were
obtained. The mean protein fold determined in this manner agrees with the X-ray
structure with a backbone atom root-mean-square deviation of 1.8 Å.

Since the discovery of the Cope rearrangement in the 1940s, no asymmetric variant
of the rearrangement of achiral 1,5-dienes has emerged, despite the successes
that have been achieved with its heteroatom variants (Claisen, aza-Cope, and so
on). This article reports the first example of an enantioselective Cope reaction 
that starts from an achiral diene. The new gold(I) catalyst derived from double
Cl(-)-abstraction of ((S)-3,5-xylyl-PHANEPHOS(AuCl)(2)), has been developed for
the sigmatropic rearrangement of alkenyl-methylenecyclopropanes. The reaction
proceeds at low temperature and the synthetically useful vinylcyclopropane
products are obtained in high yield and enantioselectivity. Density functional
theory calculations predict that: (1) the reaction proceeds via a cyclic
carbenium ion intermediate, (2) the relief of strain in the methylenecyclopropane
moiety provides the thermodynamic driving force for the rearrangement and (3)
metal complexation of the transition-state structure lowers the rearrangement
barriers.

The effective absorption cross-section of a molecule (acceptor) can be greatly
increased by associating it with a cluster of molecules that absorb light and
transfer the excitation energy to the acceptor molecule. The basic mechanism of
such light harvesting by Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is well
established, but recent experiments have revealed a new feature whereby
excitation is coherently shared among donor and acceptor molecules during FRET.
In the present study, two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy was used to examine
energy transfer at ambient temperature in a naturally occurring light-harvesting 
protein (PE545 of the marine cryptophyte alga Rhodomonas sp. strain CS24).
Quantum beating was observed across a range of excitation frequencies. The shapes
of those features in the two-dimensional spectra were examined. Through
simulations, we show that two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy provides a
probe of the adiabaticity of the free energy landscape underlying light
harvesting.

Photosynthetic organisms harvest sunlight with near unity quantum efficiency. The
complexity of the electronic structure and energy transfer pathways within
networks of photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes often obscures the
mechanisms behind the efficient light-absorption-to-charge conversion process.
Recent experiments, particularly using two-dimensional spectroscopy, have
detected long-lived quantum coherence, which theory suggests may contribute to
the effectiveness of photosynthetic energy transfer. Here, we present a new,
direct method to access coherence signals: a coherence-specific polarization
sequence, which isolates the excitonic coherence features from the population
signals that usually dominate two-dimensional spectra. With this polarization
sequence, we elucidate coherent dynamics and determine the overall measurable
lifetime of excitonic coherence in the major light-harvesting complex of
photosystem II. Coherence decays on two distinct timescales of 47 fs and ~800 fs.
We present theoretical calculations to show that these two timescales are from
weakly and moderately strongly coupled pigments, respectively.

Green plants convert CO(2) to sugar for energy storage via photosynthesis. We
report a novel catalyst that uses CO(2) and hydrogen to store energy in formic
acid. Using a homogeneous iridium catalyst with a proton-responsive ligand, we
show the first reversible and recyclable hydrogen storage system that operates
under mild conditions using CO(2), formate and formic acid. This system is
energy-efficient and green because it operates near ambient conditions, uses
water as a solvent, produces high-pressure CO-free hydrogen, and uses pH to
control hydrogen production or consumption. The extraordinary and switchable
catalytic activity is attributed to the multifunctional ligand, which acts as a
proton-relay and strong π-donor, and is rationalized by theoretical and
experimental studies.

Proteins represent the most sophisticated building blocks available to an
organism and to the laboratory chemist. Yet, in contrast to nearly all other
types of molecular building blocks, the designed self-assembly of proteins has
largely been inaccessible because of the chemical and structural heterogeneity of
protein surfaces. To circumvent the challenge of programming extensive
non-covalent interactions to control protein self-assembly, we have previously
exploited the directionality and strength of metal coordination interactions to
guide the formation of closed, homoligomeric protein assemblies. Here, we extend 
this strategy to the generation of periodic protein arrays. We show that a
monomeric protein with properly oriented coordination motifs on its surface can
arrange, on metal binding, into one-dimensional nanotubes and two- or
three-dimensional crystalline arrays with dimensions that collectively span
nearly the entire nano- and micrometre scale. The assembly of these arrays is
tuned predictably by external stimuli, such as metal concentration and pH.

Although asymmetric catalysis is universally dependent on spatial interactions to
impart specific chirality on a given substrate, examination of steric effects in 
these catalytic systems remains empirical. Previous efforts by our group and
others have seen correlation between steric parameters developed by Charton and
simple substituents in both substrate and ligand; however, more complex
substituents were not found to be correlative. Here, we review and compare the
steric parameters common in quantitative structure activity relationships (QSAR),
a common method for pharmaceutical function optimization, and how they might be
applied in asymmetric catalysis, as the two fields are undeniably similar. We
re-evaluate steric/enantioselection relationships, which we previously analysed
with Charton steric parameters, using the more sophisticated Sterimol parameters 
developed by Verloop and co-workers in a QSAR context. Use of these Sterimol
parameters led to strong correlations in numerous processes where Charton
parameters had previously failed. Sterimol parameterization also allows for
greater mechanistic insight into the key elements of asymmetric induction within 
these systems.

The carbon-oxygen double bond of ketones (R(2)C=O) makes them among the most
important organic compounds, but their homologues, heavy ketones with an E=O
double bond (E = Si, Ge, Sn or Pb), had not been isolated as stable compounds.
Their unavailability as monomeric molecules is ascribed to their high tendency
for intermolecular oligomerization or polymerization via opening of the E=O
double bond. Can such an intermolecular process be inhibited by bulky protecting 
groups? We now report that it can, with the first isolation of a monomeric
germanium ketone analogue (Eind)(2)Ge=O
(Eind = 1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7-octaethyl-s-hydrindacen-4-yl), stabilized by
appropriately designed bulky Eind groups, with a planar tricoordinate germanium
atom. Computational studies and chemical reactions suggest the Ge=O double bond
is highly polarized with a contribution of a charge-separated form
(Eind)(2)Ge(+)-O(-). The germanone thus exhibits unique reactivities that are not
observed with ordinary ketones, including the spontaneous trapping of CO(2) gas
to provide a cyclic addition product.

Amyloid formation has been implicated in the pathology of over 20 human diseases,
but the rational design of amyloid inhibitors is hampered by a lack of structural
information about amyloid-inhibitor complexes. We use isotope labelling and
two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy to obtain a residue-specific structure for 
the complex of human amylin (the peptide responsible for islet amyloid formation 
in type 2 diabetes) with a known inhibitor (rat amylin). Based on its sequence,
rat amylin should block formation of the C-terminal β-sheet, but at 8 h after
mixing, rat amylin blocks the N-terminal β-sheet instead. At 24 h after mixing,
rat amylin blocks neither β-sheet and forms its own β-sheet, most probably on the
outside of the human fibrils. This is striking, because rat amylin is natively
disordered and not previously known to form amyloid β-sheets. The results show
that even seemingly intuitive inhibitors may function by unforeseen and complex
structural processes.

Three-dimensional (3D) printing has the potential to transform science and
technology by creating bespoke, low-cost appliances that previously required
dedicated facilities to make. An attractive, but unexplored, application is to
use a 3D printer to initiate chemical reactions by printing the reagents directly
into a 3D reactionware matrix, and so put reactionware design, construction and
operation under digital control. Here, using a low-cost 3D printer and
open-source design software we produced reactionware for organic and inorganic
synthesis, which included printed-in catalysts and other architectures with
printed-in components for electrochemical and spectroscopic analysis. This
enabled reactions to be monitored in situ so that different reactionware
architectures could be screened for their efficacy for a given process, with a
digital feedback mechanism for device optimization. Furthermore, solely by
modifying reactionware architecture, reaction outcomes can be altered. Taken
together, this approach constitutes a relatively cheap, automated and
reconfigurable chemical discovery platform that makes techniques from chemical
engineering accessible to typical synthetic laboratories.

Platonic and Archimedean polyhedra, well-known to mathematicians, have been
recently constructed by chemists at a molecular scale by defining the vertices
and the edges with metal ions (M) and organic ligands (L), respectively. Here, we
report the first synthesis of a concave-surface 'stellated polyhedron',
constructed by extending the faces of its precursor polyhedron until they
intersect, forming additional nodes. Our approach involves the formation of an
M(12)L(24) cuboctahedron core, the linkers of which each bear a pendant ligand
site that is subsequently able to bind an additional metal centre to form the
stellated M(18)L(24) cuboctahedron. During this post-stellation process, the
square faces of the M(12)L(24) core are closed by coordination of the pendant
moieties to the additional metal centres, but they are re-opened on removing
these metals ions from the vertices. This behaviour is reminiscent of the
analogous metal-triggered gate opening-closing switches found in spherical virus 
capsids.

Proton transfer is ubiquitous in chemistry and biology, occurring, for example,
in proteins, enzyme reactions and across proton channels and pumps. However, it
has always been described in the context of hydrogen-bonding networks ('proton
wires') acting as proton conduits. Here, we report efficient intramolecular
ionization-induced proton transfer across a 1,3-dimethyluracil dimer, a model
π-stacked system with no hydrogen bonds. Upon photoionization by tunable vacuum
ultraviolet synchrotron radiation, the dimethyluracil dimer undergoes proton
transfer and dissociates to produce a protonated monomer. Deuterated
dimethyluracil experiments confirm that proton transfer occurs from the methyl
groups and not from the aromatic C-H sites. Calculations reveal qualitative
differences between the proton transfer reaction coordinate in the π-stacked and 
hydrogen-bonded base pairs, and that proton transfer in methylated dimers
involves significant rearrangements of the two fragments, facilitating a
relatively low potential energy barrier of only 0.6 eV in the ionized dimer.

Self-assembly of the oxy-tyrosinase core and the fundamental components of
phenolic hydroxylation.

The enzyme tyrosinase contains two Cu(I) centres, trigonally coordinated by
imidazole nitrogens of six conserved histidine residues. The enzyme activates
O(2) to form a µ-η(2):η(2)-peroxo-dicopper(II) core, which hydroxylates tyrosine 
to a catechol in the first committed step of melanin biosynthesis. Here, we
report a family of synthetic peroxo complexes, with spectroscopic and chemical
features consistent with those of oxygenated tyrosinase, formed through the
self-assembly of monodentate imidazole ligands, Cu(I) and O(2) at -125 °C. An
extensively studied complex reproduces the enzymatic electrophilic oxidation of
exogenous phenolic substrates to catechols in good stoichiometric yields. The
self-assembly and subsequent reactivity support the intrinsic stability of the
Cu(2)O(2) core with imidazole ligation, in the absence of a polypeptide
framework, and the innate capacity to effect hydroxylation of phenolic
substrates. These observations suggest that a foundational role of the protein
matrix is to facilitate expression of properties native to the core by bearing
the entropic costs of assembly and precluding undesired oxidative degradation
pathways.

Microporous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) that display permanent porosity show 
great promise for a myriad of purposes. The potential applications of MOFs can be
developed further and extended by encapsulating various functional species (for
example, nanoparticles) within the frameworks. However, despite increasing
numbers of reports of nanoparticle/MOF composites, simultaneously to control the 
size, composition, dispersed nature, spatial distribution and confinement of the 
incorporated nanoparticles within MOF matrices remains a significant challenge.
Here, we report a controlled encapsulation strategy that enables
surfactant-capped nanostructured objects of various sizes, shapes and
compositions to be enshrouded by a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8). The
incorporated nanoparticles are well dispersed and fully confined within the ZIF-8
crystals. This strategy also allows the controlled incorporation of multiple
nanoparticles within each ZIF-8 crystallite. The as-prepared nanoparticle/ZIF-8
composites exhibit active (catalytic, magnetic and optical) properties that
derive from the nanoparticles as well as molecular sieving and orientation
effects that originate from the framework material.

With its exceptional charge mobility, graphene holds great promise for
applications in next-generation electronics. In an effort to tailor its
properties and interfacial characteristics, the chemical functionalization of
graphene is being actively pursued. The oxidation of graphene via the Hummers
method is most widely used in current studies, although the chemical
inhomogeneity and irreversibility of the resulting graphene oxide compromises its
use in high-performance devices. Here, we present an alternative approach for
oxidizing epitaxial graphene using atomic oxygen in ultrahigh vacuum.
Atomic-resolution characterization with scanning tunnelling microscopy is
quantitatively compared to density functional theory, showing that
ultrahigh-vacuum oxidization results in uniform epoxy functionalization.
Furthermore, this oxidation is shown to be fully reversible at temperatures as
low as 260 °C using scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopic techniques. 
In this manner, ultrahigh-vacuum oxidation overcomes the limitations of
Hummers-method graphene oxide, thus creating new opportunities for the study and 
application of chemically functionalized graphene.

The site-specific incorporation of bioorthogonal groups via genetic code
expansion provides a powerful general strategy for site-specifically labelling
proteins with any probe. However, the slow reactivity of the bioorthogonal
functional groups that can be encoded genetically limits the utility of this
strategy. We demonstrate the genetic encoding of a norbornene amino acid using
the pyrrolysyl tRNA synthetase/tRNA(CUA) pair in Escherichia coli and mammalian
cells. We developed a series of tetrazine-based probes that exhibit 'turn-on'
fluorescence on their rapid reaction with norbornenes. We demonstrate that the
labelling of an encoded norbornene is specific with respect to the entire soluble
E. coli proteome and thousands of times faster than established encodable
bioorthogonal reactions. We show explicitly the advantages of this approach over 
state-of-the-art bioorthogonal reactions for protein labelling in vitro and on
mammalian cells, and demonstrate the rapid bioorthogonal site-specific labelling 
of a protein on the mammalian cell surface.

Evidence that a 'dynamic knockout' in Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase

The question of whether protein motions play a role in the chemical step of
enzymatic catalysis has generated much controversy in recent years. Debate has
recently reignited over possible dynamic contributions to catalysis in
dihydrofolate reductase, following conflicting conclusions from studies of the
N23PP/S148A variant of the Escherichia coli enzyme. By investigating the
temperature dependence of kinetic isotope effects, we present evidence that the
reduction in the hydride transfer rate constants in this variant is not a direct 
result of impairment of conformational fluctuations. Instead, the conformational 
state of the enzyme immediately before hydride transfer, which determines the
electrostatic environment of the active site, affects the rate constant for the
reaction. Although protein motions are clearly important for binding and release 
of substrates and products, there appears to be no detectable dynamic coupling of
protein motions to the hydride transfer step itself.

Synthetic polymers are widely used materials, as attested by a production of more
than 200 millions of tons per year, and are typically composed of linear repeat
units. They may also be branched or irregularly crosslinked. Here, we introduce a
two-dimensional polymer with internal periodicity composed of areal repeat units.
This is an extension of Staudinger's polymerization concept (to form
macromolecules by covalently linking repeat units together), but in two
dimensions. A well-known example of such a two-dimensional polymer is graphene,
but its thermolytic synthesis precludes molecular design on demand. Here, we have
rationally synthesized an ordered, non-equilibrium two-dimensional polymer far
beyond molecular dimensions. The procedure includes the crystallization of a
specifically designed photoreactive monomer into a layered structure, a
photo-polymerization step within the crystal and a solvent-induced delamination
step that isolates individual two-dimensional polymers as free-standing,
monolayered molecular sheets.

Topological insulators are an intriguing class of materials with an insulating
bulk state and gapless Dirac-type edge/surface states. Recent theoretical work
predicts that few-layer topological insulators are promising candidates for
broadband and high-performance optoelectronic devices due to their
spin-momentum-locked massless Dirac edge/surface states, which are topologically 
protected against all time-reversal-invariant perturbations. Here, we present the
first experimental demonstration of near-infrared transparent flexible electrodes
based on few-layer topological-insulator Bi(2)Se(3) nanostructures epitaxially
grown on mica substrates by means of van der Waals epitaxy. The large,
continuous, Bi(2)Se(3)-nanosheet transparent electrodes have single Dirac cone
surface states, and exhibit sheet resistances as low as ~330 Ω per square, with a
transparency of more than 70% over a wide range of wavelengths. Furthermore,
Bi(2)Se(3)-nanosheet transparent electrodes show high chemical and thermal
stabilities as well as excellent mechanical durability, which may lead to novel
optoelectronic devices with unique properties.

We describe the synthesis of a variety of cyclopropanes and epoxides by combining
a readily accessible and isolable N,N'-diamidocarbene with a range of
structurally and electronically diverse olefins and aldehydes, including
electron-rich derivatives. Surprisingly, the cyclopropanation and epoxidation
reactions were discovered to be rapid and thermally reversible at relatively low 
temperatures, two features often desired for applications that utilize dynamic
covalent chemistry. In addition, a diamidocyclopropane derivative prepared via
this method was hydrolysed successfully to form the corresponding linear
carboxylic acid in a metal- and carbon monoxide-free hydrocarboxylation reaction.
As such, diamidocarbenes are expected to find utility in the synthesis of
cyclopropanes, epoxides and their derivatives, as well as in dynamic covalent
chemistry applications.

Polymer stomatocytes are bowl-shaped structures of nanosize dimensions formed by 
the controlled deformation of polymer vesicles. The stable nanocavity and strict 
control of the opening are ideal for the physical entrapment of nanoparticles
which, when catalytically active, can turn the stomatocyte morphology into a
nanoreactor. Herein we report an approach to generate autonomous movement of the 
polymer stomatocytes by selectively entrapping catalytically active platinum
nanoparticles within their nanocavities and subsequently using catalysis as a
driving force for movement. Hydrogen peroxide is free to access the inner
stomatocyte cavity, where it is decomposed by the active catalyst (the entrapped 
platinum nanoparticles) into oxygen and water. This generates a rapid discharge, 
which induces thrust and directional movement. The design of the platinum-loaded 
stomatocytes resembles a miniature monopropellant rocket engine, in which the
controlled opening of the stomatocytes directs the expulsion of the decomposition
products away from the reaction chamber (inner stomatocyte cavity).

The extraordinary development of the design and synthesis of dendrimers has
allowed scientists to locate redox sites at precise positions (core, focal
points, branching points, termini, cavities) of these perfectly defined
macromolecules, which have generation-controlled sizes and topologies matching
those of biomolecules. Redox-dendrimer engineering has led to fine modelling
studies of electron-transfer metalloproteins, in which the branches of the
dendrimers hinder access to the active site in a manner reminiscent of that of
the protein. It has also enabled the construction of remarkable catalysts,
sensors and printboards, including by sophisticated design of the interface
between redox dendrimers and solid-state devices - for example by functionalizing
electrodes and other surfaces. Electron-transfer processes between dendrimers and
a variety of other molecules hold promising applications in diverse areas that
range from bio-engineering to sensing, catalysis and energy materials.

The development of efficient and selective transformations is crucial in
synthetic chemistry as it opens new possibilities in the total synthesis of
complex molecules. Applying such reactions to the synthesis of ketones is of
great importance, as this motif serves as a synthetic handle for the elaboration 
of numerous organic functionalities. In this context, we report a general and
chemoselective method based on an activation/addition sequence on secondary
amides allowing the controlled isolation of structurally diverse ketones and
ketimines. The generation of a highly electrophilic imidoyl triflate intermediate
was found to be pivotal in the observed exceptional functional group tolerance,
allowing the facile addition of readily available Grignard and diorganozinc
reagents to amides, and avoiding commonly observed over-addition or reduction
side reactions. The methodology has been applied to the formal synthesis of
analogues of the antineoplastic agent Bexarotene and to the rapid and efficient
synthesis of unsymmetrical diketones in a one-pot procedure.

The most common motif in uranium chemistry is the d(0)f(0) uranyl ion [UO(2)](2+)
in which the oxo groups are rigorously linear and inert. Alternative geometries, 
such as the cis-uranyl, have been identified theoretically and implicated in
oxo-atom transfer reactions that are relevant to environmental speciation and
nuclear waste remediation. Single electron reduction is now known to impart
greater oxo-group reactivity, but with retention of the linear OUO motif, and
reactions of the oxo groups to form new covalent bonds remain rare. Here, we
describe the synthesis, structure, reactivity and magnetic properties of a
binuclear uranium-oxo complex. Formed through a combination of reduction and
oxo-silylation and migration from a trans to a cis position, the new
butterfly-shaped Si-OUO(2)UO-Si molecule shows remarkably strong U(V)-U(V)
coupling and chemical inertness, suggesting that this rearranged uranium oxo
motif might exist for other actinide species in the environment, and have
relevance to the aggregation of actinide oxide clusters.

A key challenge in the field of nanotechnology, in particular in the design of
molecular machines, novel materials or molecular electronics, is the bottom-up
construction of covalently bound molecular architectures in a well-defined
arrangement. To date, only rather simple structures have been obtained because of
the limitation of one-step connection processes. Indeed, for the formation of
sophisticated structures, step-by-step connection of molecules is required. Here,
we present a strategy for the covalent connection of molecules in a hierarchical 
manner by the selective and sequential activation of specific sites, thereby
generating species with a programmed reactivity. This approach leads to improved 
network quality and enables the fabrication of heterogeneous architectures with
high selectivity. Furthermore, substrate-directed growth and a preferred
orientation of the molecular nanostructures are achieved on an anisotropic
surface. The demonstrated control over reactivity and diffusion during covalent
bond formation constitutes a promising route towards the creation of
sophisticated multi-component molecular nanostructures.

The specific hybridization of complementary sequences is an essential property of
nucleic acids, enabling diverse biological and biotechnological reactions and
functions. However, the specificity of nucleic acid hybridization is compromised 
for long strands, except near the melting temperature. Here, we analytically
derived the thermodynamic properties of a hybridization probe that would enable
near-optimal single-base discrimination and perform robustly across diverse
temperature, salt and concentration conditions. We rationally designed 'toehold
exchange' probes that approximate these properties, and comprehensively tested
them against five different DNA targets and 55 spurious analogues with
energetically representative single-base changes (replacements, deletions and
insertions). These probes produced discrimination factors between 3 and 100+
(median, 26). Without retuning, our probes function robustly from 10 °C to 37 °C,
from 1 mM Mg(2+) to 47 mM Mg(2+), and with nucleic acid concentrations from 1 nM 
to 5 µM. Experiments with RNA also showed effective single-base change
discrimination.

Many essential biological molecules exist only in one of two possible
mirror-image structures, either because they possess a chiral unit or through
their structure (helices, for example, are intrinsically chiral), but so far the 
origin of this homochirality has not been unraveled. Here we demonstrate that the
handedness of helical supramolecular aggregates formed by achiral molecules can
be directed by applying rotational, gravitational and orienting forces during the
self-assembly process. In this system, supramolecular chirality is determined by 
the relative directions of rotation and magnetically tuned effective gravity, but
the magnetic orientation of the aggregates is also essential. Applying these
external forces only during the nucleation step of the aggregation is sufficient 
to achieve chiral selection. This result shows that an almost instantaneous
chiral perturbation can be transferred and amplified in growing supramolecular
self-assemblies, and provides evidence that a falsely chiral influence is able to
induce absolute enantioselection.

Triple bonding is conventionally considered to be the limit for multiply bonded
main group elements, despite higher metal-metal bond orders being frequently
observed for transition metals and lanthanides/actinides. Here, using high-level 
theoretical methods, we show that C(2) and its isoelectronic molecules CN(+), BN 
and CB(-) (each having eight valence electrons) are bound by a quadruple bond.
The bonding comprises not only one σ- and two π-bonds, but also one weak
'inverted' bond, which can be characterized by the interaction of electrons in
two outwardly pointing sp hybrid orbitals. A simple way of assessing the energy
of the fourth bond is proposed and is found to be ~12-17 kcal mol(-1) for the
isoelectronic species studied, and thus stronger than a hydrogen bond. In
contrast, the analogues of C(2) that contain higher-row elements, such as Si(2)
and Ge(2), exhibit only double bonding.

Porous materials such as zeolites contain well-defined pores in molecular
dimensions and have important industrial applications in catalysis, sorption and 
separation. Aluminosilicates with intersecting 10- and 12-ring channels are
particularly interesting as selective catalysts. Many porous materials,
especially zeolites, form only nanosized powders and some are intergrowths of
different structures, making structure determination very challenging. Here, we
report the atomic structures of an aluminosilicate zeolite family, ITQ-39, solved
from nanocrystals only a few unit cells in size by electron crystallography.
ITQ-39 is an intergrowth of three different polymorphs, built from the same layer
but with different stacking sequences. ITQ-39 contains stacking faults and
twinning with nano-sized domains, being the most complex zeolite ever solved. The
unique structure of ITQ-39, with a three-dimensional intersecting pairwise
12-ring and 10-ring pore system, makes it a promising catalyst for converting
naphtha into diesel fuel, a process of emerging interest for the petrochemical
industry.

The pre-RNA world hypothesis postulates that RNA was preceded in the evolution of
life by a simpler genetic material, but it is not known if such systems can fold 
into structures capable of eliciting a desired function. Presumably, whatever
chemistry gave rise to RNA would have produced other RNA analogues, some of which
may have preceded or competed directly with RNA. Threose nucleic acid (TNA), a
potentially natural derivative of RNA, has received considerable interest as a
possible RNA progenitor due to its chemical simplicity and ability to exchange
genetic information with itself and RNA. Here, we have applied Darwinian
evolution methods to evolve, in vitro, a TNA receptor that binds to an arbitrary 
target with high affinity and specificity. This demonstration shows that TNA has 
the ability to fold into tertiary structures with sophisticated chemical
functions, which provides evidence that TNA could have served as an ancestral
genetic system during an early stage of life.

The role of protein dynamics in enzyme catalysis is a matter of intense current
debate. Enzyme-catalysed reactions that involve significant quantum tunnelling
can give rise to experimental kinetic isotope effects with complex temperature
dependences, and it has been suggested that standard statistical rate theories,
such as transition-state theory, are inadequate for their explanation. Here we
introduce aspects of transition-state theory relevant to the study of enzyme
reactivity, taking cues from chemical kinetics and dynamics studies of small
molecules in the gas phase and in solution--where breakdowns of statistical
theories have received significant attention and their origins are relatively
better understood. We discuss recent theoretical approaches to understanding
enzyme activity and then show how experimental observations for a number of
enzymes may be reproduced using a transition-state-theory framework with
physically reasonable parameters. Essential to this simple model is the inclusion
of multiple conformations with different reactivity.

Fast motions (femtosecond to picosecond) and their potential involvement during
enzyme-catalysed reactions have ignited considerable interest in recent years.
Their influence on reaction chemistry has been inferred indirectly from studies
of the anomalous temperature dependence of kinetic isotope effects and
computational simulations. But can such motion reduce the width and height of
energy barriers along the reaction coordinate, and contribute to quantum
mechanical and/or classical nuclear-transfer chemistry? Here we discuss
contemporary ideas for enzymatic reactions invoking a role for fast 'promoting'
(or 'compressive') motions that, in principle, can aid hydrogen-transfer
reactions. Of key importance is the direct demonstration of a role for
compressive motions and the ability to understand in atomic detail the structural
origin of these fast motions, but so far this has not been achieved. Here we
discuss both indirect experimental evidence that supports a role for compressive 
motion and the additional insight gained from computational simulations.

The promoting effect of adsorbed carbon monoxide on the oxidation of alcohols on

In heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis, adsorbed carbon monoxide
typically acts as a poison or poisoning intermediate in the oxidation of
alcohols. However, gold as an (electro)catalyst often exhibits unexpected
properties. Here we show that carbon monoxide irreversibly adsorbed on a Au(111) 
surface in aqueous alkaline media can act as a promoter for the electrocatalytic 
oxidation of certain alcohols, in particular methanol. In comparison with bare
Au(111), the onset potential for methanol oxidation is significantly lower in the
presence of adsorbed CO, and formation of the main methanol oxidation
products--formaldehyde and formic acid--is enhanced. By studying the effect of
adsorbed CO on the oxidation of other alcohols on gold, we conclude that the
presence of adsorbed CO promotes beta-hydrogen elimination, that is, C-H bond
breaking. Apart from its importance to gold catalysis, this is an unanticipated
example of promotion effects by co-adsorbed small molecules in electrocatalysis.

The one-step transformation of C(7)-C(12) linear alkanes into more valuable
oxygenates provides heterogeneous catalysis with a major challenge. In evaluating
the potential of a classic mixed-metal-oxide catalyst, we demonstrate new
insights into the reactivity of adsorbed oxygen species. During the aerobic
gas-phase conversion of n-decane over iron molybdate, the product distribution
correlates with the condition of the catalyst. Selectivity to oxygenated
aromatics peaks at 350 °C while the catalyst is in a fully oxidized state,
whereas decene and aromatic hydrocarbons dominate at higher temperatures. The
high-temperature performance is consistent with an underlying redox mechanism in 
which lattice oxide ions abstract hydrogen from decane. At lower temperatures,
the formation of oxygenated aromatics competes with the formation of CO(2),
implying that electrophilic adsorbed oxygen is involved in both reactions. We
suggest, therefore, that so-called non-selective oxygen is capable of insertion
into carbon-rich surface intermediates to generate aromatic partial oxidation
products.

Fluorous mixture synthesis minimizes the effort to synthesize small-molecule
libraries by labelling the molecules rather than the reaction vessels. Reactants 
are labelled with fluorinated tags and products can later be demixed based on the
fluorine content. A limit in the number of available tags can be overcome by
using binary encoding so that a total of four tags can label uniquely a library
of 16 compounds. This strategy, however, means that separation based on fluorine 
content alone is not possible. Here, we solve this problem by selectively
removing one tag after an initial demixing step; a second demixing provides each 
individual compound. The usefulness of this strategy is demonstrated by the
synthesis of a library that contains all 16 diastereomers of the natural products
macrosphelides A and E. Macrosphelide D was not in this library, and so its
assigned structure was incorrect. We determined its constitution by using NMR
spectroscopy and its configuration by synthesizing four candidate stereoisomers.

Advances in synthetic chemistry, structural biology, molecular modelling and
molecular cloning have enabled the systematic functional manipulation of
transmembrane proteins. By combining genetically manipulated proteins with
light-sensitive ligands, innately 'blind' neurobiological receptors can be
converted into photoreceptors, which allows them to be photoregulated with high
spatiotemporal precision. Here, we present the optochemical control of neuronal
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) with photoswitchable tethered agonists
and antagonists. Using structure-based design, we produced heteromeric α3β4 and
α4β2 nAChRs that can be activated or inhibited with deep-violet light, but
respond normally to acetylcholine in the dark. The generation of these engineered
receptors should facilitate investigation of the physiological and pathological
functions of neuronal nAChRs and open a general pathway to photosensitizing
pentameric ligand-gated ion channels.

Drug-likeness is a key consideration when selecting compounds during the early
stages of drug discovery. However, evaluation of drug-likeness in absolute terms 
does not reflect adequately the whole spectrum of compound quality. More
worryingly, widely used rules may inadvertently foster undesirable molecular
property inflation as they permit the encroachment of rule-compliant compounds
towards their boundaries. We propose a measure of drug-likeness based on the
concept of desirability called the quantitative estimate of drug-likeness (QED). 
The empirical rationale of QED reflects the underlying distribution of molecular 
properties. QED is intuitive, transparent, straightforward to implement in many
practical settings and allows compounds to be ranked by their relative merit. We 
extended the utility of QED by applying it to the problem of molecular target
druggability assessment by prioritizing a large set of published bioactive
compounds. The measure may also capture the abstract notion of aesthetics in
medicinal chemistry.

The enantioselective synthesis of nitrogen-containing heterocycles
(N-heterocycles) represents a substantial chemical research effort and resonates 
across numerous disciplines, including the total synthesis of natural products
and medicinal chemistry. In this Article, we describe the highly enantioselective
palladium-catalysed decarboxylative allylic alkylation of readily available
lactams to form 3,3-disubstituted pyrrolidinones, piperidinones, caprolactams and
structurally related lactams. Given the prevalence of quaternary N-heterocycles
in biologically active alkaloids and pharmaceutical agents, we envisage that our 
method will provide a synthetic entry into the de novo asymmetric synthesis of
such structures. As an entry for these investigations we demonstrate how the
described catalysis affords enantiopure quaternary lactams that intercept
synthetic intermediates previously used in the synthesis of the Aspidosperma
alkaloids quebrachamine and rhazinilam, but that were previously only available
by chiral auxiliary approaches or as racemic mixtures.

Metal ions are an important part of many natural proteins, providing structural, 
catalytic and electron transfer functions. Reproducing these functions in a
designed protein is the ultimate challenge to our understanding of them. Here, we
present an artificial metallohydrolase, which has been shown by X-ray
crystallography to contain two different metal ions-a Zn(II) ion, which is
important for catalytic activity, and a Hg(II) ion, which provides structural
stability. This metallohydrolase displays catalytic activity that compares well
with several characteristic reactions of natural enzymes. It catalyses
p-nitrophenyl acetate (pNPA) hydrolysis with an efficiency only ~100-fold less
than that of human carbonic anhydrase (CA)II and at least 550-fold better than
comparable synthetic complexes. Similarly, CO(2) hydration occurs with an
efficiency within ~500-fold of CAII. Although histidine residues in the absence
of Zn(II) exhibit pNPA hydrolysis, miniscule apopeptide activity is observed for 
CO(2) hydration. The kinetic and structural analysis of this first de novo
designed hydrolytic metalloenzyme reveals necessary design features for future
metalloenzymes containing one or more metals.

The tiling of surfaces has long attracted the attention of scientists, not only
because it is intriguing intrinsically, but also as a way to control the
properties of surfaces. However, although random tiling networks are studied
increasingly, their degree of randomness (or partial order) has remained
notoriously difficult to control, in common with other supramolecular systems.
Here we show that the random organization of a two-dimensional supramolecular
array of isophthalate tetracarboxylic acids varies with subtle chemical changes
in the system. We quantify this variation using an order parameter and reveal a
phase behaviour that is consistent with long-standing theoretical studies on
random tiling. The balance between order and randomness is driven by small
differences in intermolecular interaction energies, which can be related by
numerical simulations to the experimentally measured order parameter. Significant
variations occur with very small energy differences, which highlights the
delicate balance between entropic and energetic effects in complex self-assembly 
processes.

The discovery of new compounds for the pharmacological manipulation of protein
function often embraces the screening of compound collections, and it is widely
recognized that natural products offer beneficial characteristics as protein
ligands. Much effort has therefore been focused on 'natural product-like'
libraries, yet the synthesis and screening of such libraries is often limited by 
one or more of the following: modest library sizes and structural diversity,
conformational heterogeneity and the costs associated with the substantial
infrastructure of modern high-throughput screening centres. Here, we describe the
design and execution of an approach to this broad problem by merging principles
associated with biologically inspired oligomerization and the structure of
polyketide-derived natural products. A novel class of chiral and conformationally
constrained oligomers is described (termed 'chiral oligomers of pentenoic
amides', COPA), which offers compatibility with split-and-pool methods and can be
screened en masse in a batch mode. We demonstrate that a COPA library containing 
160,000 compounds is a useful source of novel protein ligands by identifying a
non-covalent synthetic ligand to the DNA-binding domain of the p53 transcription 
factor.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous materials constructed from modular
molecular building blocks, typically metal clusters and organic linkers. These
can, in principle, be assembled to form an almost unlimited number of MOFs, yet
materials reported to date represent only a tiny fraction of the possible
combinations. Here, we demonstrate a computational approach to generate all
conceivable MOFs from a given chemical library of building blocks (based on the
structures of known MOFs) and rapidly screen them to find the best candidates for
a specific application. From a library of 102 building blocks we generated
137,953 hypothetical MOFs and for each one calculated the pore-size distribution,
surface area and methane-storage capacity. We identified over 300 MOFs with a
predicted methane-storage capacity better than that of any known material, and
this approach also revealed structure-property relationships.
Methyl-functionalized MOFs were frequently top performers, so we selected one
such promising MOF and experimentally confirmed its predicted capacity.

In the search for new biologically active molecules, diversity-oriented synthetic
strategies break through the limitation of traditional library synthesis by
sampling new chemical space. Many natural products can be regarded as intriguing 
starting points for diversity-oriented synthesis, wherein stereochemically rich
core structures may be reorganized into chemotypes that are distinctly different 
from the parent structure. Ideally, to be suited to library applications, such
transformations should be general and involve few steps. With this objective in
mind, the highly oxygenated natural product fumagillol has been successfully
remodelled in several ways using a reaction-discovery-based approach. In
reactions with amines, excellent regiocontrol in a bis-epoxide
opening/cyclization sequence can be obtained by size-dependent interaction of an 
appropriate catalyst with the parent molecule, forming either perhydroisoindole
or perhydroisoquinoline products. Perhydroisoindoles can be further remodelled by
cascade processes to afford either morpholinone or bridged
4,1-benzoxazepine-containing structures.

Treatment with therapeutic proteins is an attractive approach to targeting a
number of challenging diseases. Unfortunately, the native proteins themselves are
often unstable in physiological conditions, reducing bioavailability and
therefore increasing the dose that is required. Conjugation with poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG) is often used to increase stability, but this has a detrimental
effect on bioactivity. Here, we introduce conjugation with zwitterionic polymers 
such as poly(carboxybetaine). We show that poly(carboxybetaine) conjugation
improves stability in a manner similar to PEGylation, but that the new conjugates
retain or even improve the binding affinity as a result of enhanced
protein-substrate hydrophobic interactions. This chemistry opens a new avenue for
the development of protein therapeutics by avoiding the need to compromise
between stability and affinity.

Sandwich structures formed by metal atoms intercalated between sp(2)-carbon
planes can be found either in metal-graphite-based materials or discrete
multinuclear sandwich complexes. Their reactivity, and in particular their
dynamic behaviour, has recently attracted interest both from a structural and a
practical aspect, for example in catalysis. However, progress in this area has
been rather slow, and it remains difficult to elucidate their structure and
behaviour at the molecular level. Here, we report two sandwich complexes--in
which four palladium centres are incorporated between two π-conjugated
ligands--which exhibit two modes of redox-switchable structural changes. In the
first complex, the tetrapalladium chain is split by oxidation into two
well-separated dipalladium units. This motion is reversed on reduction. In the
second complex, reversible carbon-carbon coupling occurs between the ligands
during the redox process.

Multicomponent reactions are employed extensively in many areas of organic
chemistry. Despite significant progress, the discovery of such enabling
transformations remains challenging. Here, we present the development of a
parallel, label-free reaction-discovery platform that can be used in the
identification of new multicomponent transformations. Our approach is based on
parallel mass spectrometric screening of interfacial chemical reactions on arrays
of self-assembled monolayers. This strategy enabled the identification of a
simple organic phosphine that can catalyse a previously unknown condensation of
siloxyalkynes, aldehydes and amines to produce 3-hydroxyamides with high
efficiency and diastereoselectivity. The reaction was further optimized using
solution-phase methods.

Colloidal hybrid nanoparticles contain multiple nanoscale domains fused together 
by solid-state interfaces. They represent an emerging class of multifunctional
lab-on-a-particle architectures that underpin future advances in solar energy
conversion, fuel-cell catalysis, medical imaging and therapy, and electronics.
The complexity of these 'artificial molecules' is limited ultimately by the lack 
of a mechanism-driven design framework. Here, we show that known chemical
reactions can be applied in a predictable and stepwise manner to build complex
hybrid nanoparticle architectures that include M-Pt-Fe(3)O(4) (M = Au, Ag, Ni,
Pd) heterotrimers, M(x)S-Au-Pt-Fe(3)O(4) (M = Pb, Cu) heterotetramers and
higher-order oligomers based on the heterotrimeric Au-Pt-Fe(3)O(4) building
block. This synthetic framework conceptually mimics the total-synthesis approach 
used by chemists to construct complex organic molecules. The reaction toolkit
applies solid-state nanoparticle analogues of chemoselective reactions,
regiospecificity, coupling reactions and molecular substituent effects to the
construction of exceptionally complex hybrid nanoparticle oligomers.

The helicates--chiral assemblies of two or more metal atoms linked by short or
relatively rigid multidentate organic ligands--may be regarded as non-peptide
mimetics of α-helices because they are of comparable size and have shown some
relevant biological activity. Unfortunately, these beautiful helical compounds
have remained difficult to use in the medicinal arena because they contain
mixtures of isomers, cannot be optimized for specific purposes, are insoluble, or
are too difficult to synthesize. Instead, we have now prepared thermodynamically 
stable single enantiomers of monometallic units connected by organic linkers. Our
highly adaptable self-assembly approach enables the rapid preparation of ranges
of water-stable, helicate-like compounds with high stereochemical purity. One
such iron(II) 'flexicate' system exhibits specific interactions with DNA,
promising antimicrobial activity against a Gram-positive bacterium
(methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA252), but also, unusually, a
Gram-negative bacterium (Escherichia coli, MC4100), as well as low toxicity
towards a non-mammalian model organism (Caenorhabditis elegans).

Some enzymes function by coupling substrate turnover with electron transfer from 
a redox cofactor such as ferredoxin. In the [FeFe]-hydrogenases, nature's fastest
catalysts for the production and oxidation of H(2), the one-electron redox by a
ferredoxin complements the one-electron redox by the diiron active site. In this 
Article, we replicate the function of the ferredoxins with the redox-active
ligand Cp*Fe(C(5)Me(4)CH(2)PEt(2)) (FcP*). FcP* oxidizes at mild potentials, in
contrast to most ferrocene-based ligands, which suggests that it might be a
useful mimic of ferredoxin cofactors. The specific model is
Fe(2)[(SCH(2))(2)NBn](CO)(3)(FcP*)(dppv) (1), which contains the three functional
components of the active site: a reactive diiron centre, an amine as a proton
relay and, for the first time, a one-electron redox module. By virtue of the
synthetic redox cofactor, [1](2+) exhibits unique reactivity towards hydrogen and
CO. In the presence of excess oxidant and base, H(2) oxidation by [1](2+) is
catalytic.

Taxanes form a large family of terpenes comprising over 350 members, the most
famous of which is Taxol (paclitaxel), a billion-dollar anticancer drug. Here, we
describe the first practical and scalable synthetic entry to these natural
products via a concise preparation of (+)-taxa-4(5),11(12)-dien-2-one, which has 
a suitable functional handle with which to access more oxidized members of its
family. This route enables a gram-scale preparation of the 'parent'
taxane--taxadiene--which is the largest quantity of this naturally occurring
terpene ever isolated or prepared in pure form. The characteristic 6-8-6
tricyclic system of the taxane family, containing a bridgehead alkene, is forged 
via a vicinal difunctionalization/Diels-Alder strategy. Asymmetry is introduced
by means of an enantioselective conjugate addition that forms an all-carbon
quaternary centre, from which all other stereocentres are fixed through substrate
control. This study lays a critical foundation for a planned access to minimally 
oxidized taxane analogues and a scalable laboratory preparation of Taxol itself.

the most complex non-DNA molecular knot prepared to date: the self-assembly of
five bis-aldehyde and five bis-amine building blocks about five metal cations and
one chloride anion to form a 160-atom-loop molecular pentafoil knot (five
crossing points). The structure and topology of the knot is established by NMR
spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and X-ray crystallography, revealing a
symmetrical closed-loop double helicate with the chloride anion held at the
centre of the pentafoil knot by ten CH···Cl(-) hydrogen bonds. The one-pot
self-assembly reaction features an exceptional number of different design
elements-some well precedented and others less well known within the context of
directing the formation of (supra)molecular species. We anticipate that the
strategies and tactics used here can be applied to the rational synthesis of
other higher-order interlocked molecular architectures.

Quantum dots are highly fluorescent and photostable, making them excellent tools 
for imaging. When using these quantum dots in cells and animals, however,
intracellular biothiols (such as glutathione and cysteine) can degrade the
quantum dot monolayer, compromising function. Here, we describe a label-free
method to quantify the intracellular stability of monolayers on quantum dot
surfaces that couples laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry with
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Using this new approach we have
demonstrated that quantum dot monolayer stability is correlated with both quantum
dot particle size and monolayer structure, with appropriate choice of both
particle size and ligand structure required for intracellular stability.

Non-coding RNAs fold into precise base-pairing patterns to carry out critical
roles in genetic regulation and protein synthesis, but determining RNA structure 
remains difficult. Here, we show that coupling systematic mutagenesis with
high-throughput chemical mapping enables accurate base-pair inference of domains 
from ribosomal RNA, ribozymes and riboswitches. For a six-RNA benchmark that has 
challenged previous chemical/computational methods, this 'mutate-and-map'
strategy gives secondary structures that are in agreement with crystallography
(helix error rates, 2%), including a blind test on a double-glycine riboswitch.
Through modelling of partially ordered states, the method enables the first test 
of an interdomain helix-swap hypothesis for ligand-binding cooperativity in a
glycine riboswitch. Finally, the data report on tertiary contacts within
non-coding RNAs, and coupling to the Rosetta/FARFAR algorithm gives
nucleotide-resolution three-dimensional models (helix root-mean-squared
deviation, 5.7 Å) of an adenine riboswitch. These results establish a promising
two-dimensional chemical strategy for inferring the secondary and tertiary
structures that underlie non-coding RNA behaviour.

One-dimensional metal wires are valuable materials because of their optical and
electronic anisotropy, and they have potential utility in devices such as
photovoltaic cells and molecular sensors. However, despite more than a century of
research, only a few examples exist of well-defined one-dimensional (1D) metal
wires that allow for the rational variation of conductivity. Herein we describe
the first examples of 1D molecular wires supported by Pd-Pd bonds, the thin-film 
conductive properties of which can be altered by controlled molecular changes.
Wires based on Pd(III) give semiconducting films with a modifiable bandgap,
whereas wires based on Pd(2.5) give films that display metallic conductivity
above 200 K: a metallic state has not been reported previously for any polymer
composed of 1D metal wires. The wires are infinite in the solid state and
maintain 1D structures in solution with lengths of up to 750 nm. Solution
stability enables thin film coating, a requisite for device fabrication using
molecular wires.

Reversible covalent bonding is often used for the creation of novel
supramolecular structures, multi-component assemblies and sensing ensembles.
Despite the remarkable success of dynamic covalent systems, the reversible
binding of a mono-alcohol with high strength is challenging. Here, we show that a
strategy of carbonyl activation and hemiaminal ether stabilization can be
embodied in a four-component reversible assembly that creates a tetradentate
ligand and incorporates secondary alcohols with exceptionally high affinity.
Evidence is presented that the intermediate leading to binding and exchange of
alcohols is an iminium ion. To demonstrate the use of this assembly process we
also explored chirality sensing and enantiomeric excess determinations. An
induced twist in the ligand by a chiral mono-ol results in large Cotton effects
in the circular dichroism spectra indicative of the handedness of the alcohol.
The strategy revealed in this study should prove broadly applicable for the
incorporation of alcohols into supramolecular architecture construction.

Polyprenylated polycyclic acylphloroglucines (PPAPs) are a family of natural
products that possess a wide range of different important biological activities
because of the relative position and configuration of four substituents that
decorate one common central bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,4,9-trione core. The rigid
bicyclic framework with its lipophilic side chains and its hydrophilic trione
moiety represents a nature-derived lead structure that arranges the substituents 
(R(1) to R(4)) into a defined topographical orientation. As the substituents are 
responsible for the biological activities, the seven-step synthetic approach
presented here sets the stage for an iterative introduction of R(1) to R(4) and
thus generates structurally diverse trans-type B PPAPs. Four natural and one
non-natural trans-type B PPAPs were prepared starting from acetylacetone with
overall yields that ranged from 6 to 22%. The concept of separating framework
construction from decorating transformations plus the minimization of
protecting-group operations are the key issues for the realization of our
synthetic approach.

Roaming-mediated isomerization in the photodissociation of nitrobenzene.

Roaming reactions comprise a new class of reaction in which a molecule undergoes 
frustrated dissociation to radicals, followed by an intramolecular abstraction
reaction. Nitro compounds have long been known to dissociate to give NO as a
major product. However, rates based upon isomerization via calculated tight
transition states are implausibly slow, so the key dissociation pathway for this 
important class of molecules remains obscure. Here, we present an imaging study
of the photodissociation of nitrobenzene with state-specific detection of the
resulting NO products. We observe a bimodal translational energy distribution in 
which the slow products are formed with low NO rotational excitation, and the
fast component is associated with high rotational excitation. High-level ab
initio calculations identified a 'roaming-type' saddle point on the ground state.
Branching ratio calculations then show that thermal dissociation of nitrobenzene 
is dominated by 'roaming-mediated isomerization' to phenyl nitrite, which
subsequently decomposes to give C(6)H(5)O + NO.

To provide insight into how cells receive information from their external
surroundings, synthetic hydrogels have emerged as systems for assaying cell
function in well-defined microenvironments where single cues can be introduced
and subsequent effects individually elucidated. However, as answers to more
complex biological questions continue to be sought, advanced material systems are
needed that allow dynamic alteration of the three-dimensional cellular
environment with orthogonal reactions that enable multiple levels of control of
biochemical and biomechanical signals. Here, we seek to synthesize one such
three-dimensional culture system using cytocompatible and wavelength-specific
photochemical reactions to create hydrogels that allow orthogonal and dynamic
control of material properties through independent spatiotemporally regulated
photocleavage of crosslinks and photoconjugation of pendant functionalities. The 
results demonstrate the versatile nature of the chemistry to create programmable 
niches to study and direct cell function by modifying the local hydrogel
environment.

Fundamental polymer science is undergoing a profound transformation. As a result 
of recent progress in macromolecular chemistry and physics, synthetic polymer
chains are becoming much more than just the modest building blocks of traditional
'plastics'. Promising options for controlling the primary and secondary
structures of synthetic polymers have been proposed and, therefore, similarly to 
biopolymers, synthetic macromolecules may now be exploited as discrete objects
with carefully engineered structures and functions. Although it is not possible
today to reach the high level of complexity found in biomaterials, these new
chemical possibilities open interesting avenues for applications in
microelectronics, photovoltaics, catalysis and biotechnology. Here, we describe
in detail these recent advances in macromolecular science and emphasize the
possible emergence of technologies based on single-chain devices.

The simplicity, efficiency and generality of the transition-metal-catalysed
Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction has led to its application in the
preparation of a wide variety of organic compounds. Cross-coupling of alkylboron 
derivatives, however, remains a major challenge, in particular with regard to
stereochemical control. Here, we describe the preparation and reaction of highly 
optically enriched 1,1-diboron compounds. A catalytic asymmetric conjugate
borylation of β-boronylacrylates provided geminal diboronate products that
feature two distinct boronyl units, in 99% enantiomeric excess. Chemoselective
cross-coupling of one-boronyl unit, a trifluoroborate salt, occurred
stereospecifically via inversion of its configuration to generate enantioenriched
benzylic or allylic boronates. The difficult transmetallation in the
Suzuki-Miyaura catalytic reaction cycle is believed to be facilitated by a
stabilization effect from the second boronyl unit, and internal coordination by
the oxygen of the proximal carboxyester. We also explored subsequent
functionalization of the second boronyl unit.

Ultrafast vibrational energy transfer at the water/air interface revealed by
two-dimensional surface vibrational spectroscopy.

Water is very different from liquids of similar molecular weight, and one of its 
unique properties is the very efficient transfer of vibrational energy between
molecules, which arises as a result of strong dipole-dipole interactions between 
the O-H oscillators. Although we have a sound understanding of such energy
transfer in bulk water, we know less about how, and how quickly, transfer occurs 
at its interface with a hydrophobic phase, because specifically addressing the
outermost monolayer is difficult. Here, we use ultrafast two-dimensional
surface-specific vibrational spectroscopy to probe the interfacial energy
dynamics of heavy water (D(2)O) at the water/air interface. The measurements
reveal the presence of surprisingly rapid energy transfer, both between
hydrogen-bonded interfacial water molecules (intermolecular), and between O-D
groups sticking out from the water surface and those located on the same molecule
and pointing towards the water bulk (intramolecular). Vibrational energy transfer
occurs on sub-picosecond timescales, and its rates and pathways can be quantified
directly.

Photochemical uncaging techniques use light to release active molecules from
otherwise inert compounds. Here we expand this class of techniques by
demonstrating the mechanical uncaging of a reactive species within a single
protein. We proved this novel technique by capturing the regiospecific reaction
between a thiol and a vicinal disulfide bond. We designed a protein that includes
a caged cysteine and a buried disulfide. The mechanical unfolding of this protein
in the presence of an external nucleophile frees the single reactive cysteine
residue, which now can cleave the target disulfide via a nucleophilic attack on
either one of its two sulfur atoms. This produces two different and competing
reaction pathways. We used single-molecule force spectroscopy to monitor the
cleavage of the disulfides, which extends the polypeptide by a magnitude
unambiguously associated with each reaction pathway. This allowed us to measure, 
for the first time, the kinetics of disulfide-bond isomerization in a protein.

A long-lived and sequence-specific ligand-DNA complex would make possible the
modulation of biological processes for extended periods. For this purpose, we are
investigating a polyintercalation approach to DNA recognition in which flexible
chains of aromatic units thread back and forth repeatedly through the double
helix. Here we describe the DNA-binding behaviour of a threading
tetra-intercalator. Specific binding was observed on a relatively long DNA strand
that strongly favoured a predicted 14 base-pair sequence. Kinetic studies
revealed a multistep association process, with sequence specificity that
primarily derives from large differences in dissociation rates. The rate-limiting
dissociation rate constant of the tetra-intercalator complex dissociating from
its preferred binding site was extremely slow, corresponding to a half-life of 16
days. This is one of the longest non-covalent complex half-lives yet reported
and, to the best of our knowledge, the longest for a DNA-binding molecule.

Membrane lipids are dynamic molecules that play important roles in cell
signalling and regulation, but an in situ imaging method for quantitatively
tracking lipids in living cells is lacking at present. Here, we report a new
chemical method of quantitative lipid imaging using sensors engineered by
labelling proteins with an environmentally sensitive fluorophore. A prototype
sensor for phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P(2))--a key
signalling lipid in diverse cellular processes--was generated by covalently
attaching a single 2-dimethylamino-6-acyl-naphthalene group to the N-terminal
α-helix of the engineered epsin1 ENTH domain, a protein that selectively binds
PtdIns(4,5)P(2). The sensor allows robust and sensitive in situ quantitative
imaging in mammalian cells, providing new insight into the spatiotemporal
dynamics and fluctuation of this key signalling lipid. Application of the sensor 
to immune cells reveals the presence of a local threshold PtdIns(4,5)P(2)
concentration required for triggering phagocytosis. This sensor strategy is
generally applicable to in situ quantification of other cellular lipids.

Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) is the major conversion process used in oil
refineries to produce valuable hydrocarbons from crude oil fractions. Because the
demand for oil-based products is ever increasing, research has been ongoing to
improve the performance of FCC catalyst particles, which are complex mixtures of 
zeolite and binder materials. Unfortunately, there is limited insight into the
distribution and activity of individual zeolitic domains at different life
stages. Here we introduce a staining method to visualize the structure of zeolite
particulates and other FCC components. Brønsted acidity maps have been
constructed at the single particle level from fluorescence microscopy images. By 
applying a statistical methodology to a series of catalysts deactivated via
industrial protocols, a correlation is established between Brønsted acidity and
cracking activity. The generally applicable method has clear potential for
catalyst diagnostics, as it determines intra- and interparticle Brønsted acidity 
distributions for industrial FCC materials.

Long-range communication of stereochemical information is common in biological
systems, particularly in enzyme-catalysed reactions. Here, we report the remote
control of the dynamic chirality of metal centres, coordinated by 2,2'-bipyridine
ligands bearing dynamic helical oligopeptides. The helical chirality of the
oligopeptides is controlled by a stereocentre remote from the metal. We show that
when a mixture of chiral and achiral peptide ligands is used, both the chirality 
of the metal centre and that of the achiral oligopeptide helices are
significantly amplified. The amplification mechanism relies on several steps of
chirality induction, first from a single chiral peptide to the helicity of an
oligopeptide through the induction of propeller chirality at the metal centre,
then on to induction of helical chirality in an achiral oligopeptide.

Vibrational energy flow into reactants, and out of products, plays a key role in 
chemical reactivity, so understanding the microscopic detail of the pathways and 
rates associated with this phenomenon is of considerable interest. Here, we use
molecular dynamics simulations to model the vibrational relaxation that occurs
during the reaction CN + c-C(6)H(12) → HCN + c-C(6)H(11) in CH(2)Cl(2), which
produces vibrationally hot HCN. The calculations reproduce the observed energy
distribution, and show that HCN relaxation follows multiple timescales. Initial
rapid decay occurs through energy transfer to the cyclohexyl co-product within
the solvent cage, and slower relaxation follows once the products diffuse apart. 
Re-analysis of the ultrafast experimental data also provides evidence for the
dual timescales. These results, which represent a formal violation of
conventional linear response theory, provide a detailed picture of the interplay 
between fluctuations in organic solvent structure and thermal solution-phase
chemistry.

Electrical charges on the boundaries of topological insulators favour forward
motion over back-scattering at impurities, producing low-dissipation, metallic
states that exist up to room temperature in ambient conditions. These states have
the promise to impact a broad range of applications from electronics to the
production of energy, which is one reason why topological insulators have become 
the rising star in condensed-matter physics. There are many challenges in the
processing of these exotic materials to use the metallic states in functional
devices, and they present great opportunities for the chemistry and materials
science research communities.

Replicating the multi-hierarchical self-assembly of collagen has long-attracted
scientists, from both the perspective of the fundamental science of
supramolecular chemistry and that of potential biomedical applications in tissue 
engineering. Many approaches to drive the self-assembly of synthetic systems
through the same steps as those of natural collagen (peptide chain to triple
helix to nanofibres and, finally, to a hydrogel) are partially successful, but
none simultaneously demonstrate all the levels of structural assembly. Here we
describe a peptide that replicates the self-assembly of collagen through each of 
these steps. The peptide features collagen's characteristic
proline-hydroxyproline-glycine repeating unit, complemented by designed
salt-bridged hydrogen bonds between lysine and aspartate to stabilize the triple 
helix in a sticky-ended assembly. This assembly is propagated into nanofibres
with characteristic triple helical packing and lengths with a lower bound of
several hundred nanometres. These nanofibres form a hydrogel that is degraded by 
collagenase at a similar rate to that of natural collagen.

Heteromultimetallic hydride clusters containing both rare-earth and d-transition 
metals are of interest in terms of both their structure and reactivity. However, 
such heterometallic complexes have not yet been investigated to a great extent
because of difficulties in their synthesis and structural characterization. Here,
we report the synthesis, X-ray and neutron diffraction studies, and hydrogen
addition and release properties of a family of rare-earth/d-transition-metal
heteromultimetallic polyhydride complexes of the core structure type 'Ln(4)MH(n)'
(Ln = Y, Dy, Ho; M = Mo, W; n = 9, 11, 13). Monitoring of hydrogen addition to a 
hydride cluster such as [{(C(5)Me(4)SiMe(3))Y}(4)(μ-H)(9)Mo(C(5)Me(5))] in a
single-crystal to single-crystal process by X-ray diffraction has been achieved
for the first time. Density functional theory studies reveal that the hydrogen
addition process is cooperatively assisted by the Y/Mo heteromultimetallic sites,
thus offering unprecedented insight into the hydrogen addition and release
process of a metal hydride cluster.

Water oxidation catalysis constitutes the bottleneck for the development of
energy-conversion schemes based on sunlight. To date, state-of-the-art
homogeneous water oxidation catalysis is performed efficiently with expensive,
toxic and earth-scarce transition metals, but 3d metal-based catalysts are much
less established. Here we show that readily available, environmentally benign
iron coordination complexes catalyse homogeneous water oxidation to give O(2),
with high efficiency during a period of hours. Turnover numbers >350 and >1,000
were obtained using cerium ammonium nitrate at pH 1 and sodium periodate at pH 2,
respectively. Spectroscopic monitoring of the catalytic reactions, in combination
with kinetic studies, show that high valent oxo-iron species are responsible for 
the O-O forming event. A systematic study of iron complexes that contain a broad 
family of neutral tetradentate organic ligands identifies first-principle
structural features to sustain water oxidation catalysis. Iron-based catalysts
described herein open a novel strategy that could eventually enable sustainable
artificial photosynthetic schemes.

Frustrated magnetic lattices offer the possibility of many exotic ground states
that are of great fundamental importance. Of particular significance is the hunt 
for frustrated spin-1/2 networks as candidates for quantum spin liquids, which
would have exciting and unusual magnetic properties at low temperatures. The few 
reported candidate materials have all been based on d(9) ions. Here, we report
the ionothermal synthesis of [NH(4)](2)[C(7)H(14)N][V(7)O(6)F(18)], an
inorganic-organic hybrid solid that contains a S = 1/2 kagome network of d(1)
V(4+) ions. The compound exhibits a high degree of magnetic frustration, with
significant antiferromagnetic interactions but no long-range magnetic order or
spin-freezing above 2 K, and appears to be an excellent candidate for realizing a
quantum spin liquid ground state in a spin-1/2 kagome network.

The universal genetic code relies on two hydrogen-bonded Watson-Crick base pairs 
that can form 64 triplet codons. This places a limit on the number of amino acids
that can be encoded, which has motivated efforts to create synthetic base pairs
that are orthogonal to the natural ones. An additional base pair would result in 
another 61 triplet codons. Artificial organic base pairs have been described in
enzymatic incorporation studies, and inorganic T-Hg-T and C-Ag-C base pairs have 
been reported to form in primer extension studies. Here, we demonstrate a metal
base pair that is fully orthogonal and can be replicated, and can even be
amplified by polymerase chain reaction in the presence of the canonical pairs
dA:dT and dG:dC. Crystal structures of a dS-Cu-dS base pair inside a polymerase
show that reversible chemistry is possible directly inside the polymerase, which 
enables the efficient copying of the inorganic crosslink. The results open up the
possibility of replicating and amplifying artificial inorganic DNA nanostructures
by extending the genetic alphabet.

Oxo-transfer chemistry mediated by iron underpins many biological processes and
today is emerging as synthetically very important for the catalytic oxidation of 
C-H and C=C moieties that are hard to activate conventionally. Despite the vast
amount of research in this area, experimental characterization of the reactive
species under catalytic conditions is very limited, although a Fe(V)=O moiety was
postulated. Here we show, using variable-temperature mass spectrometry, the
generation of a Fe(V)=O species within a synthetic non-haem complex at -40 °C and
its reaction with an olefin. Also, with isotopic labelling we were able both to
follow oxygen-atom transfer from H(2)O(2)/H(2)O through Fe(V)=O to the products
and to probe the reactivity as a function of temperature. This study pioneers the
implementation of variable-temperature mass spectrometry to investigate reactive 
intermediates.

Ligands that stabilize the formation of telomeric DNA G-quadruplexes have
potential as cancer treatments, because the G-quadruplex structure cannot be
extended by telomerase, an enzyme over-expressed in many cancer cells.
Understanding the kinetic, thermodynamic and mechanical properties of
small-molecule binding to these structures is therefore important, but classical 
ensemble assays are unable to measure these simultaneously. Here, we have used a 
laser tweezers method to investigate such interactions. With a force jump
approach, we observe that pyridostatin promotes the folding of telomeric
G-quadruplexes. The increased mechanical stability of pyridostatin-bound
G-quadruplex permits the determination of a dissociation constant K(d) of 490 ±
80 nM. The free-energy change of binding obtained from a Hess-like process
provides an identical K(d) for pyridostatin and a K(d) of 42 ± 3 µM for a weaker 
ligand RR110. We anticipate that this single-molecule platform can provide
detailed insights into the mechanical, kinetic and thermodynamic properties of
liganded bio-macromolecules, which have biological relevance.

The construction of a protocell from a materials point of view is important in
understanding the origin of life. Both self-reproduction of a compartment and
self-replication of an informational substance have been studied extensively, but
these processes have typically been carried out independently, rather than linked
to one another. Here, we demonstrate the amplification of DNA (encapsulated
guest) within a self-reproducible cationic giant vesicle (host). With the
addition of a vesicular membrane precursor, we observe the growth and spontaneous
division of the giant vesicles, accompanied by distribution of the DNA to the
daughter giant vesicles. In particular, amplification of the DNA accelerated the 
division of the giant vesicles. This means that self-replication of an
informational substance has been linked to self-reproduction of a compartment
through the interplay between polyanionic DNA and the cationic vesicular
membrane. Our self-reproducing giant vesicle system therefore represents a step
forward in the construction of an advanced model protocell.

Solar fuel production often starts with the energy from light being absorbed by
an assembly of molecules; this electronic excitation is subsequently transferred 
to a suitable acceptor. For example, in photosynthesis, antenna complexes capture
sunlight and direct the energy to reaction centres that then carry out the
associated chemistry. In this Review, we describe the principles learned from
studies of various natural antenna complexes and suggest how to elucidate
strategies for designing light-harvesting systems. We envisage that such systems 
will be used for solar fuel production, to direct and regulate excitation energy 
flow using molecular organizations that facilitate feedback and control, or to
transfer excitons over long distances. Also described are the notable properties 
of light-harvesting chromophores, spatial-energetic landscapes, the roles of
excitonic states and quantum coherence, as well as how antennas are regulated and
photoprotected.

A current challenge in synthetic organic chemistry is the development of methods 
that allow the regio- and stereoselective oxidative C-H activation of natural or 
synthetic compounds with formation of the corresponding alcohols. Cytochrome P450
enzymes enable C-H activation at non-activated positions, but the simultaneous
control of both regio- and stereoselectivity is problematic. Here, we demonstrate
that directed evolution using iterative saturation mutagenesis provides a means
to solve synthetic problems of this kind. Using P450 BM3(F87A) as the starting
enzyme and testosterone as the substrate, which results in a 1:1 mixture of the
2β- and 15β-alcohols, mutants were obtained that are 96-97% selective for either 
of the two regioisomers, each with complete diastereoselectivity. The mutants can
be used for selective oxidative hydroxylation of other steroids without
performing additional mutagenesis experiments. Molecular dynamics simulations and
docking experiments shed light on the origin of regio- and stereoselectivity.

Although the outer surface of single-walled carbon nanotubes (atomically thin
cylinders of carbon) can be involved in a wide range of chemical reactions, it is
generally thought that the interior surface of nanotubes is unreactive. In this
study, we show that in the presence of catalytically active atoms of rhenium
inserted into nanotubes, the nanotube sidewall can be engaged in chemical
reactions from the inside. Aberration-corrected high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy operated at 80 keV allows visualization of the formation of
nanometre-sized hollow protrusions on the nanotube sidewall at the atomic level
in real time at ambient temperature. Our direct observations and theoretical
modelling demonstrate that the nanoprotrusions are formed in three stages: (i)
metal-assisted deformation and rupture of the nanotube sidewall, (ii) the fast
formation of a metastable asymmetric nanoprotrusion with an open edge and (iii) a
slow symmetrization process that leads to a stable closed nanoprotrusion.

Transcription factors are proteins that bind specifically to defined DNA
sequences to promote gene expression. Targeting transcription factors with small 
molecules to modulate the expression of certain genes has been notoriously
difficult to achieve. The natural product thiostrepton is known to reduce the
transcriptional activity of FOXM1, a transcription factor involved in
tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Herein we demonstrate that thiostrepton
interacts directly with FOXM1 protein in the human breast cancer cells MCF-7.
Biophysical analyses of the thiostrepton-FOXM1 interaction provide additional
insights on the molecular mode of action of thiostrepton. In cellular
experiments, we show that thiostrepton can inhibit the binding of FOXM1 to
genomic target sites. These findings illustrate the potential druggability of
transcription factors and provide a molecular basis for targeting the FOXM1
family with small molecules.

Although phospholipid bilayers are ubiquitous in modern cells, their
impermeability, lack of dynamic properties, and synthetic complexity are
difficult to reconcile with plausible pathways of proto-metabolism, growth and
division. Here, we present an alternative membrane-free model, which demonstrates
that low-molecular-weight mononucleotides and simple cationic peptides
spontaneously accumulate in water into microdroplets that are stable to changes
in temperature and salt concentration, undergo pH-induced cycles of growth and
decay, and promote α-helical peptide secondary structure. Moreover, the
microdroplets selectively sequester porphyrins, inorganic nanoparticles and
enzymes to generate supramolecular stacked arrays of light-harvesting molecules, 
nanoparticle-mediated oxidase activity, and enhanced rates of glucose
phosphorylation, respectively. Taken together, our results suggest that
peptide-nucleotide microdroplets can be considered as a new type of protocell
model that could be used to develop novel bioreactors, primitive artificial cells
and plausible pathways to prebiotic organization before the emergence of
lipid-based compartmentalization on the early Earth.

Homochirality is essential to many biological systems, and plays a pivotal role
in various technological applications. The generation of homochirality and an
understanding of its mechanism from the single-molecule to supramolecular level
have received much attention. Two-dimensional chirality is a subject of intense
interest due to the unique possibilities and consequences of confining molecular 
self-assembly to surfaces or interfaces. Here, we report the perfect generation
of two-dimensional homochirality of porous molecular networks at the liquid-solid
interface in two different ways: (i) by self-assembly of homochiral building
blocks and (ii) by self-assembly of achiral building blocks in the presence of a 
chiral modifier via a hierarchical structural recognition process, as revealed by
scanning tunnelling microscopy. The present results provide important impetus for
the development of two-dimensional crystal engineering and may afford
opportunities for the utilization of chiral nanowells in chiral recognition
processes, as nanoreactors and as data storage systems.

The efficiency of fuel cells and metal-air batteries is significantly limited by 
the activation of oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. Despite the
well-recognized role of oxygen reaction kinetics on the viability of energy
technologies, the governing mechanisms remain elusive and until now have been
addressable only by macroscopic studies. This lack of nanoscale understanding
precludes optimization of material architecture. Here, we report direct
measurements of oxygen reduction/evolution reactions and oxygen vacancy diffusion
on oxygen-ion conductive solid surfaces with sub-10 nm resolution. In
electrochemical strain microscopy, the biased scanning probe microscopy tip acts 
as a moving, electrocatalytically active probe exploring local electrochemical
activity. The probe concentrates an electric field in a nanometre-scale volume of
material, and bias-induced, picometre-level surface displacements provide
information on local electrochemical processes. Systematic mapping of oxygen
activity on bare and platinum-functionalized yttria-stabilized zirconia surfaces 
is demonstrated. This approach allows direct visualization of the oxygen
reduction/evolution reaction activation process at the triple-phase boundary, and
can be extended to a broad spectrum of oxygen-conductive and electrocatalytic
materials.

The single-handedness of biological molecules is critical for molecular
recognition and replication processes and would seem to be a prerequisite for the
origin of life. A drawback of recently reported synthetic routes to RNA is the
requirement for enantioenriched reactants, which fails to address the puzzle of
how the single chirality of biological molecules arose. Here, we report the
synthesis of highly enantioenriched RNA precursor molecules from racemic starting
materials, with the molecular asymmetry derived solely from a small initial
imbalance of the amino-acid enantiomers present in the reaction mixture. Acting
as spectators to the main reaction chemistry, the amino acids orchestrate a
sequence of physical and chemical amplification processes. The emergence of
molecules of single chirality from complex, multi-component mixtures supports the
robustness of this synthesis process under potential prebiotic conditions and
provides a plausible explanation for the single-handedness of biological
molecules before the emergence of self-replicating informational polymers.

Portable, low-cost and quantitative detection of a broad range of targets at home
and in the field has the potential to revolutionize medical diagnostics and
environmental monitoring. Despite many years of research, very few such devices
are commercially available. Taking advantage of the wide availability and low
cost of the pocket-sized personal glucose meter-used worldwide by diabetes
sufferers-we demonstrate a method to use such meters to quantify non-glucose
targets, ranging from a recreational drug (cocaine, 3.4 µM detection limit) to an
important biological cofactor (adenosine, 18 µM detection limit), to a disease
marker (interferon-gamma of tuberculosis, 2.6 nM detection limit) and a toxic
metal ion (uranium, 9.1 nM detection limit). The method is based on the
target-induced release of invertase from a functional-DNA-invertase conjugate.
The released invertase converts sucrose into glucose, which is detectable using
the meter. The approach should be easily applicable to the detection of many
other targets through the use of suitable functional-DNA partners (aptamers,
DNAzymes or aptazymes).

Successful implementation of a catalytic asymmetric synthesis strategy to produce
enantiomerically enriched compounds requires the adoption of suitable prochiral
substrates. The combination of an azomethine imine electrophile with various
nucleophiles could give straightforward access to a number of synthetically
useful chiral hydrazines, but is used rarely. Here we report the exploitation of 
acyclic azomethine imines as a new type of prochiral electrophile. They can be
generated in situ by the condensation of N'-benzylbenzoylhydrazide with a variety
of aldehydes in the presence of a catalytic amount of an axially chiral
dicarboxylic acid. By trapping these electrophiles with alkyl diazoacetate or
(diazomethyl)phosphonate nucleophiles, we produced a diverse array of chiral
α-diazo-β-hydrazino esters and phosphonates with excellent enantioselectivities.

Platinum-based heterogeneous catalysts are critical to many important commercial 
chemical processes, but their efficiency is extremely low on a per metal atom
basis, because only the surface active-site atoms are used. Catalysts with
single-atom dispersions are thus highly desirable to maximize atom efficiency,
but making them is challenging. Here we report the synthesis of a single-atom
catalyst that consists of only isolated single Pt atoms anchored to the surfaces 
of iron oxide nanocrystallites. This single-atom catalyst has extremely high atom
efficiency and shows excellent stability and high activity for both CO oxidation 
and preferential oxidation of CO in H2. Density functional theory calculations
show that the high catalytic activity correlates with the partially vacant 5d
orbitals of the positively charged, high-valent Pt atoms, which help to reduce
both the CO adsorption energy and the activation barriers for CO oxidation.

Elucidation of natural product biosynthetic pathways provides important insights 
into the assembly of potent bioactive molecules, and expands access to unique
enzymes able to selectively modify complex substrates. Here, we show full
reconstitution, in vitro, of an unusual multi-step oxidative cascade for
post-assembly-line tailoring of tirandamycin antibiotics. This pathway involves a
remarkably versatile and iterative cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (TamI) and a
flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent oxidase (TamL), which act co-dependently
through the repeated exchange of substrates. TamI hydroxylates tirandamycin C
(TirC) to generate tirandamycin E (TirE), a previously unidentified tirandamycin 
intermediate. TirE is subsequently oxidized by TamL, giving rise to the ketone of
tirandamycin D (TirD), after which a unique exchange back to TamI enables
successive epoxidation and hydroxylation to afford, respectively, the final
products tirandamycin A (TirA) and tirandamycin B (TirB). Ligand-free, substrate-
and product-bound crystal structures of bicovalently flavinylated TamL oxidase
reveal a likely mechanism for the C10 oxidation of TirE.

From ligand-receptor binding to DNA hybridization, molecular recognition plays a 
central role in biology. Over the past several decades, chemists have
successfully reproduced the exquisite specificity of biomolecular interactions.
However, engineering multiple specific interactions in synthetic systems remains 
difficult. DNA retains its position as the best medium with which to create
orthogonal, isoenergetic interactions, based on the complementarity of
Watson-Crick binding. Here we show that DNA can be used to create diverse bonds
using an entirely different principle: the geometric arrangement of blunt-end
stacking interactions. We show that both binary codes and shape complementarity
can serve as a basis for such stacking bonds, and explore their specificity,
thermodynamics and binding rules. Orthogonal stacking bonds were used to connect 
five distinct DNA origami. This work, which demonstrates how a single attractive 
interaction can be developed to create diverse bonds, may guide strategies for
molecular recognition in systems beyond DNA nanostructures.

The daphnane diterpene orthoesters constitute a structurally fascinating family
of natural products that exhibit a remarkable range of potent biological
activities. Although partial activity information is available for some natural
daphnanes, little information exists for non-natural congeners or on how changes 
in structure affect mode of action, function, potency or selectivity. A gateway
strategy designed to provide general synthetic access to natural and non-natural 
daphnanes is described and utilized in the synthesis of two novel members of this
class. In this study, a commercially available tartrate derivative was elaborated
through a key late-stage diversification intermediate into B-ring yuanhuapin
analogues to initiate exploration of the structure-function relationships of this
class. Protein kinase C was identified as a cellular target for these agents, and
their activity against human lung and leukaemia cell lines was evaluated. The
natural product and a novel non-natural analogue exhibited significant potency,
but the epimeric epoxide was essentially inactive.

Catalytic hydrogenation of organic carbonates, carbamates and formates is of
significant interest both conceptually and practically, because these compounds
can be produced from CO2 and CO, and their mild hydrogenation can provide
alternative, mild approaches to the indirect hydrogenation of CO2 and CO to
methanol, an important fuel and synthetic building block. Here, we report for the
first time catalytic hydrogenation of organic carbonates to alcohols, and
carbamates to alcohols and amines. Unprecedented homogeneously catalysed
hydrogenation of organic formates to methanol has also been accomplished. The
reactions are efficiently catalysed by dearomatized PNN Ru(II) pincer complexes
derived from pyridine- and bipyridine-based tridentate ligands. These
atom-economical reactions proceed under neutral, homogeneous conditions, at mild 
temperatures and under mild hydrogen pressures, and can operate in the absence of
solvent with no generation of waste, representing the ultimate 'green' reactions.
A possible mechanism involves metal-ligand cooperation by
aromatization-dearomatization of the heteroaromatic pincer core.

The transition from inanimate materials to the earliest forms of life must have
involved multiplication of a catalytically active polymer that is able to
replicate. The semiconservative replication that is characteristic of genetic
information transfer requires strands that contain more than one type of
nucleobase. Short strands of RNA can act as catalysts, but attempts to induce
efficient self-copying of mixed sequences (containing four different nucleobases)
have been unsuccessful with ribonucleotides. Here we show that inhibition by
spent monomers, formed by the hydrolysis of the activated nucleotides, is the
cause for incomplete extension of growing daughter strands on RNA templates.
Immobilization of strands and periodic displacement of the solution containing
the activated monomers overcome this inhibition. Any of the four nucleobases
(A/C/G/U) is successfully copied in the absence of enzymes. We conclude therefore
that in a prebiotic world, oligoribonucleotides may have formed and undergone
self-copying on surfaces.

Inelastic scattering is a fundamental collisional process that plays an important
role in many areas of chemistry, and its detailed study can provide valuable
insight into more complex chemical systems. Here, we report the measurement of
differential cross-sections for the rotationally inelastic scattering of
NO(X2Π1/2, v=0, j=0.5, f) by Ar at a collision energy of 530 cm(-1) in
unprecedented detail, with full Λ-doublet (hence total NO parity) resolution in
both the initial and final rotational quantum states. The observed differential
cross-sections depend sensitively on the change in total NO parity on collision. 
Differential cross-sections for total parity-conserving and changing collisions
have distinct, novel quantum-mechanical interference structures, reflecting
different sensitivities to specific homonuclear and heteronuclear terms in the
interaction potential. The experimental data agree remarkably well with rigorous 
quantum-mechanical scattering calculations, and reveal the role played by total
parity in acting as a potential energy landscape filter.

Although the majority of ligands in modern chemistry take advantage of
carbon-based substituent effects to tune the sterics and electronics of
coordinating moieties, we describe here how icosahedral carboranes-boron-rich
clusters-can influence metal-ligand interactions. Using a series of
phosphine-thioether chelating ligands featuring meta- or ortho-carboranes grafted
on the sulfur atom, we were able to tune the lability of the platinum-sulfur
interaction of platinum(II)-thioether complexes. Experimental observations,
supported by computational work, show that icosahedral carboranes can act either 
as strong electron-withdrawing ligands or electron-donating moieties (similar to 
aryl- or alkyl-based groups, respectively), depending on which atom of the
carborane cage is attached to the thioether moiety. These and similar results
with carborane-selenol derivatives suggest that, in contrast to carbon-based
ligands, icosahedral carboranes exhibit a significant dichotomy in their
coordination chemistry, and can be used as a versatile class of electronically
tunable building blocks for various ligand platforms.

Engineering the surface chemistry of a material so that it can interface with
cells is an extraordinarily demanding task. The surface of a cell is composed of 
thousands of different lipids, proteins and carbohydrates, all intricately (and
dynamically) arranged in three dimensions on multiple length scales. This
complexity presents both a challenge and an opportunity to chemists working on
bioactive interfaces. Here we discuss how some of these challenges can be met
with interdisciplinary material synthesis. We also review the most popular
classes of functional molecules grafted on engineered surfaces and explore some
alternatives that may offer greater flexibility and specificity. Finally, we
discuss the emerging field of dynamic surfaces capable of stimulating and
responding to cellular activity in real time.

The light-induced phase transition between the low-spin (LS) and high-spin (HS)
states of some transition-metal ions has been extensively studied in the fields
of chemistry and materials science. In a crystalline extended system,
magnetically ordering the HS sites of such transition-metal ions by irradiation
should lead to spontaneous magnetization. Previous examples of light-induced
ordering have typically occurred by means of an intermetallic charge transfer
mechanism, inducing a change of valence of the metal centres. Here, we describe
the long-range magnetic ordering of the extended Fe(II)(HS) sites in a
metal-organic framework caused instead by a light-induced excited spin-state
trapping effect. The Fe-Nb-based material behaves as a spin-crossover magnet, in 
which a strong superexchange interaction (magnetic coupling through non-magnetic 
elements) between photo-produced Fe(II)(HS) and neighbouring Nb(IV) atoms
operates through CN bridges. The magnetic phase transition is observed at 20 K
with a coercive field of 240 Oe.

Cell surface carbohydrates play significant roles in a number of biologically
important processes. Heparan sulfate, for instance, is a ubiquitously distributed
polysulfated polysaccharide that is involved, among other things, in the initial 
step of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection. The virus interacts with
cell-surface heparan sulfate to facilitate host-cell attachment and entry.
3-O-Sulfonated heparan sulfate has been found to function as an HSV-1 entry
receptor. Achieving a complete understanding of these interactions requires the
chemical synthesis of such oligosaccharides, but this remains challenging. Here, 
we present a convenient approach for the synthesis of two irregular
3-O-sulfonated heparan sulfate octasaccharides, making use of a key disaccharide 
intermediate to acquire different building blocks for the oligosaccharide chain
assembly. Despite substantial structural differences, the prepared 3-O-sulfonated
sugars blocked viral infection in a dosage-dependent manner with remarkable
similarity to one another.

Metal nanoparticles that comprise a few hundred to several thousand atoms have
many applications in areas such as photonics, sensing, medicine and catalysis.
Colloidal methods have proven particularly suitable for producing small
nanoparticles with controlled morphologies and excellent catalytic properties.
Ligands are necessary to stabilize nanoparticles during synthesis, but once the
particles have been deposited on a substrate the presence of the ligands is
detrimental for catalytic activity. Previous methods for ligand removal have
typically involved thermal and oxidative treatments, which can affect the size or
morphology of the particles, in turn altering their catalytic activity. Here, we 
report a procedure to effectively remove the ligands without affecting particle
morphology, which enhances the surface exposure of the nanoparticles and their
catalytic activity over a range of reactions. This may lead to developments of
nanoparticles prepared by colloidal methods for applications in fields such as
environmental protection and energy production.

The prohibitive cost and scarcity of the noble-metal catalysts needed for
catalysing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells and metal-air
batteries limit the commercialization of these clean-energy technologies.
Identifying a catalyst design principle that links material properties to the
catalytic activity can accelerate the search for highly active and abundant
transition-metal-oxide catalysts to replace platinum. Here, we demonstrate that
the ORR activity for oxide catalysts primarily correlates to σ-orbital (e(g))
occupation and the extent of B-site transition-metal-oxygen covalency, which
serves as a secondary activity descriptor. Our findings reflect the critical
influences of the σ orbital and metal-oxygen covalency on the competition between
O(2)(2-)/OH(-) displacement and OH(-) regeneration on surface transition-metal
ions as the rate-limiting steps of the ORR, and thus highlight the importance of 
electronic structure in controlling oxide catalytic activity.

Loline (1) is a small alkaloid that, in spite of its simple-looking structure,
has posed surprising challenges to synthetic chemists. It has been known for more
than a century and has been the subject of extensive biological investigations,
but only two total syntheses have been achieved to date. Here, we report an
asymmetric total synthesis of loline that, with less then ten steps, is
remarkably short. Our synthesis incorporates a Sharpless epoxidation, a Grubbs
olefin metathesis and an unprecedented transannular aminobromination, which
converts an eight-membered cyclic carbamate into a bromopyrrolizidine. The
synthesis is marked by a high degree of chemo- and stereoselectivity and gives
access to several members of the loline alkaloid family. It delivers sufficient
material to support a programme aimed at studying the complex interactions
between plants, fungi, insects and bacteria brokered by loline alkaloids.

Single-molecule magnets approach the ultimate size limit for spin-based devices. 
These complexes can retain spin information over long periods of time at low
temperature, suggesting possible applications in high-density information
storage, quantum computing and spintronics. Notably, the success of most such
applications hinges upon raising the inherent molecular spin-inversion barrier.
Although recent advances have shown the viability of lanthanide-containing
complexes in generating large barriers, weak or non-existent magnetic exchange
coupling allows fast relaxation pathways that mitigate the full potential of
these species. Here, we show that the diffuse spin of an N(2)(3-) radical bridge 
can lead to exceptionally strong magnetic exchange in dinuclear Ln(III) (Ln = Gd,
Dy) complexes. The Gd(III) congener exhibits the strongest magnetic coupling yet 
observed for that ion, while incorporation of the high-anisotropy Dy(III) ion
gives rise to a molecule with a record magnetic blocking temperature of 8.3 K at 
a sweep rate of 0.08 T s(-1).

Bioinspired hydrogenation of N(2) to ammonia at ambient conditions by stepwise
nitrogen protonation/reduction with metal complexes in solution has experienced
remarkable progress. In contrast, the highly desirable direct hydrogenation with 
H(2) remains difficult. In analogy to the heterogeneously catalysed Haber-Bosch
process, such a reaction is conceivable via metal-centred N(2) splitting and
unprecedented hydrogenolysis of the nitrido ligands to ammonia. We report the
synthesis of a ruthenium(IV) nitrido complex. The high nucleophilicity of the
nitrido ligand is demonstrated by unusual N-C coupling with π-acidic CO.
Furthermore, the terminal nitrido ligand undergoes facile hydrogenolysis with
H(2) at ambient conditions to produce ammonia in high yield. Kinetic and quantum 
chemical examinations of this reaction suggest cooperative behaviour of a
phosphorus-nitrogen-phosphorus pincer ligand in rate-determining heterolytic
hydrogen splitting.

Unlike N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), which are now used ubiquitously in
metal-based chemistry, the nitrogen-derived analogue (in which a carbon is
replaced with the isoelectronic nitrogen cation, a nitrenium ion) has remained
elusive as a ligand for metals. This is especially intriguing, because several
other main-group analogues of NHCs have been prepared, and have been shown to
coordinate with transition-metal complexes. Here, we describe the preparation of 
several N-heterocyclic nitrenium ions that are isoelectronic and isostructural to
NHCs, and study their ligand properties. The formation of relatively strong
nitrenium-metal bonds is unambiguously confirmed, in solution by selective
(15)N-labelling experiments, and in the solid state by X-ray crystallography.
Experimental and computational studies of the electronic properties of this novel
type of ligand suggest that they are poor σ-donors and good π-acceptors.

Peptide macrocycles have found applications that range from drug discovery to
nanomaterials. These ring-shaped molecules have shown remarkable capacity for
functional fine-tuning. Such capacity is enabled by the possibility of adjusting 
the peptide conformation using the techniques of chemical synthesis. Cyclic
peptides have been difficult, and often impossible, to prepare using traditional 
synthetic methods. For macrocyclization to occur, the activated peptide must
adopt an entropically disfavoured pre-cyclization conformation before forming the
desired product. Here, we review recent solutions to some of the major challenges
in this important area of contemporary synthesis.

Catalytic hydrogen production from renewables is a promising method for providing
energy carriers in the near future. Photocatalysts capable of promoting this
reaction are often composed of noble metal nanoparticles deposited on a
semiconductor. The most promising semiconductor at present is TiO₂. The
successful design of these catalysts relies on a thorough understanding of the
role of the noble metal particle size and the TiO₂ polymorph. Here we demonstrate
that Au particles in the size range 3-30 nm on TiO₂ are very active in hydrogen
production from ethanol. It was found that Au particles of similar size on
anatase nanoparticles delivered a rate two orders of magnitude higher than that
recorded for Au on rutile nanoparticles. Surprisingly, it was also found that Au 
particle size does not affect the photoreaction rate over the 3-12 nm range. The 
high hydrogen yield observed makes these catalysts promising materials for solar 
conversion.

Cyst nematodes are troublesome parasites that live on, and destroy, a range of
important host vegetable plants. Damage caused by the potato cyst nematode has
now been reported in over 50 countries. One approach to eliminating the problem
is to stimulate early hatching of the nematodes, but key hatching stimuli are not
naturally available in sufficient quantities to do so. Here, we report the first 
chemical synthesis of solanoeclepin A, the key hatch-stimulating substance for
potato cyst nematode. The crucial steps in our synthesis are an intramolecular
cyclization reaction for construction of the highly strained
tricyclo[5.2.1.0¹'⁶]decane skeleton (DEF ring system) and an intramolecular
Diels-Alder reaction of a furan derivative for the synthesis of the ABC carbon
framework. The present synthesis has the potential to contribute to addressing
one of the critical food issues of the twenty-first century.

Core@shell structured bimetallic nanoparticles are currently of immense interest 
due to their unique electronic, optical and catalytic properties. However, their 
synthesis is non-trivial. We report a new supramolecular route for the synthesis 
of core@shell nanoparticles, based on an anion coordination protocol--the first
to function by binding the shell metal to the surface of the pre-formed primary
metal core before reduction. The resultant gold/palladium and platinum/palladium 
core@shell nanoparticles have been characterized by aberration-corrected scanning
transmission electron microscopy (as well as other techniques), giving striking
atomic-resolution images of the core@shell architecture, and the unique catalytic
properties of the structured nanoparticles have been demonstrated in a remarkable
improvement of the selective production of industrially valuable chloroaniline
from chloronitrobenzene.

Single-step constructions of molecules with multiple quaternary carbon
stereocentres are rare. The spirooxindole structural motif is common to a range
of bioactive compounds; however, asymmetric synthesis of this motif is
complicated due to the presence of multiple chiral centres. The development of
organocatalytic cascade reactions has proven to be valuable for the construction 
of several chiral centres in one step. Here, we describe a newly designed
organocatalytic asymmetric domino Michael-aldol reaction between 3-substituted
oxindoles and methyleneindolinones that affords complex bispirooxindoles. This
reaction was catalysed by a novel multifunctional organocatalyst that contains
tertiary and primary amines and thiourea moieties to activate substrates
simultaneously, providing extraordinary levels of stereocontrol over four
stereocentres, three of which are quaternary carbon stereocentres. This new
methodology provides facile access to a range of multisubstituted
bispirocyclooxindole derivatives, and should be useful in medicinal chemistry and
diversity-oriented syntheses of this intriguing class of compounds.

Catalysis plays a critical role in chemical conversion, energy production and
pollution mitigation. High activation barriers associated with rate-limiting
elementary steps require most commercial heterogeneous catalytic reactions to be 
run at relatively high temperatures, which compromises energy efficiency and the 
long-term stability of the catalyst. Here we show that plasmonic nanostructures
of silver can concurrently use low-intensity visible light (on the order of solar
intensity) and thermal energy to drive catalytic oxidation reactions--such as
ethylene epoxidation, CO oxidation, and NH₃ oxidation--at lower temperatures than
their conventional counterparts that use only thermal stimulus. Based on kinetic 
isotope experiments and density functional calculations, we postulate that
excited plasmons on the silver surface act to populate O₂ antibonding orbitals
and so form a transient negative-ion state, which thereby facilitates the
rate-limiting O₂-dissociation reaction. The results could assist the design of
catalytic processes that are more energy efficient and robust than current
processes.

Water oxidation in all oxygenic photosynthetic organisms is catalysed by the
Mn₄CaO₄ cluster of Photosystem II. This cluster has inspired the development of
synthetic manganese catalysts for solar energy production. A photoelectrochemical
device, made by impregnating a synthetic tetranuclear-manganese cluster into a
Nafion matrix, has been shown to achieve efficient water oxidation catalysis. We 
report here in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy and transmission electron
microscopy studies that demonstrate that this cluster dissociates into Mn(II)
compounds in the Nafion, which are then reoxidized to form dispersed
nanoparticles of a disordered Mn(III/IV)-oxide phase. Cycling between the
photoreduced product and this mineral-like solid is responsible for the observed 
photochemical water-oxidation catalysis. The original manganese cluster serves
only as a precursor to the catalytically active material. The behaviour of Mn in 
Nafion therefore parallels its broader biogeochemistry, which is also dominated
by cycles of oxidation into solid Mn(III/IV) oxides followed by photoreduction to
Mn²⁺.

Single-molecule magnets (SMMs) are compounds that, below a blocking temperature, 
exhibit stable magnetization purely of molecular origin, and not caused by
long-range ordering of magnetic moments in the bulk. They thus show promise for
applications such as data storage of ultra-high density. The stability of the
magnetization increases with increasing ground-state spin and magnetic
anisotropy. Transition-metal SMMs typically possess high-spin ground states, but 
insufficient magnetic anisotropies. Lanthanide SMMs exhibit large magnetic
anisotropies, but building high-spin ground states is difficult because they tend
to form ionic bonds that limit magnetic exchange coupling. In contrast, the
significant covalent bonding and large spin-orbit contributions associated with
uranium are particularly attractive for the development of improved SMMs. Here we
report a delocalized arene-bridged diuranium SMM. This study demonstrates that
arene-bridged polyuranium clusters can exhibit SMM behaviour without relying on
the superexchange coupling of spins. This approach may lead to increased blocking
temperatures.

Management of chronic pain continues to represent an area of great unmet
biomedical need. Although opioid analgesics are typically embraced as the
mainstay of pharmaceutical interventions in this area, they suffer from
substantial liabilities that include addiction and tolerance, as well as
depression of breathing, nausea and chronic constipation. Because of their
suboptimal therapeutic profile, the search for non-opioid analgesics to replace
these well-established therapeutics is an important pursuit. Conolidine is a rare
C5-nor stemmadenine natural product recently isolated from the stem bark of
Tabernaemontana divaricata (a tropical flowering plant used in traditional
Chinese, Ayurvedic and Thai medicine). Although structurally related alkaloids
have been described as opioid analgesics, no therapeutically relevant properties 
of conolidine have previously been reported. Here, we describe the first de novo 
synthetic pathway to this exceptionally rare C5-nor stemmadenine natural product,
the first asymmetric synthesis of any member of this natural product class, and
the discovery that (±)-, (+)- and (-)-conolidine are potent and efficacious
non-opioid analgesics in an in vivo model of tonic and persistent pain.

Measuring the isotopic abundance of hydrogen versus deuterium atoms is a key
method for interrogating reaction pathways in chemistry. H/D 'scrambling' is the 
intramolecular rearrangement of labile isotopes of hydrogen atoms and when it
occurs through unanticipated pathways can complicate the interpretation of such
experiments. Here, we investigate H/D scrambling in acetaldehyde at the energetic
threshold for breaking the formyl C-H bond and reveal an unexpected unimolecular 
mechanism. Laser photolysis experiments of CD₃CHO show that up to 17% of the
products have undergone H/D exchange to give CD₂H + DCO. Transition-state theory 
calculations reveal that the dominant mechanism involves four sequential H- or
D-shifts to form CD₂HCDO, which then undergoes conventional C-C bond cleavage. At
the lowest energy the molecule undergoes an average of 20 H- or D-shifts before
products are formed, evincing significant scrambling of H and D atoms. Analogous 
photochemically induced isomerizations and isotope scrambling are probably
important in both atmospheric chemistry and combustion reactions.

Pipetting and dilution are universal processes used in chemical and biological
laboratories to assay and experiment. In microfluidics such operations are
equally in demand, but difficult to implement. Recently, droplet-based
microfluidics has emerged as an exciting new platform for high-throughput
experimentation. However, it is challenging to vary the concentration of droplets
rapidly and controllably. To this end, we developed a dilution module for
high-throughput screening using droplet-based microfluidics. Briefly, a
nanolitre-sized sample droplet of defined concentration is trapped within a
microfluidic chamber. Through a process of droplet merging, mixing and
re-splitting, this droplet is combined with a series of smaller buffer droplets
to generate a sequence of output droplets that define a digital concentration
gradient. Importantly, the formed droplets can be merged with other reagent
droplets to enable rapid chemical and biological screens. As a proof of concept, 
we used the dilutor to perform a high-throughput homogeneous DNA-binding assay
using only nanolitres of sample.

Recently, by mastering either top-down or bottom-up approaches, tailor-made
macromolecular nano-objects with semiconducting properties have been fabricated. 
These engineered nanostructures for organic electronics are based on conjugated
systems predominantly made up of sp²-hybridized carbon, such as graphene
nanoribbons. Here, we describe developments in a selection of these
nanofabrication techniques, which include graphene carving, stimulus-induced
synthesis of conjugated polymers and surface-assisted synthesis. We also assess
their potential to reproduce chemically and spatially precise molecular
arrangements, that is, molecular blueprints. In a broad context, the engineering 
of a molecular blueprint represents the fabrication of an integrated all-organic 
macromolecular electronic circuit. In this Perspective, we suggest chemical
routes, as well as convergent on-surface synthesis and microfabrication
approaches, for the ultimate goal of bringing the field closer to technology.

Macromolecular antimicrobial agents such as cationic polymers and peptides have
recently been under an increased level of scrutiny because they can combat
multi-drug-resistant microbes. Most of these polymers are non-biodegradable and
are designed to mimic the facially amphiphilic structure of peptides so that they
may form a secondary structure on interaction with negatively charged microbial
membranes. The resulting secondary structure can insert into and disintegrate the
cell membrane after recruiting additional polymer molecules. Here, we report the 
first biodegradable and in vivo applicable antimicrobial polymer nanoparticles
synthesized by metal-free organocatalytic ring-opening polymerization of
functional cyclic carbonate. We demonstrate that the nanoparticles disrupt
microbial walls/membranes selectively and efficiently, thus inhibiting the growth
of Gram-positive bacteria, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and
fungi, without inducing significant haemolysis over a wide range of
concentrations. These biodegradable nanoparticles, which can be synthesized in
large quantities and at low cost, are promising as antimicrobial drugs, and can
be used to treat various infectious diseases such as MRSA-associated infections, 
which are often linked with high mortality.

The recoil of adsorbates away (desorption) and towards (reaction) surfaces is
well known. Here, we describe the long-range recoil of adsorbates in the plane of
a surface, and accordingly the novel phenomenon of reactions occurring at a
substantial distance from the originating event. Three thermal and three
electron-induced surface reactions are shown by scanning tunnelling microscopy to
propel their physisorbed ethylenic products across the rough surface of Si(100)
over a distance of up to 200 Å before an attachment reaction. The recoil energy
in the ethylenic products comes from thermal exoergicity or from electronic
excitation of chemisorbed alkenes. We propose that the mechanism of migration is 
a rolling motion, because the recoiling molecule overcomes raised surface
obstacles. Electronic excitation of propene causes directional recoil and often
end-to-end inversion, suggesting cartwheeling. Ab initio calculations of the
halogenation and electron-induced reactions support a model in which asymmetric
forces between the molecule and the surface induce rotation and therefore
migration.

The properties of a nanocrystal are heavily influenced by its shape. Shape
control of a colloidal nanocrystal is believed to be a kinetic process, with
high-energy facets growing faster then vanishing, leading to nanocrystals
enclosed by low-energy facets. Identifying a surfactant that can specifically
bind to a particular crystal facet is critical, but has proved challenging to
date. Biomolecules have exquisite specific molecular recognition properties that 
can be explored for the precise engineering of nanostructured materials. Here, we
report the use of facet-specific peptide sequences as regulating agents for the
predictable synthesis of platinum nanocrystals with selectively exposed crystal
surfaces and particular shapes. The formation of platinum nanocubes and
nanotetrahedrons are demonstrated with Pt-{100} and Pt-{111} binding peptides,
respectively. Our studies unambiguously demonstrate the abilities of
facet-selective binding peptides in determining nanocrystal shape, representing a
critical step forward in the use of biomolecules for programmable synthesis of
nanostructures.

Oxidative cyclizations, exemplified by the biosynthetic assembly of the
penicillin nucleus from a tripeptide precursor, are arguably the most
synthetically powerful implementation of C-H activation reactions in nature.
Here, we show that Rieske oxygenase-like enzymes mediate regio- and
stereodivergent oxidative cyclizations to form 10- and 12-membered carbocyclic
rings in the key steps of the biosynthesis of the antibiotics streptorubin B and 
metacycloprodigiosin, respectively. These reactions represent the first examples 
of oxidative carbocyclizations catalysed by non-haem iron-dependent oxidases and 
define a novel type of catalytic activity for Rieske enzymes. A better
understanding of how these enzymes achieve such remarkable regio- and
stereocontrol in the functionalization of unactivated hydrocarbon chains will
greatly facilitate the development of selective man-made C-H activation
catalysts.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of crystalline materials that consist
of metal ions and organic ligands linked together by coordination bonds. Because 
of their porosity and the possibility of combining large surface areas with pore 
characteristics that can be tailored, these solids show great promise for a wide 
range of applications. Although most applications currently under investigation
are based on powdered solids, developing synthetic methods to prepare defect-free
MOF layers will also enable applications based on selective permeation. Here, we 
demonstrate how the intrinsically hybrid nature of MOFs enables the
self-completing growth of thin MOF layers. Moreover, these layers can be shaped
as hollow capsules that demonstrate selective permeability directly related to
the micropore size of the MOF crystallites forming the capsule wall. Such
capsules effectively entrap guest species, and, in the future, could be applied
in the development of selective microreactors containing molecular catalysts.

Carbon-carbon bond formation is the basis for the biogenesis of nature's
essential molecules. Consequently, it lies at the heart of the chemical sciences.
Chiral catalysts have been developed for asymmetric C-C bond formation to yield
single enantiomers from several organometallic reagents. Remarkably, for
extremely reactive organolithium compounds, which are among the most broadly used
reagents in chemical synthesis, a general catalytic methodology for
enantioselective C-C formation has proven elusive, until now. Here, we report a
copper-based chiral catalytic system that allows carbon-carbon bond formation via
allylic alkylation with alkyllithium reagents, with extremely high
enantioselectivities and able to tolerate several functional groups. We have
found that both the solvent used and the structure of the active chiral catalyst 
are the most critical factors in achieving successful asymmetric catalysis with
alkyllithium reagents. The active form of the chiral catalyst has been identified
through spectroscopic studies as a diphosphine copper monoalkyl species.

Supported catalysts are widely used in industry and can be optimized by tuning
the composition and interface of the metal nanoparticles and oxide supports.
Rational design of metal-metal oxide interfaces in nanostructured catalysts is
critical to achieve better reaction activities and selectivities. We introduce
here a new class of nanocrystal tandem catalysts that have multiple metal-metal
oxide interfaces for the catalysis of sequential reactions. We utilized a
nanocrystal bilayer structure formed by assembling platinum and cerium oxide
nanocube monolayers of less than 10 nm on a silica substrate. The two distinct
metal-metal oxide interfaces, CeO(2)-Pt and Pt-SiO(2), can be used to catalyse
two distinct sequential reactions. The CeO(2)-Pt interface catalysed methanol
decomposition to produce CO and H(2), which were subsequently used for ethylene
hydroformylation catalysed by the nearby Pt-SiO(2) interface. Consequently,
propanal was produced selectively from methanol and ethylene on the nanocrystal
bilayer tandem catalyst. This new concept of nanocrystal tandem catalysis
represents a powerful approach towards designing high-performance,
multifunctional nanostructured catalysts.

The reaction of enol(ate)s with electrophiles is used extensively in organic
synthesis for stereoselective C-C bond formation. Protein-based catalysts have
had comparatively limited application for the stereoselective formation of C-C
bonds of choice via enolate chemistry. We describe protein engineering studies on
5-carboxymethylproline synthases, members of the crotonase superfamily, aimed at 
enabling stereoselective C-C bond formation leading to N-heterocycles via control
of trisubstituted enolate intermediates. Active site substitutions, including at 
the oxyanion binding site, enable the production of substituted N-heterocycles in
high diastereomeric excesses via stereocontrolled enolate formation and reaction.
The results reveal the potential of the ubiquitous crotonase superfamily as
adaptable catalysts for the control of enolate chemistry.

Bistable molecules that behave as switches in solution have long been known.
Systems that can be reversibly converted between two stable states that differ in
their physical properties are particularly attractive in the development of
memory devices when immobilized in substrates. Here, we report a highly robust
surface-confined switch based on an electroactive, persistent organic radical
immobilized on indium tin oxide substrates that can be electrochemically and
reversibly converted to the anion form. This molecular bistable system behaves as
an extremely robust redox switch in which an electrical input is transduced into 
optical as well as magnetic outputs under ambient conditions. The fact that this 
molecular surface switch, operating at very low voltages, can be patterned and
addressed locally, and also has exceptionally high long-term stability and
excellent reversibility and reproducibility, makes it a very promising platform
for non-volatile memory devices.

A variety of host compounds have been used as molecular-scale reaction vessels,
protecting guests from their environment or restricting the space available
around them, thus favouring particular reactions. Such molecular 'flasks' can
endow guest molecules with reactivities that differ from those in bulk solvents. 
Here, we extend this concept to crystalline molecular flasks, solid-state
crystalline networks with pores within which pseudo-solution-state reactions can 
take place. As the guest molecules can spontaneously align along the walls and
channels of the hosts, structural changes in the substrates can be directly
observed by in situ X-ray crystallography during reaction. Recently, this has
enabled observation of the molecular structures of transient intermediates and
other labile species, in the form of sequential structural snapshots of the
chemical transformation. Here, we describe the principles, development and
applications of crystalline molecular flasks.

Emiliania huxleyi, an environmentally important marine microalga, has a
bloom-and-bust lifestyle in which massive algal blooms appear and fade.
Phaeobacter gallaeciensis belongs to the roseobacter clade of α-Proteobacteria,
the populations of which wax and wane with that of E. huxleyi. Roseobacter are
thought to promote algal growth by biosynthesizing and secreting antibiotics and 
growth stimulants (auxins). Here we show that P. gallaeciensis switches its
secreted small molecule metabolism to the production of potent and selective
algaecides, the roseobacticides, in response to p-coumaric acid, an algal lignin 
breakdown product that is symptomatic of aging algae. This switch converts P.
gallaeciensis into an opportunistic pathogen of its algal host.

Alkane molecules are held together in the crystal state by purportedly weak
homonuclear R-H···H-R dihydrogen interactions. In an apparent contradiction, the 
high melting points and vaporization enthalpies of polyhedranes in condensed
phases require quite strong intermolecular interactions. Two questions arise:
'How strong can a weak C-H···H-C bond be?' and 'How do the size and topology of
the carbon skeleton affect these bonding interactions?' A systematic
computational study of intermolecular interactions in dimers of n-alkanes and
polyhedranes, such as tetrahedrane, cubane, octahedrane or dodecahedrane, showed 
that attractive C-H···H-C interactions are stronger than usually thought. We
identified factors that account for the strength of these interactions, including
the tertiary nature of the carbon atoms and their low pyramidality. An alkane
with a bowl shape was designed in the search for stronger dihydrogen
intermolecular bonding, and a dissociation energy as high as 12 kJ mol⁻¹ is
predicted by our calculations.

The kinetics of multivalent (multisite) interactions at interfaces is poorly
understood, despite its fundamental importance for molecular or biomolecular
motion and molecular recognition events at biological interfaces. Here, we use
fluorescence microscopy to monitor the spreading of mono-, di- and trivalent
ligand molecules on a receptor-functionalized surface, and perform multiscale
computer simulations to understand the surface diffusion mechanisms. Analogous to
chemotaxis, we found that the spreading is directional (along a developing
gradient of vacant receptor sites) and is strongly dependent on ligand valency
and concentration of a competing monovalent receptor in solution. We identify
multiple surface diffusion mechanisms, which we call walking, hopping and flying.
The study shows that the interfacial behaviour of multivalent systems is much
more complex than that of monovalent ones.

An amorphous-to-crystal transition in phase-change materials like Ge-Sb-Te is
widely used for data storage. The basic principle is to take advantage of the
property contrast between the crystalline and amorphous states to encode
information; amorphization is believed to be caused by melting the materials with
an intense laser or electrical pulse and subsequently quenching the melt. Here,
we demonstrate that distortions in the crystalline phase may trigger a collapse
of long-range order, generating the amorphous phase without going through the
liquid state. We further show that the principal change in optical properties
occurs during the distortion of the still crystalline structure, upsetting yet
another commonly held belief that attributes the change in properties to the loss
of long-range order. Furthermore, our results suggest a way to lower energy
consumption by condensing phase change inducing energy into shorter pulses or
through the use of coherent phonon excitation.

Formed by linking metals or metal clusters through organic linkers, metal-organic
frameworks are a class of solids with structural and chemical properties that
mark them out as candidates for many emerging gas storage, separation, catalysis 
and biomedical applications. Important features of these materials include their 
high porosity and their flexibility in response to chemical or physical stimuli. 
Here, a copper-based metal-organic framework has been prepared in which the
starting linker (benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid) undergoes selective
monoesterification during synthesis to produce a solid with two different channel
systems, lined by hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces, respectively. The
material reacts differently to gases or vapours of dissimilar chemistry, some
stimulating subtle framework flexibility or showing kinetic adsorption effects.
Adsorption can be switched between the two channels by judicious choice of the
conditions. The monoesterified linker is recoverable in quantitative yield,
demonstrating possible uses of metal-organic frameworks in molecular synthetic
chemistry as 'protecting groups' to accomplish selective transformations that are
difficult using standard chemistry techniques.

Photochemical reduction of CO₂ (to produce formic acid) can be seen both as a
method to produce a transportable hydrogen-based fuel and also to reduce levels
of CO₂ in the atmosphere. However, an often overlooked necessity for
photochemical CO₂ reduction is the need for a sacrificial electron donor, usually
a tertiary amine. Here, we describe a new strategy for coupling the photochemical
reduction of CO₂ to photochemical water splitting, and illustrate this with a
prototype example. Instead of seeking to eliminate the use of an external
reducing agent altogether, our alternative strategy makes the reducing agent
recyclable. This has two potential advantages over the direct coupling of CO₂
reduction and water oxidation. First, it allows the two redox reactions to be
carried out with existing chemistry, and second, it permits these reactions to be
conducted under mutually incompatible conditions.

Titanium dioxide is the prototypical transition metal oxide photocatalyst.
However, the larger than 3 eV bandgap of common bulk phases of TiO₂ limits its
light absorption to UV light, making it inefficient for solar energy conversion. 
Attempts at increasing visible light activity by narrowing the bandgap of TiO₂
through doping have proven difficult, because of defect-induced charge trapping
and recombination sites of photo-excited charge carriers. Here, we report the
existence of a dopant-free, pure TiO₂ phase with a narrow bandgap. This new pure 
TiO₂ phase forms on the surface of rutile TiO₂(011) by oxidation of bulk titanium
interstitials. We measure a bandgap of only ~2.1 eV for this new phase, matching 
it closely with the energy of visible light.

The heterogeneous reactions of O₃ with aerosol particles are of central
importance to air quality. They are studied extensively, but the molecular
mechanisms and kinetics remain unresolved. Based on new experimental data and
calculations, we show that long-lived reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) are
formed. The chemical lifetime of these intermediates exceeds 100 seconds, which
is much longer than the surface residence time of molecular O₃ (~10⁻⁹ s). The
ROIs explain and resolve apparent discrepancies between earlier quantum
mechanical calculations and kinetic experiments. They play a key role in the
chemical transformation and adverse health effects of toxic and allergenic
air-particulate matter, such as soot, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and
proteins. ROIs may also be involved in the decomposition of O₃ on mineral dust
and in the formation and growth of secondary organic aerosols. Moreover, ROIs may
contribute to the coupling of atmospheric and biospheric multiphase processes.

Methanol is an abundant (35 million metric tons per year), renewable chemical
feedstock, yet its use as a one-carbon building block in fine chemical synthesis 
is highly underdeveloped. Using a homogeneous iridium catalyst developed in our
laboratory, methanol engages in a direct C-C coupling with allenes to furnish
higher alcohols that incorporate all-carbon quaternary centres, free of
stoichiometric by-products. A catalytic mechanism that involves turnover-limiting
methanol oxidation, a consequence of the high energetic demand of methanol
dehydrogenation, is corroborated through a series of competition kinetics
experiments. This process represents the first catalytic C-C coupling of methanol
to provide discrete products of hydroxymethylation.

Graphene, a truly two-dimensional and fully π-conjugated honeycomb carbon
network, is currently evolving into the most promising successor to silicon in
micro- and nanoelectronic applications. However, its wider application is impeded
by the difficulties in opening a bandgap in its gapless band-structure, as well
as the lack of processability in the resultant intrinscially insoluble material. 
Covalent chemical modification of the π-electron system is capable of addressing 
both of these issues through the introduction of variable chemical decoration.
Although there has been significant research activity in the field of
functionalized graphene, most work to date has focused on the use of graphene
oxide. In this Article, we report on the first wet chemical bulk
functionalization route beginning with pristine graphite that does not require
initial oxidative damage of the graphene basal planes. Through effective
reductive activation, covalent functionalization of the charged graphene is
achieved by organic diazonium salts. Functionalization was observed
spectroscopically, and successfully prevents reaggregation while providing
solubility in common organic media.

Recently scanning probe microscopy has made tremendous progress in imaging
organic molecules with high lateral resolution. Atoms and bonds within individual
molecules have been clearly resolved, indicating the exciting potential of this
technique for studying molecular structures, bonding within and between
molecules, molecular conformational changes and chemical reactions at the
single-molecule level. It turns out that the key step enabling such studies is an
atomically controlled functionalization of the microscope tip. In this
Perspective, the different techniques used for high-resolution molecular imaging,
their implementations, advantages and limitations are described, and possible
scientific areas of applications are discussed.

The click reaction paradigm is focused on the development and implementation of
reactions that are simple to perform while being robust and providing exquisite
control of the reaction and its products. Arguably the most prolific and powerful
of these reactions, the copper-catalysed alkyne-azide reaction (CuAAC) is highly 
efficient and ubiquitous in an ever increasing number of synthetic methodologies 
and applications, including bioconjugation, labelling, surface functionalization,
dendrimer synthesis, polymer synthesis and polymer modification. Unfortunately,
as the Cu(I) catalyst is typically generated by the chemical reduction of Cu(II) 
to Cu(I), or added as a Cu(I) salt, temporal and spatial control of the CuAAC
reaction is not readily achieved. Here, we demonstrate catalysis of the CuAAC
reaction via the photochemical reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I), affording
comprehensive spatial and temporal control of the CuAAC reaction using standard
photolithographic techniques. Results reveal the diverse capability of this
technique in small molecule synthesis, patterned material fabrication and
patterned chemical modification.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is a crucial tool for the detection and
study of various biological substances, from DNA and proteins to viruses and
bacteria. It does not require any labelling species, and methods based on it have
been developed to study cellular processes (such as cell spreading, adhesion,
invasion, toxicology and mobility). However, data have so far lacked spatial
information, which is essential for investigating heterogeneous processes and
imaging high-throughput microarrays. Here, we report an electrochemical impedance
microscope based on surface plasmon resonance that resolves local impedance with 
submicrometre spatial resolution. We have used an electrochemical impedance
microscope to monitor the dynamics of cellular processes (apoptosis and
electroporation of individual cells) with millisecond time resolution. The high
spatial and temporal resolution makes it possible to study individual cells, but 
also resolve subcellular structures and processes without labels, and with
excellent detection sensitivity (~2 pS). We also describe a model that simulates 
cellular and electrochemical impedance microscope images based on local
dielectric constant and conductivity.

Secondary electrostatic interactions between adjacent hydrogen bonds can have a
significant effect on the stability of a supramolecular complex. In theory, the
binding strength should be maximized if all the hydrogen-bond donors (D) are on
one component and all the hydrogen-bond acceptors (A) are on the other. Here, we 
describe a readily accessible AAAA–DDDD quadruple hydrogen-bonding array that
exhibits exceptionally strong binding for a small-molecule hydrogen-bonded
complex in a range of different solvents (K(a) > 3 × 10(12) M(-1) in CH2Cl2, 1.5 
× 10(6) M(-1) in CH3CN and 3.4 × 10(5) M(-1) in 10% v/v DMSO/CHCl3). The
association constant in CH2Cl2 corresponds to a binding free energy (ΔG) in
excess of –71 kJ mol(-1) (more than 20% of the thermodynamic stability of a
carbon–carbon covalent bond), which is remarkable for a supramolecular complex
held together by just four intercomponent hydrogen bonds.

Many important intracellular biochemical reactions are modulated by transition
metals, typically in the form of metalloproteins. The ability to carry out
selective transformations inside a cell would allow researchers to manipulate or 
interrogate innumerable biological processes. Here, we show that palladium
nanoparticles trapped within polystyrene microspheres can enter cells and mediate
a variety of Pd(0)-catalysed reactions, such as allylcarbamate cleavage and
Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling. The work provides the basis for the customization 
of heterogeneous unnatural catalysts as tools to carry out artificial chemistries
within cells. Such in cellulo synthesis has potential for a plethora of
applications ranging from cellular labelling to synthesis of modulators or
inhibitors of cell function.

Covalent bridges play a crucial role in the folding process of sequence-defined
biopolymers. This feature, however, has not been recreated in synthetic polymers 
because, apart from some simple regular arrangements (such as block co-polymers),
these macromolecules generally do not exhibit a controlled primary
structure--that is, it is difficult to predetermine precisely the sequence of
their monomers. Herein, we introduce a versatile strategy for preparing foldable 
linear polymer chains. Well-defined polymers were synthesized by the atom
transfer radical polymerization of styrene. The controlled addition of discrete
amounts of protected maleimide at precise times during the synthesis enabled the 
formation of polystyrene chains that contained positionable reactive alkyne
functions. Intramolecular reactions between these functions subsequently led to
the formation of different types of covalently folded polymer chains. For
example, tadpole (P-shaped), pseudocyclic (Q-shaped), bicyclic (8-shaped) and
knotted (α-shaped) macromolecular origamis were prepared in a relatively
straightforward manner.

Molecular wires show promise in nanoscale electronics, but the synthesis of
uniform, long conductive molecules is a significant challenge. Deoxyribonucleic
acid (DNA) of precise length, by contrast, is synthesized easily, but its
conductivity over the distances required for nanoscale devices has not been
explored. Here we demonstrate DNA charge transport (CT) over 34 nm in 100-mer
monolayers on gold. Multiplexed gold electrodes modified with 100-mer DNA yield
sizable electrochemical signals from a distal, covalent Nile Blue redox probe.
Significant signal attenuation upon incorporation of a single base-pair mismatch 
demonstrates that CT is DNA-mediated. Efficient cleavage of these 100-mers by a
restriction enzyme indicates that the DNA adopts a native conformation accessible
to protein binding. Similar electron-transfer rates measured through 100-mer and 
17-mer monolayers are consistent with rate-limiting electron tunnelling through
the saturated carbon linker. This DNA-mediated CT distance of 34 nm surpasses
that of most reports of molecular wires.

Multiphoton photoresists giving nanoscale resolution that is inversely dependent

Recent advances in materials science have made it possible to perform
photolithography at the nanoscale using visible light. One approach to
visible-light nanolithography (resolution augmentation through photo-induced
deactivation) uses a negative-tone photoresist incorporating a radical
photoinitiator that can be excited by two-photon absorption. With subsequent
absorption of light, the photoinitiator can also be deactivated before
polymerization occurs. This deactivation step can therefore be used for spatial
limitation of photopatterning. In previous work, continuous-wave light was used
for the deactivation step in such photoresists. Here we identify three broad
classes of photoinitiators for which deactivation is efficient enough to be
accomplished by the ultrafast excitation pulses themselves. The remarkable
properties of these initiators result in the inverse scaling of lithographic
feature size with exposure time. By combining different photoinitiators it is
further possible to create a photoresist for which the resolution is independent 
of exposure over a broad range of fabrication speeds.

Diverting non-haem iron catalysed aliphatic C-H hydroxylations towards

Carboxylate-ligated, non-haem iron enzymes demonstrate the capacity for
catalysing such remarkable processes as hydroxylations, chlorinations and
desaturations of inert, aliphatic C-H bonds. A key to functional diversity is the
enzymes' ability to divert fleeting radicals towards different types of
functionalization using active site and/or substrate modifications. We report
that a non-haem iron hydroxylase catalyst [Fe(PDP)] can also be diverted to
catalytic, mixed hydroxylase/desaturase activity with aliphatic C-H bonds. Using 
a taxane-based radical trap that rearranges under Fe(PDP) oxidation to furnish a 
nortaxane skeleton, we provide the first direct evidence for a substrate radical 
using this class of stereoretentive hydroxylation catalysts. Hydroxylation and
desaturation proceed by means of a short-lived radical that diverges in a
substrate-dependent manner in the presence of carboxylic acids. The novel
biomimetic reactivity displayed by this small molecule catalyst is harnessed to
diversify natural product derivatives as well as interrogate their biosynthetic
pathways.

Dye-sensitized solar cells based on iodide/triiodide (I(-)/I(3)(-)) electrolytes 
are viable low-cost alternatives to conventional silicon solar cells. However, as
well as providing record efficiencies of up to 12.0%, the use of I(-)/I(3)(-) in 
such solar cells also brings about certain limitations that stem from its
corrosive nature and complex two-electron redox chemistry. Alternative redox
mediators have been investigated, but these generally fall well short of matching
the performance of conventional I(-)/I(3)(-) electrolytes. Here, we report energy
conversion efficiencies of 7.5% (simulated sunlight, AM1.5, 1,000 W m(-2)) for
dye-sensitized solar cells combining the archetypal ferrocene/ferrocenium
(Fc/Fc(+)) single-electron redox couple with a novel metal-free organic
donor-acceptor sensitizer (Carbz-PAHTDTT). These Fc/Fc(+)-based devices exceed
the efficiency achieved for devices prepared using I(-)/I(3)(-) electrolytes
under comparable conditions, revealing the great potential of ferrocene-based
electrolytes in future dye-sensitized solar cells applications. This improvement 
results from a more favourable matching of the redox potential of the ferrocene
couple with that of the new donor-acceptor sensitizer.

Phosphorescence is among the many functional features that, in practice, divide
pure organic compounds from organometallics and inorganics. Considered to be
practically non-phosphorescent, purely organic compounds (metal-free) are very
rarely explored as emitters in phosphor applications, despite the emerging demand
in this field. To defy this paradigm, we describe novel design principles to
create purely organic materials demonstrating phosphorescence that can be turned 
on by incorporating halogen bonding into their crystals. By designing
chromophores to contain triplet-producing aromatic aldehydes and
triplet-promoting bromine, crystal-state halogen bonding can be made to direct
the heavy atom effect to produce surprisingly efficient solid-state
phosphorescence. When this chromophore is diluted into the crystal of a
bi-halogenated, non-carbonyl analogue, ambient phosphorescent quantum yields
reach 55%. Here, using this design, a series of pure organic phosphors are
colour-tuned to emit blue, green, yellow and orange. From this initial discovery,
a directed heavy atom design principle is demonstrated that will allow for the
development of bright and practical purely organic phosphors.

Graphene, a two-dimensional layer of sp(2)-hybridized carbon atoms, can be viewed
as a sheet of benzene rings fused together. Three benzene rings can be combined
in three different ways, to yield linear anthracene and angular phenanthrene,
where the rings share two C-C bonds, and the phenalenyl structure where three C-C
bonds are shared between the rings. This third structure contains an uneven
number of carbon atoms and, hence, in its neutral state, an uneven number of
electrons--that is, it is a radical. All three structures may be viewed as being 
sections of graphene. Extension of this concept leads to an entire family of
phenalenyl derivatives--'open-shell graphene fragments'--that are of substantial 
interest from the standpoint of fundamental science as well as in view of their
potential applications in materials chemistry, in particular quantum electronic
devices. Here we discuss current trends and challenges in this field.

Amyloid cascades that lead to peptide β-sheet fibrils and plaques are central to 
many important diseases. Recently, intermediate assemblies of these cascades were
identified as the toxic agents that interact with cellular machinery. The
location and cause of the transformation from a natively unstructured assembly to
the β-sheet oligomers found in all fibrils is important in understanding disease 
onset and the development of therapeutic agents. Largely, research on this early 
oligomeric region was unsuccessful because all the traditional techniques measure
only the average oligomer properties of the ensemble. We utilized ion-mobility
methods to deduce the peptide self-assembly mechanism and examined a series of
amyloid-forming peptides clipped from larger peptides or proteins associated with
disease. We provide unambiguous evidence for structural transitions in each of
these fibril-forming peptide systems and establish the potential of this method
for the development of therapeutic agents and drug evaluation.

Aromatic hydrocarbons are among the most important building blocks in the
chemical industry. Benzene, toluene and xylenes are obtained from the high
temperature thermolysis of alkanes. Higher alkylaromatics are generally derived
from arene-olefin coupling, which gives branched products--that is, secondary
alkyl arenes--with olefins higher than ethylene. The dehydrogenation of acyclic
alkanes to give alkylaromatics can be achieved using heterogeneous catalysts at
high temperatures, but with low yields and low selectivity. We present here the
first catalytic conversion of n-alkanes to alkylaromatics using homogeneous or
molecular catalysts--specifically 'pincer'-ligated iridium complexes--and
olefinic hydrogen acceptors. For example, the reaction of n-octane affords up to 
86% yield of aromatic product, primarily o-xylene and secondarily ethylbenzene.
In the case of n-decane and n-dodecane, the resulting alkylarenes are exclusively
unbranched (that is, n-alkyl-substituted), with selectivity for the corresponding
o-(n-alkyl)toluene.

Thermoelectric materials can directly generate electrical power from waste heat
but the challenge is in designing efficient, stable and inexpensive systems.
Nanostructuring in bulk materials dramatically reduces the thermal conductivity
but simultaneously increases the charge carrier scattering, which has a
detrimental effect on the carrier mobility. We have experimentally achieved
concurrent phonon blocking and charge transmitting via the endotaxial placement
of nanocrystals in a thermoelectric material host. Endotaxially arranged SrTe
nanocrystals at concentrations as low as 2% were incorporated in a PbTe matrix
doped with Na(2)Te. This effectively inhibits the heat flow in the system but
does not affect the hole mobility, allowing a large power factor to be achieved. 
The crystallographic alignment of SrTe and PbTe lattices decouples phonon and
electron transport and this allows the system to reach a thermoelectric figure of
merit of 1.7 at ~800 K.

Membrane proteomics, the large-scale global analysis of membrane proteins, is
often constrained by the efficiency of separating and extracting membrane
proteins. Recent approaches involve conjugating membrane proteins with the small 
molecule biotin and using the receptor streptavidin to extract the labelled
proteins. Despite the many advantages of this method, several shortcomings
remain, including potential contamination by endogenously biotinylated molecules 
and interference by streptavidin during analytical stages. Here, we report a
supramolecular fishing method for membrane proteins using the synthetic
receptor-ligand pair cucurbit[7]uril-1-trimethylammoniomethylferrocene
(CB[7]-AFc). CB[7]-conjugated beads selectively capture AFc-labelled proteins
from heterogeneous protein mixtures, and AFc-labelling of cells results in the
efficient capture of membrane proteins by these beads. The captured proteins can 
be recovered easily at room temperature by treatment with a strong competitor
such as 1,1'-bis(trimethylammoniomethyl)ferrocene. This synthetic but
biocompatible host-guest system may be a useful alternative to
streptavidin-biotin for membrane proteomics as well as other biological and
biotechnological applications.

Using a system that accelerates the serendipitous discovery of new reactions by
evaluating hundreds of DNA-encoded substrate combinations in a single experiment,
we explored a broad range of reaction conditions for new bond-forming reactions. 
We discovered reactivity that led to a biomolecule-compatible, Ru(II)-catalysed
azide-reduction reaction induced by visible light. In contrast to current
azide-reduction methods, this reaction is highly chemoselective and is compatible
with alcohols, phenols, acids, alkenes, alkynes, aldehydes, alkyl halides, alkyl 
mesylates and disulfides. The remarkable functional group compatibility and mild 
conditions of the reaction enabled the azide reduction of nucleic acid and
oligosaccharide substrates, with no detectable occurrence of side reactions. The 
reaction was also performed in the presence of a protein enzyme without the loss 
of enzymatic activity, in contrast to two commonly used azide-reduction methods. 
The visible-light dependence of this reaction provides a means of photouncaging
functional groups, such as amines and carboxylates, on biological macromolecules 
without using ultraviolet irradiation.

The development of new means of activating molecules and bonds for chemical
reactions is a fundamental objective for chemists. In this regard, visible-light 
photoredox catalysis has emerged as a powerful technique for chemoselective
activation of chemical bonds under mild reaction conditions. Here, we report a
visible-light-mediated photocatalytic alcohol activation, which we use to convert
alcohols to the corresponding bromides and iodides in good yields, with
exceptional functional group tolerance. In this fundamentally useful reaction,
the design and operation of the process is simple, the reaction is highly
efficient, and the formation of stoichiometric waste products is minimized.

A detailed understanding of the sources, transformations and fates of organic
species in the environment is crucial because of the central roles that they play
in human health, biogeochemical cycles and the Earth's climate. However, such an 
understanding is hindered by the immense chemical complexity of environmental
mixtures of organics; for example, atmospheric organic aerosol consists of at
least thousands of individual compounds, all of which likely evolve chemically
over their atmospheric lifetimes. Here, we demonstrate the utility of describing 
organic aerosol (and other complex organic mixtures) in terms of average carbon
oxidation state, a quantity that always increases with oxidation, and is readily 
measured using state-of-the-art analytical techniques. Field and laboratory
measurements of the average carbon oxidation state, using several such
techniques, constrain the chemical properties of the organics and demonstrate
that the formation and evolution of organic aerosol involves simultaneous changes
to both carbon oxidation state and carbon number.

Most proteins fulfil their function as part of large protein complexes.
Surprisingly, little is known about the pathways and regulation of protein
assembly. Several viral coat proteins can spontaneously assemble into capsids in 
vitro with morphologies identical to the native virion and thus resemble ideal
model systems for studying protein complex formation. Even for these systems, the
mechanism for self-assembly is still poorly understood, although it is generally 
thought that smaller oligomeric structures form key intermediates. This assembly 
nucleus and larger viral assembly intermediates are typically low abundant and
difficult to monitor. Here, we characterised small oligomers of Hepatitis B virus
(HBV) and norovirus under equilibrium conditions using native ion mobility mass
spectrometry. This data in conjunction with computational modelling enabled us to
elucidate structural features of these oligomers. Instead of more globular
shapes, the intermediates exhibit sheet-like structures suggesting that they are 
assembly competent. We propose pathways for the formation of both capsids.

The synthesis of transition metal-dinitrogen complexes and the stoichiometric
transformation of their coordinated dinitrogen into ammonia and hydrazine have
been the subject of considerable research, with a view to achieving nitrogen
fixation under ambient conditions. Since a single example in 2003, no examples
have been reported of the catalytic conversion of dinitrogen into ammonia under
ambient conditions. The dimolybdenum-dinitrogen complex bearing PNP pincer
ligands was found to work as an effective catalyst for the formation of ammonia
from dinitrogen, with 23 equiv. of ammonia being produced with the catalyst (12
equiv. of ammonia are produced based on the molybdenum atom of the catalyst).
This is another successful example of the catalytic and direct conversion of
dinitrogen into ammonia under ambient reaction conditions. We believe that the
results described in this Article provide valuable information with which to
develop a more effective nitrogen-fixation system under mild reaction conditions.

Diatomic molecules attached to complexed iron or cobalt centres are important in 
many biological processes. In natural systems, metallotetrapyrrole units carry
respiratory gases or provide sensing and catalytic functions. Conceiving
synthetic model systems strongly helps to determine the pertinent chemical
foundations for such processes, with recent work highlighting the importance of
the prosthetic groups' conformational flexibility as an intricate variable
affecting their functional properties. Here, we present simple model systems to
investigate, at the single molecule level, the interaction of carbon monoxide
with saddle-shaped iron- and cobalt-porphyrin conformers, which have been
stabilized as two-dimensional arrays on well-defined surfaces. Using scanning
tunnelling microscopy we identified a novel bonding scheme expressed in tilted
monocarbonyl and cis-dicarbonyl configurations at the functional metal-macrocycle
unit. Modelling with density functional theory revealed that the weakly bonded
diatomic carbonyl adduct can effectively bridge specific pyrrole groups with the 
metal atom as a result of the pronounced saddle-shape conformation of the
porphyrin cage.

The specificity and predictability of Watson-Crick base pairing make DNA a
powerful and versatile material for engineering at the nanoscale. This has
enabled the construction of a diverse and rapidly growing set of DNA
nanostructures and nanodevices through the programmed hybridization of
complementary strands. Although it had initially focused on the self-assembly of 
static structures, DNA nanotechnology is now also becoming increasingly
attractive for engineering systems with interesting dynamic properties. Various
devices, including circuits, catalytic amplifiers, autonomous molecular motors
and reconfigurable nanostructures, have recently been rationally designed to use 
DNA strand-displacement reactions, in which two strands with partial or full
complementarity hybridize, displacing in the process one or more pre-hybridized
strands. This mechanism allows for the kinetic control of reaction pathways.
Here, we review DNA strand-displacement-based devices, and look at how this
relatively simple mechanism can lead to a surprising diversity of dynamic
behaviour.

Chain reactions on a surface offer an important route to linear nanopatterning.
We recently reported cooperative reactions on a silicon surface in which the
reaction of one halogen atom with a silicon atom of a silicon dimer induced the
halogenation of its neighbouring silicon atom through surface-mediated charge
transfer. The reaction was unable to propagate further but here we describe how, 
by chemically bridging the gaps between the rows of these silicon dimers, this
mechanism is able to form extended chains. The agents for chain growth are
CH(3)Cl molecules that dissociatively attach CH(3) groups and chlorine atoms to
silicon atoms from different dimers. By means of charge transfer through the
surface, this gives rise to dangling bonds adjacent to the CH(3) groups and
chlorine atoms (in effect, 'free radicals') that dissociate further incoming
CH(3)Cl molecules, thereby providing the growing points for chains of indefinite 
length. This versatile mechanism of chain growth is examined in experiments and
using ab initio theory.

Spinels can serve as alternative low-cost bifunctional electrocatalysts for
oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER), which are the key barriers in
various electrochemical devices such as metal-air batteries, fuel cells and
electrolysers. However, conventional ceramic synthesis of crystalline spinels
requires an elevated temperature, complicated procedures and prolonged heating
time, and the resulting product exhibits limited electrocatalytic performance. It
has been challenging to develop energy-saving, facile and rapid synthetic
methodologies for highly active spinels. In this Article, we report the synthesis
of nanocrystalline M(x)Mn(3-x)O(4) (M = divalent metals) spinels under ambient
conditions and their electrocatalytic application. We show rapid and selective
formation of tetragonal or cubic M(x)Mn(3-x)O(4) from the reduction of amorphous 
MnO(2) in aqueous M(2+) solution. The prepared Co(x)Mn(3-x)O(4) nanoparticles
manifest considerable catalytic activity towards the ORR/OER as a result of their
high surface areas and abundant defects. The newly discovered phase-dependent
electrocatalytic ORR/OER characteristics of Co-Mn-O spinels are also interpreted 
by experiment and first-principle theoretical studies.

Self-assembly of planar molecules on a surface can result in the formation of a
wide variety of close-packed or porous structures. Two-dimensional porous arrays 
provide host sites for trapping guest species of suitable size. Here we show that
a non-planar guest species (C(60)) can play a more complex role by promoting the 
growth of a second layer of host molecules (p-terphenyl-3,5,3″,5″-tetracarboxylic
acid) above and parallel to the surface so that self-assembly is extended into
the third dimension. The addition of guest molecules and the formation of the
second layer are co-dependent. Adding a planar guest (coronene) can displace the 
C(60) and cause reversion to a monolayer arrangement. The system provides an
example of a reversible transformation between a planar and a non-planar
supramolecular network, an important step towards the controlled self-assembly of
functional, three-dimensional, surface-based supramolecular architectures.

Helices have long attracted the attention of chemists, both for their inherent
chiral structure and their potential for applications such as the separation of
chiral compounds or the construction of molecular machines. As a result of steric
forces, polymeric o-phenylenes adopt a tight helical conformation in which the
densely packed phenylene units create a highly condensed π-cloud. Here, we show
an oligomeric o-phenylene that undergoes a redox-responsive dynamic motion. In
solution, the helices undergo a rapid inversion. During crystallization, however,
a chiral symmetry-breaking phenomenon is observed in which each crystal contains 
only one enantiomeric form. Crystals of both handedness are obtained, but in a
non-racemic mixture. Furthermore, in solution, the dynamic motion of the helical 
oligomer is dramatically suppressed by one-electron oxidation. X-ray
crystallography of both the neutral and oxidized forms indicated that a hole,
generated upon oxidation, is shared by the repeating o-phenylene units. This
enables conformational locking of the helix, and represents a long-lasting
chiroptical memory.

Atomically thin sheets of sp(2)-hybridized carbon--graphene--have enormous
potential for applications in future electronic devices. Particularly promising
are nanostructured (sub)units of graphene, the electronic properties of which can
be tuned by changing the spatial extent or the specific edge termination of the
carbon network. Processability and precise tailoring of graphene-derived
structures are, however, still major obstacles in developing applications; both
bottom-up and top-down routes are presently under investigation in attempts to
overcome this limitation. Here, we propose a surface chemical route that allows
for the atomically precise fabrication of tailored nanographenes from
polyphenylene precursors. The cyclodehydrogenation of a prototypical
polyphenylene on Cu(111) is studied using scanning tunnelling microscopy and
density functional theory. We find that the thermally induced
cyclodehydrogenation proceeds via several intermediate steps, two of which can be
stabilized on the surface, yielding unprecedented insight into a dehydrogenative 
intramolecular aryl-aryl coupling reaction.

Biological rotary motors can alter their mechanical function by changing the
direction of rotary motion. Achieving a similar reversal of direction of rotation
in artificial molecular motors presents a fundamental stereochemical challenge:
how to change from clockwise to anticlockwise motion without compromising the
autonomous unidirectional rotary behaviour of the system. A new molecular motor
with multilevel control of rotary motion is reported here, in which the direction
of light-powered rotation can be reversed by base-catalysed epimerization. The
key steps are deprotonation and reprotonation of the photochemically generated
less-stable isomers during the 360° unidirectional rotary cycle, with complete
inversion of the configuration at the stereogenic centre. The ability to change
directionality is an essential step towards mechanical molecular systems with
adaptive functional behaviour.

Transition-metal oxynitrides with perovskite-type structures are an emerging
class of materials with optical, photocatalytic, dielectric and magnetoresistive 
properties that may be sensitive to oxide-nitride order, but the anion-ordering
principles were unclear. Here we report an investigation of the representative
compounds SrMO(2)N (M = Nb, Ta) using neutron and electron diffraction. This
revealed a robust 1O/2(O(0.5)N(0.5)) partial anion order (up to at least 750 °C
in the apparently cubic high-temperature phases) that directs the rotations of
MO(4)N(2) octahedra in the room-temperature superstructure. The anion
distribution is consistent with local cis-ordering of the two nitrides in each
octahedron driven by covalency, which results in disordered zigzag M-N chains in 
planes within the perovskite lattice. Local structures for the full range of
oxynitride perovskites are predicted and a future challenge is to tune properties
by controlling the order and dimensionality of the anion chains and networks.

N,N',N″-trialkylbenzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamides (BTAs) self-assemble by means of
strong, threefold α-helix-type intermolecular hydrogen bonding into well-defined,
helical, one-dimensional columnar aggregates. When a stereogenic centre is
introduced into the alkyl side chains of these BTAs, strong Cotton effects are
observed in dilute apolar solutions, indicating the preference for one helical
conformation over the other. Here, we report the creation of a helical sense
preference in self-assembled BTAs by introducing deuterium/hydrogen isotope
chirality into the alkyl side chains. We determine the relative stabilities of
the left- and right-handed helical conformations of these deuterated
supramolecular polymers by performing a conformational analysis. Our findings
show that the results of deuterium/hydrogen substitution in BTA-based
supramolecular polymers and helical polyisocyanates are very similar, although
the formation mechanisms differ. The selectively deuterated BTAs discussed here
represent the first example of supramolecular chirality resulting from isotope
substitution.

The effective utilization of solar energy requires photocatalytic reactions with 
high quantum efficiency. Water is the most abundant reactant that can be used as 
an oxygen source in efficient photocatalytic reactions, just as nature uses water
in an oxygenic photosynthesis. We report that photocatalytic oxygenation of
organic substrates such as sodium p-styrene sulfonate occurs with nearly 100%
quantum efficiency using manganese(III) porphyrins as an oxygenation catalyst,
[Ru(II)(bpy)(3)](2+) (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine) as a photosensitized
electron-transfer catalyst, [Co(III)(NH(3))(5)Cl](2+) as a low-cost and weak
one-electron oxidant, and water as an oxygen source in a phosphate buffer
solution (pH 7.4). A high-valent manganese-oxo porphyrin is proposed as an active
oxidant that effects the oxygenation reactions.

Molecular recognition plays an important role in nature, with perhaps the best
known example being the complementarity exhibited by pairs of nucleobases in DNA.
Studies of self-assembling and self-organizing systems based on molecular
recognition are often performed at the molecular level, however, and any
macroscopic implications of these processes are usually far removed from the
specific molecular interactions. Here, we demonstrate that well-defined
molecular-recognition events can be used to direct the assembly of macroscopic
objects into larger aggregated structures. Acrylamide-based gels functionalized
with either host (cyclodextrin) rings or small hydrocarbon-group guest moieties
were synthesized. Pieces of host and guest gels are shown to adhere to one
another through the mutual molecular recognition of the cyclodextrins and
hydrocarbon groups on their surfaces. By changing the size and shape of the host 
and guest units, different gels can be selectively assembled and sorted into
distinct macroscopic structures that are on the order of millimetres to
centimetres in size.

Larmor precession of a quantum mechanical angular momentum vector about an
applied magnetic field forms the basis for a range of magnetic resonance
techniques, including nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic
resonance imaging. We have used a polarized laser pump-probe scheme with
velocity-map imaging detection to visualize, for the first time, the precessional
motion of a quantum mechanical angular momentum vector. Photodissociation of O(2)
at 157 nm provides a clean source of fast-moving O((1)D(2)) atoms, with their
electronic angular momentum vector strongly aligned perpendicular to the recoil
direction. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the distribution of
atomic angular momenta precesses about the field direction, and
polarization-sensitive images of the atomic scattering distribution recorded as a
function of field strength yield 'time-lapse-photography' style movies of the
precessional motion. We present movies recorded in various experimental
geometries, and discuss potential consequences and applications in atmospheric
chemistry and reaction dynamics.

Reactivity principles based on orbital overlap and bonding/antibonding
interactions are well established to describe the reactivity of organic species, 
and atomic structures are typically predicted by Hund's rules to have maximum
single-electron occupancy of degenerate orbitals in the ground state. Here, we
extend the role of exchange to transition states and discuss how, for reactions
and kinetics of bioinorganic species, the analogue of Hund's rules is
exchange-controlled reactivity. Pathways that increase the number of unpaired and
spin-identical electrons on a metal centre will be favoured by exchange
stabilization. Such exchange-enhanced reactivity endows transition states with a 
stereochemistry different from that observed in cases that are not
exchange-enhanced, and is in good agreement with the reactivity observed for
iron-based enzymes and synthetic analogues. We discuss the interplay between
orbital- and exchange-controlled principles, and how this depends on the identity
of the transition metal, its oxidation number and its coordination sphere.

Nucleic acids containing stretches of tandem guanines can fold into four-stranded
structures called G-quadruplexes. The existence of such sequences in genomic DNA 
suggests the occurrence of these motifs in cells, with potential implications in 
a number of biological processes relevant to cancer. Small molecules have proven 
to be valuable tools to dissect cell circuitry. Here, we describe a synthetic
small molecule derived from an N,N'-bis(2-quinolinyl)pyridine-2,6-dicarboxamide, 
which is designed to mediate the selective isolation of G-quadruplex nucleic
acids. The methodology was successfully applied to a range of DNA and RNA
G-quadruplexes in vitro. We demonstrate the general applicability of the method
by isolating telomeric DNA-containing G-quadruplex motifs from cells. We show
that telomeres are targets for the probe, providing further evidence of the
formation of G-quadruplexes in human cells.

Supramolecular gels, which demonstrate tunable functionalities, have attracted
much interest in a range of areas, including healthcare, environmental protection
and energy-related technologies. Preparing these materials in a reliable manner
is challenging, with an increased level of kinetic defects observed at higher
self-assembly rates. Here, by combining biocatalysis and molecular self-assembly,
we have shown the ability to more quickly access higher-ordered structures. By
simply increasing enzyme concentration, supramolecular order expressed at
molecular, nano- and micro-levels is dramatically enhanced, and, importantly, the
gelator concentrations remain identical. Amphiphile molecules were prepared by
attaching an aromatic moiety to a dipeptide backbone capped with a methyl ester. 
Their self-assembly was induced by an enzyme that hydrolysed the ester. Different
enzyme concentrations altered the catalytic activity and size of the enzyme
clusters, affecting their mobility. This allowed structurally diverse materials
that represent local minima in the free energy landscape to be accessed based on 
a single gelator structure.

The minerals involved in the formation of metazoan skeletons principally comprise
glassy silica, calcium phosphate or carbonate. Because of their ancient heritage,
glass sponges (Hexactinellida) may shed light on fundamental questions such as
molecular evolution, the unique chemistry and formation of the first skeletal
silica-based structures, and the origin of multicellular animals. We have studied
anchoring spicules from the metre-long stalk of the glass rope sponge (Hyalonema 
sieboldi; Porifera, Class Hexactinellida), which are remarkable for their size,
durability, flexibility and optical properties. Using slow-alkali etching of
biosilica, we isolated the organic fraction, which was revealed to be dominated
by a hydroxylated fibrillar collagen that contains an unusual [Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp]
motif. We speculate that this motif is predisposed for silica precipitation, and 
provides a novel template for biosilicification in nature.

Thanks largely to a cooperative chelate effect, clustered membrane-embedded
proteins favourably bind to multivalent ligands in solution and, conversely, a
multivalent receptor can induce the clustering of membrane-embedded proteins.
Here, we use a chemical model to show that the binding of a monovalent ligand and
the clustering of a membrane-embedded receptor are closely related processes that
modulate each other without the contribution of any apparent multivalence effect.
Clearly, the confinement of the receptor within the surface reveals cooperative
effects between clustering and binding that are too weak to detect in
bulk-solution systems. This work shows that for membrane-embedded receptors that 
undergo some degree of spontaneous clustering, analyses based on
multivalence-mediated cooperativity are insufficient to describe fully the
molecular recognition events induced by ligands in solution. Instead, a
binding-clustering thermodynamic cycle is proposed for the analysis of the
interaction of any kind of ligand with membrane-embedded receptors.

Chemical reactions inside single crystals are quite rare because crystallinity is
difficult to retain owing to atomic rearrangements. Protein crystals in general
have a high solvent content. This allows for some molecular flexibility, which
makes it possible to trap reaction intermediates of enzymatic reactions without
disrupting the crystal lattice. A similar approach has not yet been fully
implemented in the field of inorganic chemistry. Here, we have combined model
chemistry and protein X-ray crystallography to study the intramolecular aromatic 
dihydroxylation by an arene-containing protein-bound iron complex. The bound
complex was able to activate dioxygen in the presence of a reductant, leading to 
the formation of catechol as the sole product. The structure determination of
four of the catalytic cycle intermediates and the end product showed that the
hydroxylation reaction implicates an iron peroxo, generated by reductive O(2)
activation, an intermediate already observed in iron monooxygenases. This
strategy also provided unexpected mechanistic details such as the rearrangement
of the iron coordination sphere on metal reduction.

In enzymes, the electronic and steric environments of active centres, and
therefore their activity in biological processes, are controlled by the
surrounding amino acids. In a similar manner, organic ligands have been used for 
the 'passivation' of metal clusters, that is, inhibition of their aggregation and
control of their environment. However, the ability of enzymes to maintain large
degrees of accessibility has remained difficult to mimic in synthetic systems in 
which little room, if any, is typically left to bind to other species. Here,
using calix[4]arene macrocycles bearing phosphines as crude mimics of the rigid
backbones of proteins, we demonstrate the synthesis of gold clusters and the
control of their accessibility through an interplay between the sizes of the
calixarene ligands and metal cores. For 0.9-nm cores, 25% of all the gold atoms
within the cluster bind to the chemisorption probe 2-naphthalenethiol. This
accessibility dramatically decreases with 1.1-nm and 4-nm gold cores.

The oxo groups in the uranyl ion [UO(2)](2+)-one of many oxo cations formed by
metals from across the periodic table-are particularly inert, which explains the 
dominance of this ion in the laboratory and its persistence as an environmental
contaminant. In contrast, transition metal oxo (M=O) compounds can be highly
reactive and carry out difficult reactions such as the oxygenation of
hydrocarbons. Here we show how the sequential addition of a lithium metal base to
the uranyl ion constrained in a 'Pacman' environment results in lithium
coordination to the U=O bonds and single-electron reduction. This reaction
depends on the nature and stoichiometry of the lithium reagent and suggests that 
competing reduction and C-H bond activation reactions are occurring.

DNA has recently been used as a programmable 'smart' building block for the
assembly of a wide range of nanostructures. It remains difficult, however, to
construct DNA assemblies that are also functional. Incorporating RNA is a
promising strategy to circumvent this issue as RNA is structurally related to DNA
but exhibits rich chemical, structural and functional diversities. However, only 
a few examples of rationally designed RNA structures have been reported. Herein, 
we describe a simple, general strategy for the de novo design of nanostructures
in which the self-assembly of RNA strands is programmed by DNA strands. To
demonstrate the versatility of this approach, we have designed and constructed
three different RNA-DNA hybrid branched nanomotifs (tiles), which readily
assemble into one-dimensional nanofibres, extended two-dimensional arrays and a
discrete three-dimensional object. The current strategy could enable the
integration of the precise programmability of DNA with the rich functionality of 
RNA.

The direct functionalization of C-H bonds has drawn the attention of chemists for
almost a century. C-H activation has mainly been achieved through four
metal-mediated pathways: oxidative addition, electrophilic substitution, σ-bond
metathesis and metal-associated carbene/nitrene/oxo insertion. However, the
identification of methods that do not require transition-metal catalysts is
important because methods involving such catalysts are often expensive. Another
advantage would be that the requirement to remove metallic impurities from
products could be avoided, an important issue in the synthesis of pharmaceutical 
compounds. Here, we describe the identification of a cross-coupling between aryl 
iodides/bromides and the C-H bonds of arenes that is mediated solely by the
presence of 1,10-phenanthroline as catalyst in the presence of KOt-Bu as a base. 
This apparently transition-metal-free process provides a new strategy with which 
to achieve direct C-H functionalization.

We describe the use of low-molecular-weight supramolecular gels as media for the 
growth of molecular crystals. Growth of a range of crystals of organic compounds,
including pharmaceuticals, was achieved in bis(urea) gels. Low-molecular-weight
supramolecular gelators allow access to an unlimited range of solvent systems, in
contrast to conventional aqueous gels such as gelatin and agarose. A detailed
study of carbamazepine crystal growth in four different bis(urea) gelators,
including a metallogelator, is reported. The crystallization of a range of other 
drug substances, namely sparfloxacin, piroxicam, theophylline, caffeine,
ibuprofen, acetaminophen (paracetamol), sulindac and indomethacin, was also
achieved in supramolecular gel media without co-crystal formation. In many cases,
crystals can be conveniently recovered from the gels by using supramolecular
anion-triggered gel dissolution; however, crystals of substances that themselves 
bind to anions are dissolved by them. Overall, supramolecular gel-phase
crystallization offers an extremely versatile new tool in pharmaceutical
polymorph screening.

Although the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism in one compound 
is rare, some examples of such materials are known to exist. Methods to
physically prepare hybrid structures with both competing phases are also known,
which rely on the nanofabrication of alternating conducting layers. Chemical
methods of building up hybrid materials with organic molecules (superconducting
layers) and metal complexes (magnetic layers) have provided examples of
superconductivity with some magnetic properties, but not fully ordered. Now, we
report a chemical design strategy that uses the self assembly in solution of
macromolecular nanosheet building blocks to engineer the coexistence of
superconductivity and magnetism in [Ni(0.66)Al(0.33)(OH)(2)][TaS(2)] at ∼4 K. The
method is further demonstrated in the isostructural
[Ni(0.66)Fe(0.33)(OH)(2)][TaS(2)], in which the magnetic ordering is shifted from
4 K to 16 K.

Imaging techniques are a vital part of clinical diagnostics, biomedical research 
and nanotechnology. Optical molecular imaging makes use of relatively harmless,
low-energy light and technically straightforward instrumentation.
Self-illuminating, chemiluminescent systems are particularly attractive because
they have inherently high signal contrast due to the lack of background emission.
Currently, chemiluminescence imaging involves short-lived molecular species that 
are not stored but are instead generated in situ, and they typically emit visible
light, which does not penetrate far through heterogeneous biological media. Here,
we describe a new paradigm for optical molecular imaging using squaraine rotaxane
endoperoxides, interlocked fluorescent and chemiluminescent dye molecules that
have a squaraine chromophore encapsulated inside a macrocycle endoperoxide.
Squaraine rotaxane endoperoxides can be stored indefinitely at temperatures below
-20 °C, but upon warming to body temperature they undergo a unimolecular chemical
reaction and emit near-infrared light that can pass through a living mouse.

Chemically derived graphene oxide (GO) is an atomically thin sheet of graphite
that has traditionally served as a precursor for graphene, but is increasingly
attracting chemists for its own characteristics. It is covalently decorated with 
oxygen-containing functional groups - either on the basal plane or at the edges -
so that it contains a mixture of sp(2)- and sp(3)-hybridized carbon atoms. In
particular, manipulation of the size, shape and relative fraction of the
sp(2)-hybridized domains of GO by reduction chemistry provides opportunities for 
tailoring its optoelectronic properties. For example, as-synthesized GO is
insulating but controlled deoxidation leads to an electrically and optically
active material that is transparent and conducting. Furthermore, in contrast to
pure graphene, GO is fluorescent over a broad range of wavelengths, owing to its 
heterogeneous electronic structure. In this Review, we highlight the recent
advances in optical properties of chemically derived GO, as well as new physical 
and biological applications.

The enantioselective addition of water to olefins in an aqueous environment is a 
common transformation in biological systems, but was beyond the ability of
synthetic chemists. Here, we present the first examples of a non-enzymatic
catalytic enantioselective hydration of enones, for which we used a catalyst that
comprises a copper complex, based on an achiral ligand, non-covalently bound to
(deoxy)ribonucleic acid, which is the only source of chirality present under the 
reaction conditions. The chiral β-hydroxy ketone product was obtained in up to
82% enantiomeric excess. Deuterium-labelling studies demonstrated that the
reaction is diastereospecific, with only the syn hydration product formed. So
far, this diastereospecific and enantioselective reaction had no equivalent in
conventional homogeneous catalysis.

A bidentate Lewis acid with a telluronium ion as an anion-binding site.

The search for receptors that can selectively capture small and potentially toxic
anions in protic media has sparked a renewed interest in the synthesis and
anion-binding properties of polydentate Lewis acids. Seeking new paradigms to
enhance the anion affinities of such systems, we synthesized a bidentate Lewis
acid that contains a boryl and a telluronium moiety as Lewis acidic sites.
Anion-complexation studies indicate that this telluronium borane displays a high 
affinity for fluoride in methanol. Structural and computational studies show that
the unusual fluoride affinity of this bidentate telluronium borane can be
correlated with the formation of a B-F → Te chelate motif supported by a strong
lone-pair(F) → σ*(Te-C) donor-acceptor interaction. These results, which
illustrate the viability of heavier chalcogenium centres as anion-binding sites, 
allow us to introduce a novel strategy for the design of polydentate Lewis acids 
with enhanced anion affinities.

The question of whether sound vibration of a medium can bring about any kind of
molecular or macromolecular events is a long-standing scientific controversy.
Although it is known that ultrasonic vibrations with frequencies of more than 1
MHz are able to align certain macromolecules in solution, no effect has yet been 
reported with audible sound, the frequency of which is much lower (20-20,000 Hz).
Here, we report on the design of a supramolecular nanofibre that in solution
becomes preferentially aligned parallel to the propagation direction of audible
sound. This phenomenon can be used to spectroscopically visualize sound-induced
vibrations in liquids and may find application in a wide range of vibration
sensing technologies.

Direct enantio-convergent transformation of racemic substrates without

Asymmetric reactions that transform racemic mixtures into enantio-enriched
products are in high demand, but classical kinetic resolution produces
enantiopure compounds in <50% yield even in an ideal case. Many deracemization
processes have thus been developed including dynamic kinetic resolution and
dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation, which can provide enantio-enriched
products even after complete conversion of the racemic starting materials.
However, these dynamic processes require racemization or symmetrization of the
substrates or intermediates. We demonstrate a direct chemical enantio-convergent 
transformation without a racemization or symmetrization process.
Copper(I)-catalysed asymmetric allylic substitution of a racemic allylic ether
afforded a single enantiomer of an α-chiral allylboronate with complete
conversion and high enantioselectivity (up to 98% enantiomeric excess). One
enantiomer of the substrate undergoes an anti-S(N)2'-type reaction whereas the
other enantiomer reacts via a syn-S(N)2' pathway. The products, which cannot be
prepared by dynamic procedures, have been used to construct all-carbon quaternary
stereocentres.

Carbyne is an allotrope of carbon composed of sp-hybridized carbon atoms.
Although its formation in the laboratory is suggested, no well-defined sample is 
described. Interest in carbyne and its potential properties remains intense
because of, at least in part, technological breakthroughs offered by other carbon
allotropes, such as fullerenes, carbon nanotubes and graphene. Here, we describe 
the synthesis of a series of conjugated polyynes as models for carbyne. The
longest of the series consists of 44 contiguous acetylenic carbons, and it
maintains a framework clearly composed of alternating single and triple bonds.
Spectroscopic analyses for these polyynes reveal a distinct trend towards a
finite gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital for carbyne, which is estimated to be ∼485 nm (∼2.56
eV). Even the longest members of this series of polyynes are not particularly
sensitive to light, moisture or oxygen, and they can be handled and characterized
under normal laboratory conditions.

Supramolecular chemistry provides a versatile tool for the organization of
molecular systems into functional structures and the actuation of these
assemblies for applications through the reversible association between
complementary components. Use of this methodology in living systems, however,
represents a significant challenge owing to the chemical complexity of cellular
environments and lack of selectivity of conventional supramolecular interactions.
Herein, we present a host-guest system featuring diaminohexane-terminated gold
nanoparticles (AuNP-NH(2)) and complementary cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]). In this
system, threading of CB[7] on the particle surface reduces the cytotoxicity of
AuNP-NH(2) through sequestration of the particle in endosomes. Intracellular
triggering of the therapeutic effect of AuNP-NH(2) was then achieved through the 
administration of 1-adamantylamine (ADA), removing CB[7] from the nanoparticle
surface, causing the endosomal release and concomitant in situ cytotoxicity of
AuNP-NH(2). This supramolecular strategy for intracellular activation provides a 
new tool for potential therapeutic applications.

The maximum pentagon separation rule provides a guideline for the structures of

Fullerenes tend to follow the isolated pentagon rule, which requires that each of
the 12 pentagons is surrounded only by hexagons. Over the past decade many
violations to this rule were reported for endohedral fullerenes. Based on the
ionic model M(3)N(6+)@C(2n)(6-) and the orbital energies of the isolated cages,
in 2005 we formulated a molecular orbital rule to identify the most suitable
hosting cages in endohedral metallofullerenes. Now, we give physical support to
the orbital rule, and we propose the maximum pentagon separation rule, which can 
be applied to either isolated pentagon rule cages or to non-isolated pentagon
rule cages with the same number of adjacent pentagon pairs. The maximum pentagon 
separation rule can be formulated as 'The electron transfer from the internal
cluster to the fullerene host preferentially adds electrons to the pentagons;
therefore, the most suitable carbon cages are those with the largest separations 
among the 12 pentagons'.

Delivery of prebiotic compounds to early Earth from an impacting comet is thought
to be an unlikely mechanism for the origins of life because of unfavourable
chemical conditions on the planet and the high heat from impact. In contrast, we 
find that impact-induced shock compression of cometary ices followed by expansion
to ambient conditions can produce complexes that resemble the amino acid glycine.
Our ab initio molecular dynamics simulations show that shock waves drive the
synthesis of transient C-N bonded oligomers at extreme pressures and
temperatures. On post impact quenching to lower pressures, the oligomers break
apart to form a metastable glycine-containing complex. We show that impact from
cometary ice could possibly yield amino acids by a synthetic route independent of
the pre-existing atmospheric conditions and materials on the planet.

Metal-organic frameworks--a class of porous hybrid materials built from metal
ions and organic bridges--have recently shown great promise for a wide variety of
applications. The large choice of building blocks means that the structures and
pore characteristics of the metal-organic frameworks can be tuned relatively
easily. However, despite much research, it remains challenging to prepare
frameworks specifically tailored for particular applications. Here, we have used 
computational modelling to design and predictively characterize a metal-organic
framework (NU-100) with a particularly high surface area. Subsequent experimental
synthesis yielded a material, matching the calculated structure, with a high BET 
surface area (6,143 m(2) g(-1)). Furthermore, sorption measurements revealed that
the material had high storage capacities for hydrogen (164 mg g(-1)) and carbon
dioxide (2,315 mg g(-1))--gases of high importance in the contexts of clean
energy and climate alteration, respectively--in excellent agreement with
predictions from modelling.

The reactions of acyl anion equivalents (d1 synthons) with carbonyl electrophiles
allow for the construction of a wide range of molecules useful for the synthesis 
of biologically active compounds, natural products and chiral ligands. Despite
their utility, significant challenges still exist for developing catalytic,
enantioselective variants of these reactions. For example, the asymmetric benzoin
process, arguably the most characteristic reaction of d synthetic equivalents,
finds no general solution for reactions involving aliphatic acyl anions. In this 
Article, we introduce a new class of stable, isolable silyl ketene imines derived
from protected cyanohydrins. These nucleophiles serve as acyl anion equivalents
in Lewis base catalysed aldol addition reactions and allow for the preparation of
cross-benzoin and glycolate-aldol products in high yield and with exceptional
diastereo- and enantioselectivities.

Naturally occurring photosynthetic systems use elaborate pathways of self-repair 
to limit the impact of photo-damage. Here, we demonstrate a complex consisting of
two recombinant proteins, phospholipids and a carbon nanotube that mimics this
process. The components self-assemble into a configuration in which an array of
lipid bilayers aggregate on the surface of the carbon nanotube, creating a
platform for the attachment of light-converting proteins. The system can
disassemble upon the addition of a surfactant and reassemble upon its removal
over an indefinite number of cycles. The assembly is thermodynamically metastable
and can only transition reversibly if the rate of surfactant removal exceeds a
threshold value. Only in the assembled state do the complexes exhibit
photoelectrochemical activity. We demonstrate a regeneration cycle that uses
surfactant to switch between assembled and disassembled states, resulting in an
increased photoconversion efficiency of more than 300% over 168 hours and an
indefinite extension of the system lifetime.

The covalent chemistry of reactants tethered within a single protein pore can be 
monitored by observing the time-dependence of ionic current flow through the
pore, which responds to bond making and breaking in individual reactant
molecules. Here we use this 'nanoreactor' approach to examine the reaction of a
quinone with a thiol to form a substituted hydroquinone by reductive 1,4-Michael 
addition. Remarkably, a primary hydrogen-deuterium isotope effect is readily
detected at the single-molecule level during prototropic rearrangement of an
initial adduct. The observation of individual reaction intermediates allows the
measurement of an isotope effect whether or not the step involved is rate
limiting, which would not be the case in an ensemble measurement.

Most synthetic materials that show molecular-scale porosity consist of one-, two-
or three-dimensional networks. Porous metal-organic frameworks in particular have
attracted a lot of recent attention. By contrast, discrete molecules tend to pack
efficiently in the solid state, leaving as little empty space as possible, which 
leads to non-porous materials. This Perspective discusses recent developments
with discrete organic molecules that are porous in the solid state. Such
molecules, which may be either crystalline or amorphous, can be categorized as
either intrinsically porous (containing permanent covalent cavities) or
extrinsically porous (inefficiently packed). We focus on the possible advantages 
of organic molecules over inorganic or hybrid systems in terms of molecular
solubility, choice of components and functionalities, and structural mobility and
responsiveness in non-covalent extended solids. We also highlight the potential
for 'undiscovered' porous systems among the large number of cage-like organic
molecules that are already known.

Bridging-ligand-substitution strategy for the preparation of metal-organic
polyhedra.

Metal-organic polyhedra-discrete molecular architectures constructed through the 
coordination of metal ions and organic linkers-have recently attracted
considerable attention due to their intriguing structures, their potential for a 
variety of applications and their relevance to biological self-assembly. Several 
synthetic routes have been investigated to prepare these complexes. However, to
date, these preparative methods have typically been based on the direct assembly 
of metal ions and organic linkers. Although these routes are convenient, it
remains difficult to find suitable reaction conditions or to control the outcome 
of the assembly process. Here, we demonstrate a synthetic strategy based on the
substitution of bridging ligands in soluble metal-organic polyhedra. The
introduction of linkers with different properties from those of the initial
metal-organic polyhedra can thus lead to new metal-organic polyhedra with
distinct properties (including size and shape). Furthermore, partial substitution
can also occur and form mixed-ligand species that may be difficult to access by
means of other approaches.

The cortistatins are a recently identified class of marine natural products
characterized by an unusual steroidal skeleton, which have been found to inhibit 
differentially the proliferation of various mammalian cells in culture by an
unknown mechanism. We describe a comprehensive route for the synthesis of
cortistatins from a common precursor, which in turn is assembled from two
fragments of similar structural complexity. Cortistatins A and J, and for the
first time K and L, have been synthesized in parallel processes from like
intermediates prepared from a single compound. With the identification of facile 
laboratory transformations linking intermediates in the cortistatin L synthetic
series with corresponding intermediates to cortistatins A and J, we have been led
to speculate that somewhat related paths might occur in nature, offering
potential sequencing and chemical detail for cortistatin biosynthetic pathways.

The slow rate of the oxygen reduction reaction in the phosphoric acid fuel cell
is the main factor limiting its wide application. Here, we present an approach
that can be used for the rational design of cathode catalysts with potential use 
in phosphoric acid fuel cells, or in any environments containing strongly
adsorbing tetrahedral anions. This approach is based on molecular patterning of
platinum surfaces with cyanide adsorbates that can efficiently block the sites
for adsorption of spectator anions while the oxygen reduction reaction proceeds
unhindered. We also demonstrate that, depending on the supporting electrolyte
anions and cations, on the same CN-covered Pt(111) surface, the oxygen reduction 
reaction activities can range from a 25-fold increase to a 50-fold decrease. This
behaviour is discussed in the light of the role of covalent and non-covalent
interactions in controlling the ensemble of platinum active sites required for
high turn over rates of the oxygen reduction reaction.

Two [3]catenane 'molecular flasks' have been designed to create stabilized,
redox-controlled tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) dimers, enabling their
spectrophotometric and structural properties to be probed in detail. The
mechanically interlocked framework of the [3]catenanes creates the ideal
arrangement and ultrahigh local concentration for the encircled TTF units to form
stable dimers associated with their discrete oxidation states. These dimerization
events represent an affinity umpolung, wherein the inversion in electronic
affinity replaces the traditional TTF-bipyridinium interaction, which is
over-ridden by stabilizing mixed-valence (TTF)2•+ and radical-cation (TTF•+)2
states inside the 'molecular flasks.' The experimental data, collected in the
solid state as well as in solution under ambient conditions, together with
supporting quantum mechanical calculations, are consistent with the formation of 
stabilized paramagnetic mixed-valence dimers, and then diamagnetic radical-cation
dimers following subsequent one-electron oxidations of the [3]catenanes.

The desorption of dihydrogen from magnesium(II) hydride, MgH2 (containing 7.6 wt%
H), is reversible. MgH2 therefore holds promise as a hydrogen storage material in
devices powered by fuel cells. We believed that dimeric magnesium(I) dimers
(LMgMgL, L=β-diketiminate) could find use as soluble models to aid the study of
the mechanisms and/or kinetics of the hydrogenation of magnesium and its alloys. 
Here, we show that LMgMgL can be readily hydrogenated to yield LMg(µ-H)2MgL by
treatment with aluminium(III) hydride complexes. In one case, hydrogenation was
reversed by treating LMg(µ-H)2MgL with potassium metal. The hydrogenation
by-products are the first thermally stable, neutral aluminium(II) hydride
complexes to be produced, one of which, [{(IPr)(H)2Al}2]
(IPr=:C[{(C6H3-i-Pr(2)-2,6)NCH}2]), is an N-heterocyclic carbene adduct of the
elusive parent dialane4 (Al2H4). A computational analysis of this compound is
presented.

Meroterpenoids are hybrid natural products of both terpenoid and polyketide
origin. We identified a biosynthetic gene cluster that is responsible for the
production of the meroterpenoid pyripyropene in the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus 
through reconstituted biosynthesis of up to five steps in a heterologous fungal
expression system. The cluster revealed a previously unknown terpene cyclase with
an unusual sequence and protein primary structure. The wide occurrence of this
sequence in other meroterpenoid and indole-diterpene biosynthetic gene clusters
indicates the involvement of these enzymes in the biosynthesis of various
terpenoid-bearing metabolites produced by fungi and bacteria. In addition, a
novel polyketide synthase that incorporated nicotinyl-CoA as the starter unit and
a prenyltransferase, similar to that in ubiquinone biosynthesis, was found to be 
involved in the pyripyropene biosynthesis. The successful production of a
pyripyropene analogue illustrates the catalytic versatility of these enzymes for 
the production of novel analogues with useful biological activities.

Aqueous ions are central to catalysis and biological function and play an
important role in radiation biology as sources of damage-inducing electrons.
Detailed knowledge of solute-solvent interactions is therefore crucial. For
transition-metal ions, soft X-ray L-edge spectroscopy allows access to d
orbitals, which are involved in chemical bonding. Using this technique, we show
that the fluorescence-yield spectra of aqueous ionic species exhibit additional
features compared with those of non-aqueous solvents. Some features dip below the
fluorescence background of the solvent and this is rationalized by the
competition between the fluorescence yields of the solute and solvent species,
and between the solute radiative (fluorescence) and non-radiative channels; in
particular, electron transfer to the water molecules. This method allows us to
determine the nature, directionality and timescale of the electron transfer.
Remarkably, we observe such features even for fully ligated metal atoms, which
indicates a direct interaction with the water molecules.

The concept of self-assembling container molecules as yocto-litre reaction flasks
is gaining prominence. However, the idea of using such containers as a means of
protection is not well developed. Here, we illustrate this idea in the context of
kinetic resolutions. Specifically, we report on the use of a water-soluble,
deep-cavity cavitand to bring about kinetic resolutions within pairs of esters
that otherwise cannot be resolved because they react at very similar rates.
Resolution occurs because the presence of the cavitand leads to a competitive
binding equilibrium in which the stronger binder primarily resides inside the
host and the weaker binding ester primarily resides in the bulk hydrolytic
medium. For the two families of ester examined, the observed kinetic resolutions 
were highest within the optimally fitting smaller esters.

Metal-organic frameworks, built by bridging metal ions with organic linkers,
represent a new class of porous hybrid materials with attractive tunability in
compositions, structures and functions. In particular, the mild conditions
typically employed for their synthesis allow for the functionalization of their
building blocks, and thus the rational design of novel materials. Here we
demonstrate the systematic design of eight mesoporous chiral metal-organic
frameworks, with the framework formula [LCu2(solvent)2] (where L is a chiral
tetracarboxylate ligand derived from 1,1'-bi-2-naphthol), that have the same
structures but channels of different sizes. Chiral Lewis acid catalysts were
generated by postsynthesis functionalization with Ti(OiPr)4, and the resulting
materials proved to be highly active asymmetric catalysts for diethylzinc and
alkynylzinc additions, which converted aromatic aldehydes into chiral secondary
alcohols. The enantioselectivities of these reactions can be modified by tuning
the size of the channels, which alters the diffusion rates of the organic
substrates.

An effective and efficient means to catalyst discovery is the high-throughput
screening of catalyst libraries. However, the current status of this approach
suffers from a number of limitations, namely access to structurally diverse and
meaningful ligand libraries and the enormous effort required for massive parallel
screening of the resulting catalysts. We report an integrated solution to these
drawbacks, which combines a diversity-oriented ligand synthesis, a
catalyst-generation process driven by self-assembly and, finally, a combinatorial
iterative library deconvolution strategy to identify the optimal catalyst. As a
test case, rhodium-catalysed asymmetric hydrogenation was studied and, from a
library of 120 self-assembling catalysts, highly enantioselective catalysts for
the asymmetric hydrogenation of different olefinic substrates were identified
within 17 experiments. Comparison of the results of the iterative library
deconvolution strategy with those of the classic parallel-screening process
confirmed the validity of this approach.

Water is the renewable, bulk chemical that nature uses to enable carbohydrate
production from carbon dioxide. The dream goal of energy research is to transpose
this incredibly efficient process and make an artificial device whereby the
catalytic splitting of water is finalized to give a continuous production of
oxygen and hydrogen. Success in this task would guarantee the generation of
hydrogen as a carbon-free fuel to satisfy our energy demands at no environmental 
cost. Here we show that very efficient and stable nanostructured, oxygen-evolving
anodes are obtained by the assembly of an oxygen-evolving polyoxometalate cluster
(a totally inorganic ruthenium catalyst) with a conducting bed of multiwalled
carbon nanotubes. Our bioinspired electrode addresses the one major challenge of 
artificial photosynthesis, namely efficient water oxidation, which brings us
closer to being able to power the planet with carbon-free fuels.

Nature offers a huge and only partially explored variety of small molecules with 
potential pharmaceutical applications. Commonly used characterization methods for
natural products include spectroscopic techniques such as nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. In some cases, however, these
techniques do not succeed in the unambiguous determination of the chemical
structure of unknown compounds. To validate the usefulness of scanning probe
microscopy as an adjunct to the other tools available for organic structure
analysis, we used the natural product cephalandole A, which had previously been
misassigned, and later corrected. Our results, corroborated by density functional
theory, demonstrate that direct imaging of an organic compound with
atomic-resolution force microscopy facilitates the accurate determination of its 
chemical structure. We anticipate that our method may be developed further
towards molecular imaging with chemical sensitivity, and will become generally
useful in solving certain classes of natural product structures.

Reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization has
revolutionized the field of polymer synthesis as a versatile tool for the
production of complex polymeric architectures. As for all chemical processes,
research and development in RAFT have to focus on the design and application of
chemical products and processes that have a minimum environmental impact, and
follow the principles of 'green' chemistry. In this Review, we summarize some of 
the green features of the RAFT process, and review the recent advances in the
production of degradable polymers obtained from RAFT polymerization. Its use to
modify biodegradable and renewable inorganic and organic materials to yield more 
functional products with enhanced applications is also covered. RAFT is a
promising candidate for answering both the increasing need of modern society to
employ highly functional polymeric materials and the global requirements for
developing sustainable chemicals and processes.

Two- and three-dimensional extended solids and metallization of compressed XeF2.

University, Pullman, Washington 99164, USA.

The application of pressure, internal or external, transforms molecular solids
into extended solids with more itinerant electrons to soften repulsive
interatomic interactions in a tight space. Examples include insulator-to-metal
transitions in O(2), Xe and I(2), as well as molecular-to-non-molecular
transitions in CO(2) and N(2). Here, we present new discoveries of novel two- and
three-dimensional extended non-molecular phases of solid XeF(2) and their
metallization. At approximately 50 GPa, the transparent linear insulating XeF(2) 
transforms into a reddish two-dimensional graphite-like hexagonal layered
structure of semiconducting XeF(4). Above 70 GPa, it further transforms into a
black three-dimensional fluorite-like structure of the first observed metallic
XeF(8) polyhedron. These simultaneously occurring molecular-to-non-molecular and 
insulator-to-metal transitions of XeF(2) arise from the pressure-induced
delocalization of non-bonded lone-pair electrons to sp(3)d(2) hybridization in
two-dimensional XeF(4) and to p(3)d(5) in three-dimensional XeF(8) through the
chemical bonding of all eight valence electrons in Xe and, thereby, fulfilling
the octet rule at high pressures.

Many molecular cages selectively bind guests in solution, but in the solid state 
close packing often prevents guest entry, which renders the cages inactive. We
envisioned that coordination networks constructed from well-known molecular cages
could transfer the richness of solution-state host-guest chemistry into the solid
state. We report a crystalline coordination network generated from an infinite
array of octahedral M(6)L(4) cage subunits (M = metal, L = ligand). This
coordination network is a 'crystalline molecular sponge' engineered on the
molecular level and retains similar guest recognition properties to those found
in solution. The network crystallinity is robust and thus X-ray diffraction
analysis can be used to unambiguously observe single-crystal to single-crystal
guest inclusion. The void spaces define alternating M(12)L(8) and M(12)L(24)
cuboctahedral molecular cages and these large cages absorb up to 35 weight per
cent of C(60) or C(70) by simply soaking the crystals in a toluene solution of
the fullerene. When the crystals are immersed in fullerene mixtures, C(70) is
preferentially absorbed.

Supramolecular assembly is a powerful strategy used by nature to build nanoscale 
architectures with predefined sizes and shapes. With synthetic systems, however, 
numerous challenges remain to be solved before precise control over the
synthesis, folding and assembly of rationally designed three-dimensional
nano-objects made of RNA can be achieved. Here, using the transfer RNA molecule
as a structural building block, we report the design, efficient synthesis and
structural characterization of stable, modular three-dimensional particles
adopting the polyhedral geometry of a non-uniform square antiprism. The spatial
control within the final architecture allows the precise positioning and
encapsulation of proteins. This work demonstrates that a remarkable degree of
structural control can be achieved with RNA structural motifs for the
construction of thermostable three-dimensional nano-architectures that do not
rely on helix bundles or tensegrity. RNA three-dimensional particles could
potentially be used as carriers or scaffolds in nanomedicine and synthetic
biology.

Enzymes are a continuing source of inspiration for the design of new chemical
reactions that proceed with efficiency, high selectivity and minimal waste. In
many biochemical processes, different catalytic species, such as Lewis acids and 
bases, are involved in precisely orchestrated interactions to activate reactants 
simultaneously or sequentially. This type of 'cooperative catalysis', in which
two or more catalytic cycles operate concurrently to achieve one overall
transformation, has great potential in enhancing known reactivity and driving the
development of new chemical reactions with high value. In this disclosure, a
cooperative N-heterocyclic carbene/Lewis acid catalytic system promotes the
addition of homoenolate equivalents to hydrazones, generating highly substituted 
gamma-lactams in moderate to good yields and with high levels of diastereo- and
enantioselectivity.

Aqueous lithium-ion batteries may solve the safety problem associated with
lithium-ion batteries that use highly toxic and flammable organic solvents, and
the poor cycling life associated with commercialized aqueous rechargeable
batteries such as lead-acid and nickel-metal hydride systems. But all reported
aqueous lithium-ion battery systems have shown poor stability: the capacity
retention is typically less than 50% after 100 cycles. Here, the stability of
electrode materials in an aqueous electrolyte was extensively analysed. The
negative electrodes of aqueous lithium-ion batteries in a discharged state can
react with water and oxygen, resulting in capacity fading upon cycling. By
eliminating oxygen, adjusting the pH values of the electrolyte and using
carbon-coated electrode materials, LiTi(2)(PO(4))(3)/Li(2)SO(4)/LiFePO(4) aqueous
lithium-ion batteries exhibited excellent stability with capacity retention over 
90% after 1,000 cycles when being fully charged/discharged in 10 minutes and 85% 
after 50 cycles even at a very low current rate of 8 hours for a full
charge/discharge offering an energy storage system with high safety, low cost,
long cycling life and appropriate energy density.

Critical biological electron-transfer processes involving high-valent oxometal
chemistry occur widely, for example in haem proteins [oxoiron(IV); Fe(IV)(O)] and
in photosystem II. Photosystem II involves Ca(2+) as well as high-valent
oxomanganese cluster species. However, there is no example of an interaction
between metal ions and oxoiron(IV) complexes. Here, we report new findings
concerning the binding of the redox-inactive metal ions Ca(2+) and Sc(3+) to a
non-haem oxoiron(IV) complex, [(TMC)Fe(IV)(O)](2+) (TMC =
1,4,8,11-tetramethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane). As determined by X-ray
diffraction analysis, an oxo-Sc(3+) interaction leads to a structural distortion 
of the oxoiron(IV) moiety. More importantly, this interaction facilitates a
two-electron reduction by ferrocene, whereas only a one-electron reduction
process occurs without the metal ions. This control of redox behaviour provides
valuable mechanistic insights into oxometal redox chemistry, and suggests a
possible key role that an auxiliary Lewis acid metal ion could play in nature, as
in photosystem II.

Interlocked molecules comprise two or more separate components that are joined by
'mechanical' rather than covalent bonds. In other words, these molecular
assemblies cannot be dissociated without the cleavage of one or more chemical
bonds. Although recent progress has enabled the preparation of such topologies
through coordination or templating interactions, three-dimensional interlocked
covalent architectures remain difficult to prepare. Here, we present a
template-free one-pot synthesis of triply interlocked organic cages. These
20-component dimers consist of two tetrahedral monomeric cages each built from
four nodes and six linkers. The monomers exhibit axial chirality, which is
recognized by their partner cage during the template-free interlocking assembly
process. The dimeric cages also include two well-defined cavities per assembly,
which for one of the systems studied led to the formation of a supramolecular
host-guest chain. These interlocked organic molecules may prove useful as part of
a toolkit for the modular construction of complex porous solids and other
supramolecular assemblies.

The development of single-molecule techniques has afforded many new methods for
the observation and assembly of supramolecular structures and biomolecular
networks. We previously reported a method, known as the single-molecule
cut-and-paste approach, to pick up and deposit individual DNA strands on a
surface. This, however, required pre-functionalization of the surface with DNA
strands complementary to those that were to be picked up and then deposited. Here
we show that single molecules of double-stranded DNA, bound to the tip of an
atomic force microscope, can be deposited on a bare gold electrode using an
electrical trigger (surface potential cycling). The interactions between the DNA 
and the electrode were investigated and we found that double-stranded DNA
chemisorbs to the gold electrode exclusively at its end through primary amine
groups. We corroborated this finding in experiments in which only a single
adenosine nucleotide on a polyethylene glycol spacer was 'electrosorbed' to the
gold electrode.

Although metal-metal bonding is important in the chemistry of both solid-state
intermetallic compounds and molecular species, the study of this bonding is
limited by the compounds available and it is rarely possible to identify
connections between these two areas. In this study, molecular intermetalloids
[Ln(ReCp(2))(3)] (Ln = Sm, Lu and La) have been synthesized that contain
lanthanoid metals bound only to transition metals. Although they are highly
reactive species, such lanthanoid-core transition-metal-shell compounds can be
stable in solution. They mimic the bonding situation of intermetallic compounds, 
as revealed by a direct comparison of molecular and solid state
lanthanoid-transition metal bonding.

In biology-oriented synthesis the underlying scaffold classes of natural products
selected in evolution are used to define biologically relevant starting points in
chemical structure space for the synthesis of compound collections with focused
structural diversity. Here we describe a highly enantioselective synthesis of
natural-product-inspired 3,3'-pyrrolidinyl spirooxindoles--which contain an
all-carbon quaternary centre and three tertiary stereocentres. This synthesis
takes place by means of an asymmetric Lewis acid-catalysed 1,3-dipolar
cycloaddition of an azomethine ylide to a substituted 3-methylene-2-oxindole
using 1-3 mol% of a chiral catalyst formed from a N,P-ferrocenyl ligand and
CuPF(6)(CH(3)CN)(4). Cellular evaluation has identified a molecule that arrests
mitosis, induces multiple microtubule organizing centres and multipolar spindles,
causes chromosome congression defects during mitosis and inhibits tubulin
regrowth in cells. Our findings support the concept that compound collections
based on natural-product-inspired scaffolds constructed with complex
stereochemistry will be a rich source of compounds with diverse bioactivity.

Atomic steps at the surface of a catalyst play an important role in heterogeneous
catalysis, for example as special sites with increased catalytic activity.
Exposure to reactants can cause entirely new structures to form at the catalyst
surface, and these may dramatically influence the reaction by 'poisoning' it or
by acting as the catalytically active phase. For example, thin metal oxide films 
have been identified as highly active structures that form spontaneously on metal
surfaces during the catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide. Here, we present
operando X-ray diffraction experiments on a palladium surface during this
reaction. They reveal that a high density of steps strongly alters the stability 
of the thin, catalytically active palladium oxide film. We show that
stabilization of the metal, caused by the steps and consequent destabilization of
the oxide, is at the heart of the well-known reaction rate oscillations exhibited
during CO oxidation at atmospheric pressure.

Uranium nitride [U[triple bond]N](x) is an alternative nuclear fuel that has
great potential in the expanding future of nuclear power; however, very little is
known about the U[triple bond]N functionality. We show, for the first time, that 
a terminal uranium nitride complex can be generated by photolysis of an azide
(U-N=N=N) precursor. The transient U[triple bond]N fragment is reactive and
undergoes insertion into a ligand C-H bond to generate new N-H and N-C bonds. The
mechanism of this unprecedented reaction has been evaluated through computational
and spectroscopic studies, which reveal that the photochemical azide activation
pathway can be shut down through coordination of the terminal azide ligand to the
Lewis acid B(C(6)F(5))(3). These studies demonstrate that photochemistry can be a
powerful tool for inducing redox transformations for organometallic actinide
complexes, and that the terminal uranium nitride fragment is reactive, cleaving
strong C-H bonds.

Atmospheric aerosol particles play pivotal roles in climate and air quality. Just
as chemically reduced gases experience oxidation in the atmosphere, it is now
apparent that solid and liquid atmospheric particulates are also subject to
similar oxidative processes. The most reactive atmospheric gas-phase radicals, in
particular the hydroxyl radical, readily promote such chemistry through surficial
interactions. This Review looks at progress made in this field, discussing the
radical-initiated heterogeneous oxidation of organic and inorganic constituents
of atmospheric aerosols. We focus on the kinetics and reaction mechanisms of such
processes as well as how they can affect the physico-chemical properties of
particles, such as their composition, size, density and hygroscopicity. Potential
impacts on the atmosphere include the release of chemically reactive gases such
as halogens, aldehydes and organic acids, reactive loss of particle-borne
molecular tracer and toxic species, and enhanced hygroscopic properties of
aerosols that may improve their ability to form cloud droplets.

Metal-organic frameworks, typically built by bridging metal centres with organic 
linkers, have recently shown great promise for a wide variety of applications,
including gas separation and drug delivery. Here, we have used them as a scaffold
to probe the photophysical and photochemical properties of metal-diimine
complexes. We have immobilized a M(diimine)(CO)(3)X moiety (where M is Re or Mn, 
and X can be Cl or Br) by using it as the linker of a metal-organic framework,
with Mn(II) cations acting as nodes. Time-resolved infrared measurements showed
that the initial excited state formed on ultraviolet irradiation of the
rhenium-based metal-organic framework was characteristic of an intra-ligand
state, rather than the metal-ligand charge transfer state typically observed in
solution, and revealed that the metal-diimine complexes rearranged from the fac- 
to mer-isomer in the crystalline solid state. This approach also enabled
characterization of the photoactivity of Mn(diimine)(CO)(3)Br by single-crystal
X-ray diffraction.

Molecular subcomponents such as phosphate groups are often passed between
biomolecules during complex signalling cascades, the flow of which define the
motion of the machinery of life. Here, we show how an abiological system
consisting of organic subcomponents knitted together by metal-ion coordination
can respond to simple signals in complex ways. A Cu(I)(3) helicate transformed
into its Zn(II)(2)Cu(I) analogue following the addition of zinc(II), and the
ejected copper(I) went on to induce the self-assembly of a Cu(I)(2) helicate from
other free subcomponents present in solution. The addition of an additional
subcomponent, 8-aminoquinoline, resulted in the formation of a third, more stable
Cu(I)(3) helicate, requiring the destruction of both the Zn(II)(2)Cu(I) and
Cu(I)(2) helicates to scavenge sufficient Cu(I) for the new structure. This
system thus demonstrates two examples in which the application of one signal
provokes two distinct responses involving the creation or destruction of complex 
assemblies as the system seeks thermodynamic equilibrium following perturbation.

If the physical properties of C(60) fullerene molecules can be controlled in
C(60) products already in use in various applications, the potential for
industrial development will be significant. Encapsulation of a metal atom in the 
C(60) fullerene molecule is a promising way to control its physical properties.
However, the isolation of C(60)-based metallofullerenes has been difficult due to
their insolubility. Here, we report the complete isolation and determination of
the molecular and crystal structure of polar cationic Li@C(60) metallofullerene. 
The physical and chemical properties of Li@C(60) cation are compared with those
of pristine C(60). It is found that the lithium cation is located at off-centre
positions in the C(60)-I(h) cage interior and that the [Li(+)@C(60)] salt has a
unique two-dimensional structure. The present method of purification and
crystallization of C(60)-based metallofullerenes provides a new C(60) fullerene
material that contains a metal atom.

Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer a new strategy for assembling organic
semiconductors into robust networks with atomic precision and long-range order.
General methods for COF synthesis will allow complex building blocks to be
incorporated into these emerging materials. Here we report a new Lewis
acid-catalysed protocol to form boronate esters directly from protected catechols
and arylboronic acids. This transformation also provides crystalline boronate
ester-linked COFs from protected polyfunctional catechols and bis(boronic acids).
Using this method, we prepared a new COF that features a square lattice composed 
of phthalocyanine macrocycles joined by phenylene bis(boronic acid) linkers. The 
phthalocyanines stack in an eclipsed fashion within the COF to form 2.3 nm pores 
that run parallel to the stacked chromophores. The material's broad absorbance
over the solar spectrum, potential for efficient charge transport through the
stacked phthalocyanines, good thermal stability and the modular nature of COF
synthesis, show strong promise for applications in organic photovoltaic devices.

The 'anomeric effect' is the thermodynamic preference for polar substituents to
occupy the axial position in the chair conformation of various heterocycles. The 
most common explanation given for this effect at present is hyperconjugation from
the lone pairs on the ring heteroatom to the antibonding orbital between the
anomeric carbon and its linking substituent. Alternatively, the anomeric effect
could be explained by intramolecular electrostatic interactions between local
dipoles. Few models can provide convincing data for either theory at the
quantum-mechanical level. Now, using the extended block-localized wavefunction
method, which is the simplest form of valence bond theory, we have evaluated the 
degree of hyperconjugation in various compounds that display the anomeric effect 
and have interpreted their conformational preferences in terms of steric,
hyperconjugation and dispersion effects. The results provide strong evidence that
hyperconjugative interactions are not responsible for the anomeric effect and
that it is better interpreted in terms of electrostatic interactions.

University, Stanford, California 94305, USA.

Large-scale graphene electronics requires lithographic patterning of narrow
graphene nanoribbons for device integration. However, conventional lithography
can only reliably pattern approximately 20-nm-wide GNR arrays limited by
lithography resolution, while sub-5-nm GNRs are desirable for high on/off ratio
field-effect transistors at room temperature. Here, we devised a gas phase
chemical approach to etch graphene from the edges without damaging its basal
plane. The reaction involved high temperature oxidation of graphene in a slightly
reducing environment in the presence of ammonia to afford controlled etch rate
(less than or approximately 1 nm min(-1)). We fabricated approximately
20-30-nm-wide graphene nanoribbon arrays lithographically, and used the gas phase
etching chemistry to narrow the ribbons down to <10 nm. For the first time, a
high on/off ratio up to approximately 10(4) was achieved at room temperature for 
field-effect transistors built with sub-5-nm-wide graphene nanoribbon
semiconductors derived from lithographic patterning and narrowing. Our controlled
etching method opens up a chemical way to control the size of various graphene
nano-structures beyond the capability of top-down lithography.

Information storage and processing is carried out at the level of individual
macromolecules in biological systems, but there is no reason, in principle, why
synthetic copolymers should not be used for the same purpose. Previous work has
suggested that monomer sequence information in chain-folding synthetic
copolyimides can be recognized by tweezer-type molecules binding to adjacent
triplet sequences, and we show here that different tweezer molecules can show
different sequence selectivities. This work, based on (1)H NMR spectroscopy in
solution and on single-crystal X-ray analysis of tweezer-oligomer complexes in
the solid state, provides the first clear-cut demonstration of polyimide
chain-folding and adjacent-tweezer binding. It also reveals a new and entirely
unexpected mechanism for sequence recognition, which, by analogy with a related
process in biomolecular information processing, may be termed
'frameshift-reading'. The ability of one particular tweezer molecule to detect,
with exceptionally high sensitivity, long-range sequence information in
chain-folding aromatic copolyimides is readily explained by this novel process.

Multi-exciton generation-the creation of multiple charge carrier pairs from a
single photon-has been reported for several materials and may dramatically
increase solar cell efficiency. Singlet fission, its molecular analogue, may
govern multi-exciton generation in a variety of materials, but a fundamental
mechanism for singlet fission has yet to be described. Here, we use sophisticated
ab initio calculations to show that singlet fission in pentacene proceeds through
rapid internal conversion of the photoexcited state into a dark state of
multi-exciton character that efficiently splits into two triplets. We show that
singlet fission to produce a pair of triplet excitons must involve an
intermediate state that (i) has a multi-exciton character, (ii) is energetically 
accessible from the optically allowed excited state, and (iii) efficiently
dissociates into multiple electron-hole pairs. The rational design of
photovoltaic materials that make use of singlet fission will require similar ab
initio analysis of multi-exciton states such as the dark state studied here.

Nitric oxide, NO, the diatomic hybrid of dinitrogen and dioxygen, has extensive
biochemical, industrial and atmospheric chemistry. The unpaired electron on NO
makes it highly reactive and its facile oxidation and reduction to make (NO)(1+) 
and (NO)(1-), respectively, have been heavily studied. Now the (NO)(2-) dianion
has been isolated for the first time from the two-electron reduction of NO by the
recently discovered (N(2))(3-) yttrium complex
{[(Me(3)Si)(2)N](2)(THF)Y}(2)(micro(3)-eta(2):eta(2):eta(2)-N(2))K. NO reacts
with this complex to form {[(Me(3)Si)(2)N](2)(THF)Y}(2)(micro-eta(2):eta(2)-NO), 
a paramagnetic complex that has an electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum
definitive for the (NO)(2-) radical. Density functional theory reveals that a
metal d(pi) to ligand pi* interaction is crucial for the stability of this
complex, which reacts with additional NO to generate the diamagnetic (ON=NO)(2-) 
product, {[(Me(3)Si)(2)N](2)Y}(4)(micro(3)-ON=NO)(2)(THF)(2).

Skipped polyenes (that is, 1,4-dienes and higher homologues) are stereodefined
components of a vast array of biologically important natural products, including 
polyunsaturated fatty acids. Although widespread in nature, these architectures
are generally considered to represent significant barriers to efficient chemical 
synthesis. Partial reduction of skipped poly-ynes provides a pathway to a subset 
of such structures, but general chemical methods for the preparation of skipped
polyenes that contain varied stereochemistries and substitution patterns are
lacking. Here, we describe a metal-promoted reductive cross-coupling reaction
between vinylcyclopropanes and alkynes (or vinylsilanes) that provides
stereoselective access to a diverse array of skipped polyenes through a process
that establishes one C-C bond, generates up to three stereodefined alkenes, and
can be used to introduce stereogenic centres at the central positions of the
skipped polyene motif. We also demonstrate the significance of the present bond
construction by preparing substituted and stereodefined polyunsaturated synthetic
fatty acids.

Porous coordination polymers are materials formed from metal ions that are
bridged together by organic linkers and that can combine two seemingly
contradictory properties-crystallinity and flexibility. Porous coordination
polymers can therefore create highly regular yet dynamic nanoporous domains that 
are particularly promising for sorption applications. Here, we describe the
effective selective sorption of dioxygen and nitric oxide by a structurally and
electronically dynamic porous coordination polymer built from zinc centres and
tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) as a linker. In contrast to a variety of other
gas molecules (C(2)H(2), Ar, CO(2), N(2) and CO), O(2) and NO are accommodated in
its pores. This unprecedented preference arises from the concerted effect of the 
charge-transfer interaction between TCNQ and these guests, and the switchable
gate opening and closing of the pores of the framework. This system provides
further insight into the efficient recognition of small gas molecules.

thioanisole.

Chemical reactions that occur in the ground electronic state are described well
by invoking the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, which allows their development to
be rationalized by nuclear rearrangements that smoothly traverse an adiabatic
potential energy surface. The situation is different, however, for reactions in
electronically excited states, where non-adiabatic transitions occur between
adiabatic surfaces. The conical intersection, in which two adiabatic surfaces
touch, is accepted widely as the dynamic funnel for efficient non-adiabatic
transitions, but its direct experimental probing is rare. Here, we investigate
the photodissociation of thioanisole and observe a striking dependence of the
relative yields of two reaction channels on the photoexcitation energy as
indicated by a dynamic resonance in the product branching ratio. This results
from the interference of two different adiabatic states that are in close
proximity in the region of a conical intersection. The location of the observed
resonance on the multidimensional potential energy surface thus reveals the
nuclear configuration of the conical intersection and its dynamic role in the
non-adiabatic transition.

The ensemble of forces that stabilize protein structure and facilitate biological
function are intimately linked with the ubiquitous aqueous environment of living 
systems. As a consequence, biomolecular activity is highly sensitive to the
interplay of solvent-protein interactions, and deviation from the native
conditions, for example by exposure to increased thermal energy or severe
dehydration, results in denaturation and subsequent loss of function. Although
certain enzymes can be extracted into non-aqueous solvents without significant
loss of activity, there are no known examples of solvent-less (molten) liquids of
functional metalloproteins. Here we describe the synthesis and properties of
room-temperature solvent-free myoglobin liquids with near-native structure and
reversible dioxygen binding ability equivalent to the haem protein under
physiological conditions. The realization of room-temperature solvent-free
myoglobin liquids with retained function presents novel challenges to existing
theories on the role of solvent molecules in structural biology, and should offer
new opportunities in protein-based nanoscience and bionanotechnology.

Sciences, Nieuwe Achtergracht 166, 1018 WV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

Supramolecular catalysis - the assembly of catalyst species by harnessing
multiple weak intramolecular interactions - has, until recently, been dominated
by enzyme-inspired approaches. Such approaches often attempt to create an
enzyme-like 'active site' and have concentrated on reactions similar to those
catalysed by enzymes themselves. Here, we discuss the application of
supramolecular assembly to the more traditional transition metal catalysis and to
small-molecule organocatalysis. The modularity of self-assembled multicomponent
catalysts means that a relatively small pool of catalyst components can provide
rapid access to a large number of catalysts that can be evaluated for
industrially relevant reactions. In addition, we discuss how catalyst-substrate
interactions can be tailored to direct substrates along particular reaction paths
and selectivities.

The development of methods for carbon-carbon bond formation under benign
conditions is an ongoing challenge for the synthetic chemist. In recent years
there has been considerable interest in using selective C-H activation as a
direct route for generating reactive intermediates. In this article, we describe 
the use of aldehyde auto-oxidation as a simple, clean and effective method for
C-H activation, resulting in the generation of an acyl radical. This acyl radical
can be used for carbon-carbon bond formation and herein we describe the
application of this method for the hydroacylation of alpha,beta-unsaturated
esters without the requirement of additional catalysts or reagents. This
methodology generates unsymmetrical ketones, which have been shown to have broad 
use in organic synthesis.

Cleave and capture chemistry illustrated through bimetallic-induced fragmentation
of tetrahydrofuran.

The cleavage of ethers is commonly encountered in organometallic chemistry,
although rarely studied in the context of new, emerging bimetallic reagents.
Recently, it was reported that a bimetallic sodium-zinc base can deprotonate
cyclic tetrahydrofuran under mild conditions without opening its heterocyclic
(OC(4)) ring. In marked contrast to this synergic sedation, herein we show that
switching to the more reactive sodium-magnesium or sodium-manganese bases
promotes cleavage of at least six bonds in tetrahydrofuran, but uniquely the ring
fragments are captured in separate crystalline complexes. Oxide fragments occupy 
guest positions in bimetallic, inverse crown ethers and C(4) fragments ultimately
appear in bimetallated butadiene molecules. These results demonstrate the special
synergic reactivity that can be executed by bimetallic reagents, which include
the ability to capture and control, and thereby study, reactive fragments from
sensitive substrates.

The excellent electrical, optical and mechanical properties of graphene have
driven the search to find methods for its large-scale production, but established
procedures (such as mechanical exfoliation or chemical vapour deposition) are not
ideal for the manufacture of processable graphene sheets. An alternative method
is the reduction of graphene oxide, a material that shares the same atomically
thin structural framework as graphene, but bears oxygen-containing functional
groups. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations to study the atomistic
structure of progressively reduced graphene oxide. The chemical changes of
oxygen-containing functional groups on the annealing of graphene oxide are
elucidated and the simulations reveal the formation of highly stable carbonyl and
ether groups that hinder its complete reduction to graphene. The calculations are
supported by infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. Finally,
more effective reduction treatments to improve the reduction of graphene oxide
are proposed.

Dioxygen activation for the subsequent oxygenation of organic substrates that
involves cheap and environmentally friendly chemical elements is at the cutting
edge of chemical research. As silicon is a non-toxic and highly oxophilic
element, the use of silylenes could be attractive for facile dioxygen activation 
to give dioxasiliranes with a SiO(2)-peroxo ring as versatile oxo-transfer
reagents. However, the latter are elusive species, and have been generated and
studied only in argon matrices at -233 degrees C. Recently, it was demonstrated
that unstable silicon species can be isolated by applying the concept of
donor-acceptor stabilization. We now report the first synthesis and
crystallographic characterization of dioxasiliranes stabilized by N-heterocyclic 
carbenes that feature a three-membered SiO(2)-peroxide ring, isolable at room
temperature. Unexpectedly, these can undergo internal oxygen transfer in toluene 
solution at ambient temperature to give a unique complex of cyclic sila-urea with
C=O --> Si=O interaction and the shortest Si=O double-bond distance reported to
date.

Mechanistic insights into the ruthenium-catalysed diene ring-closing metathesis
reaction.

Ruthenium-catalysed ring-closing metathesis (RCM) is a powerful technique for the
preparation of medium-to-large rings in organic synthesis, but the details of the
intimate mechanism are obscure. The dynamic behaviour of an RCM-relevant
ruthenacyclobutane complex and its reactivity with ethene were studied using
low-temperature NMR spectroscopy to illuminate the mechanism of this widely used 
reaction. These kinetic and thermodynamic experiments allowed for mapping the
energy surface of the key steps in the RCM reaction as mediated by Grubbs-type
catalysts for alkene metathesis. The highest barrier along the RCM path is only
65 kJ mol(-1), which shows that this catalyst has extremely high inherent
activity. Furthermore, this transition state corresponds to that connecting the
intermediates in this reaction leading to ring opening of the cyclopentene
product. This shows that ring closing is kinetically slightly favoured over ring 
opening, in addition to being driven by the loss of ethene.

Non-spherical nanostructures derived from soft matter and with uniform size-that 
is, monodisperse materials-are of particular utility and interest, but are very
rare outside the biological domain. We report the controlled formation of highly 
monodisperse cylindrical block copolymer micelles (length dispersity < or = 1.03;
length range, approximately 200 nm to 2 microm) by the use of very small
(approximately 20 nm) uniform crystallite seeds that serve as initiators for the 
crystallization-driven living self-assembly of added block-copolymer unimers with
a crystallizable, core-forming metalloblock. This process is analogous to the use
of small initiator molecules in classical living polymerization reactions. The
length of the nanocylinders could be precisely controlled by variation of the
unimer-to-crystallite seed ratio. Samples of the highly monodisperse
nanocylinders of different lengths that are accessible using this approach have
been shown to exhibit distinct liquid-crystalline alignment behaviour.

Triggering N(2) uptake via redox-induced expulsion of coordinated NH(3) and N(2) 
silylation at trigonal bipyramidal iron.

The biological reduction of N(2) to give NH(3) may occur by one of two
predominant pathways in which nitrogenous N(x)H(y) intermediates, including
hydrazine (N(2)H(4)), diazene (N(2)H(2)), nitride (N(3-)) and imide (NH(2-)), may
be involved. To test the validity of hypotheses on iron's direct role in the
stepwise reduction of N(2), model systems for iron are needed. Such systems can
test the chemical compatibility of iron with various proposed N(x)H(y)
intermediates and the reactivity patterns of such species. Here we describe a
trigonal bipyramidal Si(o-C(6)H(4)PR(2))(3)Fe-L scaffold (R = Ph or i-Pr) in
which the apical site is occupied by nitrogenous ligands such as N(2), N(2)H(4), 
NH(3) and N(2)R. The system accommodates terminally bound N(2) in the three
formal oxidation states (iron(0), +1 and +2). N(2) uptake is demonstrated by the 
displacement of its reduction partners NH(3) and N(2)H(4), and N(2)
functionalizaton is illustrated by electrophilic silylation.

Chiral-auxiliary-mediated 1,2-cis-glycosylations for the solid-supported

Solid-phase oligosaccharide synthesis offers the promise of providing libraries
of oligosaccharides for glycomics research. A major stumbling block to
solid-phase oligosaccharide synthesis has been a lack of general methods for the 
stereoselective installation of 1,2-cis-glycosides, and intractable mixtures of
compounds are obtained if several such glycosides need to be installed. We have
prepared on-resin a biologically important glucoside containing multiple
1,2-cis-glycosidic linkages with complete anomeric control by using glycosyl
donors having a participating (S)-(phenylthiomethyl)benzyl chiral auxiliary at
C2. A branching point could be installed by using 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl
(Fmoc) and allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc) as a versatile set of orthogonal protecting
groups. The synthetic strategy made it possible to achieve partial on-resin
deprotection of the completed oligosaccharide, thereby increasing the overall
efficiency of the synthesis. The combination of classical and auxiliary-mediated 
neighbouring-group participation for controlling anomeric selectivity is bringing
the promise of routine automated solid-supported oligosaccharide synthesis
closer.

The ready availability, low price and environmentally benign character of iron
mean that it is an ideal alternative to precious metals in catalysis. Recent
growth in the number of iron-catalysed reactions reported reflects an increasing 
demand for sustainable chemistry. Only a limited number of chiral iron catalysts 
have been reported and these have, in general, proven less enantioselective than 
other transition-metal catalysts, thus limiting their appeal. Here, we report
that iron complexes of spiro-bisoxazoline ligands are highly efficient catalysts 
for asymmetric O-H bond insertion reactions. These complexes catalyse insertions 
into the O-H bond of a wide variety of alcohols and even water, with exceptional 
enantioselectivities under mild reaction conditions. The selectivities surpass
those obtained with other transition-metal catalysts. This study should inspire
and encourage the use of iron instead of traditional precious metals in the
development of greener catalysts for catalytic asymmetric synthesis.

Photoinduced phase-transition materials, such as chalcogenides, spin-crossover
complexes, photochromic organic compounds and charge-transfer materials, are of
interest because of their application to optical data storage. Here we report a
photoreversible metal-semiconductor phase transition at room temperature with a
unique phase of Ti(3)O(5), lambda-Ti(3)O(5). lambda-Ti(3)O(5) nanocrystals are
made by the combination of reverse-micelle and sol-gel techniques. Thermodynamic 
analysis suggests that the photoinduced phase transition originates from a
particular state of lambda-Ti(3)O(5) trapped at a thermodynamic local energy
minimum. Light irradiation causes reversible switching between this trapped state
(lambda-Ti(3)O(5)) and the other energy-minimum state (beta-Ti(3)O(5)), both of
which are persistent phases. This is the first demonstration of a photorewritable
phenomenon at room temperature in a metal oxide. lambda-Ti(3)O(5) satisfies the
operation conditions required for a practical optical storage system (operational
temperature, writing data by short wavelength light and the appropriate threshold
laser power).

Attractive in theory and confirmed to exist, anion-pi interactions have never
really been seen at work. To catch them in action, we prepared a collection of
monomeric, cyclic and rod-shaped naphthalenediimide transporters. Their ability
to exert anion-pi interactions was demonstrated by electrospray tandem mass
spectrometry in combination with theoretical calculations. To relate this
structural evidence to transport activity in bilayer membranes, affinity and
selectivity sequences were recorded. pi-acidification and active-site decrowding 
increased binding, transport and chloride > bromide > iodide selectivity, and
supramolecular organization inverted acetate > nitrate to nitrate > acetate
selectivity. We conclude that anion-pi interactions on monomeric surfaces are
ideal for chloride recognition, whereas their supramolecular enhancement by
pi,pi-interactions appears perfect to target nitrate. Chloride transporters are
relevant to treat channelopathies, and nitrate sensors to monitor cellular
signaling and cardiovascular diseases. A big impact on organocatalysis can be
expected from the stabilization of anionic transition states on chiral pi-acidic 
surfaces.

Light can be considered an ideal reagent for environmentally friendly, 'green'
chemical synthesis; unlike many conventional reagents, light is non-toxic,
generates no waste, and can be obtained from renewable sources. Nevertheless, the
need for high-energy ultraviolet radiation in most organic photochemical
processes has limited both the practicality and environmental benefits of
photochemical synthesis on industrially relevant scales. This perspective
describes recent approaches to the use of metal polypyridyl photocatalysts in
synthetic organic transformations. Given the remarkable photophysical properties 
of these complexes, these new transformations, which use Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and
related photocatalysts, can be conducted using almost any source of visible
light, including both store-bought fluorescent light bulbs and ambient sunlight. 
Transition metal photocatalysis thus represents a promising strategy towards the 
development of practical, scalable industrial processes with great environmental 
benefits.

Transporting protons is essential in several biological processes as well as in
renewable energy devices, such as fuel cells. Although biological systems exhibit
precise supramolecular organization of chemical functionalities on the nanoscale 
to effect highly efficient proton conduction, to achieve similar organization in 
artificial systems remains a daunting challenge. Here, we are concerned with
transporting protons on a micron scale under anhydrous conditions, that is proton
transfer unassisted by any solvent, especially water. We report that
proton-conducting systems derived from facially amphiphilic polymers that exhibit
organized supramolecular assemblies show a dramatic enhancement in anhydrous
conductivity relative to analogous materials that lack the capacity for
self-organization. We describe the design, synthesis and characterization of
these macromolecules, and suggest that nanoscale organization of
proton-conducting functionalities is a key consideration in obtaining efficient
anhydrous proton transport.

In this Article we have used new approaches to investigate a well-known chemical 
process, the propagation of electrochemical signals through a thin glass
membrane. This process, which has been extensively studied over the last century,
is the basis of the response of a potentiometric glass pH sensor; however, no
amperometric glass sensors have yet been reported because of its high ohmic
resistance. Voltammetry at nanoelectrodes has revealed that water molecules can
diffuse through nanometre-thick layers of dry glass and undergo
oxidation/reduction at the buried platinum surface. After soaking for a few hours
in an aqueous solution, voltammetric waves of other redox couples, such as
Ru(NH(3))(6)(3+/2+), could also be obtained at the glass-covered platinum
nanoelectrodes. This behaviour suggests that the nanometre-thick insulating glass
sheath surrounding the platinum core can be largely converted to hydrated gel,
and electrochemical processes occur at the platinum/hydrogel interface. Potential
applications range from use in nanometre-sized solid-state pH probes and
determination of the water content in organic solvents to glass-modified
voltammetric sensors and electrocatalysts.

Dynamic covalent chemistry uses reversible chemical reactions to set up an
equilibrating network of molecules at thermodynamic equilibrium, which can adjust
its composition in response to any agent capable of altering the free energy of
the system. When the target is a biological macromolecule, such as a protein, the
process corresponds to the protein directing the synthesis of its own best
ligand. Here, we demonstrate that reversible acylhydrazone formation is an
effective chemistry for biological dynamic combinatorial library formation. In
the presence of aniline as a nucleophilic catalyst, dynamic combinatorial
libraries equilibrate rapidly at pH 6.2, are fully reversible, and may be
switched on or off by means of a change in pH. We have interfaced these hydrazone
dynamic combinatorial libraries with two isozymes from the glutathione
S-transferase class of enzyme, and observed divergent amplification effects,
where each protein selects the best-fitting hydrazone for the hydrophobic region 
of its active site.

The facile decomposition of ammonia to produce hydrogen is critical to its use as
a hydrogen storage medium in a hydrogen economy, and although ruthenium shows
good activity for catalysing this process, its expense and scarcity are
prohibitive to large-scale commercialization. The need to develop alternative
catalysts has been addressed here, using microkinetic modelling combined with
density functional studies to identify suitable monolayer bimetallic (surface or 
subsurface) catalysts based on nitrogen binding energies. The Ni-Pt-Pt(111)
surface, with one monolayer of Ni atoms residing on a Pt(111) substrate, was
predicted to be a catalytically active surface. This was verified using
temperature-programmed desorption and high-resolution electron energy loss
spectroscopy experiments. The results reported here provide a framework for
complex catalyst discovery. They also demonstrate the critical importance of
combining theoretical and experimental approaches for identifying desirable
monolayer bimetallic systems when the surface properties are not a linear
function of the parent metals.

Direct functionalization of alkanes by oxidation of C-H bonds to form alcohols
under mild conditions is a challenge for synthetic chemistry. Most alkanes
contain a large number of C-H bonds that present difficulties for selectivity,
and the oxidants employed often result in overoxidation. Here we describe a
divanadium-substituted phosphotungstate that catalyses the stereo- and
regioselective hydroxylation of alkanes with hydrogen peroxide as the sole
oxidant. Both cyclic and acyclic alkanes were oxidized to form alcohols with
greater than 96% selectivity. The bulky polyoxometalate framework of the catalyst
results in an unusual selectivity that can lead to the oxidation of secondary
rather than the weaker tertiary C-H bonds. The catalyst also avoids wasteful
decomposition of the stoichiometric oxidant, which can result in the production
of hydroxyl radicals and lead to non-selective oxidation and overoxidation of the
desired products.

It has long been appreciated that the transport properties of molecules can
control reaction kinetics. This effect can be characterized by the time it takes 
a diffusing molecule to reach a target-the first-passage time (FPT). Determining 
the FPT distribution in realistic confined geometries has until now, however,
seemed intractable. Here, we calculate this FPT distribution analytically and
show that transport processes as varied as regular diffusion, anomalous
diffusion, and diffusion in disordered media and fractals, fall into the same
universality classes. Beyond the theoretical aspect, this result changes our
views on standard reaction kinetics and we introduce the concept of
'geometry-controlled kinetics'. More precisely, we argue that geometry-and in
particular the initial distance between reactants in 'compact' systems-can become
a key parameter. These findings could help explain the crucial role that the
spatial organization of genes has in transcription kinetics, and more generally
the impact of geometry on diffusion-limited reactions.

XH/pi interactions make important contributions to biomolecular structure and
function. These weakly polar interactions, involving pi-system acceptor groups,
are usually identified from the three-dimensional structures of proteins. Here,
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has been used to directly detect
methyl/pi (Me/pi) interactions in proteins at atomic resolution. Density
functional theory calculations predict the existence of weak scalar (J) couplings
between nuclei involved in Me/pi interactions. Using an optimized
isotope-labelling strategy, these J couplings have been detected in proteins
using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The resulting spectra provide
direct experimental evidence of Me/pi interactions in proteins and allow a simple
and unambiguous assignment of donor and acceptor groups. The use of nuclear
magnetic resonance spectroscopy is an elegant way to identify and experimentally 
characterize Me/pi interactions in proteins without the need for arbitrary
geometric descriptions or pre-existing three-dimensional structures.

Metal-organic frameworks form a unique class of multifunctional hybrid materials 
and have myriad applications, including gas storage and catalysis. Their
structure is usually achieved through the infinite coordination of metal ions and
multidentate organic ligands by means of strong covalent bonds. Threaded
molecules such as catenanes and rotaxanes have largely been restricted to
comprising components of two-dimensional interlocking rings or polygons. There
are very few examples of the catenation of polyhedral cages. Although it has been
postulated that the infinite extended architecture can be obtained from the
polycatenation of a discrete cage based on such threading, this has not been
documented to date. Here we describe an infinite three-dimensional metal-organic 
framework composed of catenated polyhedral cages, in which the framework is
achieved by mechanical interlocking of all of the vertices of the cages. The
three-dimensional polycatenated framework shows twofold self-interpenetration in 
its crystal packing. The penetration of polycatenanes creates nanosized voids
into which the Keggin polyoxometalate anions are perfectly accommodated as
counteranions.

Electrocatalysis will play a key role in future energy conversion and storage
technologies, such as water electrolysers, fuel cells and metal-air batteries.
Molecular interactions between chemical reactants and the catalytic surface
control the activity and efficiency, and hence need to be optimized; however,
generalized experimental strategies to do so are scarce. Here we show how lattice
strain can be used experimentally to tune the catalytic activity of dealloyed
bimetallic nanoparticles for the oxygen-reduction reaction, a key barrier to the 
application of fuel cells and metal-air batteries. We demonstrate the core-shell 
structure of the catalyst and clarify the mechanistic origin of its activity. The
platinum-rich shell exhibits compressive strain, which results in a shift of the 
electronic band structure of platinum and weakening chemisorption of oxygenated
species. We combine synthesis, measurements and an understanding of strain from
theory to generate a reactivity-strain relationship that provides guidelines for 
tuning electrocatalytic activity.

Although fullerenes can be efficiently generated from graphite in high yield, the
route to the formation of these symmetrical and aesthetically pleasing carbon
cages from a flat graphene sheet remains a mystery. The most widely accepted
mechanisms postulate that the graphene structure dissociates to very small
clusters of carbon atoms such as C(2), which subsequently coalesce to form
fullerene cages through a series of intermediates. In this Article,
aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy directly visualizes, in
real time, a process of fullerene formation from a graphene sheet. Quantum
chemical modelling explains four critical steps in a top-down mechanism of
fullerene formation: (i) loss of carbon atoms at the edge of graphene, leading to
(ii) the formation of pentagons, which (iii) triggers the curving of graphene
into a bowl-shaped structure and which (iv) subsequently zips up its open edges
to form a closed fullerene structure.

Molecules that extend and contract under external stimuli are used to build
molecular machines with nanomechanical functions. But although common in
biological systems, such extension and contraction motions with helical molecules
have rarely been accompanied by unidirectional twisting in synthetic systems.
Here we show that sodium ions can trigger the reversible anisotropic twisting of 
an enantiomeric double-stranded helicate, without racemization. An optically
active helicate consisting of two tetraphenol strands bridged by two spiroborate 
groups sandwiches a sodium ion. On removal of the central sodium-through addition
of a cryptand [2.2.1] in solution-the double helicate extends. Crystallographic
and nuclear magnetic resonance studies reveal that the extended helicate is over 
twice as long as the initial molecule, and is twisted in the right-handed
direction. Circular dichroism analysis suggests that the twisting doesn't affect 
the helicate's handedness. This anisotropic extension-contraction process is
reversibly triggered by the successive addition and removal of sodium ions in
solution.

Although metal-organic frameworks are extensive in number and have found
widespread applications, there remains a need to add complexity to their
structures in a controlled manner. It is inevitable that frameworks capable of
dynamics will be required. However, as in other extended structures, when they
are flexible, they fail. We propose that mechanically interlocked molecules be
inserted covalently into the rigid framework backbone such that they are mounted 
as integrated components, capable of dynamics, without compromising the fidelity 
of the entire system. We have coined the term 'robust dynamics' to describe
constructs where the repeated dynamics of one entity does not affect the
integrity of any others linked to it. The implication of this concept for dynamic
molecules, whose performance has the disadvantages of random motion, is to bring 
them to a standstill in three-dimensional extended structures and thus
significantly enhance their order, and ultimately their coherence and
performance.
