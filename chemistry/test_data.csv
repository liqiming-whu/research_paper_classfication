Anion Transport with Pnictogen Bonds in Direct Comparison with Chalcogen and Halogen Bonds.,"In this Communication, we introduce transmembrane anion transport with pnictogen-bonding compounds and compare their characteristics with chalcogen- and halogen-bonding analogues. Tellurium-centered chalcogen bonds are at least as active as antimony-centered pnictogen bonds, whereas iodine-centered halogen bonds are 3 orders of magnitude less active. Irregular voltage-dependent single-channel currents, high gating charges, and efficient dye leakage support for the formation of bulky, membrane-disruptive supramolecular amphiphiles due to ""too strong"" binding of anions to tris(perfluorophenyl)stibanes. In contrast, the chalcogen-bonding bis(perfluorophenyl)tellanes do not cause leakage and excel as carriers with nanomolar activity, with P(Cl/Na) = 10.4 for anion/cation selectivity and P(Cl/NO3) = 4.5 for anion selectivity. The selectivities are lower with pnictogen-bonding carriers because their membrane-disturbing 3D structure also affects weaker binders ( P(Cl/Na) = 2.1, P(Cl/NO3) = 2.5). Their 2D structure, directionality, hydrophobicity, and support from proximal anion-pi interactions are suggested to contribute to the unique power of chalcogen bonds to transport anions across lipid bilayer membranes.",2
Few-Nanometer-Sized alpha-CsPbI3 Quantum Dots Enabled by Strontium Substitution and Iodide Passivation for Efficient Red-Light Emitting Diodes.,"Cubic phase CsPbI3 quantum dots (alpha-CsPbI3 QDs) as a newly emerging type of semiconducting QDs hold tremendous promise for fundamental research and optoelectronic device applications. However, stable and sub-5 nm-sized alpha-CsPbI3 QDs have rarely been demonstrated so far due to their highly labile ionic structure and low phase stability. Here, we report a novel strontium-substitution along with iodide passivation strategy to stabilize the cubic phase of CsPbI3, achieving the facile synthesis of alpha-CsPbI3 QDs with a series of controllable sizes down to sub-5 nm. We demonstrate that the incorporation of strontium ions can significantly increase the formation energies of alpha-CsPbI3 QDs and hence reduce the structure distortion to stabilize the cubic phase at the few-nanometer size. The size ranging from 15 down to sub-5 nm of as-prepared stable alpha-CsPbI3 QDs allowed us to investigate their unique size-dependent optical properties. Strikingly, the few-nanometer-sized alpha-CsPbI3 QDs turned out to retain high photoluminescence and highly close packing in solid state thin films, and the fabricated red light emitting diodes exhibited high brightness (1250 cd m(-2) at 9.2 V) and good operational stability (L50 > 2 h driven by 6 V). The developed cation-substitution strategy will provide an alternative method to prepare uniform and finely size-controlled colloidal lead halide perovskite QDs for various optoelectronic applications.",2
Acid Responsive Hydrogen-Bonded Organic Frameworks.,"A porous hydrogen-bonded organic framework (HOF) responsive to acid was constructed from a hexaazatrinaphthylene derivative with carboxyphenyl groups (CPHATN). Precise structures of both 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene solvate [CPHATN-1(TCB)] and activated HOF with permanent porosity (CPHATN-1a) were successfully determined by single-crystalline X-ray diffraction analysis. Permanent porosity of CPHATN-1a was evaluated by gas sorption experiments at low temperature. CPHATN-1a also shows significant thermal stability up to 633 K. Its crystals exhibit a rich photochemistry thanks to intramolecular charge-transfer and interunit proton-transfer reactions. Femtosecond (fs) experiments on crystals demonstrate that these events occur in </=200 fs and 1.2 ps, respectively. Moreover, single-crystal fluorescence microscopy reveals a shift of the emission spectra most probably as a result of defects and a high anisotropic behavior, reflecting an ordered crystalline structure with a preferential orientation of the molecular dipole moments. Remarkably, CPHATN-1a, as a result of the protonation of pyradyl nitrogen atoms embedded in its pi-conjugated core, shows reversible vapor acid-induced color changes from yellow to reddish-brown, which can be also followed by an ON/OFF of its emission. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first HOF that exhibits acid-responsive color changes. The present work provides new findings for developing stimuli responsive HOFs.",2
Direct Observation of the Orientational Anisotropy of Buried Hydroxyl Groups inside Muscovite Mica.,"Muscovite mica (001) is a widely used model surface for controlling molecular assembly and a common substrate for environmental adsorption processes. The mica (001) surface displays near-trigonal symmetry, but many molecular adsorbates-including water-exhibit unequal probabilities of alignment along its three nominally equivalent lattice directions. Buried hydroxyl groups within the muscovite structure are speculated to be responsible, but direct evidence is lacking. Here, we utilize vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy (vSFG) to characterize the orientation and hydrogen-bonding environment of near-surface hydroxyls inside mica. Multiple distinct peaks are detected in the O-H stretch region, which we attribute to Si/Al substitution in the SiO4 tetrahedron and K(+) ion adsorption above the hydroxyls based on density functional theory simulations. Our findings demonstrate that vSFG can identify the absolute orientation of -OH groups and, hence, the surface termination at a mica surface, providing a means to investigate how -OH groups influence molecular adsorption and better understand mica stacking-sequences and physical behavior.",2
Directional Intermolecular Interactions for Precise Molecular Design of a High- Tc Multiaxial Molecular Ferroelectric.,"Quasi-spherical molecules have recently been developed as promising building blocks for constructing high-performance molecular ferroelectrics. However, although the modification of spherical molecules into quasi-spherical ones can efficiently lower the crystal symmetry, it is still a challenge to precisely arouse a low-symmetric polar crystal structure. Here, by introducing directional hydrogen-bonding interactions in the molecular modification, we successfully reduced the cubic centrosymmetric Pm3 m space group of [quinuclidinium]ClO4 at room temperature to the orthorhombic polar Pna21 space group of [3-oxoquinuclidinium]ClO4. Different from the substituent groups of -OH, -CH3, and horizontal lineCH2, the addition of a horizontal lineO group with H-acceptor to [quinuclidinium](+) forms directionally N-H...O horizontal lineC hydrogen-bonded chains, which plays a critical role in the generation of polar structure in [3-oxoquinuclidinium]ClO4. Systematic characterization indicates that [3-oxoquinuclidinium]ClO4 is an excellent molecular ferroelectric with a high Curie temperature of 457 K, a large saturate polarization of 6.7 muC/cm(2), and a multiaxial feature of 6 equiv ferroelectric axes. This work demonstrates that the strategy of combining quasi-spherical molecule building blocks with directional intermolecular interactions provides an efficient route to precisely design new eminent molecular ferroelectrics.",2
Translation of a Polar Biogenesis Proposal into a Radical Synthetic Approach: Synthesis of Pleurocin A/Matsutakone and Pleurocin B.,"A synthetic approach to recently reported and structurally unique 11(9-->7) abeo-steroids pleurocin A/matsutakone (1) and pleurocin B (2) was developed by reconsidering the originally suggested polar transformations of their biogenesis. An intricate radical cyclization of a late stage intermediate followed by an oxidative quench was used instead and forged the abeo-framework, while the 9,11-seco-motif was obtained by conversion of ergosterol into a 9,11-secoenol ether employing a mercury-free desaturation of the Treibs type, an oxidative bond scission preluding a dioxa-[4+2]-cycloaddition of an aldehyde to an enone and a combined transacetalization/elimination followed by an ionic hydrogenation.",2
Highly Efficient Enantioselective Synthesis of Chiral Sulfones by Rh-Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation.,"A highly efficient and enantioselective Rh-( R, R)-f-spiroPhos complex catalyzed hydrogenation of a series of unsaturated sulfones has been developed. With Rh-( R, R)-f-spiroPhos catalyst under mild conditions, not only the asymmetric hydrogenation of both the 3,3-diaryl and exocyclic alpha,beta-unsaturated sulfones was first realized with up to 99.9% ee but also 3-alkyl-3-aryl and benzo[ b]thiophene-1,1-dioxides were successfully hydrogenated to the corresponding chiral sulfones with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99.4% ee) regardless of the steric hindrance, electronic property, and geometry of the substrates. Moreover, this reaction offers a route to ( S)-(+)- ar-turmerone as a spice flavor, which is an important synthetic intermediate of pharmaceuticals.",2
Protein Hydration Waters Are Susceptible to Unfavorable Perturbations.,"The interactions of a protein, its phase behavior, and, ultimately, its ability to function are all influenced by the interactions between the protein and its hydration waters. Here, we study proteins with a variety of sizes, shapes, chemistries, and biological functions and characterize their interactions with their hydration waters using molecular simulations and enhanced sampling techniques. We find that, akin to extended hydrophobic surfaces, proteins situate their hydration waters at the edge of a dewetting transition, making them susceptible to unfavorable perturbations. We also find that the strength of the unfavorable potential needed to trigger dewetting is roughly the same for all proteins studied here and depends primarily on the width of the hydration shell being perturbed. Our findings establish a framework for systematically classifying protein patches according to how favorably they interact with water.",2
Rhodium-Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydroamination of Allyl Amines.,"A Rh-catalyzed enantioselective hydroamination of allylamines using a chiral BIPHEP-type ligand is reported. Enantioenriched 1,2-diamines are formed in good yields and with excellent enantioselectivities. A diverse array of nucleophiles and amine directing groups are demonstrated, including deprotectable motifs. Finally, the methodology was demonstrated toward the rapid synthesis of 2-methyl-moclobemide.",2
Molecular Upconversion in Water in Heteropolynuclear Supramolecular Tb/Yb Assemblies.,"Piling up excited states to reach upconversion (UC) is severely restricted by vibrational quenching mechanisms, especially when one looks at discrete molecular entities in solution. By carefully controlling the supramolecular assembly processes resulting from the strong electrostatic interactions between negatively charged Yb complexes and Tb(3+) cations in aqueous solutions, we engineered the formation of heteropolynuclear complexes of [(YbL)2Tb x] compositions ( x = 1 and 2). These edifices display a phenomenon of cooperative photosensitization UC with green emission of the Tb cations upon NIR excitation at 980 nm in the Yb absorption band. The photophysical properties of the complexes were carefully investigated by steady-state and time-resolved luminescence experiments in D2O, allowing one to quantify the impact of the composition and pD of the solution on the emission intensity as well as clarifying the exact cooperative photosensitization upconversion mechanism. Using optimized conditions, the energy transfer UC process could be observed for the first time in nondeuterated water with discrete molecular compounds.",2
Hydrogen-Bond-Assisted Symmetry Breaking in a Network of Chiral Metal-Organic Assemblies.,"Herein we elucidate the interplay of chiral, chelate, solvent, and hydrogen-bonding information in the self-assembly of a series of new three-dimensional metal-organic architectures. Enantiopure ligands, each containing H-bond donors and acceptors, form different structures, depending on the ratio in which they are combined: enantiopure components form M4L4 assemblies, whereas racemic mixtures form M3L3 stacks. Chiral amplification within M3L3 enantiomers was observed when a 2:1 ratio of R and S subcomponent enantiomers was employed. Simply switching the solvent (from MeCN to MeOH) or chelating unit (from bidentate to tridentate) increased the diversity of structures that can be generated from these building blocks, leading to the selective formation of novel M2L2 and M3L2 assemblies. The addition of achiral ligand building blocks resulted in the formation of further structures: When an achiral subcomponent was combined with its R and S chiral congeners, a three-layer heteroleptic architecture was generated, with the achiral unit sitting at the top of the stack. When combined with the S enantiomer only, however, the achiral unit assembled in the center of the structure, thus demonstrating the selective placement of achiral units within chiral systems. Further sorting experiments revealed that combining R and S stereocenters within a single ligand led to diastereoselective product generation. These results show how geometric complementarity between different ligands impacts upon the degree of hydrogen-bonding within the assembly, stabilizing specific low-symmetry architectures from among many possible structural outcomes.",2
"Effect of MnO2 Crystal Structure on Aerobic Oxidation of 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5-Furandicarboxylic Acid.","Aerobic oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) as a bioplastics monomer is efficiently promoted by a simple system based on a nonprecious-metal catalyst of MnO2 and NaHCO3. Kinetic studies indicate that the oxidation of 5-formyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (FFCA) to FDCA is the slowest step for the aerobic oxidation of HMF to FDCA over activated MnO2. We demonstrate through combined computational and experimental studies that HMF oxidation to FDCA is largely dependent on the MnO2 crystal structure. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that vacancy formation energies at the planar oxygen sites in alpha- and gamma-MnO2 are higher than those at the bent oxygen sites. beta- and lambda-MnO2 consist of only planar and bent oxygen sites, respectively, with lower vacancy formation energies. Consequently, beta- and lambda-MnO2 are likely to be good candidates as oxidation catalysts. On the other hand, experimental studies reveal that the reaction rates per surface area for the slowest step (FFCA oxidation to FDCA) decrease in the order of beta-MnO2 > lambda-MnO2 > gamma-MnO2 approximately alpha-MnO2 > delta-MnO2 > epsilon-MnO2; the catalytic activity of beta-MnO2 exceeds that of the previously reported activated MnO2 by three times. The order is in good agreement not only with the DFT calculation results, but also with the reduction rates per surface area determined by the H2-temperature-programmed reduction measurements for MnO2 catalysts. The successful synthesis of high-surface-area beta-MnO2 significantly improves the catalytic activity for the aerobic oxidation of HMF to FDCA.",2
"Mechanistic Characterization of (Xantphos)Ni(I)-Mediated Alkyl Bromide Activation: Oxidative Addition, Electron Transfer, or Halogen-Atom Abstraction.","Ni(I)-mediated single-electron oxidative activation of alkyl halides has been extensively proposed as a key step in Ni-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions to generate radical intermediates. There are four mechanisms through which this step could take place: oxidative addition, outer-sphere electron transfer, inner-sphere electron transfer, and concerted halogen-atom abstraction. Despite considerable computational studies, there is no experimental study to evaluate all four pathways for Ni(I)-mediated alkyl radical formation. Herein, we report the isolation of a series of (Xantphos)Ni(I)-Ar complexes that selectively activate alkyl halides over aryl halides to eject radicals and form Ni(II) complexes. This observation allows the application of kinetic studies on the steric, electronic, and solvent effects, in combination with DFT calculations, to systematically assess the four possible pathways. Our data reveal that (Xantphos)Ni(I)-mediated alkyl halide activation proceeds via a concerted halogen-atom abstraction mechanism. This result corroborates previous DFT studies on (terpy)Ni(I)- and (py)Ni(I)-mediated alkyl radical formation, and contrasts with the outer-sphere electron transfer pathway observed for (PPh3)4Ni(0)-mediated aryl halide activation. This study of a model system provides insight into the overall mechanism of Ni-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions and offers a basis for differentiating electrophiles in cross-electrophile coupling reactions.",2
Guest Vapor-Induced State Change of Structural Liquid Pillar[6]arene.,"State change is a key phenomenon in materials science. We report the first observation of vapor-responsive reversible structural liquid-to-solid and solid-to-structural liquid state changes. We observed that a macrocyclic compound, a pillar[6]arene derivative bearing 12 n-hexyl substituents, is a room temperature structural liquid with unique properties. Formation of a host-guest complex between the pillar[6]arene cavity and the n-hexyl substituent results in a structural liquid with nanoscale structural heterogeneities. The structural liquid solidifies when exposed to competitive cyclohexane guest vapor, whereupon cyclohexane replaces the n-hexyl substituents in the pillar[6]arene cavity and the n-hexyl substituents located outside of the cavity crystallize into distinct nanolayer assemblies. The solid reverts back to the structural liquid when the cyclohexane guest is removed through heating under reduced pressure because of rethreading of the n-hexyl substituents into the cavity. The structural liquid-to-solid and solid-to-structural liquid changes are reversible through the uptake and release of cyclohexane guest vapor.",2
Ligand-Dependent Colloidal Stability Controls the Growth of Aluminum Nanocrystals.,"The precise size- and shape-controlled synthesis of monodisperse Al nanocrystals remains an open challenge, limiting their utility for numerous applications that would take advantage of their size and shape-dependent optical properties. Here we pursue a molecular-level understanding of the formation of Al nanocrystals by titanium(IV) isopropoxide-catalyzed decomposition of AlH3 in Lewis base solvents. As determined by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy of intermediates, the reaction begins with the formation of Ti(3+)-AlH3 complexes. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy indicates isopropoxy ligands are removed from Ti by Al, producing aluminum(III) isopropoxide and low-valent Ti(3+) catalysts. These Ti(3+) species catalyze elimination of H2 from AlH3 inducing the polymerization of AlH3 into colloidally unstable low-valent aluminum hydride clusters. These clusters coalesce and grow while expelling H2 to form colloidally stable Al nanocrystals. The colloidal stability of the Al nanocrystals and their size is determined by the molecular structure and density of coordinating atoms in the reaction, which is controlled by choice of solvent composition.",2
Genome-Mined Diels-Alderase Catalyzes Formation of the cis-Octahydrodecalins of Varicidin A and B.,"Pericyclases are an emerging family of enzymes catalyzing pericyclic reactions. A class of lipocalin-like enzymes recently characterized as Diels-Alderases (DAses) catalyze decalin formation through intramolecular Diels-Alder (IMDA) reactions between electron-rich dienes and electron-deficient dienophiles. Using this class of enzyme as a beacon for genome mining, we discovered a biosynthetic gene cluster from Penicillium variabile and identified that it encodes for the biosynthesis of varicidin A (1), a new antifungal natural product containing a cis-octahydrodecalin core. Biochemical analysis reveals a carboxylative deactivation strategy used in varicidin biosynthesis to suppress the nonenzymatic IMDA reaction of an early acyclic intermediate that favors trans-decalin formation. A P450 oxidizes the reactive intermediate to yield a relatively unreactive combination of an electron-deficient diene and an electron-deficient dienophile. The DAse PvhB catalyzes the final stage IMDA on the carboxylated intermediate to form the cis-decalin that is important for the antifungal activity.",2
Polyoxometalate-Cyclodextrin Metal-Organic Frameworks: From Tunable Structure to Customized Storage Functionality.,"Self-assembly allows structures to organize themselves into regular patterns by using local forces to find the lowest-energy configuration. However, assembling organic and inorganic building blocks in an ordered framework remains challenging due to difficulties in rationally interfacing two dissimilar materials. Herein, the ensemble of polyoxometalates (POMs) and cyclodextrins (CDs) as molecular building blocks (MBBs) has yielded two unprecedented POM-CD-MOFs, namely [PW12O40](3-) and alpha-CD MOF (POT-CD) as well as [P10Pd15.5O50](19-) and gamma-CD MOF (POP-CD), with distinct properties not shared by their isolated parent MBBs. Markedly, the POT-CD features a nontraditional enhanced Li storage behavior by virtue of a unique ""amorphization and pulverization"" process. This opens the door to a new generation of hybrid materials with tuned structures and customized functionalities.",2
Flexible Polymer-Assisted Mesoscale Self-Assembly of Colloidal CsPbBr3 Perovskite Nanocrystals into Higher Order Superstructures with Strong Inter-Nanocrystal Electronic Coupling.,"Surface-passivating ligands, although ubiquitous to colloidal nanocrystal (NC) syntheses, play a role in assembling NCs into higher order structures and hierarchical superstructures, which has not been demonstrated yet for colloidal CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) NCs. In this work, we report that functional poly(ethylene glycols) (PEG6-Y, Y = -COOH and -NH2) represent unique surface-passivating ligands enabling the synthesis of near-uniform CsPbBr3 NCs with diameters of 3.0 nm. The synthesized NCs are assembled into individual pearl necklaces, bundled pearl necklaces, lamellar, and nanorice superstructures, in situ. It is believed a variety of forces, including van der Waals attractions between hydrophilic PEG tails in a nonpolar solvent and dipole-dipole attraction between NCs, drive mesoscale assembly to form superstructures. Furthermore, postsynthetic ligand treatment strengthens the argument for polymer-assisted mesoscale assembly as pearl necklace assemblies can be successfully converted into either lamellar or nanorice structures. We observe an approximately 240 meV bathochromic shift in the lowest energy absorption peak of CsPbBr3 NCs when they are present in the lamellar and nanorice assemblies, representing strong inter-NC electronic coupling. Moreover, pearl necklace structures are spontaneously assembled into micrometer length scale twisted ribbon hierarchical superstructures during storage of colloidal CsPbBr3 NCs. The results show that the self-assembled superstructures of CsPbBr3 NCs are now feasible to prepare via template-free synthesis, as self-assembled structures emerge in the bulk solvent, a process that mimics biological systems except for the use of nonbiological surface ligands (PEG6-Y). Taken together, emergent optoelectronic properties and higher order superstructures of CsPbBr3 NCs should aid their potential use in solid-state devices and simplify scalable manufacturing.",2
Amorphous-Phase-Mediated Crystallization of Ni Nanocrystals Revealed by High-Resolution Liquid-Phase Electron Microscopy.,"Nonclassical features of crystallization in solution have been recently identified both experimentally and theoretically. In particular, an amorphous-phase-mediated pathway is found in various crystallization systems as an important route, different from the classical nucleation and growth model. Here, we utilize high-resolution in situ transmission electron microscopy with graphene liquid cells to study amorphous-phase-mediated formation of Ni nanocrystals. An amorphous phase is precipitated in the initial stage of the reaction. Within the amorphous particles, crystalline domains nucleate and eventually form nanocrystals. In addition, unique crystallization behaviors, such as formation of multiple domains and dislocation relaxation, are observed in amorphous-phase-mediated crystallization. Theoretical calculations confirm that surface interactions can induce amorphous precipitation of metal precursors, which is analogous to the surface-induced amorphous-to-crystalline transformation occurring in biomineralization. Our results imply that an unexplored nonclassical growth mechanism is important for the formation of nanocrystals.",2
"Coordination-Driven Self-Assembled Metallacycles Incorporating Pyrene: Fluorescence Mutability, Tunability, and Aromatic Amine Sensing.","Constructing polycyclic aromatics-based, highly emissive fluorophores with good solubility and tunable aggregated structures and properties is of great importance for film fabrication, solution processing, and relevant functionality studies. Herein, we describe a general strategy to endow conventional organic fluorophores with enhanced solubility and modulated fluorescent properties via their incorporation into coordination-driven self-assembled metallacycles. A widely used fluorophore, pyrene, was decorated with two pyridyl groups to yield functionalized pyrene 4. Mixing 4 with three aromatic dicarboxylates with different lengths and a 90 degrees Pt(II) metal acceptor in a 2:2:4 stoichiometric ratio resulted in the formation of three metallacycles, 1, 2, and 3. The metallacycles display good solubility in polar organic solvents, highly aggregation-dependent fluorescence, and size-dependent emissions at higher concentrations. Moreover, metallacycle 2-based, silica-gel-supported film as fabricated not only is more emissive than the ligand 4-based one but also displays much improved sensing properties for amines in the vapor state, as demonstrated by significantly increased response speed and decreased recovery time. The enhanced solubility, unique fluorescence behavior, and multi-factor modulation character show that coordination-driven self-assembly can be utilized for the development of new fluorophores through simple modification of conventional fluorophores. The fluorophores synthesized this way possess not only complex topological structures but also good modularity and tunability in fluorescence behavior, which are important for grafting multi-stage energy-transfer systems necessary for the development of high-performance sensing materials.",2
Toward Long-Term Stability: Single-Crystal Alloys of Cesium-Containing Mixed Cation and Mixed Halide Perovskite.,"Perovskite solar cells are strong competitors for silicon-based ones, but suffer from poor long-term stability, for which the intrinsic stability of perovskite materials is of primary concern. Herein, we prepared a series of well-defined cesium-containing mixed cation and mixed halide perovskite single-crystal alloys, which enabled systematic investigations on their structural stabilities against light, heat, water, and oxygen. Two potential phase separation processes are evidenced for the alloys as the cesium content increases to 10% and/or bromide to 15%. Eventually, a highly stable new composition, (FAPbI3)0.9(MAPbBr3)0.05(CsPbBr3)0.05, emerges with a carrier lifetime of 16 mus. It remains stable during at least 10000 h water-oxygen and 1000 h light stability tests, which is very promising for long-term stable devices with high efficiency. The mechanism for the enhanced stability is elucidated through detailed single-crystal structure analysis. Our work provides a single-crystal-based paradigm for stability investigation, leading to the discovery of stable new perovskite materials.",2
Two-Dimensional PC6 with Direct Band Gap and Anisotropic Carrier Mobility.,"Graphene and phosphorene are two major types of atomically thin two-dimensional materials under extensive investigation. However, the zero band gap of graphene and the instability of phosphorene greatly restrict their applications. Here, we make first-principle unbiased structure search calculations to identify a new buckled graphene-like PC6 monolayer with a number of desirable functional properties. The PC6 monolayer is a direct-gap semiconductor with a band gap of 0.84 eV, and it has an extremely high intrinsic conductivity with anisotropic character (i.e., its electron mobility is 2.94 x 10(5) cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) along the armchair direction, whereas the hole mobility reaches 1.64 x 10(5) cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) along the zigzag direction), which is comparable to that of graphene. On the other hand, PC6 shows a high absorption coefficient (10(5) cm(-1)) in a broad band, from 300 to 2000 nm. Additionally, its direct band gap character can remain within a biaxial strain of 5%. All these appealing properties make the predicted PC6 monolayer a promising candidate for applications in electronic and photovoltaic devices.",2
Genetically Encoded Cholesterol-Modified Polypeptides.,"Biological systems use post-translational modifications (PTMs) to control the structure, location, and function of proteins after expression. Despite the ubiquity of PTMs in biology, their use to create genetically encoded recombinant biomaterials is limited. We have utilized a natural lipidation PTM (hedgehog-mediated cholesterol modification of proteins) to create a class of hybrid biomaterials called cholesterol-modified polypeptides (CHaMPs) that exhibit programmable self-assembly at the nanoscale. To demonstrate the biomedical utility of CHaMPs, we used this approach to append cholesterol to biologically active peptide exendin-4 that is an approved drug for the treatment of type II diabetes. The exendin-cholesterol conjugate self-assembled into micelles, and these micelles activate the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor with a potency comparable to that of current gold standard treatments.",2
Switchable Schottky Contacts: Simultaneously Enhanced Output Current and Reduced Leakage Current.,"Metal-semiconductor contacts are key components of nanoelectronics and atomic-scale integrated circuits. In these components Schottky diodes provide a low forward voltage and a very fast switching rate but suffer the drawback of a high reverse leakage current. Improvement of the reverse bias characteristics without degrading performance of the diode at positive voltages is deemed physically impossible for conventional silicon-based Schottky diodes. However, in this work we propose that this design challenge can be overcome in the organic-based diodes by utilizing reversible transitions between distinct adsorption states of organic molecules on metal surfaces. Motivated by previous experimental observations of controllable adsorption conformations of anthradithiophene on Cu(111), herein we use density functional theory simulations to demonstrate the distinct Schottky barrier heights of the two adsorption states. The higher Schottky barrier of the reverse bias induced by a chemisorbed state results in low leakage current, while the lower barrier of the forward bias induced by a physisorbed state yields a larger output current. The rectifying behaviors are further supported by nonequilibrium Green's function transport calculations.",2
Neighboring Protonation Unveils Lewis Acidity in the B3NO2 Heterocycle.,"Boron serves a distinctive role in a broad range of chemistry disciplines. The utility of the element lies in its Lewis acidity, and thus, it is crucial to understand the properties of the boron atom in chemically different contexts. Herein, a combination of experiments and computations reveals the nuanced nature of boron in direct amidation reactions catalyzed by recently disclosed 1,3-dioxa-5-aza-2,4,6-triborinanes (DATBs). The most active DATB catalyst has been shown to bear an azaborine ring in its structure, thus having four boron atoms in a single molecule. Three chemically distinct boron atoms in the catalyst framework have been shown to serve different roles in the catalytic cycle, depending on their innate Lewis acidity. More specifically, the most Lewis acidic boron interacts with the amine, whereas the two boron atoms in the B-N-B substructure acquire Lewis acidity only upon protonation of the center nitrogen atom. Furthermore, although the least acidic boron atom in the azaborine ring did not act as a Lewis acid, it still plays an important role in the catalytic cycle by forming a hydrogen bond between carboxylic acid and the B-OH moiety. The mechanistic insights obtained from this study not only extend the knowledge on catalytic direct amidation but also provide a guiding principle for the further exploration of multi-boron compounds.",2
Isotope Labeling Reveals Fast Atomic and Molecular Exchange in Mechanochemical Milling Reactions.,"Using tandem in situ monitoring and isotope-labeled solids, we reveal that mechanochemical ball-milling overcomes inherently slow solid-state diffusion through continuous comminution and growth of milled particles. This process occurs with or without a net chemical reaction and also occurs between solids and liquid additives that can be practically used for highly efficient deuterium labeling of solids. The presented findings reveal a fundamental aspect of milling reactions and also delineate a methodology that should be considered in the study of mechanochemical reaction mechanisms.",2
Germanium Fluoride Nanocages as Optically Transparent n-Type Materials and Their Endohedral Metallofullerene Derivatives.,"Carbon- and silicon-based n-type materials tend to suffer from instability of the corresponding radical anions. With DFT calculations, we explore a promising route to overcome such challenges with molecular nanocages which utilize the heavier element Ge. The addition of fluorine substituents creates large electron affinities in the range 2.5-5.5 eV and HOMO-LUMO gaps between 1.6 and 3.2 eV. The LUMOs envelop the surfaces of these structures, suggesting extensive delocalization of injected electrons, analogous to fullerene acceptors. Moreover, these Ge nF n inorganic cages are found to be transparent in the UV-visible region as probed with their excited states. Their capacitance, linear polarizabilities, and dielectric constants are computed and found to be on the same order of magnitude as saturated oligomers and some extended pi-organics (azobenzenes). Furthermore, we explore fullerene-type endohedral isomers, i.e., cages with internal substituents or guest atoms, and find them to be more stable than the parent exohedral isomers by up to -206.45 kcal mol(-1). We also consider the addition of Li, He, Cs, and Bi, to probe the utility of the exo/ endo cages as host-guest systems. The endohedral He/Li@F8@Ge60F52 cages are significantly more stable than their parent exohedral isomers He/Li@Ge60F52 by -182.46 and -49.22 kcal mol(-1), respectively. The energy of formation of endohedral He@F8@Ge60F52 is exothermic by -10.4 kcal mol(-1), while Cs and Bi guests are too large to be accommodated but are stable in the exohedral parent cages. Conceivable applications of these materials include n-type semiconductors and transparent electrodes, with potential for novel energy storage modalities.",2
Facile Synthesis of Stable and Highly Luminescent Methylammonium Lead Halide Nanocrystals for Efficient Light Emitting Devices.,"Metal halide perovskites are promising candidates for use in light emitting diodes (LEDs), due to their potential for color tunable and high luminescence efficiency. While recent advances in perovskite-based light emitting diodes have resulted in external quantum efficiencies exceeding 12.4% for the green emitters, and infrared emitters based on 3 D/2D mixed dimensional perovskites have exceeded 20%, the external quantum efficiencies of the red and blue emitters still lag behind. A critical issue to date is creating highly emissive and stable perovskite emitters with the desirable emission band gap to achieve full-color displays and white LEDs. Herein, we report the preparation and characterization of a highly luminescent and stable suspension of cubic-shaped methylammonium lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3) perovskite nanocrystals, where we synthesize the nanocrystals via a ligand-assisted reprecipitation technique, using an acetonitrile/methylamine compound solvent system to solvate the ions and toluene as the antisolvent to induce crystallization. Through tuning the ratio of the ligands, the ligand to toluene ratio, and the temperature of the toluene, we obtain a solution of CH3NH3PbI3 nanocrystals with a photoluminescence quantum yield exceeding 93% and tunable emission between 660 and 705 nm. We also achieved red emission at 635 nm by blending the nanocrystals with bromide salt and obtained perovskite-based light emitting diodes with maximum electroluminescent external quantum efficiency of 2.75%.",2
Statistical Analysis of Nonuniform Volume Distributions for Droplet-Based Digital PCR Assays.,"We present a method to determine the concentration of nucleic acids in a sample by partitioning it into droplets with a nonuniform volume distribution. This digital PCR method requires no special equipment for partitioning, unlike other methods that require nearly identical volumes. Droplets are generated by vortexing a sample in an immiscible oil to create an emulsion. PCR is performed, and droplets in the emulsion are imaged. Droplets with one or more copies of a nucleic acid are identified, and the nucleic acid concentration of the sample is determined. Numerical simulations of droplet distributions were used to estimate measurement error and dynamic range and to examine the effects of the total volume of droplets imaged and the shape of the droplet size distribution on measurement accuracy. The ability of the method to resolve 1.5- and 3-fold differences in concentration was assessed by using simulations of statistical power. The method was validated experimentally; droplet shrinkage and fusion during amplification were also assessed experimentally and showed negligible effects on measured concentration.",2
"High-Precision Electrochemical Measurements of the Guanine-, Mismatch-, and Length-Dependence of Electron Transfer from Electrode-Bound DNA Are Consistent with a Contact-Mediated Mechanism.","Despite 25 years' effort, serious questions remain regarding the mechanism(s) underlying electron transfer through (or from) electrode-bound double-stranded DNA. In part this is because a control experiment regarding the putatively critical role of guanine bases in the most widely proposed transport mechanism (hopping from guanine to guanine through the pi-stack) appears to be lacking from the prior literature. In response, we have employed chronoamperometry, which allows for high-precision determination of electron transfer rates, to characterize transfer to a redox reporter appended onto electrode-bound DNA duplexes. Specifically, we have measured the effects of guanines and base mismatches on the electron transfer rate associated with such constructs. Upon doing so, we find that, counter to prior reports, the transfer rate is, to within relatively tight experimental confidence intervals, unaffected by either. Parallel studies of the dependence of the electron transfer rate on the length of the DNA suggest that transfer from this system obeys a ""collision"" mechanism in which the redox reporter physically contacts the electrode surface prior to the exchange of electrons.",2
Direct Carbon Isotope Exchange through Decarboxylative Carboxylation.,A two-step degradation-reconstruction approach to the carbon-14 radiolabeling of alkyl carboxylic acids is presented. Simple activation via redox-active ester formation was followed by nickel-mediated decarboxylative carboxylation to afford a range of complex compounds with ample isotopic incorporations for drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic studies. The practicality and operational simplicity of the protocol were demonstrated by its use in an industrial carbon-14 radiolabeling setting.,2
Generalized Preparation of Two-Dimensional Quasi-nanosheets via Self-assembly of Nanoparticles.,"Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials are attracting increasing research interest because of their unique properties and promising applications. Here, we report a facile method to manipulate the assembly of nanoparticles (NPs) to fabricate free-standing 2D quasi-nanosheets. The as-generated 2D products are composed of few-layer NPs; that is, their thicknesses are only tens of nanometers but lateral dimensions could be up to several micrometers. Therefore, the novel structure was denoted as 2D ""quasi-nanosheets (QNS)"". Specifically, several types of building blocks could be assembled into 2D unary, binary, ternary, and even quaternary QNS by a universal procedure. The entire assembly process is carried out in solution and mediated simply by tuning the concentration of ligands surrounding the NPs. In contrast to traditional assembly techniques, even without any substrate or template, these QNS showed exceptionally high stability. They can remain intact for several days without any disassembly regardless of the solvent environment (e.g., water, ethanol, methanol, and hexane). In general, our method has effectively tackled several limitations associated with traditional assembly techniques and allows more freedom in manipulating assembly of NPs, which may hold great potential for future fabrication of 2D devices with rich functionalities.",2
Flexizyme-Enabled Benchtop Biosynthesis of Thiopeptides.,"Thiopeptides are natural antibiotics that are fashioned from short peptides by multiple layers of post-translational modification. Their biosynthesis, in particular the pyridine synthases that form the macrocyclic antibiotic core, has attracted intensive research but is complicated by the challenges of reconstituting multiple-pathway enzymes. By combining select RiPP enzymes with cell free expression and flexizyme-based codon reprogramming, we have developed a benchtop biosynthesis of thiopeptide scaffolds. This strategy side-steps several challenges related to the investigation of thiopeptide enzymes and allows access to analytical quantities of new thiopeptide analogs. We further demonstrate that this strategy can be used to validate the activity of new pyridine synthases without the need to reconstitute the cognate prior pathway enzymes.",2
Lead-Halide Perovskites for Photocatalytic alpha-Alkylation of Aldehydes.,"Cost-effective and efficient photocatalysis are highly desirable in chemical synthesis. Here we demonstrate that readily prepared suspensions of APbBr3 (A = Cs or methylammonium (MA)) type perovskite colloids (ca. 2-100 nm) can selectively photocatalyze carbon-carbon bond formation reactions, i.e., alpha-alkylations. Specifically, we demonstrate alpha-alkylation of aldehydes with a turnover number (TON) of over 52,000 under visible light illumination. Hybrid organic/inorganic perovskites are revolutionizing photovoltaic research and are now impacting other research fields, but their exploration in organic synthesis is rare. Our low-cost, easy-to-process, highly efficient and bandedge-tunable perovskite photocatalyst is expected to bring new insights in chemical synthesis.",2
Molecular Characteristics of DNA-Alkylating PI Polyamides Targeting RUNX Transcription Factors.,"The runt-related transcription factor (RUNX) family has been associated with cancer development. The binding of RUNX family members to specific DNA sequences is hypothesized to promote the expression of downstream genes and cause cancer proliferation. On the basis of this proposed mechanism of cancer growth, we developed conjugate 1, which inhibits the binding of RUNX to its target DNA. Conjugate 1 is a DNA-alkylating pyrrole-imidazole (PI) polyamide conjugate containing chlorambucil as an anticancer agent. Conjugate 1 was reported to have a marked anticancer effect in mouse models of acute myeloid leukemia. Although the effectiveness of 1 has been demonstrated in vivo, the detailed mechanism by which it alkylates DNA is unknown. Here, we chemically elucidated the molecular characteristics of conjugate 1 to confirm its potential as a RUNX-inhibiting drug. We also generated an alternative conjugate 2, which targets the same DNA sequence, by replacing one pyrrole with beta-alanine. Comparison of the characteristics of conjugates 1 and 2 suggested that reaction selectivity and binding affinity to the RUNX-binding sequence were improved by the introduction of beta-alanine. These findings indicate the possibility of DNA-alkylating PI polyamides as candidates for cancer chemotherapeutics.",2
Mechanistic Study of Ruthenium-Catalyzed C-H Hydroxylation Reveals an Unexpected Pathway for Catalyst Arrest.,"We have recently disclosed [(dtbpy)2RuCl2] as an effective precatalyst for chemoselective C-H hydroxylation of C(sp(3))-H bonds and have noted a marked disparity in reaction performance between 4,4'-di- tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine (dtbpy)- and 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy)-derived complexes. A desire to understand the origin of this difference and to further advance this catalytic method has motivated the comprehensive mechanistic investigation described herein. Details of this reaction have been unveiled through evaluation of ligand structure-activity relationships, electrochemical and kinetic studies, and pressurized sample infusion high-resolution mass spectrometry (PSI-MS). Salient findings from this investigation include the identification of more than one active oxidant and three disparate mechanisms for catalyst decomposition/arrest. Catalyst efficiency, as measured by turnover number, has a strong inverse correlation with the rate and extent of ligand dissociation, which is dependent on the identity of bipyridyl 4,4'-substituent groups. Dissociated bipyridyl ligand is oxidized to mono- and bis- N-oxide species under the reaction conditions, the former of which is found to act as a potent catalyst poison, yielding a catalytically inactive tris-ligated [Ru(dtbpy)2(dtbpy N-oxide)](2+) complex. Insights gained through this work highlight the power of PSI-MS for studies of complex reaction processes and are guiding ongoing efforts to develop high-performance, next-generation catalyst systems for C-H hydroxylation.",2
Structural Determination and Nonlinear Optical Properties of New 1T'''-Type MoS2 Compound.,"Noncentrosymmetric MoS2 semiconductors (1H, 3R) possess not only novel electronic structures of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and valley polarization but also remarkable nonlinear optical effects. A more interesting noncentrosymmetric structure, the so-called 1T'''-MoS2 layers, was predicted to be built up from [MoS6] octahedral motifs by theoreticians, but the bulk 1T''' MoS2 or its single crystal structure has not been reported yet. Here, we have successfully harvested 1T''' MoS2 single crystals by a topochemical method. The new layered structure is determined from single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The crystal crystallizes in space group P31m with a cell of a = b = 5.580(2) A and c = 5.957(2) A, which is a radical3 a x radical3 a superstructure of 1T MoS2 with corner-sharing Mo3 triangular trimers observed by the STEM. 1T''' MoS2 is verified to be semiconducting and possesses a band gap of 0.65 eV, different from metallic nature of 1T or 1T' MoS2. More surprisingly, the 1T''' MoS2 does show strong optical second-harmonic generation signals. This work provides the first layered noncentrosymmetric semiconductor of edge-sharing MoS6 octahedra for the research of nonlinear optics.",2
Biocatalytic N-Alkylation of Amines Using Either Primary Alcohols or Carboxylic Acids via Reductive Aminase Cascades.,"The alkylation of amines with either alcohols or carboxylic acids represents a mild and safe alternative to the use of genotoxic alkyl halides and sulfonate esters. Here we report two complementary one-pot systems in which the reductive aminase (RedAm) from Aspergillus oryzae is combined with either (i) a 1 degrees alcohol/alcohol oxidase (AO) or (ii) carboxylic acid/carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) to affect N-alkylation reactions. The application of both approaches has been exemplified with respect to substrate scope and also preparative scale synthesis. These new biocatalytic methods address issues facing alternative traditional synthetic protocols such as harsh conditions, overalkylation and complicated workup procedures.",2
Nitrosyl Linkage Isomers: NO Coupling to N2O at a Mononuclear Site.,"Linkage isomers of reduced metal-nitrosyl complexes serve as key species in nitric oxide (NO) reduction at monometallic sites to produce nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas. While factors leading to extremely rare side-on nitrosyls are unclear, we describe a pair of nickel-nitrosyl linkage isomers through controlled tuning of noncovalent interactions between the nitrosyl ligands and differently encapsulated potassium cations. Furthermore, these reduced metal-nitrosyl species with N-centered spin density undergo radical coupling with free NO and provide a N-N coupled cis-hyponitrite intermediate whose protonation triggers the release of N2O. This report outlines a stepwise molecular mechanism of NO reduction to form N2O at a mononuclear metal site that provides insight into the related biological reduction of NO to N2O.",2
DNA Intercalation Facilitates Efficient DNA-Targeted Covalent Binding of Phenanthriplatin.,"Phenanthriplatin, a monofunctional anticancer agent derived from cisplatin, shows significantly more rapid DNA covalent-binding activity compared to its parent complex. To understand the underlying molecular mechanism, we used single-molecule studies with optical tweezers to probe the kinetics of DNA-phenanthriplatin binding as well as DNA binding to several control complexes. The time-dependent extensions of single lambda-DNA molecules were monitored at constant applied forces and compound concentrations, followed by rinsing with a compound-free solution. DNA-phenanthriplatin association consisted of fast and reversible DNA lengthening with time constant tau approximately 10 s, followed by slow and irreversible DNA elongation that reached equilibrium in approximately 30 min. In contrast, only reversible fast DNA elongation occured for its stereoisomer trans-phenanthriplatin, suggesting that the distinct two-rate kinetics of phenanthriplatin is sensitive to the geometric conformation of the complex. Furthermore, no DNA unwinding was observed for pyriplatin, in which the phenanthridine ligand of phenanthriplatin is replaced by the smaller pyridine molecule, indicating that the size of the aromatic group is responsible for the rapid DNA elongation. These findings suggest that the mechanism of binding of phenanthriplatin to DNA involves rapid, partial intercalation of the phenanthridine ring followed by slower substitution of the adjacent chloride ligand by, most likely, the N7 atom of a purine base. The cis isomer affords the proper stereochemistry at the metal center to facilitate essentially irreversible DNA covalent binding, a geometric advantage not afforded by trans-phenanthriplatin. This study demonstrates that reversible DNA intercalation provides a robust transition state that is efficiently converted to an irreversible DNA-Pt bound state.",2
Investigating the Role of Ligand Electronics on Stabilizing Electrocatalytically Relevant Low-Valent Co(I) Intermediates.,"Cobalt complexes have shown great promise as electrocatalysts in applications ranging from hydrogen evolution to C-H functionalization. However, the use of such complexes often requires polydentate, bulky ligands to stabilize the catalytically active Co(I) oxidation state from deleterious disproportionation reactions to enable the desired reactivity. Herein, we describe the use of bidentate electronically asymmetric ligands as an alternative approach to stabilizing transient Co(I) species. Using disproportionation rates of electrochemically generated Co(I) complexes as a model for stability, we measured the relative stability of complexes prepared with a series of N, N-bidentate ligands. While the stability of Co(I)Cl complexes demonstrates a correlation with experimentally measured thermodynamic properties, consistent with an outer-sphere electron transfer process, the set of ligated Co(I)Br complexes evaluated was found to be preferentially stabilized by electronically asymmetric ligands, demonstrating an alternative disproportionation mechanism. These results allow a greater understanding of the fundamental processes involved in the disproportionation of organometallic complexes and have allowed the identification of cobalt complexes that show promise for the development of novel electrocatalytic reactions.",2
Highly Ordered Polypeptide with UCST Phase Separation Behavior.,"Manipulating phase separation structures of thermoresponsive polymers will enhance the usefulness of structure-controllable materials in fields such as drug delivery and tissue engineering. However, behaviors of upper critical solution temperature (UCST) have been less investigated so far, despite the importance of UCST. Here, we examined two citrulline-based polypeptides, poly(d-ornithine- co-d-citrulline) (PdOC) and poly(dl-ornithine- co-dl-citrulline) (PdlOC), to investigate how stereoregularity of the polypeptides influences UCST behavior, in addition to poly(l-ornithine- co-l-citrulline) (PlOC) previously studied. Homochiral PlOC and PdOC showed phase separation temperatures ( Tps) higher than that of racemic PdlOC. Moreover, PdlOC underwent liquid to coacervate phase separation at Tp, whereas PlOC and PdOC underwent liquid to solid-like aggregation transitions. From a structural point of view, circular dichroism and small-angle X-ray scattering measurements revealed that homochiral PlOC and PdOC polypeptides formed alpha-helical structures and assembled into a regular hexagonal lattice upon phase separation. Interactions between the pendent ureido groups of homochiral POCs appear to play pivotal roles in helical folding and assembly into the hexagonal structure. In addition, Tp change in response to biodegradation was confirmed for both PlOC and PdlOC. The biodegradability was considerably influenced by phase-separated structures. These findings of UCST-type POCs in this study would provide important insights into structure-controllable and thermoresponsive biomaterials.",2
"Welding Metallophthalocyanines into Bimetallic Molecular Meshes for Ultrasensitive, Low-Power Chemiresistive Detection of Gases.","This paper describes the first demonstration of using a series of isoreticular nickel phthalocyanine- and nickel naphthalocyanine-based bimetallic conductive two-dimensional (2D) metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as active materials in chemiresistive sensing of gases. Devices achieve exceptional sensitivity at sub-part-per-million (ppm) to part-per-billion (ppb) detection limits toward NH3 (0.31-0.33 ppm), H2S (19-32 ppb), and NO (1.0-1.1 ppb) at low driving voltages (0.01-1.0 V) within 1.5 min of exposure. The devices maintain their performance in the presence of humidity (5000 ppm of H2O). The isoreticular analogs enable modular control over selectivity and sensitivity in gas sensing through different combinations of linkers and metal nodes. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies suggest that the chemiresistive response of the MOFs involves charge transfer interactions triggered by the analytes adsorbed on MOFs.",2
Catalytic Carbonyl-Olefin Metathesis of Aliphatic Ketones: Iron(III) Homo-Dimers as Lewis Acidic Superelectrophiles.,"Catalytic carbonyl-olefin metathesis reactions have recently been developed as a powerful tool for carbon-carbon bond formation. However, currently available synthetic protocols rely exclusively on aryl ketone substrates while the corresponding aliphatic analogs remain elusive. We herein report the development of Lewis acid-catalyzed carbonyl-olefin ring-closing metathesis reactions for aliphatic ketones. Mechanistic investigations are consistent with a distinct mode of activation relying on the in situ formation of a homobimetallic singly bridged iron(III)-dimer as the postulated active catalytic species. These ""superelectrophiles"" function as more powerful Lewis acid catalysts that form upon association of individual iron(III)-monomers. While this mode of Lewis acid activation has previously been postulated to exist, it has not yet been applied in a catalytic setting. The insights presented are expected to enable further advancement in Lewis acid catalysis by building upon the activation principle of ""superelectrophiles"" and to broaden the current scope of catalytic carbonyl-olefin metathesis reactions.",2
Neutral Au1-Doped Cluster Catalysts AuTi2O3-6 for CO Oxidation by O2.,"Oxide supported gold catalysts (e.g., Au/TiO2) are of great significance in heterogeneous catalysis owing to their extraordinary catalytic activity. Study of heteronuclear metal oxide clusters (HMOCs, e.g., Au xTi yO z (q)) is an important way to uncover the molecular-level mechanisms of gold catalysis in the related heterogeneous catalytic systems. However, the current studies of HMOCs are focused on charged clusters with little attention paid to neutral species. The reactivity study of neutral HMOCs is vital to have a comprehensive understanding of heterogeneous catalysis, but it is experimentally challenging because of the difficulty of cluster ionization and detection without fragmentation. Herein, benefiting from a homemade time-of-flight mass spectrometer coupled with a vacuum ultraviolet laser system, the reactivity of neutral Au1-doped titanium oxide clusters AuTi2O3-6 in catalytic CO oxidation by O2 has been successfully identified. The mechanistic details of the catalysis have been elucidated by quantum chemistry calculations. The crucial roles of the mobile AuCO species that can facilitate not only the process of CO oxidation but also the process of O2 activation have been discovered in the cluster catalysis. The fascinating results are of substantial importance to understand the mechanisms of CO oxidation over Au/TiO2, one type of the best studied gold catalysts.",2
Supramolecular Control of Azobenzene Switching on Nanoparticles.,"The reversible photoisomerization of azobenzene has been utilized to construct a plethora of systems in which optical, electronic, catalytic, and other properties can be controlled by light. However, owing to azobenzene's hydrophobic nature, most of these examples have been realized only in organic solvents, and systems operating in water are relatively scarce. Here, we show that by coadsorbing the inherently hydrophobic azobenzenes with water-solubilizing ligands on the same nanoparticulate platforms, it is possible to render them essentially water-soluble. To this end, we developed a modified nanoparticle functionalization procedure allowing us to precisely fine-tune the amount of azobenzene on the functionalized nanoparticles. Molecular dynamics simulations helped us to identify two distinct supramolecular architectures (depending on the length of the background ligand) on these nanoparticles, which can explain their excellent aqueous solubilities. Azobenzenes adsorbed on these water-soluble nanoparticles exhibit highly reversible photoisomerization upon exposure to UV and visible light. Importantly, the mixed-monolayer approach allowed us to systematically investigate how the background ligand affects the switching properties of azobenzene. We found that the nature of the background ligand has a profound effect on the kinetics of azobenzene switching. For example, a hydroxy-terminated background ligand is capable of accelerating the back-isomerization reaction by more than 6000-fold. These results pave the way toward the development of novel light-responsive nanomaterials operating in aqueous media and, in the long run, in biological environments.",2
"Exploring the Cytotoxicity, Uptake, Cellular Response, and Proteomics of Mono- and Dinuclear DNA Light-Switch Complexes.","Drug resistance to platinum chemotherapeutics targeting DNA often involves abrogation of apoptosis and has emerged as a significant challenge in modern, non-targeted chemotherapy. Consequently, there is great interest in the anti-cancer properties of metal complexes-particularly those that interact with DNA-and mechanisms of consequent cell death. Herein we compare a parent cytotoxic complex, [Ru(phen)2(tpphz)](2+) [phen = 1,10-phenanthroline, tpphz = tetrapyridyl[3,2- a:2',3'- c:3'',2''- h:2''',3'''- j]phenazine], with a mononuclear analogue with a modified intercalating ligand, [Ru(phen)2(taptp)](2+) [taptp = 4,5,9,18-tetraazaphenanthreno[9,10- b] triphenylene], and two structurally related dinuclear, tpphz-bridged, heterometallic complexes, RuRe and RuPt. All three of these structural changes result in a switch from intercalation to groove-binding DNA interaction and concomitant reduction in cytotoxic potency, but no significant change in relative cytotoxicity toward platinum-resistant A2780CIS cancer cells, indicating that the DNA interaction mode is not critical for the mechanism of platinum resistance. All variants exhibited a light-switch effect, which for the first time was exploited to investigate timing of cell death by live-cell microscopy. Surprisingly, cell death occurred rapidly as a consequence of oncosis, characterized by loss of cytoplasmic volume control, absence of significant mitochondrial membrane potential loss, and lack of activation of apoptotic cell death markers. Importantly, a novel, quantitative proteomic analysis of the A2780 cell genome following exposure of the cells to either mononuclear complex reveals changes in protein expression associated with global cell responses to oxidative stress and DNA replication/repair cellular pathways. This combination of multiple targeting modalities and induction of a non-apoptotic death mechanism makes these complexes highly promising chemotherapeutic cytotoxicity leads.",2
Chemical Formation and Multiple Applications of Organic-Inorganic Hybrid Perovskite Materials.,"Lead halide based organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite (HPVK) materials combine the advantages of solution processing, high absorption coefficient, long charge diffusion length, and high mobility of inorganic framework. The recent interest in this field is mainly focused on solution-processable HPVK for energy conversion and different types of optoelectronics. The performance of HPVK optoelectronics is rivaling now that of conventional devices, but the stability of the HPVK device is now a major challenge in the field where chemists are expected to play more active roles. This Perspective summarizes the progress in the understanding of mechanism of the HPVK formation, and various applications in different fields such as solar cells, light-emitting diodes, lasers, photodetectors, and field-effect transistors. A personal view of the past developments and future challenges is also provided.",2
Chemistry for Covalent Modification of Endogenous/Native Proteins: From Test Tubes to Complex Biological Systems.,"Chemical modification of proteins provides powerful tools to realize a broad range of exciting biological applications, including the development of new classes of biopharmaceuticals and functional studies of individual proteins in complex biological systems. Numerous strategies for linking desired chemical probes with target proteins have been developed in the last two decades, with most exploiting genetic protein engineering and/or bio-orthogonal chemistry that utilizes unnatural amino acids incorporated into proteins. Modification of native proteins in test tubes and biological contexts by site-specific and target-selective approaches remains challenging because appropriate organic chemistry to carry out such modifications is currently limited. Nonetheless, a variety of promising strategies have appeared recently that address this grand challenge in chemical biology. These new chemistries yield native protein-based well-defined bioconjugations, specific labeling of endogenous proteins in various biological crude milieus, and the establishment of chemical proteomics as a new research area in protein science. In this Perspective, we focus on recent remarkable progress in chemistry for native protein modification. We survey chemical characteristics of the methods and describe briefly these advanced applications to address unsolved biological issues. Current limitations and future directions of this research field are also discussed.",2
Strong Phonon-Phonon Interactions Securing Extraordinary Thermoelectric Ge1- xSb xTe with Zn-Alloying-Induced Band Alignment.,"The ability of substitution atoms to decrease thermal conductivity is usually ascribed to the enhanced phonon-impurity scattering by assuming the original phonon dispersion relations. In this study, we find that 10% SbGe alloying in GeTe modifies the phonon dispersions significantly, closes the acoustic-optical phonon band gap, increases the phonon-phonon scattering rates, and reduces the phonon group velocities. These changes, together with grain boundaries, nanoprecipitates, and planar vacancies, lead to a significant decrease in the lattice thermal conductivity. In addition, an extra 2-6% Zn alloying decreases the energy offset between valence band edges at L and Sigma points in Ge1- xSb xTe that is found to be induced by the Ge 4s(2) lone pairs. Since Zn is free of s(2) lone pair electrons, substituting Ge with Zn atoms can consequently diminish the Ge 4s(2) lone-pair characters and reduce the energy offset, resulting in two energetically merged valence band maxima. The refined band structures render a power factor up to 40 muW cm(-1) K(-2) in Ge0.86Sb0.1Zn0.04Te. Ultimately, a superhigh zT of 2.2 is achieved. This study clarifies the impacts of high-concentration substitutional atoms on phonon band structure, phonon-phonon scattering rates, and the convergence of electron valence band edges, which could provide guidelines for developing high-performance thermoelectric materials.",2
Quantitative Evaluation of the Effect of the Hydrophobicity of the Environment Surrounding Bronsted Acid Sites on Their Catalytic Activity for the Hydrolysis of Organic Molecules.,"Sulfo-functionalized siloxane gels with a variety of surface hydrophobicities were fabricated to elucidate the effect of the environment surrounding the Bronsted acid site on their catalytic activity for the hydrolysis of organic molecules. A detailed structural analysis of these siloxane gels by elemental analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier-transformed infrared (FT-IR), and (29)Si MAS NMR revealed the formation of gel catalysts with a highly condensed siloxane network, which enabled us to quantitatively evaluate the hydrophobicity of the environment surrounding the catalytically active sulfo-functionality. A sulfo group in a highly hydrophobic environment exhibited excellent catalytic turnover frequency for the hydrolysis of acetate esters with a long alkyl chain, whereas not only conventional solid acid catalysts but also liquid acids showed quite low catalytic activity. Detailed kinetic studies corroborated that the adsorption of oleophilic esters at the Bronsted acid site was facilitated by the surrounding hydrophobic environment, thus significantly promoting hydrolysis under aqueous conditions. Furthermore, sulfo-functionalized siloxane gels with a highly hydrophobic surface showed excellent catalytic activity for the hydrolytic deprotection of silyl ethers.",2
Chemical Synthesis Enables Structural Reengineering of Aglaroxin C Leading to Inhibition Bias for Hepatitis C Viral Infection.,"As a unique rocaglate (flavagline) natural product, aglaroxin C displays intriguing biological activity by inhibiting hepatitis C viral entry. To further elucidate structure-activity relationships and diversify the pyrimidinone scaffold, we report a concise synthesis of aglaroxin C utilizing a highly regioselective pyrimidinone condensation. We have prepared more than 40 aglaroxin C analogues utilizing various amidine condensation partners. Through biological evaluation of analogues, we have discovered two lead compounds, CMLD012043 and CMLD012044, which show preferential bias for the inhibition of hepatitis C viral entry vs translation inhibition. Overall, the study demonstrates the power of chemical synthesis to produce natural product variants with both target inhibition bias and improved therapeutic indexes.",2
Catalytic Transfer Hydration of Cyanohydrins to alpha-Hydroxyamides.,"We report the palladium(II)-catalyzed transfer hydration of cyanohydrins to alpha -hydroxyamides by using carboxamides as water donors. This method enables selective hydration of various aldehyde- and ketone-derived cyanohydrins to afford alpha-mono- and alpha,alpha-disubstituted-alpha -hydroxyamides, respectively, under mild conditions (50 degrees C, 10 min). The direct conversion of fenofibrate, a drug bearing a benzophenone moiety, into a functionalized alpha,alpha-diaryl-alpha -hydroxyamide was achieved by means of a hydrocyanation-transfer hydration sequence. Preliminary kinetic studies and the synthesis of a site-specifically (18)O-labeled alpha -hydroxyamide demonstrated the carbonyl oxygen transfer from the carboxamide reagent into the alpha -hydroxyamide product.",2
Enzymatic Reconstitution and Biosynthetic Investigation of the Lasso Peptide Fusilassin.,"Lasso peptides are a class of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified natural product which possess a unique lariat knot conformation. The low entropy ""threaded"" conformation endows lasso peptides with considerable resistance to heat and proteolytic degradation, which are attractive properties for the development of peptide-based therapeutics. Despite their discovery nearly 30 years ago, the molecular mechanism underlying lasso peptide biosynthesis remains poorly characterized due to the low stability of the purified biosynthetic enzymes. Here, we report the biosynthetic reconstitution of a lasso peptide derived from Thermobifida fusca, termed fusilassin. Beyond robust catalytic activity, the fusilassin enzymes demonstrate extraordinary substrate tolerance during heterologous expression in E. coli and upon purification in cell-free biosynthetic reconstitution reactions. We provide evidence that the fusilassin biosynthetic enzymes are not capable of forming branched-cyclic products but can produce entirely unrelated lasso peptides. Finally, we leveraged our bioinformatic survey of all lasso peptides identified in GenBank to perform coevolutionary analysis of two requisite biosynthetic proteins. This effort correctly identified residues governing an important protein-protein interaction, illustrating how genomic insight can accelerate the characterization of natural product biosynthetic pathways. The fusilassin enzymes described within represent a model system for both designing future lasso peptides of biomedical importance and also for elucidating the molecular mechanisms that govern lasso peptide biosynthesis.",2
Apoferritin Protein Amyloid Fibrils with Tunable Chirality and Polymorphism.,"Ferritin, a soluble and highly robust protein with subunits packed into well-defined helices, is a key component of the iron regulatory system in the brain and thus is widely recognized as a crucial protein for iron metabolism, but may also bear possible implications in some neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we present evidence of how human recombinant apoferritin can convert into an unusual structure from its folded native state; that is, amyloid fibrils analogue to those found in pathological disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. An extensive combination of advanced microscopy, spectroscopy and scattering techniques concur to reveal that apoferritin fibrils possess a common double stranded twisted ribbon structure which can result in a mesoscopic right-handed chirality. We highlight a direct connection between the chirality and morphology of the resulting amyloid fibrils, and the initial protein subunits composition, advancing our understanding on the possible role of misfolding in some ferritin-related pathologies and posing new bases for the design of chiral 1D functional nanostructures.",2
"1,3-Chlorine Shift to a Vinyl Cation: A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Investigation of the E-Selective Gold(I)-Catalyzed Dimerization of Chloroacetylenes.","Metal-catalyzed dimerization reactions of terminal acetylenes are well known in the literature. However, only a few examples of the dimerization of halogen-substituted acetylenes are described. The products of the latter metal-catalyzed dimerization are the branched head-to-tail enynes. The formation of the corresponding linear head-to-head enynes has not been reported yet. Herein, we demonstrate by means of quantum chemical methods and experiments that the head-to-head dimerization of chloroarylacetylenes can be achieved via mono gold catalysis. Under the optimized conditions, a clean and complete conversion of the starting materials is observed and the dimeric products are obtained up to 75% NMR yield. A mechanistic investigation of the dimerization reaction reveals that the branched head-to-tail vinyl cation is energetically more stable than the corresponding linear head-to-head cation. However, the latter can rearrange by an unusual 1,3-chlorine shift, resulting in the highly stereoselective formation of the trans product, which corresponds to the gold complex of the head-to-head E-enyne. The activation barrier for this rearrangement is extremely low (ca. 2 kcal/mol). As the mono gold-catalyzed dimerization can be conducted in a preparative scale, this simple synthesis of trans-1,2-dichloroenynes makes the gold(I)-catalyzed head-to-head dimerization of chloroarylacetylenes an attractive method en route to more complex conjugated enyne systems and their congeners.",2
Site-Specifically Initiated Controlled/Living Branching Radical Polymerization: A Synthetic Route toward Hierarchically Branched Architectures.,"Controlled/living radical polymerization was developed to synthesize branched polyacrylates and polystyrene with tunable degrees of branching and low dispersities. This method is based on a polymerization-induced branching process that occurs when n-butyl alpha-bromoacrylate is copolymerized under atom transfer radical polymerization conditions. This novel branching polymerization demonstrates excellent synthetic versatility, enabling the preparation of complex macromolecular architectures constructed from branched-polymer building blocks.",2
Mechanism and Kinetics of Propane Dehydrogenation and Cracking over Ga/H-MFI Prepared via Vapor-Phase Exchange of H-MFI with GaCl3.,"In this study, the mechanism and kinetics of C3H8 dehydrogenation and cracking are examined over Ga/H-MFI catalysts prepared via vapor-phase exchange of H-MFI with GaCl3. The present study demonstrates that [GaH](2+) cations are the active centers for C3H8 dehydrogenation and cracking, independent of the Ga/Al ratio. For identical reaction conditions, [GaH](2+) cations in Ga/H-MFI exhibit a turnover frequency for C3H8 dehydrogenation that is 2 orders of magnitude higher and for C3H8 cracking, that is 1 order of magnitude higher than the corresponding turnover frequencies over H-MFI. C3H8 dehydrogenation and cracking exhibit first-order kinetics with respect to C3H8 over H-MFI, but both reactions exhibit first-order kinetics over Ga/H-MFI only at very low C3H8 partial pressures and zero-order kinetics at higher C3H8 partial pressures. H2 inhibits both reactions over Ga/H-MFI. It is also found that the ratio of the rate of dehydrogenation to the rate of cracking over Ga/H-MFI is independent of C3H8 and H2 partial pressures but weakly dependent on temperature. Measured activation enthalpies together with theoretical analysis are consistent with a mechanism in which both the dehydrogenation and cracking of C3H8 proceed over Ga/H-MFI via reversible, heterolytic dissociation of C3H8 at [GaH](2+) sites to form [C3H7-GaH](+)-H(+) cation pairs. The rate-determining step for dehydrogenation is the beta-hydride elimination of C3H6 and H2 from the C3H7 fragment. The rate-determining step for cracking is C-C bond attack of the same propyl fragment by the proximal Bronsted acid O-H group. H2 inhibits both dehydrogenation and cracking over Ga/H-MFI via reaction with [GaH](2+) cations to form [GaH2](+)-H(+) cation pairs.",2
Tip-Enhanced Raman Imaging of Single-Stranded DNA with Single Base Resolution.,"Tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) is a promising optical and analytical technique for chemical imaging and sensing at single molecule resolution. In particular, TERS signals generated by a gap-mode configuration where a silver tip is coupled with a gold substrate can resolve a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecule with a spatial resolution below 1 nm. To demonstrate the proof of subnanometer resolution, we show direct nucleic acid sequencing using TERS of a phage ssDNA (M13mp18). M13mp18 provides a known sequence and, through our deposition strategy, can be stretched (uncoiled) and attached to the substrate by its phosphate groups, while exposing its nucleobases to the tip. After deposition, we scan the silver tip along the ssDNA and collect TERS signals with a step of 0.5 nm, comparable to the bond length between two adjacent DNA bases. By demonstrating the real-time profiling of a ssDNA configuration and furthermore, with unique TERS signals of monomeric units of other biopolymers, we anticipate that this technique can be extended to the high-resolution imaging of various nanostructures as well as the direct sequencing of other important biopolymers including RNA, polysaccharides, and polypeptides.",2
Dynamic Carbon Isotope Exchange of Pharmaceuticals with Labeled CO2.,"A copper-catalyzed procedure enabling dynamic carbon isotope exchange is described. Utilizing the universal precursor [(14)C]CO2, this protocol allows to insert, in one single step, the desired carbon tag into carboxylic acids with no need of structural modifications. Reducing synthetic costs and limiting the generation of radioactive waste, this procedure will facilitate the access to carboxylic acids containing drugs and accelerate early (14)C-based ADME studies supporting drug development.",2
Acetyl Group Migration across the Saccharide Units in Oligomannoside Model Compound.,"Acetylated oligosaccharides are common in nature. While they are involved in several biochemical and biological processes, the role of the acetyl groups and the complexity of their migration has largely gone unnoticed. In this work, by combination of organic synthesis, NMR spectroscopy and quantum chemical modeling, we show that acetyl group migration is a much more complex phenomenon than previously known. By use of synthetic oligomannoside model compounds, we demonstrate, for the first time, that the migration of acetyl groups in oligosaccharides and polysaccharides may not be limited to transfer within a single monosaccharide moiety, but may also involve migration over a glycosidic bond between two different saccharide units. The observed phenomenon is not only interesting from the chemical point of view, but it also raises new questions about the potential biological role of acylated carbohydrates in nature.",2
Chemical Additives Enable Native Mass Spectrometry Measurement of Membrane Protein Oligomeric State within Intact Nanodiscs.,"Membrane proteins play critical biochemical roles but remain challenging to study. Recently, native or nondenaturing mass spectrometry (MS) has made great strides in characterizing membrane protein interactions. However, conventional native MS relies on detergent micelles, which may disrupt natural interactions. Lipoprotein nanodiscs provide a platform to present membrane proteins for native MS within a lipid bilayer environment, but previous native MS of membrane proteins in nanodiscs has been limited by the intermediate stability of nanodiscs. It is difficult to eject membrane proteins from nanodiscs for native MS but also difficult to retain intact nanodisc complexes with membrane proteins inside. Here, we employed chemical reagents that modulate the charge acquired during electrospray ionization (ESI). By modulating ESI conditions, we could either eject the membrane protein complex with few bound lipids or capture the intact membrane protein nanodisc complex-allowing measurement of the membrane protein oligomeric state within an intact lipid bilayer environment. The dramatic differences in the stability of nanodiscs under different ESI conditions opens new applications for native MS of nanodiscs.",2
Rh(III)-Catalyzed meta-C-H Alkenylation with Alkynes.,"Rh(III)-catalyzed meta-C-H functionalization reactions are still rare. Herein, we report the first example of Rh(III)-catalyzed meta-C-H alkenylation with disubstituted alkynes directed by a U-shaped nitrile template. Exclusive regio-selectivity has been achieved using unsymmetrical aryl and alkyl-disubstituted alkynes to afford synthetically valuable trisubstituted olefins. Propargyl alcohols are also compatible, affording complex allylic alcohols. Notably, transition metal-catalyzed meta-alkenylation with alkynes has not been successful with Pd catalysts.",2
Dramatic Electronic Perturbations of CuA Centers via Subtle Geometric Changes.,"CuA is a binuclear copper site acting as electron entry port in terminal heme-copper oxidases. In the oxidized form, CuA is a mixed valence pair whose electronic structure can be described using a potential energy surface with two minima, sigmau* and piu, that are variably populated at room temperature. We report that mutations in the first and second coordination spheres of the binuclear metallocofactor can be combined in an additive manner to tune the energy gap and, thus, the relative populations of the two lowest-lying states. A series of designed mutants span sigmau*/piu energy gaps ranging from 900 to 13 cm(-1). The smallest gap corresponds to a variant with an effectively degenerate ground state. All engineered sites preserve the mixed-valence character of this metal center and the electron transfer functionality. An increase of the Cu-Cu distance less than 0.06 A modifies the sigmau*/piu energy gap by almost 2 orders of magnitude, with longer distances eliciting a larger population of the piu state. This scenario offers a stark contrast to synthetic systems, as model compounds require a lengthening of 0.5 A in the Cu-Cu distance to stabilize the piu state. These findings show that the tight control of the protein environment allows drastic perturbations in the electronic structure of CuA sites with minor geometric changes.",2
Mechanical Properties of a Metal-Organic Framework formed by Covalent Cross-Linking of Metal-Organic Polyhedra.,"Overcoming the brittleness of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is a challenge for industrial applications. To increase the mechanical strength, MOFs have been blended with polymers to form composites. However, this also brings challenges, such as integration and integrity of MOF in the composite, which can hamper the selectivity of gas separations. In this report, an ""all MOF"" material with mechanical flexibility has been prepared by covalent cross-linking of metal-organic polyhedra (MOPs). The ubiquitous Cu24 isophthalate MOP has been decorated with a long alkyl chain having terminal alkene functionalities so that MOPs can be cross-linked via olefin metathesis using Grubbs second generation catalyst. Different degrees of cross-linked MOP materials have been obtained by varying the amount of catalyst in the reaction. Rheology of these structures with varying number of cross-links was performed to assess the cross-link density and its homogeneity throughout the sample. The mechanical properties were further investigated by the nanoindentation method, which showed increasing hardness with higher cross-link density. Thus, this strategy of cross-linking MOPs with covalent flexible units allows us to create MOFs of increasing mechanical strength while retaining the MOP cavities.",2
Mechanical Properties and Processing Techniques of Bulk Metal-Organic Framework Glasses.,"Melt quenched metal-organic framework (MOF) glasses define a new category of glass, distinct from metallic, organic, and inorganic glasses, owing to the dominant role of metal-ligand coordination bonding. The mechanical properties of glasses in general are important given their application in protective coatings and display technologies, though little is known about MOF glasses in this respect. The experimental elucidation of key properties such as their scratch resistance has been limited by the lack of processing methodologies capable of producing bulk glass samples. Here, nanoindentation was used to investigate the Young's modulus and hardness of four melt-quenched glasses formed from zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF): agZIF-4, agZIF-62, agZIF-76, and agZIF-76-mbIm. The creep resistance of the melt-quenched glasses was studied via strain-rate jump (SRJ) tests and through constant load and hold (CLH) indentation creep experiments. Values for the strain-rate sensitivity were found to be close to those for other glassy polymers and Se-rich GeSe chalcogenide glasses. Vacuum hot-pressing of agZIF-62 resulted in an inhomogeneous bulk sample containing the glass and amorphous non-melt-quenched aZIF-62. Remelting and annealing, however, resulted in the fabrication of a transparent, bubble-free bulk specimen, which allowed the first scratch testing experiments to be performed on an MOF glass.",2
"Catalytic, Enantioselective Synthesis of Cyclic Carbamates from Dialkyl Amines by CO2-Capture: Discovery, Development, and Mechanism.","Cyclic carbamates are a common feature of small-molecule therapeutics, offering a constrained hydrogen bond acceptor that is both polar and sterically small. Methods for their preparation most often focus first on amino alcohol synthesis and then reaction with phosgene or its equivalent. This report describes an enantioselective synthesis of cyclic carbamates in which carbon dioxide engages an unsaturated basic amine, facilitated by a bifunctional organocatalyst designed to stabilize a carbamic acid intermediate while activating it toward subsequent enantioselective carbon-oxygen bond formation. Six-membered cyclic carbamates are prepared in good yield with high levels of enantioselection, as constrained 1,3-amino alcohols featuring a chiral tertiary alcohol carbon. Spectroscopic analysis (NMR, DOSY) of various substrate-reagent combinations provides insight into the dominant species under the reaction conditions. Two peculiar requirements were identified to achieve highest consistency: a ""Goldilocks"" amount of water and the use of a noncrystalline form of the ligand. These atypical features of the final protocol notwithstanding, a diverse range of products could be prepared. Their functionalizations illustrate the versatility of the carbamates as precursors to enantioenriched small molecules.",2
Stepwise Expansion of Layered Metal-Organic Frameworks for Nonstochastic Exfoliation into Porous Nanosheets.,"A layered metal-organic framework (MOF) with a porous kagome lattice, kgm(SMe), was synthesized by complexation of 5-methylthioisophthalate (SMe-ip) with Cu(2+) in MeOH. As observed by powder XRD, kgm(SMe) (state I), when immersed in aprotic polar solvents such as THF, underwent stepwise interlayer expansion into a monolayer-expanded state (state III) through a bilayer-expanded state (state II). We successfully obtained the single-crystal structures of states I-III. Of interest, when further immersed in appropriate solvents, state II and III crystals preferentially exfoliated into bilayer and monolayer MOF nanosheets, respectively. The stepwise expansion followed by exfoliation, thus developed, may enable a nonstochastic approach to the selective synthesis of ultrathin porous nanosheets from layered MOF crystals.",2
Mimicking Microbial Rhodopsin Isomerization in a Single Crystal.,"Bacteriorhodopsin represents the simplest, and possibly most abundant, phototropic system requiring only a retinal-bound transmembrane protein to convert photons of light to an energy-generating proton gradient. The creation and interrogation of a microbial rhodopsin mimic, based on an orthogonal protein system, would illuminate the design elements required to generate new photoactive proteins with novel function. We describe a microbial rhodopsin mimic, created using a small soluble protein as a template, that specifically photoisomerizes all- trans to 13- cis retinal followed by thermal relaxation to the all- trans isomer, mimicking the bacteriorhodopsin photocycle, in a single crystal. The key element for selective isomerization is a tuned steric interaction between the chromophore and protein, similar to that seen in the microbial rhodopsins. It is further demonstrated that a single mutation converts the system to a protein photoswitch without chromophore photoisomerization or conformational change.",2
Realizing Two-Dimensional Magnetic Semiconductors with Enhanced Curie Temperature by Antiaromatic Ring Based Organometallic Frameworks.,"Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic semiconductors with room-temperature ferromagnetism are very desirable. Despite the great progress made recently, the Curie temperature is still very low ( approximately 45 K), originating from the weak ferromagnetic superexchange interaction. Here, based on first-principles calculations, we propose a general route to achieve 2D magnetic semiconductors with enhanced Curie temperature in organometallic frameworks by incorporating antiaromatic rings as organic linkers. Antiaromatic rings usually possess low-energy multiple spin states, which can be easily induced by adjacent magnetic moments of transition metals and subsequently coupled with them through the strong d-p direct exchange interaction, producing high-temperature ferrimagnetic ordering. The design of 2D organometallic frameworks with typical antiaromatic rings such as pentalene, which show Curie temperatures well above room temperature from classic Heisenberg model Monte Carlo simulations, confirms our proposal.",2
Redox Reactivity of a Mononuclear Manganese-Oxo Complex Binding Calcium Ion and Other Redox-Inactive Metal Ions.,"Mononuclear nonheme manganese(IV)-oxo complexes binding calcium ion and other redox-inactive metal ions, [(dpaq)Mn(IV)(O)](+)-M (n+) (1-M(n+), M (n+) = Ca(2+), Mg(2+), Zn(2+), Lu(3+), Y(3+), Al(3+), and Sc(3+)) (dpaq = 2-[bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)]amino- N-quinolin-8-yl-acetamidate), were synthesized by reacting a hydroxomanganese(III) complex, [(dpaq)Mn(III)(OH)](+), with iodosylbenzene (PhIO) in the presence of redox-inactive metal ions (M (n+)). The Mn(IV)-oxo complexes were characterized using various spectroscopic techniques. In reactivity studies, we observed contrasting effects of M (n+) on the reactivity of 1-M (n+) in redox reactions such as electron-transfer (ET), oxygen atom transfer (OAT), and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions. In the OAT and ET reactions, the reactivity order of 1-M (n+), such as 1-Sc(3+) approximately 1-Al(3+) > 1-Y(3+) > 1-Lu(3+) > 1-Zn(2+) > 1-Mg(2+) > 1-Ca(2+), follows the Lewis acidity of M (n+) bound to the Mn-O moiety; that is, the stronger the Lewis acidity of M (n+), the higher the reactivity of 1-M (n+) becomes. In sharp contrast, the reactivity of 1-M (n+) in the HAT reaction was reversed, giving the reactivity order 1-Ca(2+) > 1-Mg(2+) > 1-Zn(2+) > 1-Lu(3+)> 1-Y(3+)> 1-Al(3+) approximately 1-Sc(3+); that is, the higher is Lewis acidity of M (n+), the lower the reactivity of 1-M (n+) in the HAT reaction. The latter result implies that the Lewis acidity of M (n+) bound to the Mn-O moiety can modulate the basicity of the metal-oxo moiety, thus influencing the HAT reactivity of 1-M (n+); cytochrome P450 utilizes the axial thiolate ligand to increase the basicity of the iron-oxo moiety, which enhances the reactivity of compound I in C-H bond activation reactions.",2
Cooking Chemistry Transforms Proteins into High-Strength Adhesives.,"In prior generations, proteins were taken from horses and other animals to make glues. Petroleum-derived polymers including epoxies and cyanoacrylates have since replaced proteins owing to improved performance. These modern materials come at a cost of toxicity as well as being derived from limited resources. Ideally, replacement adhesives will be made from benign, cheap, and renewable feedstocks. Such a transition to biobased materials, however, will not occur until similar or improved performance can be achieved. We have discovered that coupling of proteins and sugars gives rise to strong adhesives. An unexpected connection was made between adhesion and Maillard chemistry, known to be at the heart of cooking foods. Cross-linked proteins bonded metal and wood with high strengths, in some cases showing forces exceeding those withstood by the substrates themselves. Simple cooking chemistry may provide a route to future high-performance materials derived from low-cost, environmentally benign components.",2
Accumulation of Glassy Poly(ethylene oxide) Anchored in a Covalent Organic Framework as a Solid-State Li(+) Electrolyte.,"Design of molecular structures showing fast ion conductive/transport pathways in the solid state has been a significant challenge. The amorphous or glassy phase in organic polymers works well for fast ion conductivity because of their dynamic and random structure. However, the main issue with these polymers has been the difficulty in elucidating the mechanisms of ion conduction and thus low designability. Furthermore, the amorphous or glassy state of ion conductive polymers often confronts the problems of structural/mechanical stabilities. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are an emerging class of crystalline organic polymers with periodic structure and tunable functionality, which exhibit potential as a unique ion conductor/transporter. Here, we describe the use of a COF as a medium for all-solid-state Li(+) conductivity. A bottom-up self-assembly approach was applied to covalently reticulate the flexible, bulky, and glassy poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) moieties that can solvate Li(+) for fast transport by their segmental motion in the rigid two-dimensional COF architectures. Temperature-dependent powder X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis showed that the periodic structures are intact even above 300 degrees C, and differential scanning calorimetry and solid-state NMR revealed that the accumulated PEO chains are highly dynamic and exhibit a glassy state. Li(+) conductivity was found to depend on the dynamics and length of PEO chains in the crystalline states, and solid-state Li(+) conductivity of 1.33 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) was achieved at 200 degrees C after LiTFSI doping. The high conductivity at the specified temperature remains intact for extended periods of time as a result of the structure's robustness. Furthermore, we demonstrated the first application of a COF electrolyte in an all-solid-state Li battery at 100 degrees C.",2
"Enantioselective Redox-Neutral Coupling of Aldehydes and Alkenes by an Iron-Catalyzed ""Catch-Release"" Tethering Approach.","The reductive coupling of aldehydes and alkenes is an emerging technology that holds the potential to reinvent carbonyl addition chemistry. However, existing enantioselective methods are limited to form ""branched"" products. Herein, we present a directed enantio- and diastereoselective alkylation of aldehydes with simple olefins to selectively yield linear coupling products. This is achieved by redox-neutral remote functionalization, whereby a tethering ""catch-release"" strategy decisively solves the key problems of reactivity and selectivity.",2
Concise Total Synthesis of Herqulines B and C.,"A simple total synthesis of herqulines B and C is reported, modeled on the reductive biosynthesis reported previously by other researchers. Commencing from tyrosine, these alkaloids were fashioned through a dimerization, macrocyclization, and four consecutive reductions. Emerging from these studies are strategic insights on the synthesis of these strained alkaloids, as well as mild conditions for the exhaustive reduction of diketopiperizines.",2
Chemistry of Singlet Oxygen with a Cadmium-Sulfur Cluster: Physical Quenching versus Photooxidation.,"We investigated the chemistry of singlet oxygen with a cadmium-sulfur cluster, (Me4N)2[Cd4(SPh)10]. This cluster was used as a model for cadmium-sulfur nanoparticles. Such nanoparticles are often used in conjunction with photosensitizers (for singlet oxygen generation or dye-sensitized solar cells), and hence, it is important to determine if cadmium-sulfur moieties physically quench and/or chemically react with singlet oxygen. We found that (Me4N)2[Cd4(SPh)10] is indeed a very strong quencher of singlet oxygen with total rate constants for (1)O2 removal of (5.8 +/- 1.3) x 10(8) M(-1) s(-1) in acetonitrile and (1.2 +/- 0.5) x 10(8) M(-1) s(-1) in CD3OD. Physical quenching predominates, but chemical reaction leading to decomposition of the cluster and formation of sulfinate is also significant, with a rate constant of (4.1 +/- 0.6) x 10(6) M(-1) s(-1) in methanol. Commercially available cadmium-sulfur quantum dots (""lumidots"") show similar singlet oxygen quenching rate constants, based on the molar concentration of the quantum dots.",2
Total Synthesis of (-)-Sinulariadiolide. A Transannular Approach.,"The constrained tricyclic skeleton of the nor-cembranoid sinulariadiolide (1) with a nine-membered nexus was obtained by a cascade of transannular Michael reaction, carbonate elimination, butenolide formation, and spontaneous oxa-Michael addition of MeOH. The required macrocyclic precursor was prepared by ring-closing alkyne metathesis followed by trans-hydrostannation/carbonylation.",2
Nonresonant Photons Catalyze Photodissociation of Phenol.,"Phenol represents an ideal polyatomic system for demonstrating photon catalysis because of its large polarizability, well-characterized excited-state potential energy surfaces, and nonadiabatic dissociation dynamics. A nonresonant IR pulse (1064 nm) supplies a strong electric field (4 x 10(7) V/cm) during the photolysis of isolated phenol (C6H5OH) molecules to yield C6H5O + H near two known energetic thresholds: the S1/S2 conical intersection and the S1 - S0 origin. H-atom speed distributions show marked changes in the relative contributions of dissociative pathways in both cases, compared to the absence of the nonresonant IR pulse. Results indicate that nonresonant photons lower the activation barrier for some pathways relative to others by dynamically Stark shifting the excited-state potential energy surfaces rather than aligning molecules in the strong electric field. Theoretical calculations offer support for the experimental interpretation.",2
Zn-Mediated Fragmentation of Tertiary Alkyl Oxalates Enabling Formation of Alkylated and Arylated Quaternary Carbon Centers.,"Zn-mediated reduction of readily accessible dialkyl oxalates derived from tertiary alcohols provides an efficient approach to C-O bond fragmentation and alkyl radical formation. With MgCl2 as the indispensable additive and Ni as the promoter, trapping the radical with activated alkenes and aryl-Ni intermediates allows for the generation of alkylated and arylated all-carbon quaternary centers.",2
Heterotetrametallic Re-Zn-Zn-Re Complex Generated by an Anionic Rhenium(I) beta-Diketiminate.,"We report the synthesis of an anionic rhenium(I) compound, Na[Re(eta(5)-Cp)(BDI)] (1; Cp = cyclopentadienide, BDI = N, N'-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-3,5-dimethyl-beta-diketiminate) and initial investigations of its use as a strong chemical reductant and metalloligand. Chemical oxidation of 1 gives a rare example of a rhenium(II) compound Re(eta(5)-Cp)(BDI) (2), while protonation of 1 yields the rhenium(III) hydride complex Re(H)(eta(5)-Cp)(BDI) (3). The reaction of 1 with ZnCl2 generated both 2 and the zinc(I) compound [ZnRe(eta(5)-Cp)(BDI)]2 (4), which features a linear, tetrametallic Re(I)-Zn(I)-Zn(I)-Re(I) core. Computational studies of 4 were performed to characterize the metal-metal bonding interactions; the results indicate a dative interaction from rhenium to zinc and covalent bonding between the two zinc centers. One-electron oxidation of 4 yielded both 2 and the triflate-bridged zinc(II) complex [(mu-OTf)ZnRe(eta(5)-Cp)(BDI)]2 (5, OTf = trifluoromethanesulfonate).",2
Wafer-Sized Ultrathin Gallium and Indium Nitride Nanosheets through the Ammonolysis of Liquid Metal Derived Oxides.,"We report the synthesis of centimeter sized ultrathin GaN and InN. The synthesis relies on the ammonolysis of liquid metal derived two-dimensional (2D) oxide sheets that were squeeze-transferred onto desired substrates. Wurtzite GaN nanosheets featured typical thicknesses of 1.3 nm, an optical bandgap of 3.5 eV and a carrier mobility of 21.5 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1), while the InN featured a thickness of 2.0 nm. The deposited nanosheets were highly crystalline, grew along the (001) direction and featured a thickness of only three unit cells. The method provides a scalable approach for the integration of 2D morphologies of industrially important semiconductors into emerging electronics and optical devices.",2
Regio- and Enantioselective Iridium-Catalyzed Amination of Racemic Branched Alkyl-Substituted Allylic Acetates with Primary and Secondary Aromatic and Heteroaromatic Amines.,"The air- and water-stable pi-allyliridium C,O-benzoate modified by ( S)-tol-BINAP, ( S)-Ir-II, catalyzes highly regio- and enantioselective Tsuji-Trost-type aminations of racemic branched alkyl-substituted allylic acetates using primary or secondary (hetero)aromatic amines. Specifically, in the presence of ( S)-Ir-II (5 mol%) in DME solvent at 60-70 degrees C, alpha-methyl allyl acetate 1a (100 mol%) reacts with primary (hetero)aromatic amines 2a-2l (200 mol%) or secondary (hetero)aromatic amines 3a-3l (200 mol%) to form the branched products of allylic amination 4a-4l and 5a-5l, respectively, as single regioisomers in good to excellent yield with uniformly high levels of enantioselectivity. As illustrated by the conversion of heteroaromatic amine 3m to adducts 6a-6g, excellent levels of regio- and enantioselectivity are retained across diverse branched allylic acetates bearing normal alkyl or secondary alkyl substituents. For reactants 3n-3p, which incorporate both primary and secondary aryl amine moieties, regio- and enantioselective amination occurs with complete site-selectivity to furnish adducts 7a-7c. Mechanistic studies involving amination of the enantiomerically enriched, deuterium-labeled acetate 1h corroborate C-N bond formation via outer-sphere addition.",2
Cationic Cascade for Building Complex Polycyclic Molecules from Simple Precursors: Diastereoselective Installation of Three Contiguous Stereogenic Centers in a One-Pot Process.,"An expedient strategy for the synthesis of polycyclic small molecules is described. The method first joins together two achiral building blocks (an enyne and an aldehyde or a ketone) using an alkynyl halo-Prins protocol. Then, in the same reaction vessel, acidic conditions initiate a cationic cascade that includes a stereospecific halo-Nazarov electrocyclization and a diastereoselective Friedel-Crafts allylation. The entire sequence forms three carbon-carbon bonds and a carbon-halogen bond, generating halocyclopentene adducts in one pot from simple precursors. The process occurs with excellent diastereocontrol, providing highly functionalized polycycles containing three tertiary or quaternary stereogenic centers in a linear array. It is even possible to install three contiguous all-carbon quaternary centers using this method.",2
Proton Discharge on a Gold Electrode from Triethylammonium in Acetonitrile: Theoretical Modeling of Potential-Dependent Kinetic Isotope Effects.,"The discharge of protons on electrode surfaces, known as the Volmer reaction, is a ubiquitous reaction in heterogeneous electrocatalysis and plays an important role in renewable energy technologies. Recent experiments with triethylammonium (TEAH(+)) donating the proton to a gold electrode in acetonitrile demonstrate significantly different Tafel slopes for TEAH(+) and its deuterated counterpart, TEAD(+). As a result, the kinetic isotope effect (KIE) for the hydrogen evolution reaction changes considerably as a function of applied potential. Herein a vibronically nonadiabatic approach for proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) at an electrode interface is extended to heterogeneous electrochemical processes and is applied to this system. This approach accounts for the key effects of the electrical double layer and spans the electronically adiabatic and nonadiabatic regimes, as found to be necessary for this reaction. The experimental Tafel plots for TEAH(+) and TEAD(+) are reproduced using physically reasonable parameters within this model. The potential-dependent KIE or, equivalently, isotope-dependent Tafel slope is found to be a consequence of contributions from excited electron-proton vibronic states that depend on both isotope and applied potential. Specifically, the contributions from excited reactant vibronic states are greater for TEAD(+) than for TEAH(+). Thus, the two reactions proceed by the same fundamental mechanism yet exhibit significantly different Tafel slopes. This theoretical approach may be applicable to a wide range of other heterogeneous electrochemical PCET reactions.",2
Direct Synthesis of Crystalline Graphdiyne Analogue Based on Supramolecular Interactions.,"The synthesis of graphdiyne with an ordered internal structure is highly attractive for its various scientific and application investigations. We reported herein a rational method to fabricate a graphdiyne analogue with the help of supramolecular chemistry. The introduction of pi-pi/CH-pi interactions controlled the conformations of the precursors and afforded multilayer graphdiyne analogue Ben-GDY through the wet chemical method. The in-plane periodicity of the multilayer Ben-GDY was corroborated by transmission electron microscopy and selected area electron diffraction, which showed a pattern well matched with ABC-style stacking.",2
Divalent Ytterbium Complex-Catalyzed Homo- and Cross-Coupling of Primary Arylsilanes.,"Redistribution of primary silanes through C-Si and Si-H bond cleavage and reformation provides a straightforward synthesis of secondary silanes, but the poor selectivity and low efficiency severely hinders the application of this synthetic protocol. Here, we show that a newly synthesized divalent ytterbium alkyl complex exhibits unprecedentedly high catalytic activity toward the selective redistribution of primary arylsilanes to secondary arylsilanes. More significantly, this complex also effectively catalyzes the cross-coupling between electron-withdrawing substituted primary arylsilanes and electron-donating substituted primary arylsilanes to secondary arylsilanes containing two different aryls. DFT calculation indicates that the reaction always involve the exothermic formation of a hypervalent silicon upon facile addition of PhSiH3 to the Yb-E (E = C, H) bond. This hypervalent compound can easily either generate directly the Yb-Ph complex, or indirectly through the formation of Yb-H, that is the key complex for the formation of Ph2SiH2.",2
Forging C(sp(3))-C(sp(3)) Bonds with Carbon-Centered Radicals in the Synthesis of Complex Molecules.,"Radical fragment coupling reactions that unite intricate subunits have become an important class of transformations within the arena of complex molecule synthesis. This Perspective highlights some of the early contributions in this area, as well as more modern applications of radical fragment couplings in the preparation of natural products. Additionally, emphasis is placed on contemporary advances that allow for radical generation under mild conditions as a driving force for the implementation of radical fragment couplings in total synthesis.",2
Generalized View of Protein Folding: In Medio Stat Virtus.,"Proteins are often described in textbooks as being only ""marginally stable"" but many proteins, specifically those with a high free energy of unfolding are, in fact, so stable that they exist only in the fully folded state except under harsh denaturing conditions. Proteins that are truly only marginally stable, those with a low free energy of unfolding, exist as an equilibrium mixture of folded and unfolded forms under ""normal"" conditions. To some extent such proteins have some features in common with ""intrinsically disordered"" proteins. We analyzed the relationship between these marginally stable proteins and intrinsically disordered proteins in order to fully understand the twilight zone that distinguishes the two ensembles in the hope of clarifying the fuzzy borders of the current classification that divides the protein world into folded and intrinsically disordered ones. Our analysis suggests that the division may be too drastic and misleading, because it puts within the same category proteins with very different behaviors. We propose a restricted, albeit operational, definition of ""marginally stable proteins"", referring by this term only to proteins whose free energy difference between the folded and unfolded states falls in the interval 0-3 kcal/mol. These proteins have special features because they normally exist as equilibrium mixtures of folded and unfolded species or as molten globule states. This coexistence makes marginally stable proteins ideal tools to study even small environmental changes to which they may behave as natural sensors.",2
Metal-Organic Frameworks as Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering Substrates with High Tailorability.,"Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a widely used analytical technique for detecting trace-level molecules based on an indispensable SERS substrate. SERS substrates with high tailorability are assumed to be attractive and desirable for SERS detection, because the substrates match the need for the selective detection of different species. Nevertheless, the rational design of such SERS substrates is rather challenging for both noble-metal and semiconductor substrates. Herein, expanding beyond conventional SERS substrates, we demonstrate that metal-organic framework (MOF) materials can serve as a type of SERS substrate with molecular selectivity, which are rarely realized for SERS detection without any special pretreatment. A salient structural characteristic of MOF-based SERS substrates benefiting the SERS selectivity is their high tailorability. By controlling the metal centers, organic ligands, and framework topologies of our MOF-based SERS substrates, we show that the electronic band structures of MOF-based SERS substrate can be purposively manipulated to match those of the target analytes, thus resulting in different detectable species. Going further, the SERS enhancement factors (EFs) of the MOF-based SERS substrates can be greatly enhanced to as high as 10(6) with a low detection limit of 10(-8) M by pore-structure optimization and surface modification, which is comparable to the EFs of noble metals without ""hot spots"" and recently reported semiconductors. This selective enhancement is interpreted as being due to the controllable combination of several resonances, such as the charge-transfer, interband and molecule resonances, together with the ground-state charge-transfer interactions. Our study opens a new venue for the development of SERS substrates with high-design flexibility, which is especially important for selective SERS detection toward specific analytes.",2
"Palladium-Catalyzed Dearomative syn-1,4-Diamination.","Herein we report a dearomative syn-1,4-diamination protocol using simple nonactivated arenes and amines. This one-pot method utilizes arene-arenophile para-cycloadducts, formed via visible-light-mediated [4+2]-photocycloaddition that undergoes formal allylic substitution with amine nucleophiles under Pd-catalysis. The products are obtained with exclusive syn-1,4-selectivity; the method permits enantioselective desymmetrization of naphthalene, as well as elaborations of amine-containing drug molecules. Furthermore, the resulting unsaturated products are amenable to numerous options for diversification. Overall, this novel dearomative functionalization strategy offers rapid and straightforward access to complex building blocks, which are difficult to prepare otherwise, from simple arenes.",2
Asymmetric Synthesis of Griffipavixanthone Employing a Chiral Phosphoric Acid-Catalyzed Cycloaddition.,"Asymmetric synthesis of the biologically active xanthone dimer griffipavixanthone is reported along with its absolute stereochemistry determination. Synthesis of the natural product is accomplished via dimerization of a p-quinone methide using a chiral phosphoric acid catalyst to afford a protected precursor in excellent diastereo- and enantioselectivity. Mechanistic studies, including an unbiased computational investigation of chiral ion-pairs using parallel tempering, were performed in order to probe the mode of asymmetric induction.",2
Ultrasensitive Ambient Mass Spectrometry Immunoassays: Multiplexed Detection of Proteins in Serum and on Cell Surfaces.,"The sensitive and accurate determination of multiple protein biomarkers for clinical diagnosis is in high demand. Here, an ambient mass spectrometry immunoassay platform that possesses advantages of high sensitivity, multiplexed quantitation, low sample consumption and convenient operation was established. A series of extensible rhodamine-based mass tags that ensured quantification of multiple proteins with ultrahigh sensitivity through two-stage signal amplification were developed. Thrombin was detected at zeptomole sensitivity in 2 muL serum/plasma, as was free cancer antigen 125 (CA125). Three protein biomarkers (CA125, carcinoembryonic antigen, and epithelial cell adhesion molecule) were simultaneously detected in situ on ca. 20 cells. This platform is promising for multiple protein detection in a single drop of sample or at the single-cell scale for clinical diagnosis and therapy.",2
Efficient and Long-Lived Room-Temperature Organic Phosphorescence: Theoretical Descriptors for Molecular Designs.,"Room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with long afterglow from pure organic materials has attracted great attention for its potential applications in biological imaging, digital encryption, optoelectronic devices, and so on. Organic materials have been long considered to be nonphosphorescent owing to their weak molecular spin-orbit coupling and high sensitivity to temperature. However, recently, some purely organic compounds have demonstrated highly efficient RTP with long afterglow upon aggregation, while others fail. Namely, it remains a challenge to expound on the underlying mechanisms. In this study, we present the molecular descriptors to characterize the phosphorescence efficiency and lifetime. For a prototypical RTP system consisting of a carbonyl group and pi-conjugated segments, the excited states can be regarded as an admixture of n --> pi* (with portion alpha) and pi --> pi* (portion beta). Starting from the phosphorescent process and El-Sayed rule, we deduced that (i) the intersystem crossing (ISC) rate of S1 --> T n is mostly governed by the modification of the product of alpha and beta and (ii) the ISC rate of T1 --> S0 is determined by the beta value of T1. Thus, the descriptors (gamma = alpha x beta, beta) can be employed to describe the RTP character of organic molecules. From hybrid quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations, we illustrated the relationships among the descriptors (gamma, beta), phosphorescence efficiency and lifetime, and spin-orbit coupling constants. We stressed that the large gamma and beta values are favorable for the strong and long-lived RTP in organic materials. Experiments have reported confirmations of these molecular design rules.",2
In Vivo Albumin Traps Photosensitizer Monomers from Self-Assembled Phthalocyanine Nanovesicles: A Facile and Switchable Theranostic Approach.,"Albumin is a promising candidate as a biomarker for potential disease diagnostics and has been extensively used as a drug delivery carrier for decades. In these two directions, many albumin-detecting probes and exogenous albumin-based nanocomposite delivery systems have been developed. However, there are only a few cases demonstrating the specific interactions of exogenous probes with albumin in vivo, and nanocomposite delivery systems usually suffer from tedious fabrication processes and potential toxicity of the complexes. Herein, we demonstrate a facile ""one-for-all"" switchable nanotheranostic (NanoPcS) for both albumin detection and cancer treatment. In particular, the in vivo specific binding between albumin and PcS, arising from the disassembly of injected NanoPcS, is confirmed using an inducible transgenic mouse system. Fluorescence imaging and antitumor tests on different tumor models suggest that NanoPcS has superior tumor-targeting ability and the potential for time-modulated, activatable photodynamic therapy.",2
"Synthesis of 2-Aryloxy-1,3-dienes from Phenols and Propargyl Carbonates.","A convenient method for the synthesis of 1,3-dienes from readily available compounds is reported. 2-Aryoxy-1,3-dienes are produced stereoselectively by a nickel-catalyzed reaction of propargyl carbonates with phenols. Functional group tolerance is broad to allow iodo, formyl, and boryl groups. The resulting 1,3-dienes are of much synthetic value because they can participate in a wide variety of reactions, including the Diels-Alder reaction.",2
Plasmonic p-n Junction for Infrared Light to Chemical Energy Conversion.,"Infrared (IR) light represents an untapped energy source accounting for almost half of all solar energy. Thus, there is a need to develop systems to convert IR light to fuel and make full use of this plentiful resource. Herein, we report photocatalytic H2 evolution driven by near- to shortwave-IR light (up to 2500 nm) irradiation, based on novel CdS/Cu7S4 heterostructured nanocrystals. The apparent quantum yield reached 3.8% at 1100 nm, which exceeds the highest efficiencies achieved by IR light energy conversion systems reported to date. Spectroscopic results revealed that plasmon-induced hot-electron injection at p-n heterojunctions realizes exceptionally long-lived charge separation (>273 mus), which results in efficient IR light to hydrogen conversion. These results pave the way for the exploration of undeveloped low-energy light for solar fuel generation.",2
Elucidation of a Redox-Mediated Reaction Cycle for Nickel-Catalyzed Cross Coupling.,"A reaction cycle for redox-mediated, Ni-catalyzed aryl etherification is proposed under both photoredox and electrochemically mediated conditions. We demonstrate that a self-sustained Ni(I/III) cycle is operative in both cases by chemically synthesizing and characterizing a common paramagnetic Ni intermediate and establishing its catalytic activity. Furthermore, deleterious pathways leading to off-cycle Ni(II) species have been identified, allowing us to discover optimized conditions for achieving self-sustained reactivity at a approximately 15-fold increase in the quantum yield and a approximately 3-fold increase in the faradaic yield. These results highlight the importance of leveraging insight of complete reaction cycles for increasing the efficiency of redox-mediated reactions.",2
Hierarchically Compartmentalized Supramolecular Gels through Multilevel Self-Sorting.,"Hierarchical compartmentalization through the bottom-up approach is ubiquitous in living cells but remains a formidable task in synthetic systems. Here we report on hierarchically compartmentalized supramolecular gels that are spontaneously formed by multilevel self-sorting. Two types of molecular gelators are formed in situ from nonassembling building blocks and self-assemble into distinct gel fibers through a kinetic self-sorting process; interestingly, these distinct fibers further self-sort into separated microdomains, leading to microscale compartmentalized gel networks. Such spontaneously multilevel self-sorting systems provide a ""bottom-up"" approach toward hierarchically structured functional materials and may play a role in intracellular organization.",2
Rotaxane-Based Transition Metal Complexes: Effect of the Mechanical Bond on Structure and Electronic Properties.,"Early work by Sauvage revealed that mechanical bonding alters the stability and redox properties of their original catenane metal complexes. However, despite the importance of controlling metal ion properties for a range of applications, these effects have received relatively little attention since. Here we present a series of tri-, tetra-, and pentadentate rotaxane-based ligands and a detailed study of their metal binding behavior and, where possible, compare their redox and electronic properties with their noninterlocked counterparts. The rotaxane ligands form complexes with most of the metal ions investigated, and X-ray diffraction revealed that in some cases the mechanical bond enforces unusual coordination numbers and distorted arrangements as a result of the exclusion of exogenous ligands driven by the sterically crowded binding sites. In contrast, only the noninterlocked equivalent of the pentadentate rotaxane Cu(II) complex could be formed selectively, and this exhibited compromised redox stability compared to its interlocked counterpart. Frozen-solution EPR data demonstrate the formation of an interesting biomimetic state for the tetradentate Cu(II) rotaxane, as well as the formation of stable Ni(I) species and the unusual coexistence of high- and low-spin Co(II) in the pentadentate framework. Our results demonstrate that readily available mechanically chelating rotaxanes give rise to complexes the noninterlocked equivalent of which are inaccessible, and that the mechanical bond augments the redox behavior of the bound metal ion in a manner analogous to the carefully tuned amino acid framework in metalloproteins.",2
Atomic Structure of a Fluorescent Ag8 Cluster Templated by a Multistranded DNA Scaffold.,"Multinuclear silver clusters encapsulated by DNA exhibit size-tunable emission spectra and rich photophysics, but their atomic organization is poorly understood. Herein, we describe the structure of one such hybrid chromophore, a green-emitting Ag8 cluster arranged in a Big Dipper-shape bound to the oligonucleotide A2C4. Three 3' cytosine metallo-base pairs stabilize a parallel A-form-like duplex with a 5' adenine-rich pocket, which binds a metallic, trapezoidal-shaped Ag5 moiety via Ag-N bonds to endo- and exocyclic nitrogens of cytosine and adenine. The unique DNA configuration, constrained coordination environment, and templated Ag8 cluster arrangement highlight the reciprocity between the silvers and DNA in adopting this structure. These first atomic details of a DNA-encapsulated Ag cluster fluorophore illuminate many aspects of biological assembly, nanoscience, and metal cluster photophysics.",2
"Cu/Chiral Phosphoric Acid-Catalyzed Asymmetric Three-Component Radical-Initiated 1,2-Dicarbofunctionalization of Alkenes.","An asymmetric intermolecular, three-component radical-initiated dicarbofunctionalization of 1,1-diarylalkenes with diverse carbon-centered radical precursors and electron-rich heteroaromatics by a copper(I) and chiral phosphoric acid cooperative catalysis strategy has been developed, providing straightforward access to chiral triarylmethanes bearing quaternary all-carbon stereocenters with high efficiency as well as excellent chemo- and enantioselectivity. The key to success is not only the introduction of a sterically demanding chiral phosphoric acid to favor radical difunctionalization over the otherwise remarkable side reactions but also the in situ generation of carbocation intermediates from benzylic radical to realize asymmetric induction with the aid of a removable hydroxy directing group via cooperative interactions with chiral phosphate. Density functional theory calculations elucidated the critical chiral environment created by the hydrogen-bonding and ion-pair interactions between the chiral phosphoric acid catalyst and substrates, which leads to the enantioselective C-C bond formation.",2
Toward Anion-pi Interactions Directed Self-Assembly with Predesigned Dual Macrocyclic Receptors and Dianions.,"Realizing anion-pi interaction induced self-assembly with charge-neutral pi receptors as building components is extremely challenging. We designed and synthesized a series of bisoxacalix[2]arene[2]triazines 7-11 in which two macrocyclic motifs are linked in diverse branching angle and rigidity. Crystal structures showed the use of rigid linkers is able to control the orientation of the two macrocyclic cavities. The interplay between the two cavities was revealed by binding studies of 8-11 with chloride in solution. Whereas 180 degrees - and 120 degrees -branched hosts 8 and 9 possess dual complexation ability, 60 degrees -branched and flexibly linked hosts 10 and 11 only form 1:1 complex with chloride. Association and self-assembly of these bismacrocyclic building units with dianionic naphthalene-1,5-disulfonate were systematically investigated. The formation of oligomeric self-assemblies and large aggregates in solution was suggested by (1)H NMR titrations, concentration- and temperature-variable (1)H NMR, diffusion-ordered spectroscopy (DOSY), ESI-MS, and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The anion-pi induced long-distance self-assembly with coherent particle formation was revealed by SEM, TEM, cryo-TEM, and AFM techniques. The systematic studies allowed us to draw the conclusion that the dianion served to bridge the initial host aggregates through anion-pi interactions and was responsible for the coherent particle formation. The cavity orientation of the bismacrocycle components was found to have a significant influence on the coherent particle morphology.",2
Triarylmethane Fluorophores Resistant to Oxidative Photobluing.,"Spectral stability of small-molecule fluorescent probes is required for correct interpretation and reproducibility of multicolor fluorescence imaging data, in particular under high (de)excitation light intensities of super-resolution imaging or in single-molecule applications. We propose a synthetic approach to a series of spectrally stable rhodamine fluorophores based on sequential Ru- and Cu-catalyzed transformations, evaluate their stability against photobleaching and photoconversion in the context of other fluorophores using chemometric analysis, and demonstrate chemical reactivity of fluorophore photoproducts. The substitution patterns providing the photoconversion-resistant triarylmethane fluorophores have been identified, and the applicability of nonbluing labels in live-cell STED nanoscopy is demonstrated.",2
Inverse Correlation between Amyloid Stiffness and Size.,"We reveal that the axial stiffness of amyloid fibrils is inversely correlated with their cross-sectional area. Because amyloid fibrils' stiffness is determined by hydrogen bond (H-bond) density with a linear correlation, our finding implies that amyloid fibrils with larger radial sizes are generally softer and have lower density H-bond networks. In silico calculations show that the stiffness-size relationship of amyloid fibrils is, indeed, driven by the packing densities of residues and H-bonds. Our results suggest that polypeptide chains which form amyloid fibrils with narrow cross sections can optimize packing densities in the fibrillar core structure, in contrast to those forming wide amyloid fibrils. Consequently, the density of residues and H-bonds that contribute to mechanical stability is higher in amyloid fibrils with narrow cross sections. This size dependence of nanomechanics appears to be a global property of amyloid fibrils, just like the well-known cross-beta sheet topology.",2
Tuning P2-Structured Cathode Material by Na-Site Mg Substitution for Na-Ion Batteries.,"Most P2-type layered oxides suffer from multiple voltage plateaus, due to Na(+)/vacancy-order superstructures caused by strong interplay between Na-Na electrostatic interactions and charge ordering in the transition metal layers. Here, Mg ions are successfully introduced into Na sites in addition to the conventional transition metal sites in P2-type Na0.7[Mn0.6Ni0.4]O2 as new cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. Mg ions in the Na layer serve as ""pillars"" to stabilize the layered structure, especially for high-voltage charging, meanwhile Mg ions in the transition metal layer can destroy charge ordering. More importantly, Mg ion occupation in both sodium and transition metal layers will be able to create ""Na-O-Mg"" and ""Mg-O-Mg"" configurations in layered structures, resulting in ionic O 2p character, which allocates these O 2p states on top of those interacting with transition metals in the O-valence band, thus promoting reversible oxygen redox. This innovative design contributes smooth voltage profiles and high structural stability. Na0.7Mg0.05[Mn0.6Ni0.2Mg0.15]O2 exhibits superior electrochemical performance, especially good capacity retention at high current rate under a high cutoff voltage (4.2 V). A new P2 phase is formed after charge, rather than an O2 phase for the unsubstituted material. Besides, multiple intermediate phases are observed during high-rate charging. Na-ion transport kinetics are mainly affected by elemental-related redox couples and structural reorganization. These findings will open new opportunities for designing and optimizing layer-structured cathodes for sodium-ion batteries.",2
Principles Governing Catalytic Activity of Self-Assembled Short Peptides.,"Molecular self-assembly provides a chemical strategy for the synthesis of nanostructures by using the principles of nature, and peptides serve as the promising building blocks to construct adaptable molecular architectures. Recently, a series of heptapeptides with alternative hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues were reported to form amyloid-like structures, which are capable of catalyzing acyl ester hydrolysis with remarkable efficiency. However, information remains elusive about the atomic structures of the fibrils. What is the origin of the sequence-dependent catalytic activity? How is the ester hydrolysis catalyzed by the fibrils? In this work, the atomic structures of the aggregates were determined by using molecular modeling and further validated by solid-state NMR experiments, where the fibril with high activity adopts twisted parallel configuration within each layer, and the one with low activity is in flat antiparallel configuration. The polymorphism originates from the interactions between different regions of the building block peptides, where the delicate balance between rigidity and flexibility plays an important role. We further show that the p-nitrophenylacetate ( pNPA) hydrolysis reactions catalyzed by two different fibrils follow a similar mechanism, and the difference in microenvironment at the active site between the natural enzyme and the present self-assembled fibrils should account for the discrepancy in catalytic activities. The present work provides understanding of the structure and function of self-assembled fibrils formed with short peptides at an atomic level and thus sheds new insight on designing aggregates with better functions.",2
Complex Molecules That Fold Like Proteins Can Emerge Spontaneously.,"Folding can bestow macromolecules with various properties, as evident from nature's proteins. Until now complex folded molecules are the product either of evolution or of an elaborate process of design and synthesis. We now show that molecules that fold in a well-defined architecture of substantial complexity can emerge autonomously and selectively from a simple precursor. Specifically, we have identified a self-synthesizing macrocyclic foldamer with a complex and unprecedented secondary and tertiary structure that constructs itself highly selectively from 15 identical peptide-nucleobase subunits, using a dynamic combinatorial chemistry approach. Folding of the structure drives its synthesis in 95% yield from a mixture of interconverting molecules of different ring sizes in a one-step process. Single-crystal X-ray crystallography and NMR reveal a folding pattern based on an intricate network of noncovalent interactions involving residues spaced apart widely in the linear sequence. These results establish dynamic combinatorial chemistry as a powerful approach to developing synthetic molecules with folding motifs of a complexity that goes well beyond that accessible with current design approaches. The fact that such molecules can form autonomously implies that they may have played a role in the origin of life at earlier stages than previously thought possible.",2
A Mild and Direct Site-Selective sp(2) C-H Silylation of (Poly)Azines.,"A base-mediated protocol that allows for the site-selective sp(2) C-H silylation of azines is described. This method is distinguished by its mild conditions, simplicity and excellent site-selective modulation for a diverse set of azines, even in the context of late-stage functionalization, while exhibiting orthogonal reactivity with classical silylation reactions.",2
Harnessing Noncovalent Interactions in Dual-Catalytic Enantioselective Heck-Matsuda Arylation.,"The use of more than one catalyst in one-pot reaction conditions has become a rapidly evolving protocol in the development of asymmetric catalysis. The lack of molecular insights on the mechanism and enantioselectivity in dual-catalytic reactions motivated the present study focusing on an important catalytic asymmetric Heck-Matsuda cross-coupling. A comprehensive density functional theory (M06 and B3LYP-D3) investigation of the coupling between a spirocyclic cyclopentene and 4-fluorophenyl diazonium species under a dual-catalytic condition involving Pd2(dba)3 (dba = trans, trans-dibenzylideneacetone) and chiral 2,2'-binaphthyl diamine (BINAM)-derived phosphoric acids (BDPA, 2,2'-binaphthyl diamine-derived phosphoric acids) is presented. Among various mechanistic possibilities examined, the pathway with explicit inclusion of the base (in situ generated sodium bicarbonate/sodium biphosphate) is found to be energetically more preferred over the analogous base-free routes. The chiral phosphate generated by the action of sodium carbonate on BDPA is found to remain associated with the reaction site as a counterion. The initial oxidative addition of Pd(0) to the aryl diazonium bond gives rise to a Pd-aryl intermediate, which then goes through the enantiocontrolling migratory insertion to the cyclic alkene, leading to an arylated cycloalkene intermediate. Insights on how a series of noncovalent interactions, such as C-H...O, C-H...N, C-H...F, C-H...pi, lp...pi, O-H...pi, and C-F...pi, in the enantiocontrolling transition state (TS) render the migration of the Pd-aryl to the si prochiral face of the cyclic alkene more preferred over that to the re face are utilized for modulating the enantioselectivity. Aided by molecular insights on the enantiocontrolling transition states, we predicted improved enantioselectivity from 37% to 89% by changes in the N-aryl substituents of the catalyst. Subsequent experiments in our laboratory offered very good agreement with the predicted enantioselectivities.",2
Kinetic Resolution of Allylic Alcohol with Chiral BINOL-Based Alkoxides: A Combination of Experimental and Theoretical Studies.,"The development and characterization of enantioselective catalytic kinetic resolution of allylic alcohols through asymmetric isomerization with chiral BINOL derivatives-based alkoxides as bifunctional Bronsted base catalysts were described in the study. A number of chiral BINOL derivatives-based alkoxides were synthesized, and their structure-enantioselectivity correlation study in asymmetric isomerization identified a promising chiral Bronsted base catalyst, which afforded various chiral secondary allylic alcohols (ee up to 99%, S factor up to >200). In the mechanistic study, alkoxide species were identified as active species and the phenol group of BINOL largely affected the high reactivity and enantioselectivity via hydrogen bonding between the chiral Bronsted base catalyst and substrates. The strategy is the first successful synthesis strategy of various chiral secondary allylic alcohols through enantioselective transition-metal-free base-catalyzed isomerization. The applicability of the strategy had been demonstrated by the synthesis of the bioactive natural product (+)-veraguensin.",2
Pressure-Engineered Structural and Optical Properties of Two-Dimensional (C4H9NH3)2PbI4 Perovskite Exfoliated nm-Thin Flakes.,"Resolving the structure-property relationships of two-dimensional (2D) organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites is essential for the development of photovoltaic and photoelectronic devices. Here, pressure (0-10 GPa) was applied to 2D hybrid perovskite flakes mechanically exfoliated from butylammonium lead halide single crystals, (C4H9NH3)2PbI4, from which we observed a series of changes of the strong excitonic emissions in the photoluminescence spectra. By correlating with in situ high-pressure X-ray diffraction results, we examine successfully the relationship between structural modifications in the inorganic PbI4(2-) layer and their excitonic properties. During the transition between Pbca (1b) phase and Pbca (1a) phase at around 0.1 GPa, the decrease in Pb-I-Pb bond angle and increase in Pb-I bond length lead to an abrupt blue shift of the excitonic bandgap. The presence of the P21/a phase above 1.4 GPa increases the Pb-I-Pb bond angle and decreases the Pb-I bond length, leading to a deep red shift of the excitonic bandgap. The total band gap narrowing of approximately 350 meV to 2.03 eV at 5.3 GPa before amorphization, facilitates (C4H9NH3)2PbI4 as a much better solar absorber. Moreover, phase transitions inevitably modify the carrier lifetime of (C4H9NH3)2PbI4, where an initial 150 ps at ambient phase is prolongated to 190 ps in the Pbca (1a) phase along with enhanced photoluminescence (PL), originating from pressure-induced strong radiative recombination of trapped excitons.The onset of P21/a phase shortens significantly the carrier lifetime to 53 ps along with a weak PL emission due to pressure-induced severe lattice distortion and amorphization. High-pressure study on (C4H9NH3)2PbI4 nm-thin flakes may provide insights into the mechanisms for synthetically designing novel 2D hybrid perovskite based photoelectronic devices and solar cells.",2
How Does the Oxidation State of Palladium Surfaces Affect the Reactivity and Selectivity of Direct Synthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide from Hydrogen and Oxygen Gases? A Density Functional Study.,"Direct synthesis of H2O2 from H2 and O2 is an environmentally benign and atom economic process and as such is the ideal pathway in catalysis. However, currently no low-cost pathway of this kind of catalysis exists, although it would be an attractive alternative strategy to the common industrial anthraquinone method for H2O2 production. Metal-based catalysts are widely employed in such a direct synthesis process but often need to be oxidized, alloyed, or supplied with additives to make them selective. To understand the metal-oxidation state in heterogeneous catalysis, we studied the selective oxidation of hydrogen by molecular oxygen on Pd(111) and PdO(101) surfaces, leading to either H2O2 or H2O products. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that the oxidized PdO(101) surface clearly shows better performance and selectivity, as compared to the reduced Pd(111) one. The activation barrier on the oxidized Pd surface is ca. 0.2 eV lower than the one on the reduced Pd surface. On the oxidized surface, the H2O2 synthesis route is preferred, while, on the reduced surface, the H2O route is predominant. The decomposition of H2O2 is also greatly inhibited on the oxidized surface. We analyzed the different pathways in detail through thermochemical cycles, which establishes that the oxidized surface shows weaker adsorption ability toward the reagents O2 and H2, the key intermediate OOH, and also the product H2O2 in comparison with the Pd(111) surface, which we believe affect the selectivity. The work presented here clearly shows that the oxidation state of metal surfaces is one of the most important factors that tunes the catalysis of a chemical reaction and can affect the selectivity and reaction patterns dramatically.",2
What Are the Radical Intermediates in Oxidative N-Heterocyclic Carbene Organocatalysis?,"The oxidation of the Breslow intermediate resulting from the addition of an N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) to benzaldehyde triggers a fast deprotonation, followed by a second electron transfer, directly affording the corresponding acylium at E > -0.8 V (versus Fc/Fc(+)). Similarly, the oxidation of the cinnamaldehyde analogue occurs at an even higher potential and is not a reversible electrochemical process. As a whole, and contrary to previous beliefs, it is demonstrated that Breslow intermediates, which are the key intermediates in NHC-catalyzed transformations of aldehydes, cannot undergo a single electron transfer (SET) with mild oxidants ( E < -1.0 V). Moreover, the corresponding enol radical cations are ruled out as relevant intermediates. It is proposed that oxidative NHC-catalyzed radical transformations of enals proceed either through SET from the corresponding electron-rich enolate or through coupled electron-proton transfer from the enol, in any case generating neutral capto-dative radicals. Relevant electrochemical surrogates of these paramagnetic species have been isolated.",2
Total Synthesis of Herquline B and C.,"The total syntheses of (-)-herquline B (2) and a heretofore-unrecognized congener, (+)-herquline C (3), are described. The syntheses require 14 and 13 steps, respectively, and feature a key oxazoline reduction that sets the stage for piperazine construction.",2
Asymmetric Catalysis Using Aromatic Aldehydes as Chiral alpha-Alkoxyalkyl Anions.,"We have developed a new umpolung strategy for catalytically forming a chiral alpha-alkoxyalkyl anion from an aromatic aldehyde for use in asymmetric synthesis. The reaction between aromatic aldehydes and aryl or allyl electrophiles with a silylboronate utilizing a chiral copper-N-heterocyclic carbene catalyst and a palladium-bisphosphine catalyst in a synergistic manner occurred with high enantioselectivities to deliver the three-component coupling products, chiral silyl-protected secondary alcohol derivatives. Our method features the catalytic generation of enantioenriched chiral alpha-alkoxyalkylcopper(I) intermediates from aldehydes and their subsequent palladium-catalyzed stereospecific cross-coupling.",2
Diamantane Suspended Single Copper Atoms.,"Single chains of metal atoms are expected to be perfect one-dimensional nanowires in nanotechnology, due to their quantum nature including tunable electronic or spin coupling strengths. However, it is still rather difficult to fabricate such nanowires with metallic atoms under directional and separation control. Here, we succeeded in building higher-order single diamondoid-chains from the lower-order chains using a chemically well-controlled approach that employs diamondoids on metal surfaces. This approach results in higher-order diamondoid double chains by linking two neighboring single chains, and ultimately forms a central chain consisting of single Cu atoms suspended by the diamantane framework. The suspended Cu atoms are placed above the metal surface with a periodic distance of 0.67 +/- 0.01 nm. Our bottom-up approach will allow detailed experimental investigations of the properties of these exciting suspended metal atoms (for example, quantized conductance, spin coupling, as well as transfer, etc.). Furthermore, we also identified different spatial configurations on the metal surfaces in on-surface reaction processes using high-resolution AFM imaging and density functional theory computations. Our findings broaden the on-surface synthesis concept from 2D planar aromatic molecules to 3D bulky aliphatic molecules.",2
Chemoselective methylene oxidation in aromatic molecules.,"Despite significant progress in the development of site-selective aliphatic C-H oxidations over the past decade, the ability to oxidize strong methylene C-H bonds in the presence of more oxidatively labile aromatic functionalities remains a major unsolved problem. Such chemoselective reactivity is highly desirable for enabling late-stage oxidative derivatizations of pharmaceuticals and medicinally important natural products that often contain such functionality. Here, we report a simple manganese small-molecule catalyst Mn(CF3-PDP) system that achieves such chemoselectivity via an unexpected synergy of catalyst design and acid additive. Preparative remote methylene oxidation is obtained in 50 aromatic compounds housing medicinally relevant halogen, oxygen, heterocyclic and biaryl moieties. Late-stage methylene oxidation is demonstrated on four drug scaffolds, including the ethinylestradiol scaffold where other non-directed C-H oxidants that tolerate aromatic groups effect oxidation at only activated tertiary benzylic sites. Rapid generation of a known metabolite (piragliatin) from an advanced intermediate is demonstrated.",2
The reductive C3 functionalization of pyridinium and quinolinium salts through iridium-catalysed interrupted transfer hydrogenation.,"Aromatic rings are ubiquitous in organic chemistry and form the basis of many commercial products. Despite the numerous routes available for the preparation of aromatic compounds, there remain few methods that allow their conversion into synthetically useful partially saturated derivatives and even fewer that allow new C-C bonds to be formed at the same time. Here we set out to address this problem and uncover a unique catalytic partial reduction reaction that forms partially saturated azaheterocycles from aromatic precursors. In this reaction, methanol and formaldehyde are used for the reductive functionalization of pyridines and quinolines using catalytic iridium; thus, inexpensive and renewable feedstocks are utilized in the formation of complex N-heterocycles. By harnessing the formation of a nucleophilic enamine intermediate, the C-C bond-forming process reverses the normal pattern of reactivity and allows access to the C3 position of the arene. Mechanistic investigations using D-labelling experiments reveal the source of hydride added to the ring and show the reversible nature of the iridium-hydride addition.",2
Cobalt-Catalyzed Electrophilic Aminations with Anthranils: An Expedient Route to Condensed Quinolines.,"The reaction of various organozinc pivalates with anthranils provides anilines derivatives, which cyclize under acidic conditions providing condensed quinolines. Using alkenylzinc pivalates, electron-rich arylzinc pivalates or heterocyclic zinc pivalates produces directly the condensed quinolines of which several structures belong to new heterocyclic scaffolds. These N-heterocycles are of particular interest for organic light emitting diodes with their high photoluminescence quantum yields and long exciton lifetimes as well as for hole-transporting materials in methylammonium lead iodide perovskites solar cells due to an optimal band alignment for holes and a large bandgap.",2
A Mononuclear Nonheme Iron(IV)-Amido Complex Relevant for the Compound II Chemistry of Cytochrome P450.,"A mononuclear nonheme iron(IV)-amido complex bearing a tetraamido macrocyclic ligand, [(TAML)Fe(IV)(NHTs)](-) (1), was synthesized via a hydrogen atom (H atom) abstraction reaction of an iron(V)-imido complex, [(TAML)Fe(V)(NTs)](-) (2), and fully characterized using various spectroscopies. We then investigated (1) the p Ka of 1, (2) the reaction of 1 with a carbon-centered radical, and (3) the H atom abstraction reaction of 1. To the best of our knowledge, the present study reports for the first time the synthesis and chemical properties/reactions of a high-valent iron(IV)-amido complex.",2
Spatial Presentation of Cholesterol Units on a DNA Cube as a Determinant of Membrane Protein-Mimicking Functions.,"Cells use membrane proteins as gatekeepers to transport ions and molecules, catalyze reactions, relay signals, and interact with other cells. DNA nanostructures with lipidic anchors are promising as membrane protein mimics because of their high tunability. However, the design features specifying DNA nanostructures' functions in lipid membranes are yet to be fully understood. Here, we show that altering patterns of cholesterol units on a cubic DNA scaffold dramatically changes its interaction mode with lipid membranes. This results in simple design rules that allow a single DNA nanostructure to reproduce multiple membrane protein functions: peripheral anchoring, nanopore behavior, and conformational switching to reveal membrane-binding units. Strikingly, the DNA-cholesterol cubes constitute the first open-walled DNA nanopores, as only a quarter of their wall is made of DNA. This functional diversity can increase our fundamental understanding of membrane phenomena and result in sensing, drug delivery, and cell manipulation tools.",2
Kinetics of the Topochemical Transformation of (PbSe) m(TiSe2) n(SnSe2) m(TiSe2) n to (Pb0.5Sn0.5Se) m(TiSe2) n.,"Solid-state reaction kinetics on atomic length scales have not been heavily investigated due to the long times, high reaction temperatures, and small reaction volumes at interfaces in solid-state reactions. All of these conditions present significant analytical challenges in following reaction pathways. Herein we use in situ and ex situ X-ray diffraction, in situ X-ray reflectivity, high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy to investigate the mechanistic pathways for the formation of a layered (Pb0.5Sn0.5Se)1+delta(TiSe2) m heterostructure, where m is the varying number of TiSe2 layers in the repeating structure. Thin film precursors were vapor deposited as elemental-modulated layers into an artificial superlattice with Pb and Sn in independent layers, creating a repeating unit with twice the size of the final structure. At low temperatures, the precursor undergoes only a crystallization event to form an intermediate (SnSe2)1+gamma(TiSe2) m(PbSe)1+delta(TiSe2) m superstructure. At higher temperatures, this superstructure transforms into a (Pb0.5Sn0.5Se)1+delta(TiSe2) m alloyed structure. The rate of decay of superlattice reflections of the (SnSe2)1+gamma(TiSe2) m(PbSe)1+delta(TiSe2) m superstructure was used as the indicator of the progress of the reaction. We show that increasing the number of TiSe2 layers does not decrease the rate at which the SnSe2 and PbSe layers alloy, suggesting that at these temperatures it is reduction of the SnSe2 to SnSe and Se that is rate limiting in the formation of the alloy and not the associated diffusion of Sn and Pb through the TiSe2 layers.",2
Surface Dynamics and Ligand-Core Interactions of Quantum Sized Photoluminescent Gold Nanoclusters.,"Quantum-sized metallic clusters protected by biological ligands represent a new class of luminescent materials; yet the understanding of structural information and photoluminescence origin of these ultrasmall clusters remains a challenge. Herein we systematically study the surface ligand dynamics and ligand-metal core interactions of peptide-protected gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) with combined experimental characterizations and theoretical molecular simulations. We show that the peptide sequence plays an important role in determining the surface peptide structuring, interfacial water dynamics and ligand-Au core interaction, which can be tailored by controlling peptide acetylation, constituent amino acid electron donating/withdrawing capacity, aromaticity/hydrophobicity and by adjusting environmental pH. Specifically, emission enhancement is achieved through increasing the electron density of surface ligands in proximity to the Au core, discouraging photoinduced quenching, and by reducing the amount of surface-bound water molecules. These findings provide key design principles for understanding the surface dynamics of peptide-protected nanoparticles and maximizing the photoluminescence of metallic clusters through the exploitation of biologically relevant ligand properties.",2
Structure-Guided Identification of a Small Molecule That Inhibits Anaerobic Choline Metabolism by Human Gut Bacteria.,"The anaerobic gut microbial pathway that converts choline into trimethylamine (TMA) is broadly linked to human disease. Here, we describe the discovery that betaine aldehyde inhibits TMA production from choline by human gut bacterial isolates and a complex gut community. In vitro assays and a crystal structure suggest betaine aldehyde targets the gut microbial enzyme choline TMA-lyase (CutC). In our system, we do not observe activity for the previously reported CutC inhibitor 3,3-dimethylbutanol (DMB). The workflow we establish for identifying and characterizing betaine aldehyde provides a framework for developing additional inhibitors of gut microbial choline metabolism, including therapeutic candidates.",2
"Anomalous Stoichiometry, 3-D Bridged Triangular/Pentagonal Layered Structured Artificial Antiferromagnet for the Prussian Blue Analogue A3Mn(II)5(CN)13 (A = NMe4, NEtMe3). A Cation Adaptive Structure.","The size of the organic cation dictates both the composition and the extended 3-D structure for hybrid organic/inorganic Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) of A aMn(II) b(CN) a+2 b (A = cation) stoichiometry. Alkali PBAs are typically cubic with both MC6 and M'N6 octahedral coordination sites and the alkali cation content depends on the M and M' oxidation states. The reaction of Mn(II)(O2CCH3)2 and A(+)CN(-) (A = NMe4, NEtMe3) forms a hydrated material of A3Mn(II)5(CN)13 composition. A3Mn(II)5(CN)13 forms a complex, 3-D extended structural motif with octahedral and rarely observed square pyramidal and trigonal bipyramidal Mn(II) sites with a single layer motif of three pentagonal and one triangular fused rings. A complex pattern of Mn(II)CN chains bridge the layers. (NMe4)3Mn(II)5(CN)13 possesses one low-spin octahedral and four high-spin pentacoordinate Mn(II) sites and orders as an antiferromagnet at 11 K due to the layers being bridged and antiferromagnetically coupled by the nonmagnetic cyanides. These are rare examples of intrinsic, chemically prepared and controlled artificial antiferromagnets and have the advantage of having controlled uniform spacing between the layers as they are not physically prepared via deposition methods. A3Mn5(CN)13 (A = NMe4, NEtMe3) along with [NEt4]2Mn(II)3(CN)8, [NEt4]Mn(II)3(CN)7, and Mn(CN)2 form stoichiometrically related A aMn(II) b(CN) a+2 b ( a = 0, b = 1; a = 2, b = 3; a = 1, b = 3; and a = 3, b = 5) series possessing unprecedented stoichiometries and lattice motifs. These unusual structures and stoichiometries are attributed to the very ionic nature of the high-spin N-bonded Mn(II) ion that enables the maximization of the attractive van der Waals interactions via minimization of void space via a reduced angleMnNC. This A aMn(II) b(CN) a+2 b family of compounds are referred to as being cation adaptive in which size and shape dictate both the stoichiometry and structure.",2
Small-Molecule Fluorescent Probes for Live-Cell Super-Resolution Microscopy.,"Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy is a powerful tool to visualize biomolecules and cellular structures at the nanometer scale. Employing these techniques in living cells has opened up the possibility to study dynamic processes with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. Different physical approaches to super-resolution microscopy have been introduced over the last years. A bottleneck to apply these approaches for live-cell imaging has become the availability of appropriate fluorescent probes that can be specifically attached to biomolecules. In this Perspective, we discuss the role of small-molecule fluorescent probes for live-cell super-resolution microscopy and the challenges that need to be overcome for their generation. Recent trends in the development of labeling strategies are reviewed together with the required chemical and spectroscopic properties of the probes. Finally, selected examples of the use of small-molecule fluorescent probes in live-cell super-resolution microscopy are given.",2
Metal-Free Transfer Hydroiodination of C-C Multiple Bonds.,"The design and a gram-scale synthesis of a bench-stable cyclohexa-1,4-diene-based surrogate of gaseous hydrogen iodide are described. By initiation with a moderately strong Bronsted acid, hydrogen iodide is transferred from the surrogate onto C-C multiple bonds such as alkynes and allenes without the involvement of free hydrogen iodide. The surrogate fragments into toluene and ethylene, easy-to-remove volatile waste. This hydroiodination reaction avoids precarious handling of hydrogen iodide or hydroiodic acid. By this, a broad range of previously unknown or difficult-to-prepare vinyl iodides can be accessed in stereocontrolled fashion.",2
Extended pi-Conjugated Structures via Dehydrative C-C Coupling.,"We describe a methodology for the synthesis of extended aromatic structures through dehydrative C-C coupling from readily accessible diols. Treatment of the diols with a Bronsted acid ( para-toluenesulfonic acid) induces the nucleophilic addition of an arene or heteroarene, yielding fully aromatic products in high to quantitative yields with thiophenes, furan, indole, and N, N-dimethylaniline as coupling partners. The C-C coupling reactions proceed under mild, open flask conditions and offer high atom economy, while providing an attractive alternative approach to metal-catalyzed cross-coupling.",2
Nano-Assemblies from J-Aggregated Dyes: A Stimuli-Responsive Tool Applicable To Living Systems.,"Controlling the packing arrangements of dyes is a facile way of tuning their photophysical and/or photochemical properties, thus enabling new sensing mechanisms for photofunctional tools. Here, we present a general and robust strategy toward water-stable J-aggregated dye-templated nanoassemblies by incorporating an amphiphilic diblock copolymer and a stimuli-responsive dye as the only two building components. An iodo-substituted boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) was adopted as a template to direct the self-assembly of poly(ethylene glycol)- block-polycaprolactone (PEG-PCL), forming a core-shell nanoplate with slip-stacked BODIPYs as core surrounded by hydrophilic PEG shell. The self-assembled nanoplate is stable in cell culture medium and possesses a built-in stimuli-responsiveness that arises from BODIPY bearing meso-carboxylate protecting group, which is efficiently removed upon treatment with peroxynitrite. The resulting negative charges lead to rearrangement of dyes from J-stacking to nonstacking, which activates photoinduced singlet oxygen production from the nanoassemblies. The stimuli-activatable photosensitivity has been exploited for specific photodynamic ablation of activated RAW 264.7 cells with excessive endogenous peroxynitrite. In light of the generality of the sensing mechanism, the concept described herein will significantly expand the palette of design principles to develop diverse photofunctional tools for biological research and clinical needs.",2
His-Ligation to the [4Fe-4S] Subcluster Tunes the Catalytic Bias of [FeFe] Hydrogenase.,"[FeFe] hydrogenases interconvert H2 into protons and electrons reversibly and efficiently. The active site H-cluster is composed of two sites: a unique [2Fe] subcluster ([2Fe]H) covalently linked via cysteine to a canonical [4Fe-4S] cluster ([4Fe-4S]H). Both sites are redox active and electron transfer is proton-coupled, such that the potential of the H-cluster lies very close to the H2 thermodynamic potential, which confers the enzyme with the ability to operate quickly in both directions without energy losses. Here, one of the cysteines coordinating [4Fe-4S]H (Cys362) in the [FeFe] hydrogenase from the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii ( CrHydA1) was exchanged with histidine and the resulting C362H variant was shown to contain a [4Fe-4S] cluster with a more positive redox potential than the wild-type. The change in the [4Fe-4S] cluster potential resulted in a shift of the catalytic bias, diminishing the H2 production activity but giving significantly higher H2 oxidation activity, albeit with a 200 mV overpotential requirement. These results highlight the importance of the [4Fe-4S] cluster as an electron injection site, modulating the redox potential and the catalytic properties of the H-cluster.",2
Changes in Regioselectivity of H Atom Abstraction during the Hydroxylation and Cyclization Reactions Catalyzed by Hyoscyamine 6beta-Hydroxylase.,"Hyoscyamine 6beta-hydroxylase (H6H) is an alphaKG-dependent nonheme iron oxidase that catalyzes the oxidation of hyoscyamine to scopolamine via two separate reactions: hydroxylation followed by oxidative cyclization. Both of these reactions are expected to involve H atom abstraction from each of two adjacent carbon centers (C6 vs C7) in the substrate. During hydroxylation, there is a roughly 85:1 preference for H atom abstraction from C6 versus C7; however, this inverts to a 1:16 preference during cyclization. Furthermore, (18)O incorporation experiments in the presence of deuterated substrate are consistent with the catalytic iron(IV)-oxo complex being able to support the coordination of an additional ligand during hydroxylation. These observations suggest that subtle differences in the substrate binding configuration can have significant consequences for the catalytic cycle of H6H.",2
"Binding of the Bacterial Adhesin FimH to Its Natural, Multivalent High-Mannose Type Glycan Targets.","Multivalent carbohydrate-lectin interactions at host-pathogen interfaces play a crucial role in the establishment of infections. Although competitive antagonists that prevent pathogen adhesion are promising antimicrobial drugs, the molecular mechanisms underlying these complex adhesion processes are still poorly understood. Here, we characterize the interactions between the fimbrial adhesin FimH from uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains and its natural high-mannose type N-glycan binding epitopes on uroepithelial glycoproteins. Crystal structures and a detailed kinetic characterization of ligand-binding and dissociation revealed that the binding pocket of FimH evolved such that it recognizes the terminal alpha(1-2)-, alpha(1-3)-, and alpha(1-6)-linked mannosides of natural high-mannose type N-glycans with similar affinity. We demonstrate that the 2000-fold higher affinity of the domain-separated state of FimH compared to its domain-associated state is ligand-independent and consistent with a thermodynamic cycle in which ligand-binding shifts the association equilibrium between the FimH lectin and the FimH pilin domain. Moreover, we show that a single N-glycan can bind up to three molecules of FimH, albeit with negative cooperativity, so that a molar excess of accessible N-glycans over FimH on the cell surface favors monovalent FimH binding. Our data provide pivotal insights into the adhesion properties of uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains to their target receptors and a solid basis for the development of effective FimH antagonists.",2
Primary Anion-pi Catalysis and Autocatalysis.,"Epoxide-opening ether cyclizations are shown to occur on pi-acidic aromatic surfaces without the need of additional activating groups and with autocatalytic amplification. Increasing activity with the intrinsic pi acidity of benzenes, naphthalenediimides (NDIs) and perylenediimides (PDIs) support that anion-pi interactions account for function. Rate enhancements maximize at 270 for anion-pi catalysis on fullerenes and at 5100 M(-1) for autocatalysis. The occurrence of anion-pi autocatalysis is confirmed with increasing initial rates in the presence of additional product. Computational studies on autocatalysis reveal transition state and product forming a hydrogen-bonded noncovalent macrocycle, like holding their hands and dancing on the active pi surface, with epoxide opening and nucleophile being activated by anion-pi interactions and hydrogen bonds to the product, respectively.",2
Realizing High Thermoelectric Performance in p-Type SnSe through Crystal Structure Modification.,"The simple binary compound SnSe has been reported as a robust thermoelectric material for energy conversion by showing strong anharmonicity and multiple electronic valence bands. Herein, we report a record-high average ZT value of approximately 1.6 at 300-793 K with maximum ZT values ranging from 0.8 at 300 K to 2.1 at 793 K in p-type SnSe crystals. This remarkable thermoelectric performance arises from the enhanced power factor and lowered lattice thermal conductivity through crystal structure modification via Te alloying. Our results elucidate that Te alloying increases the carrier mobility by making the bond lengths more nearly equal and sharpening the valence bands; meanwhile, the Seebeck coefficient remains large due to multiple valence bands. As a result, a record-high power factor of approximately 55 muW cm(-1) K(-2) at 300 K is achieved. Additionally, Te alloying promotes Sn atom displacements, thus leading to a lower lattice thermal conductivity. Our conclusions are well supported by electron localization function calculations, the Callaway model, and structural characterization via aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy. Our approach of modifying crystal structures could also be applied in other low-symmetry thermoelectric materials and represents a new strategy to enhance thermoelectric performance.",2
"Well-Designed Phosphine-Urea Ligand for Highly Diastereo- and Enantioselective 1,3-Dipolar Cycloaddition of Methacrylonitrile: A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Study.","A novel chiral phosphine-urea bifunctional ligand has been developed for Cu-catalyzed asymmetric 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of iminoesters with methacrylonitrile, a long-standing challenging substrate in asymmetric catalysis. Distortion-interaction energy analysis based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveals that the distortion energy plays an important role in the observed enantioselectivity, which can be attributed to the steric effect between the phosphine ligand and the dipole reactant. DFT calculations also indicate that nucleophilic addition is the enantioselectivity-determining step and hydrogen bonding between the urea moiety and methacrylonitrile assists in control of the diastereo- and enantioselectivity. By a combination of metal catalysis and organocatalysis, excellent diastereo- and enantioselectivities (up to 99:1 diastereomeric ratio, 99% enantiomeric excess) as well as good yields are achieved. A wide range of substitution patterns of both iminoester and acrylonitrile is tolerated by this catalyst system, providing access to a series of highly substituted chiral cyanopyrrolidines with up to two quaternary stereogenic centers. The synthetic utility is demonstrated by enantioselective synthesis of antitumor agent ETP69 with a pivotal nitrile pharmacophore and an all-carbon quaternary stereogenic center.",2
Stereospecific Alkene Aziridination Using a Bifunctional Amino-Reagent: An Aza-Prilezhaev Reaction.,In situ deprotection (TFA) of O-Ts activated N-Boc hydroxylamines triggers intramolecular aziridination of N-tethered alkenes to provide complex N-heterocyclic ring systems. Synthetic and computational studies corroborate a diastereospecific aza-Prilezhaev-type mechanism. The feasibility of related intermolecular alkene aziridinations is also demonstrated.,2
Solid-State Order and Charge Mobility in [5]- to [12]Cycloparaphenylenes.,"We report a computational study of mesoscale morphology and charge-transport properties of radially pi-conjugated cycloparaphenylenes ([ n]CPPs) of various ring sizes ( n = 5-12, where n is the number of repeating phenyl units). These molecules are considered structural constituents of fullerenes and carbon nanotubes. [ n]CPP molecules are nested in a unique fashion in the solid state. Molecular dynamics simulations show that while intramolecular structural stability (order) increases with system size, intermolecular structural stability decreases. Density functional calculations reveal that reorganization energy, an important parameter in charge transfer, decreases as n is increased. Intermolecular charge-transfer electronic couplings in the solid state are relatively weak (due to curved pi-conjugation and loose intermolecular contacts) and are on the same order of magnitude ( approximately 10 meV) for each system. Intrinsic charge-carrier mobilities were simulated from kinetic Monte Carlo simulations; hole mobilities increased with system size and scaled as approximately n(4). We predict that disordered [ n]CPPs exhibit hole mobilities as high as 2 cm(2)/(V.s). Our computations show a strong correlation between reorganization energy and hole mobility (mu approximately lambda(-4)). Quantum mechanical calculations were performed on cofacially stacked molecular pairs for varying phenyl units and reveal that orbital delocalization is responsible for both decreasing reorganization energies and electronic couplings as n is increased.",2
Unraveling Oxygen Evolution on Iron-Doped beta-Nickel Oxyhydroxide: The Key Role of Highly Active Molecular-like Sites.,"The active site for electrocatalytic water oxidation on the highly active iron(Fe)-doped beta-nickel oxyhydroxide (beta-NiOOH) electrocatalyst is hotly debated. Here we characterize the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of an unexplored facet of this material with first-principles quantum mechanics. We show that molecular-like 4-fold-lattice-oxygen-coordinated metal sites on the (1211) surface may very well be the key active sites in the electrocatalysis. The predicted OER overpotential (etaOER) for a Fe-centered pathway is reduced by 0.34 V relative to a Ni-centered one, consistent with experiments. We further predict unprecedented, near-quantitative lower bounds for the etaOER, of 0.48 and 0.14 V for pure and Fe-doped beta-NiOOH(1211), respectively. Our hybrid density functional theory calculations favor a heretofore unpredicted pathway involving an iron(IV)-oxo species, Fe(4+)=O. We posit that an iron(IV)-oxo intermediate that stably forms under a low-coordination environment and the favorable discharge of Ni(3+) to Ni(2+) are key to beta-NiOOH's OER activity.",2
Kinetics of the Strongly Correlated CH3O + O2 Reaction: The Importance of Quadruple Excitations in Atmospheric and Combustion Chemistry.,"Kinetics measurements on radical-radical reactions are often unavailable experimentally, and obtaining quantitative rate constants for such reactions by theoretical methods is challenging because the transition states and the reactants are often strongly correlated. Treating strongly correlated systems by coupled cluster theory limited to single, double, and triple connected excitations is often inadequate. We therefore use a new method, called GMM(P), for extrapolation to the complete configuration interaction limit to go beyond triple excitations and in particular to approximate the CCSDTQ(P)/CBS limit. Here, we present this method and use it to investigate the CH3O + O2 reaction. The contribution of connected quadruple excitations to the barrier height energy is found to be -3.13 kcal/mol, and adding a quasiperturbative calculation of the effect of connected pentuple excitations brings the post-connected-triples contributions to -3.44 kcal/mol, which corresponds to Boltzmann factors that increase calculated rate constants by factors of 1.0 x 10(3), 3.3 x 10(2), and 18 at 250, 298, and 600 K, respectively. We present rate constants for temperatures from 250 to 2000 K, and we find that the Arrhenius activation energy increases from 0.58 to 9.68 kcal/mol over this range. We also find reasonably good accuracy for the barrier height with the MN15-L exchange-correlation functional, and we calculate rate constants by a combination of GMM(P) and MN15-L electronic structure calculations and conventional and variational transition state theory, in particular canonical variational theory with small-curvature tunneling. The present findings have broad implications for obtaining quantitative rate constants for complex reaction systems in atmospheric and combustion chemistry.",2
A Probe-Enabled Approach for the Selective Isolation and Characterization of Functionally Active Subpopulations in the Gut Microbiome.,"Commensal microorganisms in the mammalian gut play important roles in host health and physiology, but a central challenge remains in achieving a detailed mechanistic understanding of specific microbial contributions to host biochemistry. New function-based approaches are needed that analyze gut microbial function at the molecular level by coupling detection and measurements of in situ biochemical activity with identification of the responsible microbes and enzymes. We developed a platform employing beta-glucuronidase selective activity-based probes to detect, isolate, and identify microbial subpopulations in the gut responsible for this xenobiotic metabolism. We find that metabolic activity of gut microbiota can be plastic and that between individuals and during perturbation, phylogenetically disparate populations can provide beta-glucuronidase activity. Our work links biochemical activity with molecular-scale resolution without relying on genomic inference.",2
Frustrated Lewis Pair Catalyzed Hydrogenation of Amides: Halides as Active Lewis Base in the Metal-Free Hydrogen Activation.,"A method for the metal-free reduction of carboxylic amides using oxalyl chloride as an activating agent and hydrogen as the final reductant is introduced. The reaction proceeds via the hydrogen splitting by B(2,6-F2-C6H3)3 in combination with chloride as the Lewis base. Density functional theory calculations support the unprecedented role of halides as active Lewis base components in the frustrated Lewis pair mediated hydrogen activation. The reaction displays broad substrate scope for tertiary benzoic acid amides and alpha-branched carboxamides.",2
Solution Processing for Lateral Transition-Metal Dichalcogenides Homojunction from Polymorphic Crystal.,"Homojunctions comprised of transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMD) polymorphs are attractive building blocks for next-generation two-dimensional (2D) electronic circuitry. However, the synthesis of such homojunctions, which usually involves elaborate manipulation at the nanoscale, still remains a great challenge. Herein, we demonstrated a solution-processing strategy to successfully harvest lateral semiconductor-metal homojunctions with high yield. Specially, through precisely controlled lithiation process, precursors of polymorphic crystal arranged with 1T-2H domains were successfully achieved. A programmed exfoliation procedure was further employed to orderly laminate each phase in the polymorphic crystal, thus leading to 1T-2H TMD homojunction monolayers with sizes up to tens of micrometers. Moreover, the atomically sharp boundaries and superior band alignment improved the device on the basis of the semiconductor-metal homojunction with 50% decrease of electric field strength required in the derivation of state transition. We anticipate that solution processing based on programmed exfoliation would be a powerful tool to produce new configurations of 2D nanomaterials.",2
Effect of Oxidative Damage on Charge and Spin Transport in DNA.,"A Hall device was used for measuring spin polarization on electrons that are either reorganized within the molecules or transmitted through the self-assembled monolayers of DNA adsorbed on the device surface. We were able to observe spin-dependent charge polarization and charge transport through double-stranded DNA of various lengths and through double-stranded DNA containing oxidative damage. We found enhancement in the spin-dependent transport through oxidatively damaged DNA. This phenomenon can be rationalized either by assuming that the damaged DNA is characterized by a higher barrier for conduction or by charge transfer through the DNA being conducted through at least two channels, one involves the bases and is highly conductive but less spin selective, while the other pathway is mainly through the ribophosphate backbone and it is the minor one in terms of charge transmission efficiency, but it is highly spin selective.",2
"Self-Assembled Copper-Amino Acid Nanoparticles for in Situ Glutathione ""AND"" H2O2 Sequentially Triggered Chemodynamic Therapy.","Nanoformulations that can respond to the specific tumor microenvironment (TME), such as a weakly acidic pH, low oxygen, and high glutathione (GSH), show promise for killing cancer cells with minimal invasiveness and high specificity. In this study, we demonstrate self-assembled copper-amino acid mercaptide nanoparticles (Cu-Cys NPs) for in situ glutathione-activated and H2O2-reinforced chemodynamic therapy for drug-resistant breast cancer. After endocytosis into tumor cells, the Cu-Cys NPs could first react with local GSH, induce GSH depletion, and reduce Cu(2+) to Cu(+). Subsequently, the generated Cu(+) would react with local H2O2 to generate toxic hydroxyl radicals (.OH) via a Fenton-like reaction, which has a fast reaction rate in the weakly acidic TME, that are responsible for tumor-cell apoptosis. Due to the high GSH and H2O2 concentration in tumor cells, which sequentially triggers the redox reactions, Cu-Cys NPs exhibited relatively high cytotoxicity to cancer cells, whereas normal cells were left alive. The in vivo results also proved that Cu-Cys NPs efficiently inhibited drug-resistant breast cancer without causing obvious systemic toxicity. As a novel copper mercaptide nanoformulation responsive to the TME, these Cu-Cys NPs may have great potential in chemodynamic cancer therapy.",2
Ab Initio Prediction of Proton Exchange Barriers for Alkanes at Bronsted Sites of Zeolite H-MFI.,"A hybrid of high level and low level quantum mechanics (QM) methods has been employed to predict intrinsic and apparent energy barriers for the direct proton exchange mechanism of methane, ethane, propane, n-butane, and i-butane on Bronsted sites of H-MFI. The specific hybrid MP2:PBE+D2 + DeltaCC implementation used is known to yield the so-called ""chemical accuracy"" (+/-4 kJ/mol). Whereas the apparent enthalpy barriers decrease with increasing C number from 104 to 63 kJ/mol, in line with the decreasing heat of adsorption, the intrinsic enthalpy barriers are constant within 124-127 kJ/mol at 500 K. For methane, ethane, propane, and n-butane, we find the expected agreement of apparent barriers with activation energies from batch recirculation reactor experiments. The activation energies derived from NMR experiments (103-113 kJ/mol) are similarly constant as the predicted intrinsic barriers but systematically lower. For i-butane the predicted intrinsic and apparent barriers for the direct proton exchange step are the same as for n-butane with deviations of 2-5 kJ/mol, while the experiments yield values that are 50-60 kJ/mol lower, far outside the estimated range of combined experimental and computational uncertainty (+/-14 kJ/mol). A change to the indirect proton exchange mechanism, in which a hydride ion is transferred between the alkane and a tert-butyl carbenium ion can be excluded, because we confirm previous findings that the barrier for dehydrogenation that would create a tert-butyl cation from i-butane is much too high, 188 and 132 kJ/mol for the intrinsic and apparent enthalpy barriers, respectively, at 500 K. The possible role of extraframework- and framework-bound alumina species is discussed.",2
Energy-Degeneracy-Driven Covalency in Actinide Bonding.,"Evaluating the nature of chemical bonding for actinide elements represents one of the most important and long-standing problems in actinide science. We directly address this challenge and contribute a Cl K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy and relativistic density functional theory study that quantitatively evaluates An-Cl covalency in AnCl6(2-) (An(IV) = Th, U, Np, Pu). The results showed significant mixing between Cl 3p- and An(IV) 5f- and 6d-orbitals (t1u*/t2u* and t2 g*/eg *), with the 6d-orbitals showing more pronounced covalent bonding than the 5f-orbitals. Moving from Th to U, Np, and Pu markedly changed the amount of M-Cl orbital mixing, such that An(IV) 6d - and Cl 3p-mixing decreased and metal 5f - and Cl 3p-orbital mixing increased across this series.",2
Chiral Molecule-mediated Porous Cu xO Nanoparticle Clusters with Antioxidation Activity for Ameliorating Parkinson's Disease.,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the major pathological mechanisms of Parkinson's disease. Using inorganic nanomaterials to scavenge ROS has drawn significant interest and can prevent ROS-mediated neurological disorders. We prepared uniform Cu xO nanoparticle clusters (NCs) with an average size of 65 +/- 7 nm, using phenylalanine (Phe) as the structure-directing agent. These Cu xO NCs functionally mimicked the activities of peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. Because they eliminated ROS, the Cu xO NCs inhibited neurotoxicity in a cellular model of Parkinson's disease and rescued the memory loss of mice with Parkinson's disease. The biocompatibility and multiple enzyme-mimicking activities of Cu xO NCs offer new opportunities for the application of NCs in biomedicine, biosensing, and biocatalysis.",2
TiO2 Nanoparticles Catalyze Oxidation of Huntingtin Exon 1-Derived Peptides Impeding Aggregation: A Quantitative NMR Study of Binding and Kinetics.,"Polyglutamine expansion within the N-terminal region of the huntingtin protein results in the formation of intracellular aggregates responsible for Huntington's disease, a fatal neurodegenerative condition. The interaction between TiO2 nanoparticles and huntingtin peptides comprising the N-terminal amphiphilic domain without (htt(NT)) or with (htt(NT)Q10) a ten-residue C-terminal polyglutamine tract, is investigated by NMR spectroscopy. TiO2 nanoparticles decrease aggregation of htt(NT)Q10 by catalyzing the oxidation of Met(7) to a sulfoxide, resulting in an aggregation-incompetent peptide. The oxidation agent is hydrogen peroxide generated on the surface of the TiO2 nanoparticles either by UV irradiation or at low steady-state levels in the dark. The binding kinetics of nonaggregating htt(NT) to TiO2 nanoparticles is characterized by quantitative analysis of (15)N dark state exchange saturation transfer and lifetime line broadening NMR data. Binding involves a sparsely populated intermediate that experiences hindered rotational diffusion relative to the free state. Catalysis of methionine oxidation within the N-terminal domain of the huntingtin protein may potentially provide a strategy for delaying the onset of Huntington's disease.",2
"Enantioselective Trapping of Pd-Containing 1,5-Dipoles by Photogenerated Ketenes: Access to 7-Membered Lactones Bearing Chiral Quaternary Stereocenters.","An enantioselective [5+2] cycloaddition of vinylethylene carbonates and alpha-diazoketones was achieved for the first time by merging photoactivation and asymmetric Pd catalysis. The key to the success of this method is the enantioselective trapping of Pd-containing, 1,5-dipolar intermediates by ketenes, a class of reactive C2 synthons, which were generated in an in situ and traceless manner under visible light irradiation. Through this trapping, a variety of 7-membered lactones bearing challenging chiral quaternary stereocenters can be accessed in a facile manner with good efficiency and high enantioselectivity (up to 99% yield and 96:4 er).",2
Ultrasmall Abundant Metal-Based Clusters as Oxygen-Evolving Catalysts.,"The oxygen evolution reaction is a crucial step in water electrolysis to develop clean and renewable energy. Although noble metal-based catalysts have demonstrated high activity for the oxygen evolution reaction, their application is limited by their high cost and low availability. Here we report the use of a molecule-to-cluster strategy for preparing ultrasmall trimetallic clusters by using the polyoxometalate molecule as a precursor. Ultrafine (0.8 nm) transition-metal clusters with controllable chemical composition are obtained. The transition-metal clusters enable highly efficient oxygen evolution through water electrolysis in alkaline media, manifested by an overpotential of 192 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 36 mV dec(-1), and long-term stability for 30 h of electrolysis. We note, however, that besides the excellent performance as an oxygen evolution catalyst, our molecule-to-cluster strategy provides a means to achieve well-defined transition-metal clusters in the subnanometer regime, which potentially can have an impact on several other applications.",2
Extended Bis(anthraoxa)quinodimethanes with Nine and Ten Consecutively Fused Six-Membered Rings: Neutral Diradicaloids and Charged Diradical Dianions/Dications.,"We report the challenging synthesis of two very long bis(anthraoxa)quinodimethanes with nine (ABA) and ten (ANA) consecutively fused six-membered rings. The former is stable with negligible diradical character, while the latter with a moderate diradical character ( y0 = 25.0%) is reactive and an unexpected trifluoroacetic substituted product (ANA-TFA) was isolated. X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed a planar backbone with a typical quinoidal character for both. Their dications can be regarded as the isoelectronic structures of the respective nonacene and decacene. The dication ABA(2+) and dianion ABA(2-) are open-shell singlet diradicaloids, while the longer dication ANA-TFA(2+) and dianion ANA(2-) have closed-shell ground state, which can be explained by the different intramolecular Coulomb interactions. Both dianions have a bent backbone and can be considered as an isoelectronic structure of the tetraanion of nonacene and decacene, respectively.",2
High Hole Mobility and Nonsaturating Giant Magnetoresistance in the New 2D Metal NaCu4Se4 Synthesized by a Unique Pathway.,"The new compound NaCu4Se4 forms by the reaction of CuO and Cu in a molten sodium polyselenide flux, with the existence of CuO being unexpectedly critical to its synthesis. It adopts a layered hexagonal structure (space group P63/ mmc with cell parameters a = 3.9931(6) A and c = 25.167(5) A), consisting of infinite two-dimensional [Cu4Se4](-) slabs separated by Na(+) cations. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy suggests that NaCu4Se4 is mixed-valent with the formula (Na(+))(Cu(+))4(Se(2-))(Se(-))(Se2)(2-). NaCu4Se4 is a p-type metal with a carrier density of approximately 10(21) cm(-3) and a high hole mobility of approximately 808 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) at 2 K based on electronic transport measurements. First-principles calculations suggest the density of states around the Fermi level are composed of Cu-d and Se-p orbitals. At 2 K, a very large transverse magnetoresistance of approximately 1400% was observed, with a nonsaturating, linear dependence on field up to 9 T. Our results indicate that the use of metal oxide chemical precursors can open reaction paths to new low-dimensional compounds.",2
Concise Syntheses of Delta(12)-Prostaglandin J Natural Products via Stereoretentive Metathesis.,"Delta(12)-Prostaglandin J family is recently discovered and has potent anticancer activity. Concise syntheses of four Delta(12)-prostaglandin J natural products (7-8 steps in the longest linear sequences) are reported, enabled by convergent stereoretentive cross-metathesis. Exceptional control of alkene geometry was achieved through stereoretention.",2
Ultrathin Conductor Enabling Efficient IR Light CO2 Reduction.,"The concurrent transformation of carbon dioxide and water into hydrocarbons and oxygen by low-photonic-energy IR light still represents a huge challenge. Here, we design an ultrathin conductor system, in which the special partially occupied band serves as the mediator to simultaneously guarantee IR light harvesting and satisfy band-edge positions, while the ultrathin configuration improves charge separation rates and surface redox kinetics. Taking the low cost and earth-abundant CuS as an example, we first fabricate ultrathin CuS layers, where temperature-dependent resistivities, valence-band spectra, and theoretical calculations affirm their metallic nature. Synchrotron-radiation photoelectron and ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared spectra show that metallic CuS atomic layers could realize a new cooperative intraband-interband transition under IR light irradiation, where the generated electrons and holes could simultaneously involve the carbon dioxide reduction and water oxidation reactions. As a result, CuS atomic layers exhibit nearly 100% selective CO production with an evolution rate of 14.5 mumol g(-1) h(-1) under IR light irradiation, while the catalytic performance shows no obvious decay after a 96 h test. Briefly, benefiting from ultrahigh conductivity and a unique partially occupied band, abundant conductor materials such as conducting metal sulfides and metal nitrides hold great promise for applications as effective IR light responsive photocatalysts.",2
Contribution of Cotranslational Folding Defects to Membrane Protein Homeostasis.,"Membrane proteins are prone to misfolding and degradation within the cell, yet the nature of the conformational defects involved in this process remain poorly understood. The earliest stages of membrane protein folding are mediated by the Sec61 translocon, a molecular machine that facilitates the lateral partitioning of the polypeptide into the membrane. Proper membrane integration is an essential prerequisite for folding of the nascent chain. However, the marginal energetic drivers of this reaction suggest the translocon may operate with modest fidelity. In this work, we employed biophysical modeling in conjunction with quantitative biochemical measurements in order to evaluate the extent to which cotranslational folding defects influence membrane protein homeostasis. Protein engineering was employed to selectively perturb the topological energetics of human rhodopsin, and the expression and cellular trafficking of engineered variants were quantitatively compared. Our results reveal clear relationships between topological energetics and the efficiency of rhodopsin biogenesis, which appears to be limited by the propensity of a polar transmembrane domain to achieve its correct topological orientation. Though the polarity of this segment is functionally constrained, we find that its topology can be stabilized in a manner that enhances biogenesis without compromising the functional properties of rhodopsin. Furthermore, sequence alignments reveal this topological instability has been conserved throughout the course of evolution. These results suggest that topological defects significantly contribute to the inefficiency of membrane protein folding in the cell. Additionally, our findings suggest that the marginal stability of rhodopsin may represent an evolved trait.",2
Analysis of TiO2 Atomic Layer Deposition Surface Chemistry and Evidence of Propene Oligomerization Using Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy.,"Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of TiO2 was performed in tandem with in situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to monitor changes in the transient surface species across multiple ALD cycles. A self-assembled monolayer of 3-mercaptopropionic acid was used as a capture agent to ensure that nucleation of the titanium precursor (titanium tetraisopropoxide [TTIP]) occurs. Comparisons between the Raman spectra of the neat precursor and the SER spectra of the first ALD cycle of TiO2 reveal typical ligand exchange chemistry taking place, with self-limiting behavior and intact isopropoxide ligands. However, subsequent cycles show drastically different chemistry, with no isopropoxide ligands remaining at any point during the second and third cycles. Continuous exposure of either TTIP or isopropyl alcohol after the first cycle shows unlimited chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-type growth. Comparisons with alternative precursors (aluminum isopropoxide, titanium tert-butoxide, and titanium propoxide) and DFT calculations reveal that, for the TTIP precursor, isolated TiO2 sites play a role in the dehydration of off-gassing isopropyl alcohol. The resulting propene then undergoes oligomerization into six-carbon olefins before polymerizing into indistinguishable carbon products that accumulate on the surface. The emergence of the dehydration chemistry is expected to be exclusively the result of these isolated TiO2 sites and, as such, is expected to occur on other surfaces where TiO2 ALD is feasible. This work showcases how seemingly innocuous ALD can evolve into a CVD process when the products can participate in various side reactions with newly made surface sites.",2
Discrete Dimers of Redox-Active and Fluorescent Perylene Diimide-Based Rigid Isosceles Triangles in the Solid State.,"The development of rigid covalent chiroptical organic materials, with multiple, readily available redox states, which exhibit high photoluminescence, is of particular importance in relation to both organic electronics and photonics. The chemically stable, thermally robust, and redox-active perylene diimide (PDI) fluorophores have received ever-increasing attention owing to their excellent fluorescence quantum yields in solution. Planar PDI derivatives, however, generally suffer from aggregation-caused emission quenching in the solid state. Herein, we report on the design and synthesis of two chiral isosceles triangles, wherein one PDI fluorophore and two pyromellitic diimide (PMDI) or naphthalene diimide (NDI) units are arranged in a rigid cyclic triangular geometry. The optical, electronic, and magnetic properties of the rigid isosceles triangles are fully characterized by a combination of optical spectroscopies, X-ray diffraction (XRD), cyclic voltammetry, and computational modeling techniques. Single-crystal XRD analysis shows that both isosceles triangles form discrete, nearly cofacial PDI-PDI pi-dimers in the solid state. While the triangles exhibit fluorescence quantum yields of almost unity in solution, the dimers in the solid state exhibit very weak-yet at least an order of magnitude higher-excimer fluorescence yield in comparison with the almost completely quenched fluorescence of a reference PDI. The triangle containing both NDI and PDI subunits shows superior intramolecular energy transfer from the lowest excited singlet state of the NDI to that of the PDI subunit. Cyclic voltammetry suggests that both isosceles triangles exhibit multiple, easily accessible, and reversible redox states. Applications beckon in arenas related to molecular optoelectronic devices.",2
Metal Oxide/(oxy)hydroxide Overlayers as Hole Collectors and Oxygen-Evolution Catalysts on Water-Splitting Photoanodes.,"Solar water splitting provides a mechanism to convert and store solar energy in the form of stable chemical bonds. Water-splitting systems often include semiconductor photoanodes, such as n-Fe2O3 and n-BiVO4, which use photogenerated holes to oxidize water. These photoanodes often exhibit improved performance when coated with metal-oxide/(oxy)hydroxide overlayers that are catalytic for the water-oxidation reaction. The mechanism for this improvement, however, remains a controversial topic. This is, in part, due to a lack of experimental techniques that are able to directly track the flow of photogenerated holes in such multicomponent systems. In this Perspective, we illustrate how this issue can be addressed by using a second working electrode to make direct current/voltage measurements on the catalytic overlayer during operation in a photoelectrochemical cell. We discuss examples where the second working electrode is a thin metallic film deposited on the catalyst layer, as well as where it is the tip of a conducting atomic-force-microscopy probe. In applying these techniques to multiple semiconductors (Fe2O3, BiVO4, Si) paired with various metal-(oxy)hydroxide overlayers (e.g., Ni(Fe)O xH y and CoO xH y), we found in all cases investigated that the overlayers collect photogenerated holes from the semiconductor, charging to potentials sufficient to drive water oxidation. The overlayers studied thus form charge-separating heterojunctions with the semiconductor as well as serve as water-oxidation catalysts.",2
Competition between Normative and Drug-Induced Virus Self-Assembly Observed with Single-Particle Methods.,"Disruption of virus capsid assembly has compelling antiviral potential that has been applied to hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV core protein assembly can be modulated by heteroaryldihydropyrimidines (HAPs), and such molecules are collectively termed core protein allosteric modulators (CpAMs). Although the antiviral effects of CpAMs are acknowledged, the mechanism of action remains an open question. Challenging aspects of characterizing misdirected assembly are the large size and nonuniform nature of the final particles. In this study of HBV assembly, we observed a competition between normative and CpAM-induced aberrant assembly with electron microscopy and resistive-pulse sensing on nanofluidic devices. This competition was a function of the strength of the association energy between individual core proteins, which is proportional to ionic strength. At strong association energy, assembly reactions primarily yielded morphologically normal HBV capsids, despite the presence of HAP-TAMRA. At weak association energy, HAP-TAMRA led to increased assembly product size and disrupted morphology. The smallest particles were T = 4 icosahedra, whereas the larger particles were defective spheres, ellipsoids, and bacilliform cylinders, with regions of T = 4 geometry interspersed with flat regions. Deviation from spherical geometry progressively increased with particle size, which is consistent with the interpretation of a competition between two alternative assembly pathways.",2
Chemical Requirement for Extracting Energetic Charge Carriers from Plasmonic Metal Nanoparticles to Perform Electron-Transfer Reactions.,"Performing electron-transfer reactions on metal nanoparticles requires separation of charge carriers at the nanoparticle and their transfer to the reacting molecules. Inducing these reactions using light is challenging due to the exceedingly short lifetimes of energetic charge carriers formed in metal nanoparticles under light illumination. The results described here show that certain conditions must be met to drive these electron-transfer reactions on plasmonic nanoparticles. One critical requirement is that the process of electronic excitation takes place at the nanoparticle/molecule interface. This is accomplished by high plasmonic electric fields at the surface of plasmonic nanoparticles. Furthermore, it is also evident from our study that the electron (or hole)-donating capacity of the hole (or electron) scavengers needs to be high enough to allow for the extraction of holes (or electrons) from the nanoparticle/molecule complex, therefore completing the catalytic cycle. We discuss these findings through a case study of the conversion of methylene blue (MB) into a reduced MB ion radical on the surface of plasmonic Ag and Ag-Pt core-shell nanoparticles. To directly monitor the reduction reaction of MB on the nanoparticle surfaces, we have used time-dependent in situ surface-enhanced Raman scattering measurement, which also informs us about the underlying mechanistic details of plasmon-driven charge transfer.",2
Chemical Interventions for the Opioid Crisis: Key Advances and Remaining Challenges.,"The present United States opioid crisis requires urgent and innovative scientific intervention. This perspective highlights a role for the chemical sciences by expounding upon three key research areas identified as priorities by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). Specifically, important advances in chemical interventions for overdose reversal, strategies for opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment, including immunopharmacotherapies, and next-generation alternatives for pain management will be discussed. Ultimately, progress made will be presented in light of remaining challenges for the field.",2
"Heterologous and in Vitro Reconstitution of Fuscanodin, a Lasso Peptide from Thermobifida fusca.","Lasso peptides are a class of ribosomally derived natural products typified by their threaded rotaxane structure. The conversion of a linear precursor peptide into a lasso peptide structure requires two enzymatic activities: cleavage of the precursor via a cysteine protease and cyclization via isopeptide bond formation. In vitro studies of lasso peptide enzymology have been hampered by difficulties in obtaining pure, soluble enzymes. We reasoned that thermophilic bacteria would be a good source for well-behaved lasso peptide biosynthetic enzymes. The genome of the thermophilic actinobacterium Thermobifida fusca encodes for a lasso peptide with an unprecedented Trp residue at its N-terminus, a peptide we have named fuscanodin. Here we reconstitute fuscanodin biosynthesis in vitro with purified components, establishing a minimal fuscanodin synthetase. These experiments have allowed us to probe the kinetics of lasso peptide biosynthesis for the first time, and we report initial rates of fuscanodin biosynthesis. The fuscanodin biosynthetic enzymes are insensitive to substrate concentration and operate in a near single-turnover regime in vitro. While lasso peptides are often touted for their stability to both chaotropic and thermal challenges, fuscanodin is found to undergo a conformational change consistent with lasso peptide unthreading in organic solvents at room temperature.",2
Regiochemistry of Thiolate for Selenolate Ligand Exchange on Gold Clusters.,"Ligand exchange is a fundamental reaction of metal nanoparticles. Multiple symmetry and kinetic exchange environments are observed for thiolate protected gold nanoparticles, but the correlation between these is unclear. Structural study of ligand exchange on chalcogenide passivated gold clusters has so-far revealed the locations of 10% or fewer of incoming ligands. In a set of 13 crystal structures, we reveal the locations of up to 17 ligands of the 18 ligands in thiolate for selenolate exchanged Au25(SeR)18- x(SR) x clusters. Overall, we see a distinct preference for the locations of thiolate and selenolate ligands that emerges over time. This most-comprehensive to-date structural study of ligand exchange on gold clusters evidences a structural basis for exchange of solvated ligands, exchange of ligands between clusters, and a net reaction that amounts to translation of ligands on the cluster surface.",2
Fluorescence Enhancement of a Microbial Rhodopsin via Electronic Reprogramming.,"The engineering of microbial rhodopsins with enhanced fluorescence is of great importance in the expanding field of optogenetics. Here we report the discovery of two mutants (W76S/Y179F and L83Q) of a sensory rhodopsin from the cyanobacterium Anabaena PCC7120 with opposite fluorescence behavior. In fact, while W76S/Y179F displays, with respect to the wild-type protein, a nearly 10-fold increase in red-light emission, the second is not emissive. Thus, the W76S/Y179F, L83Q pair offers an unprecedented opportunity for the investigation of fluorescence enhancement in microbial rhodopsins, which is pursued by combining transient absorption spectroscopy and multiconfigurational quantum chemistry. The results of such an investigation point to an isomerization-blocking electronic effect as the direct cause of instantaneous (subpicosecond) fluorescence enhancement.",2
3D Covalent Organic Frameworks of Interlocking 1D Square Ribbons.,"A new mode of mechanical entanglement in extended structures is described where 1D organic ribbons of corner-sharing squares are mutually interlocked to form 3D woven covalent organic framework-500, COF-500. Reaction of aldehyde-functionalized tetrahedral Cu(PDB)2PO2Ph2 complexes (PDB = 4,4'-(1,10-phenanthroline-2,9-diyl)dibenzaldehyde) with rectangular tetratopic ETTBA (4',4''',4''''',4'''''''-(ethene-1,1,2,2-tetrayl)tetrakis([1,1'-biphenyl]-4-amine )) linkers through imine condensation, yielded a crystalline porous metalated COF, COF-500-Cu, with pts topology. Upon removal of the Cu(I) ions, the individual 1D square ribbons in the demetalated form (COF-500) are held together only by mechanical interlocking of rings, which allows their collective movement to produce a narrow-pore form, as evidenced by nitrogen adsorption and solid-state photoluminescence studies. When exposed to tetrahydrofuran vapor, the interlocking ribbons can dynamically move away from each other to reopen up the structure. The structural integrity of COF-500 is maintained during its dynamics because the constituent square ribbons cannot part company due to spatial confinement imparted by their interlocking nature.",2
Transition of Metastable Cross-alpha Crystals into Cross-beta Fibrils by beta-Turn Flipping.,"The ensemble of native, folded state was once considered to represent the global energy minimum of a given protein sequence. More recently, the discovery of the cross-beta amyloid state revealed that deeper energy minima exist, often associated with pathogenic, fibrillar deposits, when the concentration of proteins reaches a critical value. Fortunately, a sizable energy barrier impedes the conversion from native to pathogenic states. However, little is known about the structure of the related transition state. In addition, there are indications of polymorphism in the amyloidogenic process. Here, we report the first evidence of the conversion of metastable cross-alpha-helical crystals to thermodynamically stable cross-beta-sheet-like fibrils by a de novo designed heptapeptide. Furthermore, for the first time, we demonstrate at atomic resolution that the flip of a peptide plane from a type I to a type II' turn facilitates transformation to cross-beta structure and assembly of a dry steric zipper. This study establishes the potential of a peptide turn, a common protein secondary structure, to serve as a principal gatekeeper between a native metastable folded state and the amyloid state.",2
Uranyl Functionalization Mediated by Redox-Active Ligands: Generation of O-C Bonds via Acylation.,"A series of uranyl compounds with the redox-active iminoquinone ligand have been synthesized, and their electronic structures elucidated using multinuclear NMR, EPR, electronic absorption spectroscopies, SQUID magnetometry, and X-ray crystallography. Characterization and analysis of the iminoquinone (iq(0)) complex, ((dipp)iq)UO2(OTf)2THF (1-iq), the iminosemiquinone (isq(1-)) complex, ((dipp)isq)2UO2THF (2-isq), and the amidophenolate (ap(2-)) complex, [((dipp)ap)2UO2THF][K(18-crown-6)(THF)2]2(3-ap crown) show that reduction events are ligand-based, with the uranium center remaining in the hexavalent state. Reactivity of 2-isq with B-chlorocatecholborane or pivaloyl chloride leads to U-Ouranyl bond scission and reduction of U(VI) to U(IV) concomitant with ligand oxidation along with organic byproducts. (18)O isotopic labeling experiments along with IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and multinuclear NMR spectroscopy confirm that the organic byproducts contain oxygen atoms which originate from U-Ouranyl bond activation.",2
Intersystem crossing in the exit channel.,"Intersystem crossing plays an important role in photochemistry. It is understood to be efficient when heavy atoms are present due to strong spin-orbit coupling, or when strongly bound long-lived complexes are formed that increase the chance of finding the singlet-triplet intersection seam. Here we present evidence for a different intersystem crossing mechanism in the bimolecular reaction of O((3)P) with alkylamines. In crossed-beam experiments, product velocity-flux maps are measured for aminoalkyl radicals produced from H abstraction from the methyl group, which also gives OH radicals as co-fragments. The low translational-energy release and isotropic angular distributions of the products indicate that such reactions undergo the formation of a complex before OH and aminoalkyl are produced. However, there is no well on the triplet potential energy surface that could support such a complex. Multi-reference ab initio calculations suggest, instead, that intersystem crossing occurs in the exit-channel region due to the long-range dipole-dipole interaction between the nascent radical product pair coupled with the vanishing singlet-triplet splitting at long range. Intersystem crossing then leads to a deep hydroxylamine well before OH elimination.",2
Rapamycin-inspired macrocycles with new target specificity.,"Rapamycin and FK506 are macrocyclic natural products with an extraordinary mode of action, in which they form binary complexes with FK506-binding protein (FKBP) through a shared FKBP-binding domain before forming ternary complexes with their respective targets, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and calcineurin, respectively. Inspired by this, we sought to build a rapamycin-like macromolecule library to target new cellular proteins by replacing the effector domain of rapamycin with a combinatorial library of oligopeptides. We developed a robust macrocyclization method using ring-closing metathesis and synthesized a 45,000-compound library of hybrid macrocycles (named rapafucins) using optimized FKBP-binding domains. Screening of the rapafucin library in human cells led to the discovery of rapadocin, an inhibitor of nucleoside uptake. Rapadocin is a potent, isoform-specific and FKBP-dependent inhibitor of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 and is efficacious in an animal model of kidney ischaemia reperfusion injury. Together, these results demonstrate that rapafucins are a new class of chemical probes and drug leads that can expand the repertoire of protein targets well beyond mTOR and calcineurin.",2
Streamlining the chemoenzymatic synthesis of complex N-glycans by a stop and go strategy.,"Contemporary chemoenzymatic approaches can provide highly complex multi-antennary N-linked glycans. These procedures are, however, very demanding and typically involve as many as 100 chemical steps to prepare advanced intermediates that can be diversified by glycosyltransferases in a branch-selective manner to give asymmetrical structures commonly found in nature. Only highly specialized laboratories can perform such syntheses, which greatly hampers progress in glycoscience. Here we describe a biomimetic approach in which a readily available bi-antennary glycopeptide can be converted in ten or fewer chemical and enzymatic steps into multi-antennary N-glycans that at each arm can be uniquely extended by glycosyltransferases to give access to highly complex asymmetrically branched N-glycans. A key feature of our approach is the installation of additional branching points using recombinant MGAT4 and MGAT5 in combination with unnatural sugar donors. At an appropriate point in the enzymatic synthesis, the unnatural monosaccharides can be converted into their natural counterpart, allowing each arm to be elaborated into a unique appendage.",2
Carbopalladation of C-C sigma-bonds enabled by strained boronate complexes.,"Transition-metal-catalysed cross-coupling reactions, particularly those mediated by palladium, are some of the most broadly used chemical transformations. The fundamental reaction steps of such cross-couplings typically include oxidative addition, transmetallation, carbopalladation of a pi-bond and/or reductive elimination. Herein, we describe an unprecedented fundamental reaction step: a C-C sigma-bond carbopalladation. Specifically, an aryl palladium(II) complex interacts with a sigma-bond of a strained bicyclo[1.1.0]butyl boronate complex to enable addition of the aryl palladium(II) species and an organoboronic ester substituent across a C-C sigma-bond. The overall process couples readily available aryl triflates and organoboronic esters across a cyclobutane unit with total diastereocontrol. The pharmaceutically relevant 1,1,3-trisubstituted cyclobutane products are decorated with an array of modular building blocks, including a boronic ester that can be readily derivatized.",2
Hybrid Silver Nanocubes for Improved Plasmon-Enhanced Singlet Oxygen Production and Inactivation of Bacteria.,"Plasmonic nanoparticles can strongly interact with adjacent photosensitizer molecules, resulting in a significant alteration of their singlet oxygen ((1)O2) production. In this work, we report the next generation of metal-enhanced (1)O2 nanoplatforms exploiting the lightning rod effect, or plasmon hot spots, in anisotropic (nonspherical) metal nanoparticles. We describe the synthesis of Rose Bengal-decorated silica-coated silver nanocubes (Ag@SiO2-RB NCs) with silica shell thicknesses ranging from 5 to 50 nm based on an optimized protocol yielding highly homogeneous Ag NCs. Steady-state and time-resolved (1)O2 measurements demonstrate not only the silica shell thickness dependence on the metal-enhanced (1)O2 production phenomenon but also the superiority of this next generation of nanoplatforms. A maximum enhancement of (1)O2 of approximately 12-fold is observed with a 10 nm silica shell, which is among the largest (1)O2 production metal enhancement factors ever reported for a colloidal suspension of nanoparticles. Finally, the Ag@SiO2-RB NCs were benchmarked against the Ag@SiO2-RB nanospheres previously reported by our group, and the superior (1)O2 production of Ag@SiO2-RB NCs resulted in improved antimicrobial activities in photodynamic inactivation experiments using both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria model strains.",2
Schottky Barrier Induced Coupled Interface of Electron-Rich N-Doped Carbon and Electron-Deficient Cu: In-Built Lewis Acid-Base Pairs for Highly Efficient CO2 Fixation.,"Highly efficient fixation of CO2 for the synthesis of useful organic carbonates has drawn much attention. The design of sustainable Lewis acid-base pairs, which has mainly relied on expensive organic ligands, is the key challenge in the activation of the substrate and CO2 molecule. Here, we report the application of Mott-Schottky type nanohybrids composed of electron-deficient Cu and electron-rich N-doped carbon for CO2 fixation. A ligand-free and additive-free method was used to boost the basicity of the carbon supports and the acidity of Cu by increasing the Schottky barrier at their boundary, mimicking the beneficial function of organic ligands acting as the Lewis acid and base in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) or polymers and simultaneously avoiding the possible deactivation associated with the necessary stability of a heterogeneous catalyst. The optimal Cu/NC-0.5 catalyst exhibited a remarkably high turnover frequency (TOF) value of 615 h(-1) at 80 degrees C, which is 10 times higher than that of the state-of-the-art metal-based heterogeneous catalysts in the literature.",2
Selective Ruthenium-Catalyzed Transformation of Carbon Dioxide: An Alternative Approach toward Formaldehyde.,"Formaldehyde is an important precursor to numerous industrial processes and is produced in multimillion ton scale every year by catalytic oxidation of methanol in an energetically unfavorable and atom-inefficient industrial process. In this work, we present a highly selective one-step synthesis of a formaldehyde derivative starting from carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas utilizing a homogeneous ruthenium catalyst. Here, formaldehyde is obtained as dimethoxymethane, its dimethyl acetal, by selective reduction of carbon dioxide at moderate temperatures (90 degrees C) and partial pressures (90 bar H2/20 bar CO2) in the presence of methanol. Besides the desired product, only methyl formate is formed, which can be transformed to dimethoxymethane in a consecutive catalytic step. By comprehensive screening of the catalytic system, maximum turnover numbers of 786 for dimethoxymethane and 1290 for methyl formate were achieved with remarkable selectivities of over 90% for dimethoxymethane.",2
Charge Transfer from Upconverting Nanocrystals to Semiconducting Electrodes: Optimizing Thermodynamic Outputs by Electronic Energy Transfer.,"Light-harvesting inorganic nanocrystals play an important role in emerging solar energy conversion and optoelectronic devices. We describe here a strategy for a new family of photoelectrodes with upconverting nanocrystal assemblies as the photosensitizer. The assemblies consist of oleic acid-capped cadmium selenide (CdSe) nanocrystals that coordinate directly onto a layer of surface-bound, carboxylic acid-derivatized anthracenes through displacement of the oleic acid capping ligands. Steady-state emission and transient absorption measurements show that the upconverting nanocrystal assemblies, selectively excited by green light, generate singlet excitons that enable efficient charge injection into both the conduction band of TiO2 at the photoanode and the valence band of NiO at the photocathode. The singlet excitons form by sensitized triplet-triplet annihilation within the compact layer of anthracenes on the electrode surfaces. Density of state analysis reveals that the electronic coupling between the anthracene singlet excited states and the oxides provides a thermodynamic basis for light-induced charge transfer. The interplay between the excited-state populations at the surface-bound molecules and the assembled nanocrystals presents new design rules that can potentially overcome the limitations of previous dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells for catalytic applications.",2
"Nickel-Catalyzed 1,2-Diarylation of Simple Alkenyl Amides.","A nickel-catalyzed conjunctive cross-coupling of simple alkenyl amides with aryl iodides and aryl boronic esters is reported. The reaction is enabled by an electron-deficient olefin (EDO) ligand, dimethyl fumarate, and delivers the desired 1,2-diarylated products with excellent regiocontrol. Under optimized conditions, a wide range of amides derived from 3-butenoic acid, 4-pentenoic acid, and allyl amine are compatible substrates. This method represents the first example of regiocontrolled 1,2-diarylation directed by a native amide functional group. Computational analysis sheds light on the potential substrate binding mode and the role of the EDO ligand in the reductive elimination step.",2
"Empowerment of 15-Lipoxygenase Catalytic Competence in Selective Oxidation of Membrane ETE-PE to Ferroptotic Death Signals, HpETE-PE.","sn2-15-Hydroperoxy-eicasotetraenoyl-phosphatidylethanolamines ( sn2-15-HpETE-PE) generated by mammalian 15-lipoxygenase/phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein-1 (15-LO/PEBP1) complex is a death signal in a recently identified type of programmed cell demise, ferroptosis. How the enzymatic complex selects sn2-ETE-PE as the substrate among 1 of approximately 100 total oxidizable membrane PUFA phospholipids is a central, yet unresolved question. To unearth the highly selective and specific mechanisms of catalytic competence, we used a combination of redox lipidomics, mutational and computational structural analysis to show they stem from (i) reactivity toward readily accessible hexagonally organized membrane sn2-ETE-PEs, (ii) relative preponderance of sn2-ETE-PE species vs other sn2-ETE-PLs, and (iii) allosteric modification of the enzyme in the complex with PEBP1. This emphasizes the role of enzymatic vs random stochastic free radical reactions in ferroptotic death signaling.",2
"Complexation Chemistry in N,N-Dimethylformamide-Based Molecular Inks for Chalcogenide Semiconductors and Photovoltaic Devices.","Molecular inks based on dimethyl sulfoxide, thiourea (TU), and metal salts have been used to form high optoelectronic quality semiconductors and have led to high power conversion efficiencies for solution-processed photovoltaic devices for Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTS), Cu2Zn(Ge,Sn)(S,Se)4 (CZGTS), CuIn(S,Se)2 (CIS), and Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGS). However, several metal species of interest, including Ag(I), In(III), Ge(II), and Ge(IV), either have low solubility (requiring dilute inks) or lead to precipitation or gelation. Here, we demonstrate that the combination of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and TU has the remarkable ability to form intermediate-stability acid-base complexes with a wide number of metal chloride Lewis acids (CuCl, AgCl, ZnCl2, InCl3, GaCl3, SnCl4, GeCl4, and SeCl4), to give high-concentration stable molecular inks. Using calorimetry, Raman spectroscopy, and solubility experiments, we reveal the important role of chloride transfer and TU to stabilize metal cations in DMF. Methylation of TU is used to vary the strength of the Lewis basicity and demonstrate that the strength of the TU-metal chloride complex formed after DMF evaporation is critical to prevent volatilization of metal containing species. Further, we formulated a sulfur-free molecular ink which was used to deposit crystalline CuInSe2 without selenization that sustains high quasi-Fermi level splitting under constant illumination. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of the DMF-TU molecular ink chemistry to lead to high-photovoltaic power conversion efficiencies and high-open-circuit voltages for solution-processed CIS and CZGTS with power conversion efficiencies of 13.4% and 11.0% and Voc/ Voc,SQ of 67% and 63%, respectively.",2
"Enhancement of Antiaromatic Character via Additional Benzoannulation into Dibenzo[ a, f]pentalene: Syntheses and Properties of Benzo[ a]naphtho[2,1- f]pentalene and Dinaphtho[2,1- a, f]pentalene.","Understanding the structure-property relationships in antiaromatic molecules is crucial for controlling their electronic properties and designing new organic optoelectronic materials. Dibenzo[ a, f]pentalene, a structural isomer of dibenzopentalene, displays open-shell and antiaromatic character harmonization, which is not shared by the well-known isomer, dibenzo[ a, e]pentalene. The next questions of interest concern the topological effects of the pi-extension on the harmonization of the open-shell and antiaromatic character in the dibenzo[ a, f]pentalene pi-system. Herein, we describe the synthesis and characterization of the pi-extended (bis)annulated analogues, benzo[ a]naphtho[2,1- f]pentalene 4 and dinaphtho[2,1- a, f]pentalene 5. The solid-state structures and the magnetic and optoelectronic properties characterized these pi-extended analogues as closed-shell antiaromatic molecules, in sharp contrast with dibenzo[ a, f]pentalene 2. In these pi-extended analogues, the open-shell character was annihilated whereas the antiaromatic character was retained. The fusion of additional hexagons into 2 shifted the main 4npi-conjugated circuit from a global to a local system. Further investigations into magnetic ring currents using gauge-including magnetically induced current (GIMIC) calculations suggested that an enhanced local paratropic ring current appeared in the pentalene core of 5. The preservation of the benzenoid character in the additionally fused hexagons confined the paratropicity to the pentalene subunit, and the inherent presence of an o-quinoidal structure highlighted the 4npi-electron delocalization on the pentalene unit. The antiaromaticity of 4 and 5 was characterized by their small HOMO-LUMO energy gap. Both experimental and computational results demonstrated that the [ a, f]-type ring fusion of the pentalene core effectively enhanced the antiaromatic character compared with the [ a, e]-type ring fusion in the reported bisannulated[ a, e]pentalenes. The findings of this study could potentially be used for the rational design of optoelectronic devices based on novel antiaromatic molecules.",2
Photochemical Resolution of a Thermally Inert Cyclometalated Ru(phbpy)(N-N)(Sulfoxide)(+) Complex.,"In this work a photosubstitution strategy is presented that can be used for the isolation of chiral organometallic complexes. A series of five cyclometalated complexes Ru(phbpy)(N-N)(DMSO-kappaS)](PF6) ([1]PF6-[5]PF6) were synthesized and characterized, where Hphbpy = 6'-phenyl-2,2'-bipyridyl, and N-N = bpy (2,2'-bipyridine), phen (1,10-phenanthroline), dpq (pyrazino[2,3- f][1,10]phenanthroline), dppz (dipyrido[3,2- a:2',3'- c]phenazine, or dppn (benzo[ i]dipyrido[3,2- a,2',3'- c]phenazine), respectively. Due to the asymmetry of the cyclometalated phbpy(-) ligand, the corresponding [Ru(phbpy)(N-N)(DMSO-kappaS)](+)complexes are chiral. The exceptional thermal inertness of the Ru-S bond made chiral resolution of these complexes by thermal ligand exchange impossible. However, photosubstitution by visible light irradiation in acetonitrile was possible for three of the five complexes ([1]PF6-[3]PF6). Further thermal coordination of the chiral sulfoxide ( R)-methyl p-tolylsulfoxide to the photoproduct [Ru(phbpy)(phen)(NCMe)]PF6, followed by reverse phase HPLC, led to the separation and characterization of the two diastereoisomers of [Ru(phbpy)(phen)(MeSO(C7H7))]PF6, thus providing a new photochemical approach toward the synthesis of chiral cyclometalated ruthenium(II) complexes. Full photochemical, electrochemical, and frontier orbital characterization of the cyclometalated complexes [1]PF6-[5]PF6 was performed to explain why [4]PF6 and [5]PF6 are photochemically inert while [1]PF6-[3]PF6 perform selective photosubstitution.",2
Free Amino Acid Recognition: A Bisbinaphthyl-Based Fluorescent Probe with High Enantioselectivity.,"A novel fluorescent probe based on a bisbinaphthyl structure has been designed and synthesized. This compound in combination with Zn(II) has exhibited highly enantioselective fluorescence enhancement with 13 common free amino acids. For example, its enantiomeric fluorescent enhancement ratios ( ef or Delta IL/Delta ID) in the presence of the following amino acids are extremely high: 177 for valine, 199 for methionine, 186 for phenylalanine, 118 for leucine, and 89 for alanine. The observed high enantioselectivity and the extent of the substrate scope are unprecedented in the fluorescent recognition of free amino acids. This fluorescent probe can be applied to determine the enantiomeric composition of the structurally diverse chiral amino acids. NMR and mass spectroscopic investigations have provided clues to elucidate the observed high enantioselectivity.",2
Molecular Design Strategy to Construct the Near-Infrared Fluorescent Probe for Selectively Sensing Human Cytochrome P450 2J2.,"Cytochrome P450 2J2 (CYP2J2), a key enzyme responsible for oxidative metabolism of various xenobiotics and endogenous compounds, participates in a diverse array of physiological and pathological processes in humans. Its biological role in tumorigenesis and cancer diagnosis remains poorly understood, owing to the lack of molecular tools suitable for real-time monitoring CYP2J2 in complex biological systems. Using molecular design principles, we were able to modify the distance between the catalytic unit and metabolic recognition moiety, allowing us to develop a CYP2J2 selective fluorescent probe using a near-infrared fluorophore ( E)-2-(2-(6-hydroxy-2, 3-dihydro-1 H-xanthen-4-yl)vinyl)-3,3-dimethyl-1-propyl-3 H-indol-1-ium iodide (HXPI). To improve the reactivity and isoform specificity, a self-immolative linker was introduced to the HXPI derivatives in order to better fit the narrow substrate channel of CYP2J2, the modification effectively shortened the spatial distance between the metabolic moiety ( O-alkyl group) and catalytic center of CYP2J2. After screening a panel of O-alkylated HXPI derivatives, BnXPI displayed the best combination of specificity, sensitivity and applicability for detecting CYP2J2 in vitro and in vivo. Upon O-demethylation by CYP2J2, a self-immolative reaction occurred spontaneously via 1,6-elimination of p-hydroxybenzyl resulting in the release of HXPI. Allowing BnXPI to be successfully used to monitor CYP2J2 activity in real-time for various living systems including cells, tumor tissues, and tumor-bearing animals. In summary, our practical strategy could help the development of a highly specific and broadly applicable tool for monitoring CYP2J2, which offers great promise for exploring the biological functions of CYP2J2 in tumorigenesis.",2
Total Enzyme Syntheses of Napyradiomycins A1 and B1.,"The biosynthetic route to the napyradiomycin family of bacterial meroterpenoids has been fully described 32 years following their original isolation and 11 years after their gene cluster discovery. The antimicrobial and cytotoxic natural products napyradiomycins A1 and B1 are produced using three organic substrates (1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate, and geranyl pyrophosphate), and catalysis via five enzymes: two aromatic prenyltransferases (NapT8 and T9); and three vanadium dependent haloperoxidase (VHPO) homologues (NapH1, H3, and H4). Building upon the previous characterization of NapH1, H3, and T8, we herein describe the initial (NapT9, H1) and final (NapH4) steps required for napyradiomycin construction. This remarkably streamlined biosynthesis highlights the utility of VHPO enzymology in complex natural product generation, as NapH4 efficiently performs a unique chloronium-induced terpenoid cyclization to establish two stereocenters and a new carbon-carbon bond, and dual-acting NapH1 catalyzes chlorination and etherification reactions at two distinct stages of the pathway. Moreover, we employed recombinant napyradiomycin biosynthetic enzymes to chemoenzymatically synthesize milligram quantities in one pot in 1 day. This method represents a viable enantioselective approach to produce complex halogenated metabolites, like napyradiomycin B1, that have yet to be chemically synthesized.",2
Bioinspired Metal-Organic Framework Catalysts for Selective Methane Oxidation to Methanol.,"Particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO) is an enzyme that oxidizes methane to methanol with high activity and selectivity. Limited success has been achieved in incorporating biologically relevant ligands for the formation of such active site in a synthetic system. Here, we report the design and synthesis of metal-organic framework (MOF) catalysts inspired by pMMO for selective methane oxidation to methanol. By judicious selection of a framework with appropriate topology and chemical functionality, MOF-808 was used to postsynthetically install ligands bearing imidazole units for subsequent metalation with Cu(I) in the presence of dioxygen. The catalysts show high selectivity for methane oxidation to methanol under isothermal conditions at 150 degrees C. Combined spectroscopies and density functional theory calculations suggest bis(mu-oxo) dicopper species as probable active site of the catalysts.",2
"High-Efficiency, Hysteresis-Less, UV-Stable Perovskite Solar Cells with Cascade ZnO-ZnS Electron Transport Layer.","Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have reached certified efficiencies of up to 23.7% but suffered from frailness and instability when exposed to ambient atmosphere. Zinc oxide (ZnO), when used as electron transport layer (ETL) on PSCs, gives rise to excellent electronic, optic, and photonic properties, yet the Lewis basic nature of ZnO surface leads to deprotonation of the perovskite layer, resulting in serious degradation of PSCs using ZnO as ETL. Here, we report a simple but effective strategy to convert ZnO surface into ZnS at the ZnO/perovskite interface by sulfidation. The sulfide on ZnO-ZnS surface binds strongly with Pb(2+) and creates a novel pathway of electron transport to accelerate electron transfer and reduce interfacial charge recombination, yielding a champion efficiency of 20.7% with improved stability and no appreciable hysteresis. The model devices modified with sulfide maintained 88% of their initial performance for 1000 h under storage condition and 87% for 500 h under UV radiation. ZnS is demonstrated to act as both a cascade ETL and a passivating layer for enhancing the performance of PSCs.",2
Deconvoluting Surface-Bound Quinone Proton Coupled Electron Transfer in Unbuffered Solutions: Toward a Universal Voltammetric pH Electrode.,"While quinone proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) under buffered conditions is well understood, the situation is more complicated in unbuffered aqueous solutions. With a view to producing a quinone-based voltammetric pH electrode that can function universally in both buffered and unbuffered solutions by following a two-electron (2e(-))/two-proton (2H(+)) Nernstian pathway over a wide pH range, the voltammetric response of strongly electronically coupled surface-bound quinones, directly integrated into a boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrode, is investigated. A laser ablation process enables integration of quinones into the BDD electrode surface with a high p Ka1 (first protonation state) and with controllable, very low surface coverages (as low as 2 orders of magnitude below monolayer coverage). Under buffered conditions, one wave results for all pH values, and the 2e(-)/2H(+) pathway is followed across the entire pH range. The measured ET rate constant values, from Laviron analysis, are also high, indicative of fast ET pathways. Under unbuffered conditions, one wave is again observed for all pH values; however, deviations from the buffered 2e(-)/2H(+) behavior are seen in the neutral region (pH 6-8). While 2e(-)/2H(+) transfer is maintained at all times, we attribute the observed deviation to local pH changes caused by the consumption and generation of protons at the electrode surface during the redox electrochemistry of the quinone. The associated proton fluxes generated at such sparse surface coverages are thought to be sufficiently high enough to prevent ET from occurring exclusively via a proton-independent route. By reducing surface coverage (down to approximately 4 x 10(-12) mol cm(-2); the limit of our laser ablation process) local pH changes can be reduced but are not eradicated completely. By moving to a pulsed voltammetric technique, where for each potential step protons consumed at the electrode are immediately replaced, it is possible, provided the surface coverage is low enough, to obtain a Nernstian 2e(-)/2H(+) response across a wide pH range in unbuffered solution.",2
Mechanical Deformation Distinguishes Tunneling Pathways in Molecular Junctions.,"Developing a clearer understanding of electron tunneling through molecules is a central challenge in molecular electronics. Here we demonstrate the use of mechanical stretching to distinguish orbital pathways that facilitate tunneling in molecular junctions. Our experiments employ junctions based on self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of homologous alkanethiols (C nT) and oligophenylene thiols (OPT n), which serve as prototypical examples of sigma-bonded and pi-bonded backbones, respectively. Surprisingly, molecular conductances ( Gmolecule) for stretched C nT SAMs have exactly the same length dependence as unstretched C nT SAMs in which molecular length is tuned by the number of CH2 repeat units, n. In contrast, OPT n SAMs exhibit a 10-fold-greater decrease in Gmolecule with molecular length for stretched versus unstretched cases. Experiment and theory show that these divergent results are explained by the dependence of the molecule-electrode electronic coupling Gamma on strain and the spatial extent of the principal orbital facilitating tunneling. In particular, differences in the strain sensitivity of Gamma versus the repeat-length ( n) sensitivity can be used to distinguish tunneling via delocalized orbitals versus localized orbitals. Angstrom-level tuning of interelectrode separation thus provides a strategy for examining the relationship between orbital localization or delocalization and electronic coupling in molecular junctions and therefore for distinguishing tunneling pathways.",2
"pi-Bond Character in Metal-Alkyl Compounds for C-H Activation: How, When, and Why?","C-H bond activation via sigma-bond metathesis is typically observed with transition-metal alkyl compounds in d(0) or d(0)f(n) electron configurations, e.g., biscyclopentadienyl metal alkyls. Related C-H activation processes are also observed for transition-metal alkyls with higher d-electron counts, such as W(II), Fe(II), or Ir(III). A sigma-bond metathesis mechanism has been proposed in all cases with a preference for an oxidative addition-reductive elimination pathway for Ir(III). Herein we show that, regardless of the exact mechanism, C-H activation with all of these compounds is associated with pi-character of the M-C bond, according to a detailed analysis of the (13)C NMR chemical shift tensor of the alpha-carbon. pi-Character is also a requirement for olefin insertion, indicating its similarity to sigma-bond metathesis. This observation explains the H2 response observed in d(0) olefin polymerization catalysts and underlines that sigma-bond metathesis, olefin insertion, and olefin metathesis are in fact isolobal reactions.",2
Visible-Light-Driven Conversion of CO2 to CH4 with an Organic Sensitizer and an Iron Porphyrin Catalyst.,"Using a phenoxazine-based organic photosensitizer and an iron porphyrin molecular catalyst, we demonstrated photochemical reduction of CO2 to CO and CH4 with turnover numbers (TONs) of 149 and 29, respectively, under visible-light irradiation (lambda > 435 nm) with a tertiary amine as sacrificial electron donor. This work is the first example of a molecular system using an earth-abundant metal catalyst and an organic dye to effect complete 8e(-)/8H(+) reduction of CO2 to CH4, as opposed to typical 2e(-)/2H(+) products of CO or formic acid. The catalytic system continuously produced methane even after prolonged irradiation up to 4 days. Using CO as the feedstock, the same reactive system was able to produce CH4 with 85% selectivity, 80 TON and a quantum yield of 0.47%. The redox properties of the organic photosensitizer and acidity of the proton source were shown to play a key role in driving the 8e(-)/8H(+) processes.",2
Endogenous Dynamic Nuclear Polarization for Natural Abundance (17)O and Lithium NMR in the Bulk of Inorganic Solids.,"In recent years magic angle spinning-dynamic nuclear polarization (MAS-DNP) has developed as an excellent approach for boosting the sensitivity of solid-state NMR (ssNMR) spectroscopy, thereby enabling the characterization of challenging systems in biology and chemistry. Most commonly, MAS-DNP is based on the use of nitroxide biradicals as polarizing agents. In materials science, since the use of nitroxides often limits the signal enhancement to the materials' surface and subsurface layers, there is need for hyperpolarization approaches which will provide sensitivity in the bulk of micron sized particles. Recently, an alternative in the form of paramagnetic metal ions has emerged. Here we demonstrate the remarkable efficacy of Mn(II) dopants, used as endogenous polarization agents for MAS-DNP, in enabling the detection of (17)O at a natural abundance of only 0.038%. Distinct oxygen sites are identified in the bulk of micron-sized crystals, including battery anode materials Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) and Li2ZnTi3O8, as well as the phosphor materials NaCaPO4 and MgAl2O4, all doped with Mn(II) ions. Density functional theory calculations are used to assign the resonances to specific oxygen environments in these phases. Depending on the Mn(II) dopant concentration, we obtain significant signal enhancement factors, 142 and 24, for (6)Li and (7)Li nuclei in LTO, respectively. We furthermore follow the changes in the (6,7)Li LTO resonances and determine their enhancement factors as a function of Mn(II) concentration. The results presented show that MAS-DNP from paramagnetic metal ion dopants provides an efficient approach for probing informative nuclei such as (17)O, despite their low gyromagnetic ratio and negligible abundance, without isotope enrichment.",2
Subwavelength Spatially Resolved Coordination Chemistry of Metal-Organic Framework Glass Blends.,"Microstructured metal-organic framework (MOF) glasses have been produced by combining two amorphous MOFs. However, the electronic structure of these materials has not been interrogated at the length scales of the chemical domains formed in these glasses. Here, we report a subwavelength spatially resolved physicochemical analysis of the electronic states at visible and UV energies in a blend of two zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), ZIF-4-Co and ZIF-62-Zn. By combining spectroscopy at visible and UV energies as well as at core ionization energies in electron energy loss spectroscopy in the scanning transmission electron microscope with density functional theory calculations, we show that domains less than 200 nm in size retain the electronic structure of the precursor crystalline ZIF phases. Prototypical signatures of coordination chemistry including d- d transitions in ZIF-4-Co are assigned and mapped with nanoscale precision.",2
(18)O Kinetic Isotope Effects Reveal an Associative Transition State for Phosphite Dehydrogenase Catalyzed Phosphoryl Transfer.,"Phosphite dehydrogenase (PTDH) catalyzes an unusual phosphoryl transfer reaction in which water displaces a hydride leaving group. Despite extensive effort, it remains unclear whether PTDH catalysis proceeds via an associative or dissociative mechanism. Here, primary (2)H and secondary (18)O kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) were determined and used together with computation to characterize the transition state (TS) catalyzed by a thermostable PTDH (17X-PTDH). The large, normal (18)O KIEs suggest an associative mechanism. Various transition state structures were computed within a model of the enzyme active site and (2)H and (18)O KIEs were predicted to evaluate the accuracy of each TS. This analysis suggests that 17X-PTDH catalyzes an associative process with little leaving group displacement and extensive nucleophilic participation. This tight TS is likely a consequence of the extremely poor leaving group requiring significant P-O bond formation to expel the hydride. This finding contrasts with the dissociative TSs in most phosphoryl transfer reactions from phosphate mono- and diesters.",2
Probing O-H Bonding through Proton Detected (1)H-(17)O Double Resonance Solid-State NMR Spectroscopy.,"The ubiquity of oxygen in organic, inorganic, and biological systems has stimulated the application and development of (17)O solid-state NMR spectroscopy as a probe of molecular structure and dynamics. Unfortunately, (17)O solid-state NMR experiments are often hindered by a combination of broad NMR signals and low sensitivity. Here, it is demonstrated that fast MAS and proton detection with the D-RINEPT pulse sequence can be generally applied to enhance the sensitivity and resolution of (17)O solid-state NMR experiments. Complete 2D (17)O --> (1)H D-RINEPT correlation NMR spectra were typically obtained in less than 10 h from less than 10 mg of material, with low to moderate (17)O enrichment (less than 20%). Two-dimensional (1)H-(17)O correlation solid-state NMR spectra allow overlapping oxygen sites to be resolved on the basis of proton chemical shifts or by varying the mixing time used for (1)H-(17)O magnetization transfer. In addition, J-resolved or separated local field (SLF) blocks can be incorporated into the D-RINEPT pulse sequence to allow the direct measurement of one-bond (1)H-(17)O scalar coupling constants ((1) JOH) or (1)H-(17)O dipolar couplings ( DOH), respectively, the latter of which can be used to infer (1)H-(17)O bond lengths. (1) JOH and DOH calculated from plane-wave density functional theory (DFT) show very good agreement with experimental values. Therefore, the 2D (1)H-(17)O correlation experiments, (1)H-(17)O scalar and dipolar couplings, and plane-wave DFT calculations provide a method to precisely determine proton positions relative to oxygen atoms. This capability opens new opportunities to probe interactions between oxygen and hydrogen in a variety of chemical systems.",2
Spontaneous Formation of Gating Lipid Domain in Uniform-Size Peptide Vesicles for Controlled Release.,"Hybrid assemblies composed of phospholipids and amphiphilic polymers have been investigated previously as a biomimetic model of biological cells. However, these studies focused on the functions of polymers in a sea of membrane lipids. Here, we prepared a highly stable peptide-lipid hybrid vesicle from a combination of an amphiphilic polypeptide and the phospholipid, 1,2-dimyristoyl- sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, with a mixing molar ratio of 1:1. The phase-separated structure of the hybrid vesicle was demonstrated by fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis. The lipid domain of the hybrid vesicle had a phase-transition temperature of 38 degrees C and allowed the permeation of a hydrophilic molecule, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled polyethylene glycol ( Mw: 2000), above 38 degrees C. The designed peptide-lipid hybrid vesicle and a ""lipidic gate"" are a promising tool for smart drug delivery.",2
Probing the Transformation of Boron Nitride Catalysts under Oxidative Dehydrogenation Conditions.,"Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNT) were recently reported as highly selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins in the gas phase. Previous studies revealed a substantial increase in surface oxygen content after exposure to ODH conditions (heating to ca. 500 degrees C under a flow of alkane and oxygen); however, the complexity of these materials has thus far precluded an in-depth understanding of the oxygenated surface species. In this contribution, we combine advanced NMR spectroscopy experiments with scanning electron microscopy and soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy to characterize the molecular structure of the oxygen functionalized phase that arises on h-BN and BNNT following catalytic testing for ODH of propane. The pristine BN materials are readily oxidized and hydrolyzed under ODH reaction conditions to yield a phase consisting of three-coordinate boron sites with variable numbers of hydroxyl and bridging oxide groups which is denoted B(OH) xO3- x (where x = 0-3). Evidence for this robust oxide phase revises previous literature hypotheses of hydroxylated BN edges as the active component on h-BN.",2
Cell-Penetrating Peptides Transport Noncovalently Linked Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Nanoparticles for Time-Resolved Luminescence Imaging.,"Luminescent probes and nanoparticles (NPs) with long excited state lifetimes are essential for time-resolved biological imaging. Generally, cell membranes are physiological barriers that could prevent the uptake of many unnatural compounds. It is still a big challenge to prepare biocompatible imaging agents with high cytomembrane permeability, especially for nonmetallic NPs with long-lived luminescence. Herein, an amphiphilic cell-penetrating peptide, F6G6(rR)3R2, was designed to transport hydrophobic fluorophores across cellular barriers. Three classical thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules, 4CzIPN, NAI-DPAC, and BTZ-DMAC, could self-assemble into well-dispersed NPs with F6G6(rR)3R2 in aqueous solution. These NPs showed low cytotoxicity and could penetrate membranes easily. Moreover, long-lived TADF enabled them to be used in time-resolved luminescence imaging in oxygenic environments. These findings greatly expanded the applications of cell-penetrating peptides for delivery of molecules and NPs by only noncovalent interactions, which were more flexible and easier than covalent modifications.",2
Bifunctional Biphenyl-2-ylphosphine Ligand Enables Tandem Gold-Catalyzed Propargylation of Aldehyde and Unexpected Cycloisomerization.,"Despite extensive studies in gold catalysis, sigma-allenylgold species have not been invoked as catalytic intermediates and their reactivities not studied. This work reports for the first time they are generated in situ and undergo nucleophilic addition to activated aldehydes in a bifunctional phosphine ligand-enabled gold catalysis. This development reveals a broad range of opportunities to achieve propargylic C-H functionalization for the first time under catalytic and mild conditions. The homopropargylic alcohols generated undergo ligand-enabled cycloisomerizations involving an unexpected silyl migration.",2
Radical Approach to Enzymatic beta-Thioether Bond Formation.,"Ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are an emerging class of natural products that harbor diverse chemical functionalities, usually introduced via the action of a small number of tailoring enzymes. We have been interested in RiPP biosynthetic gene clusters that encode unusual metalloenzymes, as these may install as yet unknown alterations. Using a new bioinformatic search strategy, we recently identified an array of unexplored RiPP gene clusters that are quorum sensing-regulated and contain one or more uncharacterized radical S-adenosylmethionine (RaS) metalloenzymes. Herein, we investigate the reaction of one of these RaS enzymes and find that it installs an intramolecular beta-thioether bond onto its substrate peptide by connecting a Cys-thiol group to the beta-carbon of an upstream Asn residue. The enzyme responsible, NxxcB, accepts several amino acids in place of Asn and introduces unnatural beta-thioether linkages at unactivated positions. This new transformation adds to the growing list of Nature's peptide macrocyclization strategies and expands the already impressive catalytic repertoire of the RaS enzyme superfamily.",2
Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Substituted Azepanes by Sequential Biocatalytic Reduction and Organolithium-Mediated Rearrangement.,"Enantioenriched 2-aryl azepanes and 2-arylbenzazepines were generated biocatalytically by asymmetric reductive amination using imine reductases or by deracemization using monoamine oxidases. The amines were converted to the corresponding N'-aryl ureas, which rearranged on treatment with base with stereospecific transfer of the aryl substituent to the 2-position of the heterocycle via a configurationally stable benzyllithium intermediate. The products are previously inaccessible enantioenriched 2,2-disubstituted azepanes and benzazepines.",2
"Cation Exchange Reactions in Layered Double Hydroxides Intercalated with Sulfate and Alkaline Cations (A(H2O)6)[M(2+)6Al3(OH)18(SO4)2].6H2O (M(2+) = Mn, Mg, Zn; A(+) = Li, Na, K).","Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with similar compositions to the minerals shigaite, natroglaucocerinite, and motukoreaite were synthesized by co-precipitation with increasing pH and characterized by several instrumental techniques. These minerals have previously been described to occur only with sodium and sulfate (Na(H2O)6)[M(+2)6Al3(OH)18(SO4)2].6H2O (M(2+) = Mn, Mg, and Zn). These phases were synthesized successfully along with others containing lithium and potassium. Cation exchange reactions were performed in the presence of alkaline metal sulfates, and for the first time several instrumental techniques were employed to show that the cations can be totally exchanged without removing the intercalated sulfate anions. This class of compounds, traditionally considered to be anion exchangers, can also be considered cation exchangers, which opens new avenues for future scientific and industrial applications.",2
"Selective Catalytic Formation of Cross-Tetramers from Tetrafluoroethylene, Ethylene, Alkynes, and Aldehydes via Nickelacycles as Key Reaction Intermediates.","In the presence of a catalytic amount of Ni(cod)2 (cod = 1,5-cyclooctadiene) and PCy3 (Cy = cyclohexyl), the cross-tetramerization of tetrafluoroethylene (TFE), ethylene, alkynes, and aldehydes leads to a variety of fluorine-containing enone derivatives. This reaction is the first example of a highly selective cross-tetramerization between four different unsaturated compounds. Stoichiometric reactions revealed that the present reaction involves partially fluorinated five- and seven-membered nickelacycles as key reaction intermediates.",2
"[2,2'-Bipyridin]-6(1 H)-one, a Truly Cooperating Ligand in the Palladium-Mediated C-H Activation Step: Experimental Evidence in the Direct C-3 Arylation of Pyridine.","The ligand [2,2'-bipyridin]-6(1 H)-one (bipy-6-OH) has a strong accelerating effect on the Pd-catalyzed direct arylation of pyridine or arenes. The isolation of relevant intermediates and the study of their decomposition unequivocally show that the deprotonated coordinated ligand acts as a base and assists the cleavage of the C-H bond. Mechanistic work indicates that the direct arylation of pyridine with this ligand occurs through a Pd(0)/Pd(II) cycle. Because of this dual ligand-intramolecular base role, there is no need for an available coordination site on the metal for an external base, a difficulty encountered when chelating ligands are used in coupling reactions that involve a C-H cleavage step.",2
Cationic Alkynyl Heck Reaction toward Substituted Allenes Using BobCat: A New Hybrid Pd(0)-Catalyst Incorporating a Water-Soluble dba Ligand.,"The cationic alkynyl Heck reaction between aryl triflates and alkynes to give substituted allenes is described. Key to the success of this method was the discovery and development of a new hybrid Pd(0)-catalyst, BobCat, that incorporates a water-soluble dba-ligand and biaryl phosphine ligand to provide substituted allenes in good yields under mild reaction conditions.",2
Enantioselective Synthesis of Isocarbostyril Alkaloids and Analogs Using Catalytic Dearomative Functionalization of Benzene.,"Enantioselective total syntheses of the anticancer isocarbostyril alkaloids (+)-7-deoxypancratistatin, (+)-pancratistatin, (+)-lycoricidine, and (+)-narciclasine are described. Our strategy for accessing this unique class of natural products is based on the development of a Ni-catalyzed dearomative trans-1,2-carboamination of benzene. The effectiveness of this dearomatization approach is notable, as only two additional olefin functionalizations are needed to construct the fully decorated aminocyclitol cores of these alkaloids. Installation of the lactam ring has been achieved through several pathways and a direct interconversion between natural products was established via a late-stage C-7 cupration. Using this synthetic blueprint, we were able to produce natural products on a gram scale and provide tailored analogs with improved activity, solubility, and metabolic stability.",2
Intrinsic Reactivity of Diatomic 3d Transition-Metal Carbides in the Thermal Activation of Methane: Striking Electronic Structure Effects.,"Mechanistic aspects of the C-H bond activation of methane by metal-carbide cations MC(+) of the 3d transition-metals Sc-Zn were elucidated by NEVPT2//CASSCF quantum-chemical calculations and verified experimentally for M = Ti, V, Fe, and Cu by using Fourier transform ion-cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. While MC(+) species with M = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Cu, and Zn activate CH4 at ambient temperature, this is prevented with carbide cations of M = Mn, Fe, and Co by high apparent barriers; NiC(+) has a small apparent barrier. Hydrogen-atom transfers from methane to metal-carbide cations were found to proceed via a proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism for M = Sc-Co; wherein the doubly occupied pixz/yz-orbitals between metal and carbon at the carbon site serve as electron donors and the corresponding metal-centered vacant pi*xz/yz-orbitals as electron acceptors. Classical hydrogen-atom transfer transpires only in the case of NiC(+), while ZnC(+) follows a mechanistic scenario, in which a formally hydridic hydrogen is transferred. CuC(+) reacts by a synchronous activation of two C-H bonds. While spin density is often so crucial for the reactions of numerous MO(+)/CH4 couples, it is much less important for the C-H bond activation by carbide cations of the 3d transition-metals, in which one notes large changes in bond dissociation energies, spin states, number of d-electrons, and charge distributions. All these factors jointly affect both the reactivity of the metal carbides and their mechanisms of C-H bond activation.",2
Visible-Light-Driven External-Reductant-Free Cross-Electrophile Couplings of Tetraalkyl Ammonium Salts.,"Cross-electrophile couplings between two electrophiles are powerful and economic methods to generate C-C bonds in the presence of stoichiometric external reductants. Herein, we report a novel strategy to realize the first external-reductant-free cross-electrophile coupling via visible-light photoredox catalysis. A variety of tetraalkyl ammonium salts, bearing primary, secondary, and tertiary C-N bonds, undergo selective couplings with aldehydes/ketone and CO2. Notably, the in situ generated byproduct, trimethylamine, is efficiently utilized as the electron donor. Moreover, this protocol exhibits mild reaction conditions, low catalyst loading, broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and facile scalability. Mechanistic studies indicate that benzyl radicals and anions might be generated as the key intermediates via photocatalysis, providing a new direction for cross-electrophile couplings.",2
A Chemoproteomic Strategy for Direct and Proteome-Wide Covalent Inhibitor Target-Site Identification.,"Despite recent clinical successes for irreversible drugs, potential toxicities mediated by unpredictable modification of off-target cysteines represents a major hurdle for expansion of covalent drug programs. Understanding the proteome-wide binding profile of covalent inhibitors can significantly accelerate their development; however, current mass spectrometry strategies typically do not provide a direct, amino acid level readout of covalent activity for complex, selective inhibitors. Here we report the development of CITe-Id, a novel chemoproteomic approach that employs covalent pharmacologic inhibitors as enrichment reagents in combination with an optimized proteomic platform to directly quantify dose-dependent binding at cysteine-thiols across the proteome. CITe-Id analysis of our irreversible CDK inhibitor THZ1 identified dose-dependent covalent modification of several unexpected kinases, including a previously unannotated cysteine (C840) on the understudied kinase PKN3. These data streamlined our development of JZ128 as a new selective covalent inhibitor of PKN3. Using JZ128 as a probe compound, we identified novel potential PKN3 substrates, thus offering an initial molecular view of PKN3 cellular activity. CITe-Id provides a powerful complement to current chemoproteomic platforms to characterize the selectivity of covalent inhibitors, identify new, pharmacologically addressable cysteine-thiols, and inform structure-based drug design programs.",2
Room Temperature Iron-Catalyzed Transfer Hydrogenation and Regioselective Deuteration of Carbon-Carbon Double Bonds.,"An iron catalyst has been developed for the transfer hydrogenation of carbon-carbon multiple bonds. Using a well-defined beta-diketiminate iron(II) precatalyst, a sacrificial amine and a borane, even simple, unactivated alkenes such as 1-hexene undergo hydrogenation within 1 h at room temperature. Tuning the reagent stoichiometry allows for semi- and complete hydrogenation of terminal alkynes. It is also possible to hydrogenate aminoalkenes and aminoalkynes without poisoning the catalyst through competitive amine ligation. Furthermore, by exploiting the separate protic and hydridic nature of the reagents, it is possible to regioselectively prepare monoisotopically labeled products. DFT calculations define a mechanism for the transfer hydrogenation of propene with (n)BuNH2 and HBpin that involves the initial formation of an iron(II)-hydride active species, 1,2-insertion of propene, and rate-limiting protonolysis of the resultant alkyl by the amine N-H bond. This mechanism is fully consistent with the selective deuteration studies, although the calculations also highlight alkene hydroboration and amine-borane dehydrocoupling as competitive processes. This was resolved by reassessing the nature of the active transfer hydrogenation agent: experimentally, a gel is observed in catalysis, and calculations suggest this can be formulated as an oligomeric species comprising H-bonded amine-borane adducts. Gel formation serves to reduce the effective concentrations of free HBpin and (n)BuNH2 and so disfavors both hydroboration and dehydrocoupling while allowing alkene migratory insertion (and hence transfer hydrogenation) to dominate.",2
Exploiting Substrate Promiscuity To Develop Activity-Based Probes for Ten-Eleven Translocation Family Enzymes.,"Ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes catalyze repeated oxidations of 5-methylcytosine in genomic DNA. Because of the challenges of tracking reactivity within a complex DNA substrate, chemical tools to probe TET activity are limited, despite these enzyme's crucial role in epigenetic regulation. Here, building on precedents from related Fe(II)/alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, we show that TET enzymes can promiscuously act upon cytosine bases with unnatural 5-position modifications. Oxidation of 5-vinylcytosine (vC) in DNA results in the predominant formation of a 5-formylmethylcytosine product that can be efficiently labeled to provide an end-point read-out for TET activity. The reaction with 5-ethynylcytosine (eyC), moreover, results in the formation of a high-energy ketene intermediate that can selectively trap any active TET isoform as a covalent enzyme-DNA complex, even in the complex milieu of a total cell lysate. Exploiting substrate promiscuity therefore offers a new and needed means to directly track TET activity in vitro or in vivo.",2
The Elusive Seven-Membered Cyclic Imino Ether Tetrahydrooxazepine.,"Cyclic imino ether heterocycles are used as ligands in transition metal catalysis, in various drugs and as reactive monomers in living cationic ring-opening polymerization (CROP). While five- and six-membered cyclic imino ethers, i.e. 2-oxazolines and 4,5-dihydro-1,3-oxazines, have extensively been studied in these areas, their seven-membered ring counterparts have remained unexplored. Herein, we report the synthesis of 2-phenyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1,3-oxazepine allowing reassignment of the earlier, incorrectly reported 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1,3-oxazepines as their N-acylated pyrrolidine isomers. Finally, we also report a comparison of the CROP reactivity of a homologous series of cyclic imino ethers with a 2-carbon, 3-carbon, and 4-carbon methylene bridge, revealing a remarkable ring size effect.",2
"Multivalent Ligand Binding to Cell Membrane Antigens: Defining the Interplay of Affinity, Valency, and Expression Density.","Nature uses multivalency to govern many biological processes. The development of macromolecular and cellular therapies has largely been dependent on engineering similar polyvalent interactions to enable effective targeting. Such therapeutics typically utilize high-affinity binding domains that have the propensity to recognize both antigen-overexpressing tumors and normal-expressing tissues, leading to ""on-target, off-tumor"" toxicities. One strategy to improve these agents' selectivity is to reduce the binding affinity, such that biologically relevant interactions between the therapeutic and target cell will only exist under conditions of high avidity. Preclinical studies have validated this principle of avidity optimization in the context of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells; however, a rigorous analysis of this approach in the context of soluble multivalent targeting scaffolds has yet to be undertaken. Using a modular protein nanoring capable of displaying </=8 fibronectin domains with engineered specificity for a model antigen, epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), this study demonstrates that binding affinity and ligand valency can be optimized to afford discrimination between EpCAM(High) (2.8-3.8 x 10(6) antigens/cell) and EpCAM(Low) (5.2 x 10(4) to 2.2 x 10(5) antigens/cell) tissues both in vitro and in vivo.",2
Development of S-Substituted Thioisothioureas as Efficient Hydropersulfide Precursors.,"Because of their inherent instability, hydropersulfides (RSSH) must be generated in situ using precursors, but very few physiologically useful RSSH precursors have been developed to date. In this work, we report the design, synthesis, and evaluation of novel S-substituted thiosiothioureas as RSSH precursors. These water-soluble precursors show efficient and controllable release of RSSH under physiological conditions.",2
Molecular Zirconium Nitride Super Base from a Mononuclear Parent Imide.,"In this work, we prepared, isolated, and structurally characterized a zirconium complex having a terminally bound imide motif, (PN)2Zr identical withNH (PN(-) = (N-(2-(i)Pr2P-4-methylphenyl)-2,4,6-trimethylanilide)), along with the zirconium nitride complex {(PN)2Zr identical withN[mu2-Li(THF)]}2. (PN)2Zr identical withNH was prepared by reduction of trans-(PN)2Zr(N3)2 with KC8. Isotopic labeling and spectroscopic studies were conducted using the respective (15)N enriched isotopologues, whereas solid-state structural studies confirmed some of the shortest Zr identical withN distances known to date (Zr identical withNH, 1.830(3) A; Zr identical withN(-), 1.822(2) A). It was found that the nitride in {(PN)2Zr identical withN[mu2-Li(THF)]}2 is super basic and in the range of -36 to -43 p Kb units. Computational studies have been applied to probe the bonding and structure for this new class of zirconium-nitrogen multiple bonds.",2
Stable Thiele's Hydrocarbon Derivatives Exhibiting Near-Infrared Absorption/Emission and Two-Step Electrochromism.,"We report synthesis and characterization of near-infrared (NIR)-absorbing/emitting Thiele's hydrocarbon derivatives, in which four aryl groups are bridged to a quinodimethane skeleton. The quinoid structure of the bridged-tetra-aryl- p-quinodimethanes (BTAQs) was confirmed by spectroscopic, X-ray crystallographic, and computational methods. Although quinodimethane derivatives with a small HOMO-LUMO energy gap often exhibit biradical character, BTAQs showed no biradical character. Instead, they exhibited two-step near-infrared electrochromism. The donor/acceptor properties of the aryl groups were found to play a key role in the unique properties of BTAQs.",2
Self-Sorting of Amphiphilic Copolymers for Self-Assembled Materials in Water: Polymers Can Recognize Themselves.,"Amphiphilic random copolymers bearing hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and hydrophobic alkyl pendants showed dynamic self-sorting behavior, that is, self-recognition, under competitive conditions in aqueous media. The self-sorting universally takes place not only in water but also in hydrogels and on the material surfaces, according to encoded information originating from the primary structure of composition and pendants. Binary blends of the copolymers with different composition or alkyl pendants readily induced composition- or alkyl pendant-dependent self-sorting to simultaneously provide discrete and size-controlled micelles with hydrophobic cores. Surprisingly, the micelles reversibly keep exchanging polymer chains exclusively between identical polymer micelles even in the presence of different counterparts. Owing to the dynamic self-sorting behavior, ABA-triblock copolymers comprising the amphiphilic random copolymer A segments and a hydrophilic PEG chain B segment further provided hydrogels with self-healing yet selectively adhesive properties.",2
Extraordinary Redox Activities in Ladder-Type Conjugated Molecules Enabled by B <-- N Coordination-Promoted Delocalization and Hyperconjugation.,"The introduction of B <-- N coordinate bond-isoelectronic to C-C single bond-into pi-systems represents a promising strategy to impart exotic redox and electrochromic properties into conjugated organic molecules and macromolecules. To achieve both reductive and oxidative activities using this strategy, a cruciform ladder-type molecular constitution was designed to accommodate oxidation-active, reduction-active, and B <-- N coordination units into a compact structure. Two such compounds (BN-F and BN-Ph) were synthesized via highly efficient N-directed borylation. These molecules demonstrated well-separated, two reductive and two oxidative electron-transfer processes, corresponding to five distinct yet stable oxidation states, including a rarely observed boron-containing radical cation. Spectroelectrochemical measurements revealed unique optical characteristics for each of these reduced/oxidized species, demonstrating multicolor electrochromism with excellent recyclability. Distinct color changes were observed between each redox state with clear isosbestic points on the absorption spectra. The underlying redox mechanism was elucidated by a combination of computational and experimental investigations. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis on the neutral state, the oxidized radical cation, and the reduced dianion of BN-Ph revealed structural transformations into two distinct quinonoid constitutions during the oxidation and reduction processes, respectively. B <-- N coordination played an important role in rendering the robust and reversible multistage redox properties, by extending the charge and spin delocalization, by modulating the pi-electron density, and by a newly established hyperconjugation mechanism.",2
Interaction of Water with the Gypsum (010) Surface: Structure and Dynamics from Nonlinear Vibrational Spectroscopy and Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics.,"Water-mineral interfaces are important for several environmental, industrial, biological, and geological processes. Gypsum, CaSO4.2H2O, is a widespread mineral of high technological, medical, and environmental relevance, but little is known about its surface structure and its interaction with water. A molecular-level understanding of gypsum/water interface is given here by a combined experimental/theoretical study. We investigate the structure and dynamics of water adsorbed from vapor on the gypsum (010) single-crystal surface at room temperature, combining sum-frequency generation (SFG) vibrational spectroscopy experiments and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. The SFG spectra of gypsum at low relative humidity (RH) show an anisotropic arrangement of structural water molecules and the presence of dangling OH groups. The AIMD simulations allow a detailed assignment of the SFG spectra and show that the cleaved (010) surface rearranges to have only 25% of the OH groups pointing away from the surface. At higher RHs, the first adsorbed water layer binds to these OH groups and forms an anisotropic arrangement, but with the amount of free OH groups significantly suppressed and without any significant diffusion. Upon adsorption of a second water layer, although the topmost layer of molecules is more disordered and dynamic than the previous one, its structure is still influenced by the gypsum surface underneath because it has a much reduced amount of free OH groups with respect to the free surface of water, and a slower surface diffusion with respect to bulk water. The theoretical results corroborate the experimental ones and provide an accurate atomic characterization of the surface structure.",2
Molecular Gating of an Engineered Enzyme Captured in Real Time.,"Enzyme engineering tends to focus on the design of active sites for the chemical steps, while the physical steps of the catalytic cycle are often overlooked. Tight binding of a substrate in an active site is beneficial for the chemical steps, whereas good accessibility benefits substrate binding and product release. Many enzymes control the accessibility of their active sites by molecular gates. Here we analyzed the dynamics of a molecular gate artificially introduced into an access tunnel of the most efficient haloalkane dehalogenase using pre-steady-state kinetics, single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics. Photoinduced electron-transfer-fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (PET-FCS) has enabled real-time observation of molecular gating at the single-molecule level with rate constants ( kon = 1822 s(-1), koff = 60 s(-1)) corresponding well with those from the pre-steady-state kinetics ( k-1 = 1100 s(-1), k1 = 20 s(-1)). The PET-FCS technique is used here to study the conformational dynamics in a soluble enzyme, thus demonstrating an additional application for this method. Engineering dynamical molecular gates represents a widely applicable strategy for designing efficient biocatalysts.",2
Two-Dimensional Electronic Spectroscopy Reveals Excitation Energy-Dependent State Mixing during Singlet Fission in a Terrylenediimide Dimer.,"Singlet fission (SF) is a spin-allowed process in which a singlet exciton, (1)(S1S0), within an assembly of two or more chromophores spontaneously down-converts into two triplet excitons via a multiexciton correlated triplet pair state, (1)(T1T1). To elucidate the involvement of charge transfer (CT) states and vibronic coupling in SF, we performed 2D electronic spectroscopy (2DES) on dilute solutions of a covalently linked, slip-stacked terrylene-3,4:11,12-bis(dicarboximide) (TDI) dimer. This dimer undergoes efficient SF in nonpolar 1,4-dioxane and symmetry-breaking charge separation in polar dichloromethane. The various 2DES spectral features in 1,4-dioxane show different pump wavelength dependencies, supporting the presence of mixed states with variable (1)(S1S0), (1)(T1T1) and CT contributions that evolve with time. Analysis of the 2DES spectra in dichloromethane reveals the presence of a state having largely (1)(T1T1) character during charge separation. Therefore, the (1)(T1T1) multiexciton state plays an important role in the photophysics of this TDI dimer irrespective of solvent polarity.",2
Atomic Scale Evidence of the Switching Mechanism in a Photomagnetic CoFe Dinuclear Prussian Blue Analogue.,"Molecular complexes based on Prussian Blue analogues have recently attracted considerable interest for their unique bistable properties combined to ultimately reduced dimensions. Here, we investigate the first dinuclear FeCo complex exhibiting both thermal and photomagnetic bistability in the solid state. Through an experimental and theoretical approach combining local techniques-X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), and ligand field multiplet calculations-we were able to evidence the changes occurring at the atomic scale in the electronic and magnetic properties. The spectroscopic studies were able to fully support at the atomic level the following conclusions: (i) the 300 K phase and the light-induced excited state at 4 K are both built from FeLS(III)-CoHS(II) paramagnetic pairs with no apparent reorganization of the local structure, (ii) the 100 K phase is composed of FeLS(II)-CoLS(III) diamagnetic pairs, and (iii) the light-induced excited state is fully relaxed at an average temperature of approximately 50 K. In the paramagnetic phase at 2 K, XAS and XMCD reveal that both Fe and Co ions exhibit a rather large orbital magnetic moment (0.65 muB and 0.46 muB, respectively, under an external magnetic induction of 6.5 T), but it was not possible to detect a magnetic interaction between spin centers above 2 K.",2
Elucidating CO2 Chemisorption in Diamine-Appended Metal-Organic Frameworks.,"The widespread deployment of carbon capture and sequestration as a climate change mitigation strategy could be facilitated by the development of more energy-efficient adsorbents. Diamine-appended metal-organic frameworks of the type diamine-M2(dobpdc) (M = Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn; dobpdc(4-) = 4,4'-dioxidobiphenyl-3,3'-dicarboxylate) have shown promise for carbon-capture applications, although questions remain regarding the molecular mechanisms of CO2 uptake in these materials. Here we leverage the crystallinity and tunability of this class of frameworks to perform a comprehensive study of CO2 chemisorption. Using multinuclear nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy experiments and van-der-Waals-corrected density functional theory (DFT) calculations for 13 diamine-M2(dobpdc) variants, we demonstrate that the canonical CO2 chemisorption products, ammonium carbamate chains and carbamic acid pairs, can be readily distinguished and that ammonium carbamate chain formation dominates for diamine-Mg2(dobpdc) materials. In addition, we elucidate a new chemisorption mechanism in the material dmpn-Mg2(dobpdc) (dmpn = 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-diaminopropane), which involves the formation of a 1:1 mixture of ammonium carbamate and carbamic acid and accounts for the unusual adsorption properties of this material. Finally, we show that the presence of water plays an important role in directing the mechanisms for CO2 uptake in diamine-M2(dobpdc) materials. Overall, our combined NMR and DFT approach enables a thorough depiction and understanding of CO2 adsorption within diamine-M2(dobpdc) compounds, which may aid similar studies in other amine-functionalized adsorbents in the future.",2
Unraveling the Self-Assembly of Heterocluster Janus Dumbbells into Hybrid Cubosomes with Internal Double-Diamond Structure.,"Cubosomes are bicontinuous cubic-phase particles generated by amphiphile self-assembly with bicontinuous cubic phases, which creates an intricate network of interconnected nanochannels that endow these materials with special functions for advanced applications. On the other hand, clusters are an attractive class of molecules that exhibit intriguing functions and properties that differ from those of atoms and nanoparticles. Inspired by lipid self-assembly and attracted to the new functionalities of clusters, we prepared special heterocluster Janus dumbbells (HCJDs) composed of dissimilar nanoclusters: namely, a polyoxometalate and a polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane. HCJDs resemble conventional amphiphiles and, as such, they self-assemble in solution into faceted hybrid cubosomes via the transformation of vesicles into spongelike aggregates. Multiple mechanisms that lead to equilibrium, including molecular self-assembly, vesicle accumulation, membrane fusion, inner-structure reorganization, and cubic crystal growth, contributed to the overall process. On the basis of these results, we proposed a strategy for self-assembly-from basic molecular design that goes beyond traditional amphiphiles to the construction of micro- or nanomaterials with hierarchical structures and advanced functions.",2
Na3MnZr(PO4)3: A High-Voltage Cathode for Sodium Batteries.,"Sodium batteries have been regarded as promising candidates for large-scale energy storage application, provided cathode hosts with high energy density and long cycle life can be found. Herein, we report NASICON-structured Na3MnZr(PO4)3 as a cathode for sodium batteries that exhibits an electrochemical performance superior to those of other manganese phosphate cathodes reported in the literature. Both the Mn(4+)/Mn(3+) and Mn(3+)/Mn(2+) redox couples are reversibly accessed in Na3MnZr(PO4)3, providing high discharge voltage plateaus at 4.0 and 3.5 V, respectively. A high discharge capacity of 105 mAh g(-1) was obtained from Na3MnZr(PO4)3 with a small variation of lattice parameters and a small volume change on extraction of two Na(+) ions per formula unit. Moreover, Na3MnZr(PO4)3 exhibits an excellent cycling stability, retaining 91% of the initial capacity after 500 charge/discharge cycles at 0.5 C rate. On the basis of structural analysis and density functional theory calculations, we have proposed a detailed desodiation pathway from Na3MnZr(PO4)3 where Mn and Zr are disordered within the structure. We further show that the cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion of Mn(3+) is suppressed in the cathode and that Na2MnZr(PO4)3 is a stable phase.",2
Design Principles for Trap-Free CsPbX3 Nanocrystals: Enumerating and Eliminating Surface Halide Vacancies with Softer Lewis Bases.,"We introduce a general surface passivation mechanism for cesium lead halide perovskite materials (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) that is supported by a combined experimental and theoretical study of the nanocrystal surface chemistry. A variety of spectroscopic methods are employed together with ab initio calculations to identify surface halide vacancies as the predominant source of charge trapping. The number of surface traps per nanocrystal is quantified by (1)H NMR spectroscopy, and that number is consistent with a simple trapping model in which surface halide vacancies create deleterious under-coordinated lead atoms. These halide vacancies exhibit trapping behavior that differs among CsPbCl3, CsPbBr3, and CsPbI3. Ab initio calculations suggest that introduction of anionic X-type ligands can produce trap-free band gaps by altering the energetics of lead-based defect levels. General rules for selecting effective passivating ligand pairs are introduced by considering established principles of coordination chemistry. Introducing softer, anionic, X-type Lewis bases that target under-coordinated lead atoms results in absolute quantum yields approaching unity and monoexponential luminescence decay kinetics, thereby indicating full trap passivation. This work provides a systematic framework for preparing highly luminescent CsPbX3 nanocrystals with variable compositions and dimensionalities, thereby improving the fundamental understanding of these materials and informing future synthetic and post-synthetic efforts toward trap-free CsPbX3 nanocrystals.",2
Nickel-Catalyzed Reductive [2+2] Cycloaddition of Alkynes.,"The nickel-catalyzed synthesis of tetrasubstituted cyclobutenes from alkynes is reported. This transformation is uniquely promoted by the use of a primary aminophosphine, an unusual ligand in nickel catalysis. Mechanistic insights for this new transformation are provided, and postreaction modifications of the cyclobutene products to stereodefined cyclic and acyclic compounds are reported, including the synthesis of epi-truxillic acid.",2
Graphene Oxide Hybrid with Sulfur-Nitrogen Polymer for High-Performance Pseudocapacitors.,"Toward the introduction of fast faradaic pseudocapacitive behavior and the increase of the specific capacitance of carbon-based electrodes, we covalently functionalized graphene oxide with a redox active thiourea-formaldehyde polymer, yielding a multifunctional hybrid system. The multiscale physical and chemical characterization of the novel 3-dimensional hybrid revealed high material porosity with high specific surface area (402 m(2) g(-1)) and homogeneous element distribution. The presence of multiple functional groups comprising sulfur, nitrogen, and oxygen provide additional contribution of Faradaic redox reaction in supercapacity performance, leading to a high effective electrochemical pseudocapacitance. Significantly, our graphene-based 3-dimensional thiourea-formaldehyde hybrid exhibited specific capacitance as high as 400 F g(-1), areal capacitance of 160 mF cm(-2), and an energy density of 11.1 mWh cm(-3) at scan rate of 1 mV s(-1) with great capacitance retention (100%) after 5000 cycles at scan rate of 100 mV s(-1).",2
Identification of G-Quadruplex-Binding Protein from the Exploration of RGG Motif/G-Quadruplex Interactions.,"The arginine/glycine-rich region termed the RGG domain is usually found in G-quadruplex (G4)-binding proteins and is important in G4-protein interactions. Studies on the binding mechanism of RGG domains found that small segments (RGG motif) inside the domain contribute greatly to the G4 binding affinity. However, unlike the entire RGG domains that have been broadly explored, the role of the RGG motif remains obscure, with very limited study. Herein, to clarify the role of the RGG motif in G4-protein interactions, we systematically investigated the binding affinity and mode between RGG-motif peptides and G4s. The internal arrangement of RGG repeats and gap amino acids played a more crucial role in the G4-binding mechanism than a critical number of RGG repeats. Arginines and phenylalanines at the exact position of the RGG motif might enable additional hydrogen bonding and pi-stacking interaction with nucleobases and strengthen the binding of G4. Impressively, proceeding from a G4-binding RGG peptide, 12, discovered above, we identified the cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRBP) as a new G4 DNA-binding protein both in vitro and in cells. In addition, we found that the key amino acids for G4 binding in peptide 12 and CIRBP were highly similar, and peptide 12 clearly played a key role in the G4 binding of CIRBP. This report is the first in which a G4-binding protein was identified from exploration of the G4-binding RGG motif. Our findings suggest a novel strategy for discovering new G4-binding proteins by exploring key peptide segments.",2
Dielectric Behavior as a Screen in Rational Searches for Electronic Materials: Metal Pnictide Sulfosalts.,"Dielectric screening plays an important role in reducing the strength of carrier scattering and trapping by point defects for many semiconductors such as the halide perovskite solar materials. However, it was rarely considered as a screen to find new electronic semiconductors. We performed a material search study using the dielectric properties as a screen to identify potential electronic materials in the class of metal-pnictide ternary sulfosalts, containing Bi or Sb. These salts are basically ionic due to the electronegativity difference between the S and both the metal and pnictogen elements. However, we do find significant cross-gap hybridization between the S p-derived valence bands and pnictogen p-derived conduction bands in many of the materials. This leads to enhanced Born effective charges and, in several cases, highly enhanced dielectric constants. We find a chemical rule for high dielectric constants in terms of the bond connectivity of the pnictogen-chalcogen part of the crystal structure. We additionally find a series of compounds with low effective mass, high dielectric constant, and other properties that suggest good performance as electronic materials and also several potential thermoelectric compounds. Experimental optical data and solar conversion efficiency are reported for Sn-Sb-S samples, and results in accord with predicted good performance are found. The results illustrate the utility of dielectric properties as a screen for identifying complex semiconductors.",2
Metallaphotoredox-Catalyzed Cross-Electrophile Csp(3)-Csp(3) Coupling of Aliphatic Bromides.,"A strategy for the installation of small alkyl fragments onto pharmaceutically relevant aliphatic structures has been established via metallaphotoredox catalysis. Herein, we report that tris(trimethylsilyl)silanol can be employed as an effective halogen abstraction reagent that, in combination with photoredox and nickel catalysis, allows a generic approach to Csp(3)-Csp(3) cross-electrophile coupling. In this study, we demonstrate that a variety of aliphatic drug-like groups can be successfully coupled with a number of commercially available small alkyl electrophiles, including methyl tosylate and strained cyclic alkyl bromides. Moreover, the union of two secondary aliphatic carbon centers, a long-standing challenge for organic molecule construction, has been accomplished with a wide array of structural formats. Last, this technology can be selectively merged with Csp(2)-Csp(3) aryl-alkyl couplings to build drug-like systems in a highly modular fashion.",2
Control over Near-Ballistic Electron Transport through Formation of Parallel Pathways in a Single-Molecule Wire.,"This paper reports highly efficient coherent tunneling in single-molecule wires of oligo-ferrocenes with one to three Fc units. The Fc units were directly coupled to the electrodes, i.e., without chemical anchoring groups between the Fc units and the terminal electrodes. We found that a single Fc unit readily interacts with the metal electrodes of an STM break junction (STM = scanning tunneling microscope) and that the zero-voltage bias conductance of an individual Fc molecular junction increased 5-fold, up to 80% of the conductance quantum G0 (77.4 muS), when the length of the molecular wire was increased from one to three connected Fc units. Our compendium of experimental evidence combined with nonequilibrium Green function calculations contemplate a plausible scenario to explain the exceedingly high measured conductance based on the electrode/molecule contact via multiple Fc units. The oligo-Fc backbone is initially connected through all Fc units, and, as one of the junction electrodes is pulled away, each Fc unit is sequentially disconnected from one of the junction terminals, resulting in several distinct conductance features proportional to the number of Fc units in the backbone. The conductance values are independent of the applied temperature (-10 to 85 degrees C), which indicates that the mechanism of charge transport is coherent tunneling for all measured configurations. These measurements show the direct Fc-electrode coupling provides highly efficient molecular conduits with very low barrier for electron tunneling and whose conductivity can be modulated near the ballistic regime through the number of Fc units able to bridge and the energy position of the frontier molecular orbital.",2
Design and Biosynthesis of Dimeric Alboflavusins with Biaryl Linkages via Regiospecific C-C Bond Coupling.,"Alboflavusins (AFNs) are a group of cyclohexapeptides with moderate antibacterial and antitumor activities from Streptomyces alboflavus sp. 313. In vivo and in vitro studies proposed that AFNs are biosynthesized by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase machinery, and the 6-Cl-L-Trp precursor is supplied by a tryptophan halogenase gene located outside the afn gene cluster. Guided by the structure-activity relationship knowledge about the AFN-like cyclohexapeptides, two dimeric AFNs (di-AFNs) with regiospecific biaryl linkages were designed and generated biotechnologically by expressing the P450 gene hmtS or clpS in S. alboflavus wild-type and mutant strains. The di-AFNs displayed much better antibacterial and antitumor activities than their monomers as anticipated, exemplifying a rational strategy to generate natural product congeners with improved bioactivities.",2
Binding of Distinct Substrate Conformations Enables Hydroxylation of Remote Sites in Thaxtomin D by Cytochrome P450 TxtC.,"Cytochromes P450 (CYPs) catalyze various oxidative transformations in drug metabolism, xenobiotic degradation, and natural product biosynthesis. Here we report biochemical, structural, and theoretical studies of TxtC, an unusual bifunctional CYP involved in the biosynthesis of the EPA-approved herbicide thaxtomin A. TxtC was shown to hydroxylate two remote sites within the Phe residue of its diketopiperazine substrate thaxtomin D. The reactions follow a preferred order, with hydroxylation of the alpha-carbon preceding functionalization of the phenyl group. To illuminate the molecular basis for remote site functionalization, X-ray crystal structures of TxtC in complex with the substrate and monohydroxylated intermediate were determined. Electron density corresponding to a diatomic molecule (probably dioxygen) was sandwiched between the heme iron atom and Thr237 in the TxtC-intermediate structure, providing insight into the mechanism for conversion of the ferrous-dioxygen complex into the reactive ferryl intermediate. The substrate and monohydroxylated intermediate adopted similar conformations in the active site, with the pi-face of the phenyl group positioned over the heme iron atom. Docking simulations reproduced this observation and identified a second, energetically similar but conformationally distinct binding mode in which the alpha-hydrogen of the Phe residue is positioned over the heme prosthetic group. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed that the alpha-hydrogen is sufficiently close to the ferryl oxygen atom to be extracted by it and indicated that the two substrate conformations cannot readily interconvert in the active site. These results indicate that TxtC is able to hydroxylate two spatially remote sites by binding distinct conformations of the substrate and monohydroxylated intermediate.",2
Concept and Development of Framework Nucleic Acids.,"The blooming field of structural DNA nanotechnology harnessing the material properties of nucleic acids has attracted widespread interest. The exploitation of the precise and programmable Watson-Crick base pairing of DNA or RNA has led to the development of exquisite nucleic acid nanostructures from one to three dimensions. The advances of computer-aided tools facilitate automated design of DNA nanostructures with various sizes and shapes. Especially, the construction of shell or skeleton DNA frameworks, or more recently dubbed ""framework nucleic acids"" (FNAs) provides a means to organize molecules or nanoparticles with nanometer precision. The intrinsic biological properties and tailorable functionalities of FNAs hold great promise for physical, chemical, and biological applications. This Perspective highlights state-of-the-art design and construction, of precisely assembled FNAs, and outlines the challenges and opportunities for exploiting the structural potential of FNAs for translational applications.",2
Rational Design of an Amphiphilic Coordination Cage-Based Emulsifier.,"Self-assembled, porous coordination cages with a functional interior find application in controlled guest inclusion/release, drug delivery, separation processes, and catalysis. However, only few studies exist that describe their utilization for the development of self-assembled materials based on their 3-dimensional shape and external functionalization. Here, dodecyl chain-containing, acridone-based ligands (L(A)) and shape-complementary phenanthrene-derived ligands (L(B)) are shown to self-assemble to heteroleptic coordination cages cis-[Pd2(L(A))2(L(B))2](4+) acting as a gemini amphiphile (CGA-1; Cage-based Gemini Amphiphile-1). Owing to their anisotropic decoration with short polar and long nonpolar side chains, the cationic cages were found to assemble into vesicles with diameters larger than 100 nm in suitable polar solvents, visualized by cryo-TEM and Liquid-Cell Transmission Electron Microscopy (LC-TEM). LC-TEM reveals that these vesicles aggregate into chains and necklaces via long-range interactions. In addition, the cages show a rarely described ability to stabilize oil-in-oil emulsions.",2
Amphiphile-Mediated Depalmitoylation of Proteins in Living Cells.,"Post-translational S-palmitoylation plays a central role in protein localization, trafficking, stability, aggregation, and cell signaling. Dysregulation of palmitoylation pathways in cells can alter protein function and is the cause of several diseases. Considering the biological and clinical importance of S-palmitoylation, tools for direct, in vivo modulation of this lipid modification would be extremely valuable. Here, we describe a method for the cleavage of native S-palmitoyl groups from proteins in living cells. Using a cell permeable, cysteine-functionalized amphiphile, we demonstrate the direct depalmitoylation of cellular proteins. We show that amphiphile-mediated depalmitoylation (AMD) can effectively cleave S-palmitoyl groups from the native GTPase HRas and successfully depalmitoylate mislocalized proteins in an infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (INCL) disease model. AMD enables direct and facile depalmitoylation of proteins in live cells and has potential therapeutic applications for diseases such as INCL, where native protein thioesterase activity is deficient.",2
Silicon-Mediated Selective Homo- and Heterocoupling of Carbon Monoxide.,"While the transformation of carbon monoxide to multicarbon compounds (fuels and organic bulk chemicals) via reductive scission of the enormously strong CO bond is dominated by transition metals, splitting and deoxygenative reductive coupling of CO under nonmatrix conditions using silicon, the second most abundant nonmetal of the earth's crust, is extremely scarce and mechanistically not well understood. Herein, we report the selective deoxygenative homocoupling of carbon monoxide by divalent silicon utilizing the (LSi:)2Xant 1a [Xant = 9,9-dimethyl-xanthene-4,5-diyl; PhC(N (t)Bu)2] and (LSi:)2Fc 1b (Fc = 1,1'-ferrocenyl) as four-electron reduction reagents under mild reaction conditions (RT, 1 atm), affording the corresponding disilylketenes, Xant(LSi)2(mu-O)(mu-CCO) 2a and Fc(LSi)2(mu-O)(mu-CCO) 2b, respectively. However, the dibenzofuran analogue of 1b, compound 1c, was unreactive toward CO due to the longer distance between the two Si(II) atoms, which demonstrated the crucial role of the Si...Si distance on cooperative CO binding and activation. This is confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and further theoretical investigations on CO homocoupling with 1a and 1b revealed that the initial step of CO binding and scission involved CO acting as a Lewis acid (four-electron acceptor), in sharp contrast to CO activation mediated by transition metals where CO serves as a Lewis base (two-electron donor). This mechanism was strongly reinforced by the reaction of 1a with isocyanide Xyl-NC (Xyl = 2,6-Me2C6H3), isoelectronic with CO. Treatment of 1a with one or two molecules of Xyl-NC furnished the unique (silyl)(imido)silene 3a and the C horizontal lineC coupled bis(Xyl-NC) product 5, respectively, via the isolable doubly bridged Xant(LSi)2(mu-XylNC)2 intermediate 4. Moreover, compound 3a reacts with 1 molar equivalent of CO to give the disilylketenimine Xant(LSi)2(mu-O)(mu-CCNR) 6, representing, for the first time, a selective heterocoupling product of CO with isoelectronic isocyanide.",2
Triangular DNA Origami Tilings.,"DNA origami tilings provide methods for creating complex molecular patterns and shapes using flat DNA origami structures as building blocks. Square tiles have been developed to construct micrometer-scale arrays and to generate patterns using stochastic or deterministic strategies. Here we show triangular tiles as a complementary approach for enriching the design space of DNA tilings and for extending the shape of the self-assembled arrays from 2D to 3D. We introduce a computational approach for maximizing binding specificity in a fully symmetric tile design, with which we construct a 20-tile structure resembling a rhombic triacontahedron. We demonstrate controlled transition between 3D and 2D structures using simple methods including tile concentration, magnesium, and fold symmetry in tile edge design. Using these approaches, we construct 2D arrays with unbounded and designed sizes. The programmability of the edge design and the flexibility of the structure make the triangular DNA origami tile an ideal building block for complex self-assembly and reconfiguration in artificial molecular machines and fabricated nanodevices.",2
"Anthracene as a Launchpad for a Phosphinidene Sulfide and for Generation of a Phosphorus-Sulfur Material Having the Composition P2S, a Vulcanized Red Phosphorus That Is Yellow.","Thermolysis of a pair of dibenzo-7-phosphanorbornadiene compounds is shown to lead to differing behaviors: phosphinidene sulfide release and formation of amorphous P2S. These compounds, (t)BuP(S)A (1, A = C14H10 or anthracene; 59% isol. yield) and HP(S)A (2; 63%), are available through thionation of (t)BuPA and the new secondary phosphine HPA (5), prepared from Me2NPA and DIBAL-H in 50% yield. Phosphinidene sulfide [ (t)BuP horizontal lineS] transfer is shown to proceed efficiently from 1 to 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene to form Diels-Alder product 3 with a zero-order dependence on diene. Platinum complex (Ph3P)2Pt(eta(2)- (t)BuPS) (4, 47%) is also accessed from 1 and structurally characterized. In contrast, heating parent species 2 (3 h, 135 degrees C) under vacuum instead produces an insoluble, nonvolatile yellow residual material 6 of composition P2S that displays semiconductor properties with an optical band gap of 2.4 eV. Material 6 obtained in this manner from molecular precursor 2 is in a poorly characterized portion of the phosphorus-sulfur phase diagram and has therefore been subjected to a range of spectroscopic techniques to gain structural insight. X-ray spectroscopic and diffraction techniques, including Raman, XANES, EXAFS, and PDF, reveal 6 to have similarities with related compounds including P4S3, Hittorf's violet phosphorus. Various possible structures have been explored as well using quantum chemical calculations under the constraint that each phosphorus atom is trivalent with no terminal sulfide groups, and each sulfur atom is divalent. The structural conclusions are supported by data from phosphorus-31 magic angle spinning (MAS) solid state NMR spectroscopy, bolstering the structural comparisons to other phosphorus-sulfur systems while excluding the formulation of P2S as a simple mixture of P4S3 and phosphorus.",2
"A Highly Ordered Nanoporous, Two-Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework with Modifiable Pores, and Its Application in Water Purification and Ion Sieving.","The preparation of membranes with high selectivity based on specific chemical properties such as size and charge would impact the efficiency of the world's energy supply, the production of clean water, and many other separation technologies. We report a flexible synthetic protocol for preparing highly ordered two-dimensional nanoporous polymeric materials (termed covalent organic frameworks or COFs) that allow for placing virtually any function group within the nanopores. We demonstrate that membranes, fabricated with this new family of materials with carboxylated pore walls, are very water permeable, as well as highly charged and size selective.",2
Nitric Oxide Reductase Activity in Heme-Nonheme Binuclear Engineered Myoglobins through a One-Electron Reduction Cycle.,"FeBMbs are structural and functional models of native bacterial nitric oxide reductases (NORs) generated through engineering of myoglobin. These biosynthetic models replicate the heme-nonheme diiron site of NORs and allow substitutions of metal centers and heme cofactors. Here, we provide evidence for multiple NOR turnover in monoformyl-heme-containing FeBMb1 proteins loaded with Fe(II), Co(II), or Zn(II) metal ions at the FeB site (Fe(II)/Co(II)/Zn(II)-FeBMb1(MF-heme)). FTIR detection of the nu(NNO) band of N2O at 2231 cm(-1) provides a direct quantitative measurement of the product in solution. A maximum number of turnover is observed with Fe(II)-FeBMb1(MF-heme), but the NOR activity is retained when the FeB site is loaded with Zn(II). These data support the viability of a one-electron semireduced pathway for the reduction of NO at binuclear centers in reducing conditions.",2
Design and Enantioresolution of Homochiral Fe(II)-Pd(II) Coordination Cages from Stereolabile Metalloligands: Stereochemical Stability and Enantioselective Separation.,"The stereochemistry of chiral-at-metal complexes is much more abundant, albeit complicated, than chiral-at-carbon compounds, but how to make use of stereolabile metal-centers remains a formidable challenge due to the highly versatile coordination geometry of metal ions and racemization/epimerization problem. We demonstrate herein a stepwise assembly of configurationally stable [Pd6(FeL3)8](28+) (Delta/Lambda-MOCs-42) homochiral octahedral cages from unstable D3-symmetry tris-chelate-Fe type metalloligands via strong face-directed stereochemical coupling and facile chiral-induced resolution processes based on stereodifferentiating host-guest dynamics. Kinetic studies reveal that the dissociation rate of MOC-42 cages is 100-fold slower than that of Fe-metalloligands and the racemization is effectively inhibited, making the cages retain their chirality over extended periods of time (>5 months) at room temperature. Recyclable enantioseparation of atropisomeric compounds has been successfully achieved, giving up to 88% ee.",2
"Photoactivation Mechanism, Timing of Protein Secondary Structure Dynamics and Carotenoid Translocation in the Orange Carotenoid Protein.","The orange carotenoid protein (OCP) is a two-domain photoactive protein that noncovalently binds an echinenone (ECN) carotenoid and mediates photoprotection in cyanobacteria. In the dark, OCP assumes an orange, inactive state known as OCP(O); blue light illumination results in the red active state, known as OCP(R). The OCP(R) state is characterized by large-scale structural changes that involve dissociation and separation of C-terminal and N-terminal domains accompanied by carotenoid translocation into the N-terminal domain. The mechanistic and dynamic-structural relations between photon absorption and formation of the OCP(R) state have remained largely unknown. Here, we employ a combination of time-resolved UV-visible and (polarized) mid-infrared spectroscopy to assess the electronic and structural dynamics of the carotenoid and the protein secondary structure, from femtoseconds to 0.5 ms. We identify a hereto unidentified carotenoid excited state in OCP, the so-called S* state, which we propose to play a key role in breaking conserved hydrogen-bond interactions between carotenoid and aromatic amino acids in the binding pocket. We arrive at a comprehensive reaction model where the hydrogen-bond rupture with conserved aromatic side chains at the carotenoid beta1-ring in picoseconds occurs at a low yield of <1%, whereby the beta1-ring retains a trans configuration with respect to the conjugated pi-electron chain. This event initiates structural changes at the N-terminal domain in 1 mus, which allow the carotenoid to translocate into the N-terminal domain in 10 mus. We identified infrared signatures of helical elements that dock on the C-terminal domain beta-sheet in the dark and unfold in the light to allow domain separation. These helical elements do not move within the experimental range of 0.5 ms, indicating that domain separation occurs on longer time scales, lagging carotenoid translocation by at least 2 decades of time.",2
Synergetic Organocatalysis for Eliminating Epimerization in Ring-Opening Polymerizations Enables Synthesis of Stereoregular Isotactic Polyester.,"Ring-opening polymerization of O-carboxyanhydrides (OCAs) can furnish polyesters with a diversity of functional groups that are traditionally hard to harvest by polymerization of lactones. Typical ring-opening catalysts are subject to unavoidable racemization of most OCA monomers, which hampers the synthesis of highly isotactic crystalline polymers. Here, we describe an effective bifunctional single-molecule organocatalysis for selective ring-opening polymerization of OCAs without epimerization. The close vicinity of both activating groups in the same molecule engenders an amplified synergetic effect and thus allows for the use of mild bases, thereby leading to minimal epimerization for polymerization. Ring-opening polymerization of manOCA monomer (OCA from mandelic acid) mediated by the bifunctional single-molecule organocatalyst yields highly isotactic poly(mandelic acid) (PMA) with controlled molecular weights (up to 19.8 kg mol(-1)). Mixing of the two enantiomers of PMA generates the first example of a crystalline stereocomplex in this area, which displayed distinct Tm values around 150 degrees C. Remarkably, the bifunctional catalysts are moisture-stable, recyclable, and easy to use, allowing sustainable and scalable synthesis of a stereoregular functional polyester.",2
Sequence-defined multifunctional polyethers via liquid-phase synthesis with molecular sieving.,"Synthetic chemists have devoted tremendous effort towards the production of precision synthetic polymers with defined sequences and specific functions. However, the creation of a general technology that enables precise control over monomer sequence, with efficient isolation of the target polymers, is highly challenging. Here, we report a robust strategy for the production of sequence-defined synthetic polymers through a combination of liquid-phase synthesis and selective molecular sieving. The polymer is assembled in solution with real-time monitoring to ensure couplings proceed to completion, on a three-armed star-shaped macromolecule to maximize efficiency during the molecular sieving process. This approach is applied to the construction of sequence-defined polyethers, with side-arms at precisely defined locations that can undergo site-selective modification after polymerization. Using this versatile strategy, we have introduced structural and functional diversity into sequence-defined polyethers, unlocking their potential for real-life applications in nanotechnology, healthcare and information storage.",2
Photochemical generation of radicals from alkyl electrophiles using a nucleophilic organic catalyst.,"Chemists extensively use free radical reactivity for applications in organic synthesis, materials science, and life science. Traditionally, generating radicals requires strategies that exploit the bond dissociation energy or the redox properties of the precursors. Here, we disclose a photochemical catalytic approach that harnesses different physical properties of the substrate to form carbon radicals. We use a nucleophilic dithiocarbamate anion catalyst, adorned with a well-tailored chromophoric unit, to activate alkyl electrophiles via an SN2 pathway. The resulting photon-absorbing intermediate affords radicals upon homolytic cleavage induced by visible light. This catalytic SN2-based strategy, which exploits a fundamental mechanistic process of ionic chemistry, grants access to open-shell intermediates from a variety of substrates that would be incompatible with or inert to classical radical-generating strategies. We also describe how the method's mild reaction conditions and high functional group tolerance could be advantageous for developing C-C bond-forming reactions, for streamlining the preparation of a marketed drug, for the late-stage elaboration of biorelevant compounds and for enantioselective radical catalysis.",2
Hierarchical organization of perylene bisimides and polyoxometalates for photo-assisted water oxidation.,"The oxygen in Earth's atmosphere is there primarily because of water oxidation performed by photosynthetic organisms using solar light and one specialized protein complex, photosystem II (PSII). High-resolution imaging of the PSII 'core' complex shows the ideal co-localization of multi-chromophore light-harvesting antennas with the functional reaction centre. Man-made systems are still far from replicating the complexity of PSII, as the majority of PSII mimetics have been limited to photocatalytic dyads based on a 1:1 ratio of a light absorber, generally a Ru-polypyridine complex, with a water oxidation catalyst. Here we report the self-assembly of multi-perylene-bisimide chromophores (PBI) shaped to function by interaction with a polyoxometalate water-oxidation catalyst (Ru4POM). The resulting [PBI]5Ru4POM complex shows a robust amphiphilic structure and dynamic aggregation into large two-dimensional paracrystalline domains, a redshifted light-harvesting efficiency of >40% and favourable exciton accumulation, with a peak quantum efficiency using 'green' photons (lambda > 500 nm). The modularity of the building blocks and the simplicity of the non-covalent chemistry offer opportunities for innovation in artificial photosynthesis.",2
Highly responsive nature of porous coordination polymer surfaces imaged by in situ atomic force microscopy.,"The ability of porous coordination polymers to undergo reversible structural transformations in response to the presence of guest molecules has been intensively investigated for applications such as molecular separation, storage, sensing and signalling processes. Here we report on the direct observation of the highly guest-responsive nature of the surface of a single-crystalline porous coordination polymer, which consists of paddlewheel zinc clusters and two types of ligand, by in situ liquid-phase atomic force microscopy. Observations were carried out in solution at constant temperature (28 degrees C) by high-speed atomic force microscopy with lattice resolution. A sharp and reversible response to the presence or absence of biphenyl guest molecules was observed, under conditions that can scarcely induce the transformation of the bulk crystal. Additionally, by modulating the surface coordination equilibrium, layer-by-layer delamination events were captured in real time at every ~13 s per frame.",2
"Copper-Catalyzed Radical 1,4-Difunctionalization of 1,3-Enynes with Alkyl Diacyl Peroxides and N-Fluorobenzenesulfonimide.","Many reactions involving allenyl ion species have been studied, but reactions involving allenyl radicals are less well understood, perhaps because of the inconvenience associated with the generation of short-lived allenyl radicals. We describe here a versatile method for the generation of allenyl radicals and their previously unreported applications in the intermolecular 1,4-carbocyanation and 1,4-sulfimidocyanation of 1,3-enynes. With the assistance of the trifunctional reagents, alkyl diacyl peroxides or N-fluorobenzenesulfonimide, a range of synthetically challenging multisubstituted allenes can be prepared with high regioselectivity. These multisubstituted allenes can be easily transformed into synthetically useful structures such as fluorinated vinyl cyanides, lactones, functionalized allenyl amides, 1-aminonaphthalenes, and pyridin-2(1 H)-ones, and several novel transformations are reported. The results of radical scavenger and radical clock experiments are consistent with the proposed allenyl radical pathway. Density functional theory (DFT) and IR spectroscopy studies suggest the formation of an isocyanocopper(II) species in the ligand exchange step. On the basis of the results of IR, DFT, and diastereoselectivity studies, an isocyanocopper(II)/copper(I) catalytic cycle is proposed, which differs from the previously considered Cu(III) mechanism in cyanation reactions.",2
An Isolable Bis(silylene)-Stabilized Germylone and Its Reactivity.,"The first zerovalent germanium complex (""germylone"") 3, [Si(II)(Xant)Si(II)]Ge(0), stabilized by a chelating bis(N-heterocyclic silylene)xanthene donor ligand 1 was successfully synthesized via the dechlorination of the corresponding {[Si(II)(Xant)Si(II)]GeCl}(+)Cl(-) complex 2 with KC8; it was structurally and spectroscopically characterized, and also studied by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis of 3 unambiguously exhibits two lone pairs of electrons (one sigma-type lone-pair and one 3p(Ge) lone-pair) on the zerovalent Ge atom. This is why the Ge atom can form the corresponding mono- and bis-AlBr3 Ge --> Al Lewis adducts [Si(II)(Xant)Si(II)]Ge(AlBr3) 4 and [Si(II)(Xant)Si(II)]Ge(AlBr3)2 5, respectively. Due to the electron-rich character of the Ge(0) atom, the germylone 3 displayed quite unusual reactivities. Thus, the reaction of 3 with 9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (9-BBN) as a potential Lewis acid furnished the first boryl(silyl)germylene complex 6, possessing a heteroallylic B...Ge...Si pi-conjugation. When 3 was allowed to react with Ni(cod)2 (cod = 1,5-cyclooctadiene), the unique {[Si(II)(Xant)Si(II)]Ge(I)}2Ni(II) complex with a three-membered ring Ge2Ni-metallacycle was obtained via reductive coupling of two Ge(0) atoms on the Ni center. Moreover, 3 was suitable to form a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) with BPh3, which was capable of heterolytic H2 cleavage at 1 atm and room temperature, representing, for the first time, that a metallylone could be applied in FLP chemistry.",2
Calix[4]pyrrole Hydridosilicate: The Elusive Planar Tetracoordinate Silicon Imparts Striking Stability to Its Anionic Silicon Hydride.,"Anionic hydridosilicates are highly reactive and strong hydride donors. In contrast, calix[4]pyrrole hydridosilicate is an entirely water-stable, anionic silicon hydride, which does not show hydridic reactivity. However, it still acts as an electron donor and enables the detection of a single electron transfer process in the reduction chemistry with hydridosilicates. Most important, these unusual properties are imparted by the unique planar structure of its elusive parent neutral silane-substantiating the effect of planar tetracoordinate silicon for the first time.",2
Overcoming the Limitations of gamma- and delta-C-H Arylation of Amines through Ligand Development.,"L,X-Type transient directing groups (TDGs) based on a reversible imine linkage have emerged as broadly useful tools for C-H activation of ketones and free amines. However, competitive binding interactions among multiple reaction components (TDG itself, substrate, and substrate-TDG adduct) with the palladium catalyst often lead to the formation of multiple unreactive complexes, rendering ligand development extremely challenging. Herein, we report the finding of versatile 2-pyridone ligands that addresses these problems and significantly improves the gamma-methylene arylation of alkyl amines, extending the coupling partners to a wide range of medicinally important heteroaryl iodides and even previously unreactive heteroaryl bromides. The combination of an appropriate transient directing group and pyridone ligand has also enabled the delta-arylation of alkyl amines. Notably, our transient directing group design reveals the importance of matching the size of the Pd-chelation with different transient directing groups and the size of palladacycles generated from gamma- and delta-C-H bonds: TDGs that coordinate with Pd(II) to form a six-membered chelate are selective toward gamma-C-H bonds, whereas TDGs that coordinate with Pd(II) via a five-membered chelate tend to activate delta-C-H bonds. These findings provide an avenue for developing protecting group free and selective C-H functionalization using the transient directing group strategy.",2
Potential Dependence of Mechanical Stability and Electronic Coupling of Single S-Au Bonds.,"Providing a mechanically stable and electronically efficient coupling between a molecule and an electrode is critical to the study of charge transfer and conductance of the molecule. A common method is to link the molecule to Au electrodes via a linker (e.g., thiol terminal of the molecule). Here we study the mechanical stability and electronic coupling of a S-Au bond in single-molecule junctions over a broad range of electrode potentials. Our results show that the mechanical and electromechanical properties of molecule-electrode contact undergo a systematic change with the potential involving Au oxidation at positive potentials and S protonation at negative potentials. The study establishes the potential range for a stable S-Au bond and determines the potential dependence of the mechanical and electromechanical properties of the molecule-electrode contact, which is crucial to the interpretation of potential-dependent charge transfer in electrochemistry and electrochemical gating of charge transport in molecular electronics.",2
Synthesis and Characterization of a Neutral U(II) Arene Sandwich Complex.,"Reduction of IU(NHAr(iPr6))2 (Ar(iPr6) = 2,6-(2,4,6-(i)Pr3C6H2)2C6H3) results in a rare example of a U(II) complex, U(NHAr(iPr6))2, and the first example that is a neutral species. Here, we show spectroscopic and magnetic studies that suggest a 5f(4)6d(0) valence electronic configuration for uranium, along with characterization of related U(III) complexes.",2
Preparing Semiconducting Nanoribbons with Tunable Length and Width via Crystallization-Driven Self-Assembly of a Simple Conjugated Homopolymer.,"Precise control of width and length of one-dimensional (1D) semiconducting nanostructures has attracted much attention owing to its potential for optoelectronic applications. However, regulating both their length and width using conjugated polymers or even block copolymers is a huge challenge. To solve this problem, we synthesized a unique conjugated polyacetylene homopolymer by living cyclopolymerization, which spontaneously formed 1D nanoribbons via in situ nanoparticlization. Interestingly, their widths could be controlled from 8 to 41 nm, which were directly proportional to their degree of polymerization. Furthermore, a self-seeding technique via crystallization-driven self-assembly (CDSA) was used to control the length of the nanoribbons up to 5.2 mum with narrow distributions less than 1.1. Interestingly, adding a block copolymer unimer to these nanoribbons produced triblock comicelles by the living CDSA mechanism. Finally, these nanoribbons were visualized directly by super-resolution optical fluorescence microscopy. Now, one can modulate both length and width of 1D nanoribbons simultaneously.",2
Reactivity of Solid Rubrene with Potassium: Competition between Intercalation and Molecular Decomposition.,"We present the synthesis and characterization of the K(+)-intercalated rubrene (C42H28) phase, K2Rubrene (K2R), and identify the coexistence of amorphous and crystalline materials in samples where the crystalline component is phase-pure. We suggest this is characteristic of many intercalated alkali metal-polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) systems, including those for which superconductivity has been claimed. The systematic investigation of K-rubrene solid-state reactions using both K and KH sources reveals a complex competition between K intercalation and the decomposition of rubrene, producing three K-intercalated compounds, namely, K2R, K(RR*), and K xR' (where R* and R' are rubrene decomposition derivatives C42H26 and C30H20, respectively). K2R is obtained as the major phase over a wide composition range and is accompanied by the formation of amorphous byproducts from the decomposition of rubrene. K(RR*) is synthesized as a single phase, and K xR' is obtained only as a secondary phase to the majority K2R phase. The crystal structure of K2R was determined using high-resolution powder X-ray diffraction, revealing that the structural rearrangement from pristine rubrene creates two large voids per rubrene within the molecular layers in which K(+) is incorporated. K(+) cations accommodated within the large voids interact strongly with the neighboring rubrene via eta(6), eta(3), and eta(2) binding modes to the tetracene cores and the phenyl groups. This contrasts with other intercalated PAHs, where only a single void per PAH is created and the intercalated K(+) weakly interacts with the host. The decomposition products of rubrene are also examined using solution NMR, highlighting the role of the breaking of C-Cphenyl bonds. For the crystalline decomposition derivative products K(RR*) and K xR', a lack of definitive structural information with regard to R* and R' prevents the crystal structures from being determined. The study illustrates the complexity in accessing solvent-free alkali metal salts of reduced PAH of the type claimed to afford superconductivity.",2
Electronegativity Seen as the Ground-State Average Valence Electron Binding Energy.,"We introduce a new electronegativity scale for atoms, based consistently on ground-state energies of valence electrons. The scale is closely related to (yet different from) L. C. Allen's, which is based on configuration energies. Using a combination of literature experimental values for ground-state energies and ab initio-calculated energies where experimental data are missing, we are able to provide electronegativities for elements 1-96. The values are slightly smaller than Allen's original scale, but correlate well with Allen's and others. Outliers in agreement with other scales are oxygen and fluorine, now somewhat less electronegative, but in better agreement with their chemistry with the noble gas elements. Group 11 and 12 electronegativities emerge as high, although Au less so than in other scales. Our scale also gives relatively high electronegativities for Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, Tc, Cd, Hg (affected by choice of valence state), and Gd. The new electronegativities provide hints for new alloy/compound design, and a framework is in place to analyze those energy changes in reactions in which electronegativity changes may not be controlling.",2
Preassembly Strategy To Fabricate Porous Hollow Carbonitride Spheres Inlaid with Single Cu-N3 Sites for Selective Oxidation of Benzene to Phenol.,"Developing single-atom catalysts with porous micro-/nanostructures for high active-site accessibility is of great significance but still remains a challenge. Herein, we for the first time report a novel template-free preassembly strategy to fabricate porous hollow graphitic carbonitride spheres with single Cu atoms mounted via thermal polymerization of supramolecular preassemblies composed of a melamine-Cu complex and cyanuric acid. Atomically dispersed Cu-N3 moieties were unambiguously confirmed by spherical aberration correction electron microscopy and extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. More importantly, this material exhibits outstanding catalytic performance for selective oxidation of benzene to phenol at room temperature, especially showing phenol selectivity (90.6 vs 64.2%) and stability much higher than those of the supported Cu nanoparticles alone, originating from the isolated unique Cu-N3 sites in the porous hollow structure. An 86% conversion of benzene, with an unexpectedly high phenol selectivity of 96.7% at 60 degrees C for 12 h, has been achieved, suggesting a great potential for practical applications. This work paves a new way to fabricate a variety of single-atom catalysts with diverse graphitic carbonitride architectures.",2
Two-Dimensional Kagome Lattices Made of Hetero Triangulenes Are Dirac Semimetals or Single-Band Semiconductors.,"Here we discuss, based on first-principles calculations, two-dimensional (2D) kagome lattices composed of polymerized heterotriangulene units, planar molecules with D3h point group containing a B, C, or N center atom and CH2, O, or CO bridges. We explore the design principles for a functional lattice made of 2D polymers, which involves control of pi-conjugation and electronic structure of the knots. The former is achieved by the chemical potential of the bridge groups, while the latter is controlled by the heteroatom. The resulting 2D kagome polymers have a characteristic electronic structure with a Dirac band sandwiched by two flat bands and are either Dirac semimetals (C center), or single-band semiconductors-materials with either exclusively electrons (B center) or holes (N center) as charge carriers of very high mobility, reaching values of up to approximately 8 x 10(3) cm(2) V(-1) s(-1), which is comparable to crystalline silicon.",2
Design of Iron Coordination Complexes as Highly Active Homogenous Water Oxidation Catalysts by Deuteration of Oxidation-Sensitive Sites.,"The nature of the oxidizing species in water oxidation reactions with chemical oxidants catalyzed by alpha-[Fe(OTf)2(mcp)] (1alpha; mcp = N, N'-dimethyl- N, N'-bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)cyclohexane-1,2-diamine, OTf = trifluoromethanesulfonate anion) and beta-[Fe(OTf)2(mcp)] (1beta) has been investigated. Mossbauer spectroscopy provides definitive evidence that 1alpha and 1beta generate oxoiron(IV) species as the resting state. Decomposition paths of the catalysts have been investigated by identifying and quantifying ligand fragments that form upon degradation. This analysis correlates the water oxidation activity of 1alpha and 1beta with stability against oxidative damage of the ligand via aliphatic C-H oxidation. The site of degradation and the relative stability against oxidative degradation are shown to be dependent on the topology of the catalyst. Furthermore, the mechanisms of catalyst degradation have been rationalized by computational analyses, which also explain why the topology of the catalyst enforces different oxidation-sensitive sites. This information has served in creating catalysts where sensitive C-H bonds have been replaced by C-D bonds. The deuterated analogues D4-alpha-[Fe(OTf)2(mcp)] (D4-1alpha), D4-beta-[Fe(OTf)2(mcp)] (D4-1beta), and D6-beta-[Fe(OTf)2(mcp)] (D6-1beta) were prepared, and their catalytic activity has been studied. D4-1alpha proves to be an extraordinarily active and efficient catalyst (up to 91% of O2 yield); it exhibits initial reaction rates identical with those of its protio analogue, but it is substantially more robust toward oxidative degradation and yields more than 3400 TON ( n(O2)/ n(Fe)). Altogether this evidences that the water oxidation catalytic activity is performed by a well-defined coordination complex and not by iron oxides formed after oxidative degradation of the ligands.",2
Reversible Metalation and Catalysis with a Scorpionate-like Metallo-ligand in a Metal-Organic Framework.,"The installation of metallo-ligands in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is an effective means to create site-isolated metal centers toward single-site heterogeneous catalysis. Although trispyrazolyborate (Tp) and tripyrazolylmethane (Tpm) form one of the most iconic classes of homogeneous catalysts, neither has been used as a metallo-ligand for the generation of MOFs thus far. Here, we show that upon in situ metalation with Cu(I), a tricarboxylated Tpm ligand reacts with ZrOCl2 to generate a new MOF exhibiting neutral scorpionate-like chelating sites. These sites undergo for facile demetalation and remetalation with retention of crystallinity and porosity. When remetalated with Cu(I), the MOF exhibits spectroscopic features and catalytic activity for olefin cyclopropanation reactions that are similar to the molecular [Cu(CH3CN)Tpm*]PF6 complex (Tpm* = tris(3,5-dimethylpyrazolyl)methane). These results demonstrate the inclusion of Tp or Tpm metallo-ligands in a MOF for the first time and provide a blueprint for immobilizing Tpm* catalysts in a spatially isolated and well-defined environment.",2
Balancing Specificity and Promiscuity in Enzyme Evolution: Multidimensional Activity Transitions in the Alkaline Phosphatase Superfamily.,"Highly proficient, promiscuous enzymes can be springboards for functional evolution, able to avoid loss of function during adaptation by their capacity to promote multiple reactions. We employ a systematic comparative study of structure, sequence, and substrate specificity to track the evolution of specificity and reactivity between promiscuous members of clades of the alkaline phosphatase (AP) superfamily. Construction of a phylogenetic tree of protein sequences maps out the likely transition zone between arylsulfatases (ASs) and phosphonate monoester hydrolases (PMHs). Kinetic analysis shows that all enzymes characterized have four chemically distinct phospho- and sulfoesterase activities, with rate accelerations ranging from 10(11)- to 10(17)-fold for their primary and 10(9)- to 10(12)-fold for their promiscuous reactions, suggesting that catalytic promiscuity is widespread in the AP-superfamily. This functional characterization and crystallography reveal a novel class of ASs that is so similar in sequence to known PMHs that it had not been recognized as having diverged in function. Based on analysis of snapshots of catalytic promiscuity ""in transition"", we develop possible models that would allow functional evolution and determine scenarios for trade-off between multiple activities. For the new ASs, we observe largely invariant substrate specificity that would facilitate the transition from ASs to PMHs via trade-off-free molecular exaptation, that is, evolution without initial loss of primary activity and specificity toward the original substrate. This ability to bypass low activity generalists provides a molecular solution to avoid adaptive conflict.",2
Exact Stoichiometry of Ce xZr6- x Cornerstones in Mixed-Metal UiO-66 Metal-Organic Frameworks Revealed by Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure Spectroscopy.,"Bimetallic Ce/Zr-UiO-66 metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) proved to be promising materials for various catalytic redox applications, representing, together with other bimetallic MOFs, a new generation of porous structures. However, no direct proof for the presence of both metals in a single cornerstone of UiO-type MOFs was reported so far. Employing element-selective X-ray absorption spectroscopy techniques herein, we demonstrate, for the first time, that our synthesis route allows obtaining Ce/Zr-UiO-66 MOFs with desired Ce content and bimetallic CeZr5 cornerstones. Performing multiple-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis, we determine the exact stoichiometry of the cornerstones, which explains the dependence of thermal and chemical stability of the materials on Ce content.",2
Geometrically Compelled Disilene with lambda(4)-Coordinate Si(II) Atoms.,"The first hypercoordinated disilene with the longest Si horizontal lineSi distance (2.623(1) A) reported to date, the 5,6-bis(amidinato silylenyl)acenaphtene (amidinato = PhC(N(t)Bu)2) (1), is presented. It results from a spatially compelled double dative interaction between the two singlet silylene moieties, due to their close proximity. The dynamic behavior of the Si horizontal lineSi bond contraction and elongation in 1 predicted by quantum chemical calculations could be confirmed experimentally by variable temperature NMR spectroscopy. Compound 1 exhibits an ambivalent reactivity, reacting as disilene with ethylene, diphenylacetylene and benzophenone to give [2+2] cycloaddition products, but as bis(silylene) toward Ni(cod)2 (cod = cycloocta-1,4-diene) to form the corresponding bis(silylene)Ni(0)(eta(4)-cod) complex.",2
Supramolecular Transformation of Metallacycle-linked Star Polymers Driven by Simple Phosphine Ligand-Exchange Reaction.,"As a common phenomenon in biological systems, supramolecular transformations of biomacromolecules lead to specific biological functions as outputs, which thus inspire people to construct biomimetic dynamic systems through supramolecular transformation strategy. It should be noted that well-modulating the artificial macromolecules to fine-tune their properties is of great significance yet still remains a big challenge in polymer chemistry. In this study, through the combination of coordination-driven self-assembly and postassembly ring-opening polymerization, a six-armed star polymer linked by well-defined hexagonal metallacycle as core was successfully prepared. At the same time, the trans-platinum acetylide moieties as transformation sites were anchored onto the discrete metallacycle scaffold. Subsequently, the simple phosphine ligand-exchange reaction induced the conversions of platinum acetylide building blocks with the varied binding angles, which thus resulted in the successive hexagon-rhomboid-hexagon transformations of metallacyclic scaffold, therefore allowing for the corresponding supramolecular transformation of metallacycle-linked star polymers. More importantly, accompanied by such transformation process, property modulation of the resultant polymers has been successfully realized. In a word, by taking advantage of dynamic nature of metal-ligand coordination bonds and simple phosphine ligand-exchange reactions, facile architecture transformation of a star polymer to a linear polymer and back to a star polymer was successfully realized, which may provide a promising approach toward the construction of new dynamic polymeric materials.",2
Radical Germylzincation of alpha-Heteroatom-Substituted Alkynes.,"The regio- and stereoselective addition of germanium and zinc across the C-C triple bond of nitrogen-, sulfur-, oxygen-, and phosphorus-substituted terminal and internal alkynes is achieved by reaction with a combination of R3GeH and Et2Zn. Diagnostic experiments support a radical-chain mechanism and the beta-zincated vinylgermanes that show exceptional stability are characterized by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. The unique feature of this new radical germylzincation reaction is that the C(sp(2))-Zn bond formed remains available for subsequent in situ Cu(I)- or Pd(0)-mediated C-C or C-heteroatom bond formation with retention of the double bond geometry. These protocols offer modular access to elaborated tri- and tetrasubstituted vinylgermanes decorated with heteroatom substituents beta to germanium that are useful for the preparation of stereodefined alkenes.",2
Stereoselective Assembly of Gigantic Chiral Molybdenum Blue Wheels Using Lanthanide Ions and Amino Acids.,"The synthesis of chiral polyoxometalates (POMs) is a challenge because of the difficulty to induce the formation of intrinsically chiral metal-oxo frameworks. Herein we report the stereoselective synthesis of a series of gigantic chiral Mo Blue (MB) POM clusters 1-5 that are formed by exploiting the synergy between coordinating lanthanides ions as symmetry breakers to produce MBs with chiral frameworks decorated with amino acids ligands; these promote the selective formation of enantiopure MBs. All the compounds share the same framework archetype, based on {Mo124Ce4}, which forms an intrinsically chiral Delta or Lambda configurations, controlled by the configurations of functionalized chiral amino acids. The chirality and stability of 1-5 in solution are confirmed by circular dichroism, (1)H NMR, and electrospray ion mobility-mass spectrometry studies. In addition, the framework of the {Mo124Ce4} MB not only behaves as a host able to trap a chiral {Mo8} cluster that is not accessible by traditional synthesis but also promotes the transformation of tryptophan to kynurenine in situ. This work demonstrates the potential and applicability of our synthetic strategy to produce gigantic chiral POM clusters capable of host-guest chemistry and selective synthetic transformations.",2
"Proton Mobility, Intrinsic Acid Strength, and Acid Site Location in Zeolites Revealed by Varying Temperature Infrared Spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory Studies.","The intrinsic Bronsted acid strength in solid acids relates to the energy required to separate a proton from a conjugate base, for example a negatively charged zeolite framework. The reliable characterization of zeolites' intrinsic acidity is fundamental to the understanding of acid catalysis and setting in relation solid Bronsted acids with their activity and selectivity. Here, we report an infrared spectroscopic study with partial isotopic deuterium exchange of a series of 15 different acidic aluminosilicate materials, including ZSM-5 zeolites with very few defects. Varying Temperature Infrared spectroscopy (VTIR) permitted estimating activation energies for proton diffusion. Two different proton transfer mechanisms have been distinguished for two different temperature ranges. Si-rich zeolites appeared to be promising proton-transfer materials ( Eact. < 40 kJ mol(-1)) at temperatures above 150 degrees C (423 K). Further, a linear bathochromic shift of the Si-(OD)-Al stretching vibration as a function of temperature was observed. It can be assumed that this red-shift is related to the intrinsic O-(H/D) bond strength. This observation allowed the extrapolation and estimation of precise v(O-D)@0 K values, which could be attributed to distinct crystallographic locations through Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The developed method was used to reliably determine the likelihood of the position of a proton in ZSM-5 zeolites under catalytically relevant conditions ( T > 423 K), which has so far never been achieved by any other technique.",2
"Catalytic Synthesis of Superlinear Alkenyl Arenes Using a Rh(I) Catalyst Supported by a ""Capping Arene"" Ligand: Access to Aerobic Catalysis.","Alkyl and alkenyl arenes are used in a wide range of products. However, the synthesis of 1-phenylalkanes or their alkenyl variants from arenes and alkenes is not accessible with current commercial acid-based catalytic processes. Here, it is reported that an air-stable Rh(I) complex, (5-FP)Rh(TFA)(eta(2)-C2H4) (5-FP = 1,2-bis( N-7-azaindolyl)benzene; TFA = trifluoroacetate), serves as a catalyst precursor for the oxidative conversion of arenes and alkenes to alkenyl arenes that are precursors to 1-phenylalkanes upon hydrogenation. It has been demonstrated that coordination of the 5-FP ligand enhances catalyst longevity compared to unligated Rh(I) catalyst precursors, and the 5-FP-ligated catalyst permits in situ recycling of the Cu(II) oxidant using air. The 5-FP ligand provides a Rh catalyst that can maintain activity for arene alkenylation over at least 2 weeks in reactions at 150 degrees C that involve multiple Cu(II) regeneration steps using air. Conditions to achieve >13000 catalytic turnovers with an 8:1 linear:branched (L:B) ratio have been demonstrated. In addition, the catalyst is active under aerobic conditions using air as the sole oxidant. At 80 degrees C, an 18:1 L:B ratio of alkenyl arenes has been observed, but the reaction rate is substantially reduced compared to 150 degrees C. Quantum mechanics (QM) calculations compare two predicted reaction pathways with the experimental data, showing that an oxidative addition/reductive elimination pathway is energetically favored over a pathway that involves C-H activation by concerted metalation-deprotonation. In addition, our QM computations are consistent with the observed selectivity (11:1) for linear alkenyl arene products.",2
Highly Stable Artificial Cells from Galactopyranose-Derived Single-Chain Amphiphiles.,"Single-chain amphiphiles (SCAs) that self-assemble into large vesicular structures are attractive components of synthetic cells because of the simplicity of bilayer formation and increased membrane permeability. However, SCAs commonly used for vesicle formation suffer from restricted working pH ranges, instability to divalent cations, and the inhibition of biocatalysts. Construction of more robust biocompatible membranes from SCAs would have significant benefits. We describe the formation of highly stable vesicles from alkyl galactopyranose thioesters. The compatibility of these uncharged SCAs with biomolecules makes possible the encapsulation of functional enzymes and nucleic acids during the vesicle generation process, enabling membrane protein reconstitution and compartmentalized nucleic acid amplification, even when charged precursors are supplied externally.",2
Competitive Immunoassays for the Detection of Small Molecules Using Single Molecule Arrays.,"Small-molecule detection is important for many applications including clinical diagnostics, drug discovery, and measurements of environmental samples and agricultural products. Current techniques for small-molecule detection suffer from various limitations including low analytical sensitivity and complex sample processing. Furthermore, as a result of their small size, small molecules are difficult to detect using an antibody pair in a traditional sandwich assay format. To overcome these limitations, we developed an ultrasensitive competitive immunoassay for small-molecule detection using Single Molecule Arrays (Simoa). We show that the competitive Simoa assay is approximately 50-fold more sensitive than the conventional ELISA. We performed theoretical calculations to determine the factors that influence the sensitivity of competitive Simoa assays and used them to achieve maximal sensitivity. We also demonstrate detection of small molecules in complex biological samples. We show that the competitive Simoa assay is a simple, fast, and highly sensitive approach for ultrasensitive detection of small molecules.",2
Uniform Nucleation of Lithium in 3D Current Collectors via Bromide Intermediates for Stable Cycling Lithium Metal Batteries.,"The conductive framework is generating considerable interest for lithium metal anodes to accommodate Li(+) deposition, due to its ability to reduce electrode current density by increasing the deposition area. However, in most cases, the electroactive surface area is not fully utilized for the nucleation of Li in 3D current collectors, especially under high current densities. Herein, uniform nucleation of Li in the conductive skeleton is achieved by a two-step synergetic process arising from CuBr- and Br-doped graphene-like film. The modified electrode regulates Li nucleating in uniform pancake-like seeds and growing into a granular Li metal ascribed to the excellent lithiophilicity of CuBr- and Br-doping sites and the low Li diffusion barrier on the surface of generated LiBr, as confirmed by the experimental and computational results. Therefore, the modified anode endows small nucleation overpotential, a high-reversibility Li plating/stripping process, and excellent performance in full batteries with industrially significant cathode loading. This work suggests that a two-step cooperative strategy opens a viable route to the development of a Li anode with high reversibility for stable cycling Li metal batteries.",2
Pb2GaF2(SeO3)2Cl: Band Engineering Strategy by Aliovalent Substitution for Enlarging Bandgap while Keeping Strong Second Harmonic Generation Response.,"Wide bandgap and strong second-order generation (SHG) effect are two crucial but contradictory conditions for practical nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. Herein, a new NLO crystal Pb2GaF2(SeO3)2Cl (I) containing novel functional (GaO3F3)(6-) octahedra is designed and synthesized by a rational band engineering strategy with aliovalent substitution. Benefiting from the removal of transition metal cations and the introduction of bridged F anions, I exhibits the widest bandgap among all reported phase-matchable NLO selenites. Meanwhile, a strong SHG response more than 4.5 times of KH2PO4 (KDP) is maintained. The dominate role of the (GaO3F3)(6-) groups to the enlarged bandgap in I are elucidated by first-principles studies.",2
Fast Living Polymerization and Helix-Sense-Selective Polymerization of Diazoacetates Using Air-Stable Palladium(II) Catalysts.,"In this work, air-stable palladium(II) catalysts bearing bidentate phosphine ligands were designed and prepared, which could initiate fast and living polymerizations of various diazoacetate monomers under mild conditions. The polymerization afforded the desired polymers in high yields with controlled molecular weights ( Mns) and narrow molecular weight distributions ( Mw/ Mns). The Mns of the isolated polymers were linearly correlated to the initial feed ratios of monomer to catalyst, confirming the living/controlled manner of the polymerizations. The Mn also increased linearly with the monomer conversion, and all of the isolated polymers showed narrow Mw/ Mns. The polymerization was relatively fast and could be accomplished within several minutes. Such fast living polymerization method can be applied to a wide range of diazoacetate monomers in various organic solvents at room temperature in air. Taking advantage of the living nature, we facilely prepared a series of block copolymers through chain extension reactions. The amphiphilic block copolymers synthesized by this method exhibited interesting self-assembly properties. Moreover, polymerization of achiral bulky diazoacetate by Pd(II) catalysts bearing a chiral bidentate phosphine ligand leads to the formation of polymers with high optical activity due to the formation of the predominantly one-handed helix of the main chain. The helix sense of the polymers was determined by the chirality of the Pd(II) catalysts.",2
Taking Solution Proton NMR to Its Extreme: Prediction and Detection of a Hydride Resonance in an Intermediate-Spin Iron Complex.,"Guided by DFT based modeling the chemical shift range of a hydride resonance in the proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum of the intermediate-spin, square planar iron complex (tBu)(PNP)Fe-H was predicted and detected as a broad resonance at -3560 ppm (295 K) with a temperature dependent shift of approximately 2000 ppm between 223 and 383 K. The first detection of a metal-bonded hydrogen atom by solution NMR in a complex with a paramagnetic ground state illustrates the interplay of theory and experiment for the characterization of key components in paramagnetic base metal catalysis.",2
Controlling and Observing Sharp-Valleyed Quantum Interference Effect in Single Molecular Junctions.,"The ability to control over the quantum interference (QI) effect in single molecular junctions is attractive in the application of molecular electronics. Herein we report that the QI effect of meta-benzene based molecule with dihydrobenzo[ b]thiophene as the anchoring group ( meta-BT) can be controlled by manipulating the electrode potential of the junctions in electrolyte while the redox state of the molecule does not change. More than 2 orders of magnitude conductance change is observed for meta-BT ranging from <10(-6.0) to 10(-3.3) G0 with varying the electrode potential, while the upper value is even larger than the conductance of para-BT ( para-benzene based molecule with anchoring group of dihydrobenzo[ b]thiophene). This phenomenon is attributed to the shifting of energy level alignment between the molecule and electrodes under electrode potential control. Calculation is carried out to predict the transmission function of single molecular junction and the work function of Au surface in the presence of the molecule, and good agreement is found between theory and experiments, both showing sharp-valley featured destructive QI effect for the meta-BT. The present work demonstrates that the QI effect can be tuned through electrochemical gating without change of molecular redox states, which provides a feasible way toward realization of effective molecular switches.",2
Cationic Surfactant-Based Electrolyte Additives for Uniform Lithium Deposition via Lithiophobic Repulsion Mechanisms.,"Lithium metal is among the most promising anode materials for high-energy batteries due to its high theoretical capacity and lowest electrochemical potential. However, dendrite formation is a major challenge, which can result in fire and explosion of the batteries. Herein, we report on hexadecyl trimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) as an electrolyte additive that can suppress the growth of lithium dendrites by lithiophobic repulsion mechanisms. During the lithium plating process, cationic surfactant molecules can aggregate around protuberances via electrostatic attraction, forming a nonpolar lithiophobic protective outer layer, which drives the deposition of lithium ions to adjacent regions to produce dendrite-free uniform Li deposits. Thus, an excellent cycle of 300 h at 1.0 mA cm(-2) and rate performance up to 4 mA cm(-2) are available safely in symmetric Li|Li cells. In particular, significantly enhanced cycle and rate performance were achieved when the electrolyte with CTAC additives was used in lithium-sulfur and Li|LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 full cells. The effects of carbon chains, anions of surfactant, and electrostatic repulsion on the deposition of lithium anodes are reported. This work advances research in inhibiting Li dendrite growth with a new electrolyte additive based on cationic surfactants.",2
Imaging of Neurite Network with an Anti-L1CAM Aptamer Generated by Neurite-SELEX.,"Neurite outgrowth is the critical step of nervous development. Molecular probes against neurites are essential for evaluation of the nervous system development, compound neurotoxicity, and drug efficacy on nerve regeneration. To obtain a neurite probe, we developed a neurite-SELEX strategy and generated a DNA aptamer, yly12, that strongly binds neurites. The molecular target of yly12 was identified to be neural cell adhesion molecule L1 (L1CAM), a surface antigen expressed in normal nervous system and various cancers. Here, yly12 was successfully applied to image the three-dimensional network of neurites between live cells, as well as the neurite fibers on normal brain tissue section. This aptamer was also found to have an inhibitory effect on neurite outgrowth between cells. Given the advantages of aptamers, yly12 hold great potential as a molecular tool in the field of neuroscientific research. The high efficiency of neurite-SELEX suggests that SELEX against a subcellular structure instead of the whole cells is more effective in obtaining the desired aptamers.",2
Covalent Organic Frameworks: Chemistry beyond the Structure.,"Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) represent a new field of rapidly growing chemical research that takes direct inspiration from diverse covalent bonds existing between atoms. The success of linking atoms in two and three dimensions to construct extended framework structures moved the chemistry of COFs beyond the structures to methodologies, highlighting the possibility of prospective applications. Although structure to property relation in COFs has led to fascinating properties, chemical stability, processability and scalability were some of the important challenges that needed to be overcome for their successful implementation. In this Perspective, we take a closer look at the growth of COFs from mere supramolecular structures to potential industrializable materials.",2
Nanoscale Surface Structure-Activity in Electrochemistry and Electrocatalysis.,"Nanostructured electrochemical interfaces (electrodes) are found in diverse applications ranging from electrocatalysis and energy storage to biomedical and environmental sensing. These functional materials, which possess compositional and structural heterogeneity over a wide range of length scales, are usually characterized by classical macroscopic or ""bulk"" electrochemical techniques that are not well-suited to analyzing the nonuniform fluxes that govern the electrochemical response at complex interfaces. In this Perspective, we highlight new directions to studying fundamental electrochemical and electrocatalytic phenomena, whereby nanoscale-resolved information on activity is related to electrode structure and properties colocated and at a commensurate scale by using complementary high-resolution microscopy techniques. This correlative electrochemical multimicroscopy strategy aims to unambiguously resolve structure and activity by identifying and characterizing the structural features that constitute an active surface, ultimately facilitating the rational design of functional electromaterials. The discussion encompasses high-resolution correlative structure-activity investigations at well-defined surfaces such as metal single crystals and layered materials, extended structurally/compositionally heterogeneous surfaces such as polycrystalline metals, and ensemble-type electrodes exemplified by nanoparticles on an electrode support surface. This Perspective provides a roadmap for next-generation studies in electrochemistry and electrocatalysis, advocating that complex electrode surfaces and interfaces be broken down and studied as a set of simpler ""single entities"" (e.g., steps, terraces, defects, crystal facets, grain boundaries, single particles), from which the resulting nanoscale understanding of reactivity can be used to create rational models, underpinned by theory and surface physics, that are self-consistent across broader length scales and time scales.",2
Synthetic and Spectroscopic Investigations Enabled by Modular Synthesis of Molecular Phosphaalkyne Precursors.,"A series of dibenzo-7-phosphanorbornadiene compounds, Ph3PC(R)PA (1-R; A = C14H10, anthracene; R = Me, Et, (i)Pr, (s)Bu), are reported to be capable of thermal fragmentation to generate alkyl-substituted phosphaalkynes (RC identical withP) concomitant with triphenylphosphine and anthracene. Facile preparation of these molecular precursors proceeds by treatment of ClPA with the appropriate ylide Ph3P horizontal lineCHR (2 equiv). For methyl, ethyl, and isopropyl substituents, the phosphaalkyne conversions are measured to be 56-73% in solution by quantitative (31)P NMR spectroscopy. In the case of compound 1-Me, the kinetic profile of its spontaneous unimolecular fragmentation is investigated by an Eyring analysis. The resulting 1-phosphapropyne is directly detected by solution NMR spectroscopy and gas phase rotational microwave spectroscopy. The latter technique allows for the first time measurement of the phosphorus-31 nuclear spin-rotation coupling tensor. The nuclear spin-rotation coupling provides a link between rotational and NMR spectroscopies, and is contextualized in relation to the chemical shift anisotropy.",2
Nanoscale Metal-Organic Layers for Radiotherapy-Radiodynamic Therapy.,"Nanoscale metal-organic layers (nMOLs) are an emerging class of 2D crystalline materials formed by reducing the dimensionality of nanoscale metal-organic frameworks (nMOFs). nMOLs hold significant potential in biomedical applications by combining the structural and compositional tunability of nMOFs and anisotropic properties of 2D nanomaterials. Here we report two novel nMOLs, Hf12-Ir and Hf6-Ir, based on Hf12 and Hf6 secondary building units (SBUs) and photosensitizing Ir(bpy)[dF(CF3)ppy]2(+) derived ligands [bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine; dF(CF3)ppy = 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridine] for radiotherapy (RT) and radiodynamic therapy (RDT). Upon X-ray irradiation, the Hf12 or Hf6 SBUs in the nMOLs efficiently absorb X-rays to enhance RT by producing hydroxyl radicals and to elicit RDT through the excitation of Ir(bpy)[dF(CF3)ppy]2(+) derived ligands to generate singlet oxygen and superoxide anions. Hf12-Ir and Hf6-Ir promoted effective cell instant death through RDT and cell reproductive death through RT to elicit superb anticancer efficacy, resulting in >99% tumor regression at low X-ray doses of 0.5 x 5 Gy.",2
"Rapid Dissolution of BaSO4 by Macropa, an 18-Membered Macrocycle with High Affinity for Ba(2).","Insoluble BaSO4 scale is a costly and time-consuming problem in the petroleum industry. Clearance of BaSO4-impeded pipelines requires chelating agents that can efficiently bind Ba(2+), the largest nonradioactive +2 metal ion. Due to the poor affinity of currently available chelating agents for Ba(2+), however, the dissolution of BaSO4 remains inefficient, requiring very basic solutions of ligands. In this study, we investigated three diaza-18-crown-6 macrocycles bearing different pendent arms for the chelation of Ba(2+) and assessed their potential for dissolving BaSO4 scale. Remarkably, the bis-picolinate ligand macropa exhibits the highest affinity reported to date for Ba(2+) at pH 7.4 (log K' = 10.74), forming a complex of significant kinetic stability with this large metal ion. Furthermore, the BaSO4 dissolution properties of macropa dramatically surpass those of the state-of-the-art ligands DTPA and DOTA. Using macropa, complete dissolution of a molar equivalent of BaSO4 is reached within 30 min at room temperature in pH 8 buffer, conditions under which DTPA and DOTA only achieve 40% dissolution of BaSO4. When further applied for the dissolution of natural barite, macropa also outperforms DTPA, showing that this ligand is potentially valuable for industrial processes. Collectively, this work demonstrates that macropa is a highly effective chelator for Ba(2+) that can be applied for the remediation of BaSO4 scale.",2
Visualizing Kinetically Robust Co(III)4L6 Assemblies in Vivo: SPECT Imaging of the Encapsulated [(99m)Tc]TcO4(-) Anion.,"Noncovalent encapsulation is an attractive approach for modifying the efficacy and physiochemical properties of both therapeutic and diagnostic species. Abiotic self-assembled constructs have shown promise, yet many hurdles between in vitro and (pre)clinical studies remain, not least the challenges associated with maintaining the macromolecular, hollow structure under nonequilibrium conditions. Using a kinetically robust Co(III)4L6 tetrahedron we now show the feasibility of encapsulating the most widely used precursor in clinical nuclear diagnostic imaging, the gamma-emitting [(99m)Tc]TcO4(-) anion, under conditions compatible with in vivo administration. Subsequent single-photon emission computed tomography imaging of the caged-anion reveals a marked change in the biodistribution compared to the thyroid-accumulating free oxo-anion, thus moving clinical applications of (metallo)supramolecular species a step closer.",2
Imaging Insulin Secretion from Mouse Pancreas by MRI Is Improved by Use of a Zinc-Responsive MRI Sensor with Lower Affinity for Zn(2+) Ions.,"It has been demonstrated that divalent zinc ions packaged with insulin in beta-cell granules can be detected by MRI during glucose-stimulated insulin secretion using a gadolinium-based Zn(2+)-sensitive agent. This study was designed to evaluate whether a simpler agent design having single Zn(2+)-sensing moieties but with variable Zn(2+) binding affinities might also detect insulin secretion from the pancreas. Using an implanted MR-compatible window designed to hold the pancreas in a fixed position for imaging, we now demonstrate that focally intense ""hot spots"" can be detected in the tail of the pancreas using these agents after administration of glucose to stimulate insulin secretion. Histological staining of the same tissue verified that the hot spots identified by imaging correspond to clusters of islets, perhaps reflecting first-responder islets that are most responsive to a sudden increase in glucose. A comparison of images obtained when using a high-affinity Zn(2+) sensor versus a lower-affinity sensor showed that the lower-affinity sensors produced the best image contrast. An equilibrium model that considers all possible complexes formed between Zn(2+), the GdL sensor, and HSA predicts that a GdL sensor with lower affinity for Zn(2+) generates a lower background signal from endogenous Zn(2+) prior to glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and that the weaker binding affinity agent is more responsive to a further increase in Zn(2+) concentration near beta-cells after GSIS. These model predictions are consistent with the in vivo imaging observations.",2
"Carbon's Three-Center, Four-Electron Tetrel Bond, Treated Experimentally.","Tetrel bonding is the noncovalent interaction of group IV elements with electron donors. It is a weak, directional interaction that resembles hydrogen and halogen bonding yet remains barely explored. Herein, we present an experimental investigation of the carbon-centered, three-center, four-electron tetrel bond, [N-C-N](+), formed by capturing a carbenium ion with a bidentate Lewis base. NMR-spectroscopic, titration-calorimetric, and reaction-kinetic evidence for the existence and structure of this species is reported. The studied interaction is by far the strongest tetrel bond reported so far and is discussed in comparison with the analogous halogen bond. The necessity of the involvement of a bidentate Lewis base in its formation is demonstrated by providing spectroscopic and crystallographic evidence that a monodentate Lewis base induces a reaction rather than stabilizing the tetrel bond complex. A vastly decreased Lewis basicity of the bidentate ligand or reduced Lewis acidity of the carbenium ion weakens-or even prohibits-the formation of the tetrel bond complex, whereas synthetic modifications facilitating attractive orbital overlaps promote it. As the geometry of the complex resembles the SN2 transition state, it provides a model system for the investigation of fundamental reaction mechanisms and chemical bonding theories.",2
Pressure-Driven Reversible Switching between n- and p-Type Conduction in Chalcopyrite CuFeS2.,"Temperature-dependent switching between p- and n-type conduction is a newly observed phenomenon in very few Ag-based semiconductors, which may promote fascinating applications in modern electronics. Pressure, as an efficient external stimulus that has driven collective phenomena such as spin-crossover and Mott transition, is also expected to initialize a conduction-type switching in transition metal-based semiconductors. Herein, we report the observation of a pressure-driven dramatic switching between p- and n-type conduction in chalcopyrite CuFeS2 associated with a structural phase transition. Under compression around 8 GPa, CuFeS2 undergoes a phase transition with symmetry breakdown from space group I-42 d to space group I-4 accompanying with a remarkable volume shrinkage of the FeS4 tetrahedra. A high-to-low spin-crossover of Fe(2+) ( S = 2 to S = 0) is manifested along with this phase transition. Instead of pressure-driven metallization, a surprising semiconductor-to-semiconductor transition is observed associated with the structural and electronic transformations. Significantly, both photocurrent and Hall coefficient measurements confirm that CuFeS2 undergoes a reversible pressure-driven p- n conduction type switching accompanying with the structural phase transition. The absence of cationic charge transfer between copper and iron during the phase transition is confirmed by both X-ray absorption near-edge spectra (Cu/Fe, K-edge) and total-fluorescence-yield X-ray absorption spectra (Fe, K-edge) results, and the valence distribution maintains Cu(2+)Fe(2+)S2 in the high-pressure phase. The observation of an abrupt pressure-driven p- n conduction type switching in a transition metal-based semiconductor paves the way to novel pressure-responsive switching devices.",2
Metal-Ion-Responsive Bionanocomposite for Selective and Reversible Enzyme Inhibition.,"A bionanocomposite with artificial binding pockets for a DNA repair enzyme has been developed by in situ assembly of an affinity protein with a surrounding contact surface of polydopamine on the surface of silica coated magnetic nanoparticles via molecular imprinting reactions. The obtained nanoparticles exhibited antibody-like binding behavior toward the target enzyme with highly specific and efficient inhibition effect. Moreover, the binding and inhibition could be flexibly tuned by the addition of metal ions such as Mn(2+) and Mg(2+), which provided a convenient tool to regulate enzyme activity with artificially engineered nanoinhibitors.",2
Extraordinary Dielectric Properties at Heterojunctions of Amorphous Ferroelectrics.,"Materials having a high dielectric constant are needed for a variety of electrical applications from transistors to capacitors. Ferroelectric amorphous-oxide (glass) alkali-ion electrolytes of composition A2.99Ba0.005ClO (A = Li, Na) are shown by two different types of measurement and different consistent analyses to have extraordinarily high dielectric constants, varying from 10(9) at 25 degrees C to 10(10) at 220 degrees C if the glass is properly conditioned. These anomalously high dielectric properties coexist with alkali-ion conductivities at 25 degrees C that are equivalent to those of the best organic-liquid electrolytes of a Li-ion cell, and cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a Au/glass electrolyte/Au cell is stable from -10 to +10 V. A model to interpret microscopically all the key features of the CV curves shows that the electric-double-layer capacitors that form at the gold/electrolyte interfaces in the Au/glass electrolyte/Au heterojunction reverse polarization at an applied voltage V = +/-2.1 V, resulting in three almost equivalent discharging capacitances for a single physical capacitor from -10 to +10 V.",2
Highly Active Platinum Catalysts for Nitrile and Cyanohydrin Hydration: Catalyst Design and Ligand Screening via High-Throughput Techniques.,"Nitrile hydration provides access to amides that are indispensable to researchers in chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Prohibiting the use of this venerable reaction, however, are (1) the dearth of biphasic catalysts that can effectively hydrate nitriles at ambient temperatures with high turnover numbers and (2) the unsolved challenge of hydrating cyanohydrins. Herein, we report the design of new "" donor-acceptor""-type platinum catalysts by precisely arranging electron-rich and electron-deficient ligands trans to one other, thereby enhancing both the nucleophilicity of the hydroxyl group and the electrophilicity of the nitrile group. Leveraging a high-throughput, automated workflow and evaluating a library of bidentate ligands, we have discovered that commercially available, inexpensive DPPF [1,1'-ferrocenendiyl-bis(diphenylphosphine)] provides superior reactivity. The corresponding "" donor-acceptor""-type catalyst 2a is readily prepared from (DPPF)PtCl2, PMe2OH, and AgOTf. The enhanced activity of 2a permits the hydration of a wide range of nitriles and cyanohydrins to proceed at 40 degrees C with excellent turnover numbers. Rational reevaluation of the ligand structure has led to the discovery of modified catalyst 2c, harboring the more electron-rich 1,1'-bis[bis(5-methyl-2-furanyl)phosphino] ferrocene ligand, which demonstrates the highest activity toward hydration of nitriles and cyanohydrins at room temperature. Finally, the correlation between the electron-donating ability of the phosphine ligands with catalyst efficiencies of 2a, 2c, 2d, and 2e in the hydration of nitrile 7 are examined, and the results support the "" donor-acceptor"" hypothesis.",2
Electron Transport in Low Dimensional Solids: A Surface Chemistry Perspective.,"Electron transport is a fundamental process that controls the intrinsic chemical and physical properties of solid materials. The surface phase becomes dominant when downsized dimensionality into cluster scale in nanomaterials, and surface chemistry plays more and more important role in regulating electron transport. During past decades, varieties of chemical approaches have been developed to modify the surface of low dimensional solids, substantially providing versatile perspectives on engineering electron transport. In this Perspective, we focus on recent researches concerning surface chemical modification strategies, such as surface molecular adsorption, atomic incorporation, defect engineering and spin scattering to engineer electron transport of typical one-/two-dimensional systems. Under the framework of Drude's transport model, we highlight the core role of micro degrees of freedom, i.e., charge, lattice, and spin, in molecular-level understanding and optimizing the regulation effect of surface chemistry. Finally, based on the discussion and current achievements of surface chemistry effect on electron transport of low dimensional solids, some personal perspectives on the future development are also presented.",2
Plasmonic Nanosensors Reveal a Height Dependence of MinDE Protein Oscillations on Membrane Features.,"Single-particle plasmon spectroscopy has become a standard technique to detect and quantify the presence of unlabeled macromolecules. Here, we extend this method to determine their exact distance from the plasmon sensors with sub-nanometer resolution by systematically varying the sensing range into the surrounding by adjusting the size of the plasmonic nanoparticles. We improved current single-particle plasmon spectroscopy to record continuously for hours the scattering spectra of thousands of nanoparticles of different sizes simultaneously with 1.8 s time resolution. We apply this technique to study the interaction dynamics of bacterial Min proteins with supported lipid membranes of different composition. Our experiments reveal a surprisingly flexible operating mode of the Min proteins: In the presence of cardiolipin and membrane curvature induced by nanoparticles, the protein oscillation occurs on top of a stationary MinD patch. Our results reveal the need to consider membrane composition and local curvature as important parameters to quantitatively understand the Min protein system and could be extrapolated to other macromolecular systems. Our label-free method is generally easily implementable and well suited to measure distances of interacting biological macromolecules.",2
Highly Efficient and Robust Photocatalytic Systems for CO2 Reduction Consisting of a Cu(I) Photosensitizer and Mn(I) Catalysts.,"The development of highly efficient, selective, and durable photocatalytic CO2 reduction systems that only use earth-abundant elements is key for both solving global warming and tackling the shortage of energy and carbon resources. Here, we successfully developed CO2 reduction photocatalysts using [Cu2(P2bph)2](2+) (CuPS) (P2bph = 4,7-diphenyl-2,9-di(diphenylphosphinotetramethylene)-1,10-phenanthroline) as a redox photosensitizer and fac-Mn(X2bpy)(CO)3Br (Mn(4X)) (X2bpy = 4,4'-X2-2,2'-bipyridine (X = -H and -OMe) or Mn(6mes) (6mes = 6,6'-(mesityl)2-2,2'-bipyridne)) as the catalyst. The most efficient photocatalysis was achieved by Mn(4OMe): The total quantum yield of CO2 reduction products was 57%, the turnover number based on the Mn catalyst was over 1300, and the selectivity of CO2 reduction was 95%. Electronic and steric effects of the substituents (X) in the Mn complexes largely affected both the photocatalytic efficiency and the product selectivity. For example, the highest selectivity of CO formation was achieved by using Mn(6mes) (selectivity SCO = 96.6%), whereas the photocatalytic system using Mn(4H) yielded HCOOH as the main product ( SHCOOH = 74.6%) with CO and H2 as minor products ( SCO = 23.7%, SH2 = 1.7%). In these photocatalytic reactions, CuPS played its role as an efficient and very durable redox photosensitizer, while remaining stable in the reaction solution even after a turnover number of 200 had been reached (the catalyst used had a turnover number of over 1000).",2
SO2F2-Mediated Oxidative Dehydrogenation and Dehydration of Alcohols to Alkynes.,"Direct synthesis of alkynes from inexpensive, abundant alcohols was achieved in high yields (greater than 40 examples, up to 95% yield) through a SO2F2-promoted dehydration and dehydrogenation process. This straightforward transformation of sp(3)-sp(3) (C-C) bonds to sp-sp (C identical withC) bonds requires only inexpensive and readily available reagents (no transition metals) under mild conditions. The crude alkynes are sufficiently free of impurities to permit direct use in further transformations, as illustrated by regioselective Huisgen alkyne-azide cycloaddition reactions with PhN3 to give 1,4-substituted 1,2,3-traiazoles (16 examples, up to 92% yield) and Sonogashira couplings (10 examples, up to 77% yield).",2
Mapping the Substrate Recognition Pathway in Cytochrome P450.,"Cytochrome P450s are ubiquitous metalloenzymes involved in the metabolism and detoxification of foreign components via catalysis of the hydroxylation reactions of a vast array of organic substrates. However, the mechanism underlying the pharmaceutically critical process of substrate access to the catalytic center of cytochrome P450 is a long-standing puzzle, further complicated by the crystallographic evidence of a closed catalytic center in both substrate-free and substrate-bound cytochrome P450. Here, we address a crucial question whether the conformational heterogeneity prevalent in cytochrome P450 translates to heterogeneous pathways for substrate access to the catalytic center of these metalloenzymes. By atomistically capturing the full process of spontaneous substrate association from bulk solvent to the occluded catalytic center of an archetypal system P450cam in multi-microsecond-long continuous unbiased molecular dynamics simulations, we here demonstrate that the substrate recognition in P450cam always occurs through a single well-defined dominant pathway. The simulated final bound pose resulting from these unguided simulations is in striking resemblance with the crystallographic bound pose. Each individual binding trajectory reveals that the substrate, initially placed at random locations in bulk solvent, spontaneously lands on a single key channel on the protein-surface of P450cam and resides there for an uncharacteristically long period, before correctly identifying the occluded target-binding cavity. Surprisingly, the passage of substrate to the closed catalytic center is not accompanied by any large-scale opening in protein. Rather, the unbiased simulated trajectories ( approximately 57 mus) and underlying Markov state model, in combination with free-energy analysis, unequivocally show that the substrate recognition process in P450cam needs a substrate-induced side-chain displacement coupled with a complex array of dynamical interconversions of multiple metastable substrate conformations. Further, the work reconciles multiple precedent experimental and theoretical observations on P450cam and establishes a comprehensive view of substrate-recognition in cytochrome P450 that only occurs via substrate-induced structural rearrangements.",2
Ambimodal Dipolar/Diels-Alder Cycloaddition Transition States Involving Proton Transfers.,"Quantum mechanical computations and molecular dynamics simulations have been used to elucidate the factors that control reaction outcomes in ambimodal transition states leading to both dipolar and Diels-Alder cycloaddition products, which can interconvert via alpha-ketol rearrangements. The dipolar cycloaddition pathways were found to be disadvantaged due to the persistence of charge separation after the second C-C formation en route to the dipolar cycloaddition adducts. Structural modifications that result in the stabilization of the charge-separated species lead to an increase in the amount of dipolar cycloadducts formed.",2
QM-Mechanism-Based Hierarchical High-Throughput in Silico Screening Catalyst Design for Ammonia Synthesis.,"We propose and test a hierarchical high-throughput screening (HHTS) approach to catalyst design for complex catalytic reaction systems that is based on quantum mechanics (QM) derived full reaction networks with QM rate constants but simplified to examine only the reaction steps likely to be rate determining. We illustrate this approach by applying it to determine the optimum dopants (our of 35 candidates) to improve the turnover frequency (TOF) for the Fe-based Haber-Bosch ammonia synthesis process. We start from the QM-based free-energy reaction network for this reaction over Fe(111), which contains the 26 most important surface configurations and 17 transition states at operating conditions of temperature and pressure, from which we select the key reaction steps that might become rate determining for the alloy. These are arranged hierarchically by decreasing free-energy reaction barriers. We then extract from the full reaction network, a reduced set of reaction rates required to quickly predict the effect of the catalyst changes on each barrier. This allows us to test new candidates with only 1% of the effort for a full calculation. Thus, we were able to quickly screen 34 candidate dopants to select a small subset (Rh, Pt, Pd, Cu) that satisfy all criteria, including stability. Then from these four candidates expected to increase the TOF for NH3 production, we selected the best candidate (Rh) for a more complete free-energy and kinetic analysis (10 times the effort for HHTS but still 10% of the effort for a complete analysis of the full reaction network). We predict that Rh doping of Fe will increase the TOF for NH3 synthesis by a factor of approximately 3.3 times compared to Fe(111), in excellent agreement with our HHTS predictions, validating this approach.",2
Signalling and differentiation in emulsion-based multi-compartmentalized in vitro gene circuits.,"Multicellularity enables the growth of complex life forms as it allows for the specialization of cell types, differentiation and large-scale spatial organization. In a similar way, modular construction of synthetic multicellular systems will lead to dynamic biomimetic materials that can respond to their environment in complex ways. To achieve this goal, artificial cellular communication and developmental programs still have to be established. Here, we create geometrically controlled spatial arrangements of emulsion-based artificial cellular compartments containing synthetic in vitro gene circuitry, separated by lipid bilayer membranes. We quantitatively determine the membrane pore-dependent response of the circuits to artificial morphogen gradients, which are established via diffusion from dedicated organizer cells. Utilizing different types of feedforward and feedback in vitro gene circuits, we then implement artificial signalling and differentiation processes, demonstrating the potential for the realization of complex spatiotemporal dynamics in artificial multicellular systems.",2
Catalytic Radical-Polar Crossover Reactions of Allylic Alcohols.,"Radical-polar crossover hydrofunctionalizations of tertiary allylic alcohols are described. Depending on the structure of the catalyst, corresponding epoxides or semipinacol rearrangement products are selectively obtained in good yields. Experimental evidence points to the participation of alkylcobalt complexes as electrophilic intermediates.",2
Benzimidazoles as Metal-Free and Recyclable Hydrides for CO2 Reduction to Formate.,"We report a novel metal-free chemical reduction of CO2 by a recyclable benzimidazole-based organo-hydride, whose choice was guided by quantum chemical calculations. Notably, benzimidazole-based hydride donors rival the hydride-donating abilities of noble-metal-based hydrides such as [Ru(tpy)(bpy)H](+) and [Pt(depe)2H](+). Chemical CO2 reduction to the formate anion (HCOO(-)) was carried out in the absence of biological enzymes, a sacrificial Lewis acid, or a base to activate the substrate or reductant. (13)CO2 experiments confirmed the formation of H(13)COO(-) by CO2 reduction with the formate product characterized by (1)H NMR and (13)C NMR spectroscopy and ESI-MS. The highest formate yield of 66% was obtained in the presence of potassium tetrafluoroborate under mild conditions. The likely role of exogenous salt additives in this reaction is to stabilize and shift the equilibrium toward the ionic products. After CO2 reduction, the benzimidazole-based hydride donor was quantitatively oxidized to its aromatic benzimidazolium cation, establishing its recyclability. In addition, we electrochemically reduced the benzimidazolium cation to its organo-hydride form in quantitative yield, demonstrating its potential for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. These results serve as a proof of concept for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 by sustainable, recyclable, and metal-free organo-hydrides.",2
Raising the Bar in Aromatic Donor-Acceptor Interactions with Cyclic Trinuclear Gold(I) Complexes as Strong pi-Donors.,"Aromatic donor-acceptor interactions are of high importance in supramolecular chemistry, materials science and biology. Compared to other noncovalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, the binding is often weak. Here we show that strong donor-acceptor interactions between planar aromatics with binding free energies down to -10.1 kcal mol(-1) and association constants of up to 2.34 x 10(7) L mol(-1) for 1:1 complexes can be realized using cyclic trinuclear complexes of gold(I) with pyridinate, imidazolate, or carbeniate ligands. Data were obtained through NMR and UV/vis absorption spectroscopic studies and supported by quantum chemical calculations for a variety of acceptors. By using a specifically designed bridged naphthalene diimide-based acceptor with only one binding site, we furthermore show that a 1:2 (donor:acceptor) binding model is best suited to quantify the donor and acceptor/complex equilibrium. Scanning electron microscopy on selected donor-acceptor pairs shows crystalline supramolecular assemblies. We anticipate this study to be relevant for the future design of supramolecular systems and chemical sensors and the determination of binding energies between planar donors and acceptors.",2
