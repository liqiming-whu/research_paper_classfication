Visible-light-mediated conversion of alcohols to halides.,"The development of new means of activating molecules and bonds for chemical reactions is a fundamental objective for chemists. In this regard, visible-light photoredox catalysis has emerged as a powerful technique for chemoselective activation of chemical bonds under mild reaction conditions. Here, we report a visible-light-mediated photocatalytic alcohol activation, which we use to convert alcohols to the corresponding bromides and iodides in good yields, with exceptional functional group tolerance. In this fundamentally useful reaction, the design and operation of the process is simple, the reaction is highly efficient, and the formation of stoichiometric waste products is minimized.",chemistry
Carbon oxidation state as a metric for describing the chemistry of atmospheric organic aerosol.,"A detailed understanding of the sources, transformations and fates of organic species in the environment is crucial because of the central roles that they play in human health, biogeochemical cycles and the Earth's climate. However, such an understanding is hindered by the immense chemical complexity of environmental mixtures of organics; for example, atmospheric organic aerosol consists of at least thousands of individual compounds, all of which likely evolve chemically over their atmospheric lifetimes. Here, we demonstrate the utility of describing organic aerosol (and other complex organic mixtures) in terms of average carbon oxidation state, a quantity that always increases with oxidation, and is readily measured using state-of-the-art analytical techniques. Field and laboratory measurements of the average carbon oxidation state, using several such techniques, constrain the chemical properties of the organics and demonstrate that the formation and evolution of organic aerosol involves simultaneous changes to both carbon oxidation state and carbon number.",chemistry
Interrogating viral capsid assembly with ion mobility-mass spectrometry.,"Most proteins fulfil their function as part of large protein complexes. Surprisingly, little is known about the pathways and regulation of protein assembly. Several viral coat proteins can spontaneously assemble into capsids in vitro with morphologies identical to the native virion and thus resemble ideal model systems for studying protein complex formation. Even for these systems, the mechanism for self-assembly is still poorly understood, although it is generally thought that smaller oligomeric structures form key intermediates. This assembly nucleus and larger viral assembly intermediates are typically low abundant and difficult to monitor. Here, we characterised small oligomers of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and norovirus under equilibrium conditions using native ion mobility mass spectrometry. This data in conjunction with computational modelling enabled us to elucidate structural features of these oligomers. Instead of more globular shapes, the intermediates exhibit sheet-like structures suggesting that they are assembly competent. We propose pathways for the formation of both capsids.",chemistry
A molybdenum complex bearing PNP-type pincer ligands leads to the catalytic reduction of dinitrogen into ammonia.,"The synthesis of transition metal-dinitrogen complexes and the stoichiometric transformation of their coordinated dinitrogen into ammonia and hydrazine have been the subject of considerable research, with a view to achieving nitrogen fixation under ambient conditions. Since a single example in 2003, no examples have been reported of the catalytic conversion of dinitrogen into ammonia under ambient conditions. The dimolybdenum-dinitrogen complex bearing PNP pincer ligands was found to work as an effective catalyst for the formation of ammonia from dinitrogen, with 23 equiv. of ammonia being produced with the catalyst (12 equiv. of ammonia are produced based on the molybdenum atom of the catalyst). This is another successful example of the catalytic and direct conversion of dinitrogen into ammonia under ambient reaction conditions. We believe that the results described in this Article provide valuable information with which to develop a more effective nitrogen-fixation system under mild reaction conditions.",chemistry
Cis-dicarbonyl binding at cobalt and iron porphyrins with saddle-shape conformation.,"Diatomic molecules attached to complexed iron or cobalt centres are important in many biological processes. In natural systems, metallotetrapyrrole units carry respiratory gases or provide sensing and catalytic functions. Conceiving synthetic model systems strongly helps to determine the pertinent chemical foundations for such processes, with recent work highlighting the importance of the prosthetic groups' conformational flexibility as an intricate variable affecting their functional properties. Here, we present simple model systems to investigate, at the single molecule level, the interaction of carbon monoxide with saddle-shaped iron- and cobalt-porphyrin conformers, which have been stabilized as two-dimensional arrays on well-defined surfaces. Using scanning tunnelling microscopy we identified a novel bonding scheme expressed in tilted monocarbonyl and cis-dicarbonyl configurations at the functional metal-macrocycle unit. Modelling with density functional theory revealed that the weakly bonded diatomic carbonyl adduct can effectively bridge specific pyrrole groups with the metal atom as a result of the pronounced saddle-shape conformation of the porphyrin cage.",chemistry
Dynamic DNA nanotechnology using strand-displacement reactions.,"The specificity and predictability of Watson-Crick base pairing make DNA a powerful and versatile material for engineering at the nanoscale. This has enabled the construction of a diverse and rapidly growing set of DNA nanostructures and nanodevices through the programmed hybridization of complementary strands. Although it had initially focused on the self-assembly of static structures, DNA nanotechnology is now also becoming increasingly attractive for engineering systems with interesting dynamic properties. Various devices, including circuits, catalytic amplifiers, autonomous molecular motors and reconfigurable nanostructures, have recently been rationally designed to use DNA strand-displacement reactions, in which two strands with partial or full complementarity hybridize, displacing in the process one or more pre-hybridized strands. This mechanism allows for the kinetic control of reaction pathways. Here, we review DNA strand-displacement-based devices, and look at how this relatively simple mechanism can lead to a surprising diversity of dynamic behaviour.",chemistry
Surface-mediated chain reaction through dissociative attachment.,"Chain reactions on a surface offer an important route to linear nanopatterning. We recently reported cooperative reactions on a silicon surface in which the reaction of one halogen atom with a silicon atom of a silicon dimer induced the halogenation of its neighbouring silicon atom through surface-mediated charge transfer. The reaction was unable to propagate further but here we describe how, by chemically bridging the gaps between the rows of these silicon dimers, this mechanism is able to form extended chains. The agents for chain growth are CH(3)Cl molecules that dissociatively attach CH(3) groups and chlorine atoms to silicon atoms from different dimers. By means of charge transfer through the surface, this gives rise to dangling bonds adjacent to the CH(3) groups and chlorine atoms (in effect, 'free radicals') that dissociate further incoming CH(3)Cl molecules, thereby providing the growing points for chains of indefinite length. This versatile mechanism of chain growth is examined in experiments and using ab initio theory.",chemistry
Rapid room-temperature synthesis of nanocrystalline spinels as oxygen reduction and evolution electrocatalysts.,"Spinels can serve as alternative low-cost bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER), which are the key barriers in various electrochemical devices such as metal-air batteries, fuel cells and electrolysers. However, conventional ceramic synthesis of crystalline spinels requires an elevated temperature, complicated procedures and prolonged heating time, and the resulting product exhibits limited electrocatalytic performance. It has been challenging to develop energy-saving, facile and rapid synthetic methodologies for highly active spinels. In this Article, we report the synthesis of nanocrystalline M(x)Mn(3-x)O(4) (M = divalent metals) spinels under ambient conditions and their electrocatalytic application. We show rapid and selective formation of tetragonal or cubic M(x)Mn(3-x)O(4) from the reduction of amorphous MnO(2) in aqueous M(2+) solution. The prepared Co(x)Mn(3-x)O(4) nanoparticles manifest considerable catalytic activity towards the ORR/OER as a result of their high surface areas and abundant defects. The newly discovered phase-dependent electrocatalytic ORR/OER characteristics of Co-Mn-O spinels are also interpreted by experiment and first-principle theoretical studies.",chemistry
Guest-induced growth of a surface-based supramolecular bilayer.,"Self-assembly of planar molecules on a surface can result in the formation of a wide variety of close-packed or porous structures. Two-dimensional porous arrays provide host sites for trapping guest species of suitable size. Here we show that a non-planar guest species (C(60)) can play a more complex role by promoting the growth of a second layer of host molecules (p-terphenyl-3,5,3'',5''-tetracarboxylic acid) above and parallel to the surface so that self-assembly is extended into the third dimension. The addition of guest molecules and the formation of the second layer are co-dependent. Adding a planar guest (coronene) can displace the C(60) and cause reversion to a monolayer arrangement. The system provides an example of a reversible transformation between a planar and a non-planar supramolecular network, an important step towards the controlled self-assembly of functional, three-dimensional, surface-based supramolecular architectures.",chemistry
Redox-responsive molecular helices with highly condensed pi-clouds.,"Helices have long attracted the attention of chemists, both for their inherent chiral structure and their potential for applications such as the separation of chiral compounds or the construction of molecular machines. As a result of steric forces, polymeric o-phenylenes adopt a tight helical conformation in which the densely packed phenylene units create a highly condensed pi-cloud. Here, we show an oligomeric o-phenylene that undergoes a redox-responsive dynamic motion. In solution, the helices undergo a rapid inversion. During crystallization, however, a chiral symmetry-breaking phenomenon is observed in which each crystal contains only one enantiomeric form. Crystals of both handedness are obtained, but in a non-racemic mixture. Furthermore, in solution, the dynamic motion of the helical oligomer is dramatically suppressed by one-electron oxidation. X-ray crystallography of both the neutral and oxidized forms indicated that a hole, generated upon oxidation, is shared by the repeating o-phenylene units. This enables conformational locking of the helix, and represents a long-lasting chiroptical memory.",chemistry
Surface-assisted cyclodehydrogenation provides a synthetic route towards easily processable and chemically tailored nanographenes.,"Atomically thin sheets of sp(2)-hybridized carbon--graphene--have enormous potential for applications in future electronic devices. Particularly promising are nanostructured (sub)units of graphene, the electronic properties of which can be tuned by changing the spatial extent or the specific edge termination of the carbon network. Processability and precise tailoring of graphene-derived structures are, however, still major obstacles in developing applications; both bottom-up and top-down routes are presently under investigation in attempts to overcome this limitation. Here, we propose a surface chemical route that allows for the atomically precise fabrication of tailored nanographenes from polyphenylene precursors. The cyclodehydrogenation of a prototypical polyphenylene on Cu(111) is studied using scanning tunnelling microscopy and density functional theory. We find that the thermally induced cyclodehydrogenation proceeds via several intermediate steps, two of which can be stabilized on the surface, yielding unprecedented insight into a dehydrogenative intramolecular aryl-aryl coupling reaction.",chemistry
Reversing the direction in a light-driven rotary molecular motor.,"Biological rotary motors can alter their mechanical function by changing the direction of rotary motion. Achieving a similar reversal of direction of rotation in artificial molecular motors presents a fundamental stereochemical challenge: how to change from clockwise to anticlockwise motion without compromising the autonomous unidirectional rotary behaviour of the system. A new molecular motor with multilevel control of rotary motion is reported here, in which the direction of light-powered rotation can be reversed by base-catalysed epimerization. The key steps are deprotonation and reprotonation of the photochemically generated less-stable isomers during the 360 degrees unidirectional rotary cycle, with complete inversion of the configuration at the stereogenic centre. The ability to change directionality is an essential step towards mechanical molecular systems with adaptive functional behaviour.",chemistry
Anion order in perovskite oxynitrides.,"Transition-metal oxynitrides with perovskite-type structures are an emerging class of materials with optical, photocatalytic, dielectric and magnetoresistive properties that may be sensitive to oxide-nitride order, but the anion-ordering principles were unclear. Here we report an investigation of the representative compounds SrMO(2)N (M = Nb, Ta) using neutron and electron diffraction. This revealed a robust 1O/2(O(0.5)N(0.5)) partial anion order (up to at least 750 degrees C in the apparently cubic high-temperature phases) that directs the rotations of MO(4)N(2) octahedra in the room-temperature superstructure. The anion distribution is consistent with local cis-ordering of the two nitrides in each octahedron driven by covalency, which results in disordered zigzag M-N chains in planes within the perovskite lattice. Local structures for the full range of oxynitride perovskites are predicted and a future challenge is to tune properties by controlling the order and dimensionality of the anion chains and networks.",chemistry
The effect of isotopic substitution on the chirality of a self-assembled helix.,"N,N',N''-trialkylbenzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamides (BTAs) self-assemble by means of strong, threefold alpha-helix-type intermolecular hydrogen bonding into well-defined, helical, one-dimensional columnar aggregates. When a stereogenic centre is introduced into the alkyl side chains of these BTAs, strong Cotton effects are observed in dilute apolar solutions, indicating the preference for one helical conformation over the other. Here, we report the creation of a helical sense preference in self-assembled BTAs by introducing deuterium/hydrogen isotope chirality into the alkyl side chains. We determine the relative stabilities of the left- and right-handed helical conformations of these deuterated supramolecular polymers by performing a conformational analysis. Our findings show that the results of deuterium/hydrogen substitution in BTA-based supramolecular polymers and helical polyisocyanates are very similar, although the formation mechanisms differ. The selectively deuterated BTAs discussed here represent the first example of supramolecular chirality resulting from isotope substitution.",chemistry
Highly efficient photocatalytic oxygenation reactions using water as an oxygen source.,"The effective utilization of solar energy requires photocatalytic reactions with high quantum efficiency. Water is the most abundant reactant that can be used as an oxygen source in efficient photocatalytic reactions, just as nature uses water in an oxygenic photosynthesis. We report that photocatalytic oxygenation of organic substrates such as sodium p-styrene sulfonate occurs with nearly 100% quantum efficiency using manganese(III) porphyrins as an oxygenation catalyst, [Ru(II)(bpy)(3)](2+) (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine) as a photosensitized electron-transfer catalyst, [Co(III)(NH(3))(5)Cl](2+) as a low-cost and weak one-electron oxidant, and water as an oxygen source in a phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4). A high-valent manganese-oxo porphyrin is proposed as an active oxidant that effects the oxygenation reactions.",chemistry
Macroscopic self-assembly through molecular recognition.,"Molecular recognition plays an important role in nature, with perhaps the best known example being the complementarity exhibited by pairs of nucleobases in DNA. Studies of self-assembling and self-organizing systems based on molecular recognition are often performed at the molecular level, however, and any macroscopic implications of these processes are usually far removed from the specific molecular interactions. Here, we demonstrate that well-defined molecular-recognition events can be used to direct the assembly of macroscopic objects into larger aggregated structures. Acrylamide-based gels functionalized with either host (cyclodextrin) rings or small hydrocarbon-group guest moieties were synthesized. Pieces of host and guest gels are shown to adhere to one another through the mutual molecular recognition of the cyclodextrins and hydrocarbon groups on their surfaces. By changing the size and shape of the host and guest units, different gels can be selectively assembled and sorted into distinct macroscopic structures that are on the order of millimetres to centimetres in size.",chemistry
Control and imaging of O(1D2) precession.,"Larmor precession of a quantum mechanical angular momentum vector about an applied magnetic field forms the basis for a range of magnetic resonance techniques, including nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging. We have used a polarized laser pump-probe scheme with velocity-map imaging detection to visualize, for the first time, the precessional motion of a quantum mechanical angular momentum vector. Photodissociation of O(2) at 157 nm provides a clean source of fast-moving O((1)D(2)) atoms, with their electronic angular momentum vector strongly aligned perpendicular to the recoil direction. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the distribution of atomic angular momenta precesses about the field direction, and polarization-sensitive images of the atomic scattering distribution recorded as a function of field strength yield 'time-lapse-photography' style movies of the precessional motion. We present movies recorded in various experimental geometries, and discuss potential consequences and applications in atmospheric chemistry and reaction dynamics.",chemistry
Exchange-enhanced reactivity in bond activation by metal-oxo enzymes and synthetic reagents.,"Reactivity principles based on orbital overlap and bonding/antibonding interactions are well established to describe the reactivity of organic species, and atomic structures are typically predicted by Hund's rules to have maximum single-electron occupancy of degenerate orbitals in the ground state. Here, we extend the role of exchange to transition states and discuss how, for reactions and kinetics of bioinorganic species, the analogue of Hund's rules is exchange-controlled reactivity. Pathways that increase the number of unpaired and spin-identical electrons on a metal centre will be favoured by exchange stabilization. Such exchange-enhanced reactivity endows transition states with a stereochemistry different from that observed in cases that are not exchange-enhanced, and is in good agreement with the reactivity observed for iron-based enzymes and synthetic analogues. We discuss the interplay between orbital- and exchange-controlled principles, and how this depends on the identity of the transition metal, its oxidation number and its coordination sphere.",chemistry
Quantum size effects in ambient CO oxidation catalysed by ligand-protected gold clusters.,"Finely dispersed nanometre-scale gold particles are known to catalyse several oxidation reactions in aerobic, ambient conditions. The catalytic activity has been explained by various complementary mechanisms, including support effects, particle-size-dependent metal-insulator transition, charging effects, frontier orbital interactions and geometric fluxionality. We show, by considering a series of robust and structurally well-characterized ligand-protected gold clusters with diameters between 1.2 and 2.4 nm, that electronic quantum size effects, particularly the magnitude of the so-called HOMO-LUMO energy gap, has a decisive role in binding oxygen to the nano-catalyst in an activated form. This can lead to the oxidation reaction 2CO + O(2) --> 2CO(2) with low activation barriers. Binding of dioxygen is significant only for the smallest particles with a metal core diameter clearly below 2 nm. Our results suggest a potentially viable route to practical applications using ligand-protected gold clusters for green chemistry.",chemistry
Loading and selective release of cargo in DNA nanotubes with longitudinal variation.,"Nanotubes hold promise for a number of biological and materials applications because of their high aspect ratio and encapsulation potential. A particularly attractive goal is to access nanotubes that exert well-defined control over their cargo, such as selective encapsulation, precise positioning of the guests along the nanotube length and triggered release of this cargo in response to specific external stimuli. Here, we report the construction of DNA nanotubes with longitudinal variation and alternating larger and smaller capsules along the tube length. Size-selective encapsulation of gold nanoparticles into the large capsules of these tubes leads to 'nanopeapod' particle lines with positioning of the particles 65 nm apart. These nanotubes can then be opened when specific DNA strands are added to release their particle cargo spontaneously. This approach could lead to new applications of self-assembled nanotubes, such as in the precise organization of one-dimensional nanomaterials, gene-triggered selective delivery of drugs and biological sensing.",chemistry
Preparation of functionalized organoaluminiums by direct insertion of aluminium to unsaturated halides.,"The preparation of polyfunctional organometallics is important in organic synthesis as these reagents are very popular nucleophiles. The preparation of functionalized aluminium reagents by direct insertion of aluminium powder is in general not possible. Such a reaction would be of special importance owing to the low price of aluminium compared with magnesium (it is half the price), the low toxicity of this metal and the chemoselectivity of the resultant organoaluminium reagents. We have now found that by adding catalytic amounts of selected metallic chlorides (TiCl(4), BiCl(3), InCl(3) or PbCl(2)) in the presence of LiCl, aluminium powder inserts into various unsaturated iodides and bromides under mild conditions. These resulting new organoaluminium reagents undergo smooth Pd-catalysed cross-coupling and acylation reactions, as well as copper-catalysed allylic substitutions, affording various interesting products for pharmaceutical and material science applications.",chemistry
Face-directed self-assembly of an electronically active Archimedean polyoxometalate architecture.,"The convergent assembly of metal-organic frameworks has enabled the design of porous materials using a structural building unit approach, but functional systems incorporating pre-assembled structural building unit 'pore' openings are rare. Here, we show that the face-directed assembly of a ring-shaped macrocyclic polyoxometalate structural building unit, {P(8)W(48)O(184)}(40-) with an integrated 1-nm pore as an 'aperture synthon', with manganese linkers yields a vast three-dimensional extended framework architecture based on a truncated cuboctahedron. The 1-nm-diameter entrance pores of the {P(8)W(48)O(184)}(40-) structural building unit lead to approximately spherical 7.24-nm(3) cavities containing exchangeable alkali-metal cations that can be replaced by transition-metal ions through a cation exchange process. Control over this process can be exerted by either electrochemically switching the overall framework charge by manipulating the oxidation state of the manganese linker ions, or by physically gating the pores with large organic cations, thus demonstrating how metal-organic framework-like structures with integrated pores and new physical properties can be assembled.",chemistry
Stereoinduction by distortional asymmetry.,"Stereoselective chemical synthesis requires the two faces of a pi bond to be differentiated. Theoretically sound qualitative models for understanding stereoinduction seem to break down in sterically unbiased cyclic systems. Presented here as the distortional asymmetry model is new insight that identifies circumstances where distortional ground state contributions are highly asymmetric and thereby contribute significantly to face selectivity. Out-of-plane distortional potential calculations, transition state calculations and molecular orbital analysis agree with experimental data that cannot otherwise be attributed to steric, torsion, polar or emergent transition state stabilizing effects. The model is readily understood in terms of reaction theory. The explanatory power of the model is also discussed.",chemistry
Quantum-induced symmetry breaking explains infrared spectra of CH(5)(+) isotopologues.,"For decades, protonated methane, CH(5)(+), has provided new surprises and challenges for both experimentalists and theoreticians. This is because of the correlated large-amplitude motion of its five protons around the carbon nucleus, which leads to so-called hydrogen scrambling and causes a fluxional molecular structure. Here, the infrared spectra of all its H/D isotopologues have been measured using the 'Laser Induced Reactions' technique. Their shapes are found to be extremely dissimilar and depend strongly on the level of deuteration (only CD(5)(+) is similar to CH(5)(+)). All the spectra can be reproduced and assigned based on ab initio quantum simulations. The occupation of the topologically different sites by protons and deuterons is found to be strongly non-combinatorial and thus non-classical. This purely quantum-statistical effect implies a breaking of the classical symmetry of the site occupations induced by zero-point fluctuations, and this phenomenon is key to understanding the spectral changes studied here.",chemistry
Triflimide-catalysed sigmatropic rearrangement of N-allylhydrazones as an example of a traceless bond construction.,"The recognition of structural elements (that is, retrons) that signal the application of specific chemical transformations is a key cognitive event in the design of synthetic routes to complex molecules. Reactions that produce compounds without an easily identifiable retron, by way of either substantial structural rearrangement or loss of the atoms required for the reaction to proceed, are significantly more difficult to apply during retrosynthetic planning, yet allow for non-traditional pathways that may facilitate efficient acquisition of the target molecule. We have developed a triflimide (Tf(2)NH)-catalysed rearrangement of N-allylhydrazones that allows for the generation of a sigma bond between two unfunctionalized sp(3) carbons in such a way that no clear retron for the reaction remains. This new 'traceless' bond construction displays a broad substrate profile and should open avenues for synthesizing complex molecules using non-traditional disconnections.",chemistry
Nanocrystalline intermetallics on mesoporous carbon for direct formic acid fuel cell anodes.,"Shape- and size-controlled supported metal and intermetallic nanocrystallites are of increasing interest because of their catalytic and electrocatalytic properties. In particular, intermetallics PtX (X = Bi, Pb, Pd, Ru) are very attractive because of their high activity as fuel-cell anode catalysts for formic acid or methanol oxidation. These are normally synthesized using high-temperature techniques, but rigorous size control is very challenging. Even low-temperature techniques typically produce nanoparticles with dimensions much greater than the optimum <6 nm required for fuel cell catalysis. Here, we present a simple and robust, chemically controlled process for synthesizing size-controlled noble metal or bimetallic nanocrystallites embedded within the porous structure of ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC). By using surface-modified ordered mesoporous carbon to trap the metal precursors, nanocrystallites are formed with monodisperse sizes as low as 1.5 nm, which can be tuned up to approximately 3.5 nm. To the best of our knowledge, 3-nm ordered mesoporous carbon-supported PtBi nanoparticles exhibit the highest mass activity for formic acid oxidation reported to date, and over double that of Pt-Au.",chemistry
Total synthesis of the large non-ribosomal peptide polytheonamide B.,"Polytheonamide B is by far the largest non-ribosomal peptide known at present, and displays extraordinary cytotoxicity (EC(50) = 68 pg ml(-1), mouse leukaemia P388 cells). Its 48 amino-acid residues include a variety of non-proteinogenic d- and l-amino acids, and the absolute stereochemistry of these amino acids alternate in sequence. These structural features induce the formation of a stable beta-strand-type structure, giving rise to an overall tubular structure over 30 A in length. In a biological setting, this fold is believed to transport cations across the lipid bilayer through a pore, thereby acting as an ion channel. Here, we report the first chemical construction of polytheonamide B. Our synthesis relies on the combination of four key stages: syntheses of non-proteinogenic amino acids, a solid-phase assembly of four fragments of polytheonamide B, silver-mediated connection of the fragments and, finally, global deprotection. The synthetic material now available will allow studies of the relationships between its conformational properties, channel functions and cytotoxicity.",chemistry
"Binding energies, lifetimes and implications of bulk and interface solvated electrons in water.","Solvated electrons in liquid water are one of the seemingly simplest, but most important, transients in chemistry and biology, but they have resisted disclosing important information about their energetics, binding motifs and dynamics. Here we report the first ultrafast liquid-jet photoelectron spectroscopy measurements of solvated electrons in liquid water. The results prove unequivocally the existence of solvated electrons bound at the water surface and of solvated electrons in the bulk solution, with vertical binding energies of 1.6 eV and 3.3 eV, respectively, and with lifetimes longer than 100 ps. The unexpectedly long lifetime of solvated electrons bound at the water surface is attributed to a free-energy barrier that separates surface and interior states. Beyond constituting important energetic and kinetic benchmark and reference data, the results also help to understand the mechanisms of a number of very efficient electron-transfer processes in nature.",chemistry
Chlorofullerenes featuring triple sequentially fused pentagons.,"The triple sequentially fused pentagons (TSFP) motif is one of the basic subunits that could be used for constructing fullerenes, but it violates the isolated pentagon rule (IPR) and has not been found in carbon cages to date. The properties of TSFP-incorporating fullerenes are thus poorly explored both theoretically and experimentally. Reported herein are four chlorinated derivatives of three different fullerene cages, all with the TSFP motif. X-ray crystallographic analyses indicate that the molecular strain inherent to the pentagon adjacency of a TSFP is significantly relieved upon exohedral chlorination, leaving one of the four pentagon fusion sites unsaturated and rendering the present derivatives chiral. This unique reactivity, in stark contrast to that of previously reported non-IPR fullerenes containing double fused pentagons or triple directly fused pentagons, can be rationalized by density functional theory calculations, and are expected to stimulate further studies of these new members of the fullerene family, both theoretically and experimentally.",chemistry
Novel polymerization catalysts and hydride clusters from rare-earth metal dialkyls.,"This Review gives an overview on recent progress in the synthesis and chemistry of rare-earth metal dialkyl complexes bearing monoanionic ancillary ligands, with an emphasis on novel polymerization catalysts. These structurally well-defined and highly reactive compounds are prepared either by alkane elimination reactions between trialkyl rare-earth complexes and acidic neutral ligands, or by the metathetical reactions of rare-earth trihalides with the alkali metal salts of the corresponding ligands. On treatment with an appropriate borate compound, the dialkyl complexes are converted into the corresponding cationic monoalkyl species, which serve as excellent catalysts for the polymerization and copolymerization of a variety of olefins to yield a series of new polymer materials that exhibit novel properties. Alternatively, hydrogenation of the dialkyl rare-earth complexes with H(2) affords a new class of rare-earth polyhydride complexes with unique features in terms of both their structure and reactivity.",chemistry
Exceptional ammonia uptake by a covalent organic framework.,"Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are porous crystalline materials composed of light elements linked by strong covalent bonds. A number of these materials contain a high density of Lewis acid boron sites that can strongly interact with Lewis basic guests, which makes them ideal for the storage of corrosive chemicals such as ammonia. We found that a member of the covalent organic framework family, COF-10, shows the highest uptake capacity (15 mol kg(-)(1), 298 K, 1 bar) of any porous material, including microporous 13X zeolite (9 mol kg(-)(1)), Amberlyst 15 (11 mol kg(-)(1)) and mesoporous silica, MCM-41 (7.9 mol kg(-)(1)). Notably, ammonia can be removed from the pores of COF-10 by heating samples at 200 degrees C under vacuum. In addition, repeated adsorption of ammonia into COF-10 causes a shift in the interlayer packing, which reduces its apparent surface area to nitrogen. However, owing to the strong Lewis acid-base interactions, the total uptake capacity of ammonia and the structural integrity of the COF are maintained after several cycles of adsorption/desorption.",chemistry
Solution structure of a DNA double helix with consecutive metal-mediated base pairs.,"Metal-mediated base pairs represent a powerful tool for the site-specific functionalization of nucleic acids with metal ions. The development of applications of the metal-modified nucleic acids will depend on the availability of structural information on these double helices. We present here the NMR solution structure of a self-complementary DNA oligonucleotide with three consecutive imidazole nucleotides in its centre. In the absence of transition-metal ions, a hairpin structure is adopted with the artificial nucleotides forming the loop. In the presence of Ag(i) ions, a duplex comprising three imidazole-Ag(+)-imidazole base pairs is formed. Direct proof for the formation of metal-mediated base pairs was obtained from (1)J((1)(5)N,(1)(0)(7)/(1)(0)(9)Ag) couplings upon incorporation of (1)(5)N-labelled imidazole. The duplex adopts a B-type conformation with only minor deviations in the region of the artificial bases. This work represents the first structural characterization of a metal-modified nucleic acid with a continuous stretch of metal-mediated base pairs.",chemistry
Exploring local currents in molecular junctions.,"Electron transfer through molecules is an ubiquitous process underlying the function of biological systems and synthetic devices. The electronic coupling between components varies with the structure of the molecular bridge, often in classically unintuitive ways, as determined by its quantum electronic structure. Considerable efforts in electron-transfer theory have yielded models that are useful conceptually and provide quantitative means to understand transfer rates in terms of local contributions. Here we show how a description of the local currents within a bridging molecule bound to metallic electrodes can provide chemical insight into current flow. In particular, we show that through-space, as opposed to through-bond, terms dominate in a surprising number of instances, and that interference effects can be characterized by the reversal of ring currents. Together these ideas have implications for the design of molecular electronic devices, in particular for the ways in which substituent effects may be used for maximum impact.",chemistry
Synthesis of a molecular trefoil knot by folding and closing on an octahedral coordination template.,"The advent of template-directed synthesis has provided access to a range of new interlocked molecular architectures. Although many syntheses of molecular catenanes and rotaxanes have been reported, molecular knots are a class of molecules with topologically non-planar graphs that are rather rare. Here we report a synthetic strategy for the preparation of a molecular trefoil knot from a flexible bipyridine oligomer and a zinc(II) octahedral coordination template. The oligomer folds into a stable open-knot conformation in the presence of the template, and trapping of this arrangement through esterification or ring-closing metathesis produces the closed-knot complex. Subsequent removal of the template from the metathesis product results in a molecular trefoil knot.",chemistry
Anisotropic oxygen diffusion at low temperature in perovskite-structure iron oxides.,"Oxygen-ion conduction in transition-metal oxides is exploited in, for example, electrolytes in solid-oxide fuel cells and oxygen-separation membranes, which currently work at high temperatures. Conduction at low temperature is a key to developing further utilization, and an understanding of the structures that enable conduction is also important to gain insight into oxygen-diffusion pathways. Here we report the structural changes observed when single-crystalline, epitaxial CaFeO(2).(5) thin films were changed into CaFeO(2) by low-temperature reductions with CaH(2). During the reduction process from the brownmillerite CaFeO(2).(5) into the infinite-layer structure of CaFeO(2), some of the oxygen atoms are released from and others are rearranged within the perovskite-structure framework. We evaluated these changes and the reaction time they required, and found two oxygen diffusion pathways and the related kinetics at low temperature. The results demonstrate that oxygen diffusion in the brownmillerite is highly anisotropic, significantly higher along the lateral direction of the tetrahedral and octahedral layers.",chemistry
A facile route to ketene-functionalized polymers for general materials applications.,"Function matters in materials science, and methodologies that provide paths to multiple functionality in a single step are to be prized. Therefore, we introduce a robust and efficient strategy for exploiting the versatile reactivity of ketenes in polymer chemistry. New monomers for both radical and ring-opening metathesis polymerization have been developed, which take advantage of Meldrum's acid as both a synthetic building block and a thermolytic precursor to dialkyl ketenes. The ketene-functionalized polymers are directly detected by their characteristic infrared absorption and are found to be stable under ambient conditions. The inherent ability of ketenes to provide crosslinking via dimerization and to act as reactive chemical handles via addition, provides simple methodology for application in complex materials challenges. Such versatile characteristics are illustrated by covalently attaching and patterning a dye through microcontact printing. The strategy highlights the significant opportunities afforded by the traditionally neglected ketene functional group in polymer chemistry.",chemistry
A concentric planar doubly pi-aromatic B(1)(9)(-) cluster.,"Atomic clusters often show unique, size-dependent properties and have become a fertile ground for the discovery of novel molecular structures and chemical bonding. Here we report an investigation of the B(1)(9)(-) cluster, which shows chemical bonding reminiscent of that in [10]annulene (C(1)(0)H(1)(0)) and [6]circulene (C(2)(4)H(1)(2)). Photoelectron spectroscopy reveals a relatively simple spectrum for B(1)(9)(-), with a high electron-binding energy. Theoretical calculations show that the global minimum of B(1)(9)(-) is a nearly circular planar structure with a central B(6) pentagonal unit bonded to an outer B(1)(3) ring. Chemical bonding analyses reveal that the B(1)(9)(-) cluster possesses a unique double pi-aromaticity in two concentric pi-systems, with two pi-electrons delocalized over the central pentagonal B(6) unit and another ten pi-electrons responsible for the pi-bonding between the central pentagonal unit and the outer ring. Such peculiar chemical bonding does not exist in organic compounds; it can only be found in atomic clusters.",chemistry
Formation of mixed-phase particles during the freezing of polar stratospheric ice clouds.,"Polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) are extremely efficient at catalysing the transformation of photostable chlorine reservoirs into photolabile species, which are actively involved in springtime ozone-depletion events. Why PSCs are such efficient catalysts, however, is not well understood. Here, we investigate the freezing behaviour of ternary HNO(3)-H(2)SO(4)-H(2)O droplets of micrometric size, which form type II PSC ice particles. We show that on freezing, a phase separation into pure ice and a residual solution coating occurs; this coating does not freeze but transforms into glass below approximately 150 K. We find that the coating, which is thicker around young ice crystals, can still be approximately 30 nm around older ice crystals of diameter about 10 microm. These results affect our understanding of PSC microphysics and chemistry and suggest that chlorine-activation reactions are better studied on supercooled HNO(3)-H(2)SO(4)-H(2)O solutions rather than on a pure ice surface.",chemistry
Selective incarceration of caesium ions by Venus flytrap action of a flexible framework sulfide.,"The selective capture of Cs(+) from solution is relevant to the remediation of nuclear waste and remains a significant challenge. Here we describe a new framework composed of [(CH(3))(2)NH(2)](+) and [Ga(2)Sb(2)S(7)](2)(-) layers, which are perforated with holes. Shape selectivity couples with framework flexibility, allowing the compound to respond to the ion-exchange process. The size, shape and flexibility of the holes allow Cs(+) ions in an aqueous solution to selectively pass through and enter the material via an ion-exchange process. Following capture, the structure dynamically closes its holes in a manner reminiscent of a Venus flytrap, which prevents the Cs(+) ions from leaching out. This process has useful implications in the separation science of Cs as it relates to the clean-up of nuclear waste. The dynamic response we describe here provides important insights for designing new materials for the selective removal of difficult-to-capture ions.",chemistry
Organocatalytic cascade reactions as a new tool in total synthesis.,"The total synthesis of natural products and biologically active compounds, such as pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, has reached an extraordinary level of sophistication. We are, however, still far away from the 'ideal synthesis' and the state of the art is still frequently hampered by lengthy protecting-group strategies and costly purification procedures derived from the step-by-step protocols. In recent years several new criteria have been brought forward to solve these problems and to improve total synthesis: atom, step and redox economy or protecting-group-free synthesis. Over the past decade the research area of organocatalysis has rapidly grown to become a third pillar of asymmetric catalysis standing next to metal and biocatalysis, thus paving the way for a new and powerful strategy that can help to address these issues - organocatalytic cascade reactions. In this Review we present the first applications of such asymmetric organocascade reactions to the total synthesis of natural products.",chemistry
A versatile approach to high-throughput microarrays using thiol-ene chemistry.,"Microarray technology has become extremely useful in expediting the investigation of large libraries of materials in a variety of biomedical applications, such as in DNA chips, protein and cellular microarrays. In the development of cellular microarrays, traditional high-throughput printing strategies on stiff, glass substrates and non-covalent attachment methods are limiting. We have developed a facile strategy to fabricate multifunctional high-throughput microarrays embedded at the surface of a hydrogel substrate using thiol-ene chemistry. This user-friendly method provides a platform for the immobilization of a combination of bioactive and diagnostic molecules, such as peptides and dyes, at the surface of poly(ethylene glycol)-based hydrogels. The robust and orthogonal nature of thiol-ene chemistry allows for a range of covalent attachment strategies in a fast and reliable manner, and two complementary strategies for the attachment of active molecules are demonstrated.",chemistry
Random two-dimensional string networks based on divergent coordination assembly.,"The bulk properties of glasses and amorphous materials have been studied widely, but the determination of their structural details at the molecular level is hindered by the lack of long-range order. Recently, two-dimensional, supramolecular random networks were assembled on surfaces, and the identification of elementary structural motifs and defects has provided insights into the intriguing nature of disordered materials. So far, however, such networks have been obtained with homomolecular hydrogen-bonded systems of limited stability. Here we explore robust, disordered coordination networks that incorporate transition-metal centres. Cobalt atoms were co-deposited on metal surfaces with a ditopic linker that is nonlinear, prochiral (deconvoluted in three stereoisomers on two-dimensional confinement) and bears terminal carbonitrile groups. In situ scanning tunnelling microscopy revealed the formation of a set of coordination nodes of similar energy that drives a divergent assembly scenario. The expressed string formation and bifurcation motifs result in a random reticulation of the entire surface.",chemistry
"Highly diastereoselective Csp(3)-Csp(2) Negishi cross-coupling with 1,2-, 1,3- and 1,4-substituted cycloalkylzinc compounds.","Stereoselective functionalizations of organic molecules are of great importance to modern synthesis. A stereoselective preparation of pharmaceutically active molecules is often required to ensure the appropriate biological activity. Thereby, diastereoselective methods represent valuable tools for an efficient set-up of multiple stereocentres. In this article, highly diastereoselective Csp(3) Negishi cross-couplings of various cycloalkylzinc reagents with aryl halides are reported. In all cases, the thermodynamically most-stable stereoisomer was obtained. Remarkably, this diastereoselective coupling was successful not only for 1,2-substituted cyclic systems, but also for 1,3- and 1,4-substituted cyclohexylzinc reagents. The origin of this remote stereocontrol was investigated by NMR experiments and density functional theory calculations. A detailed mechanism based on these experimental and theoretical data is proposed.",chemistry
Analysis of the reactivity and selectivity of fullerene dimerization reactions at the atomic level.,"High-resolution transmission electron microscopy has proved useful for its ability to provide time-resolved images of small molecules and their movements. One of the next challenges in this area is to visualize chemical reactions by monitoring time-dependent changes in the atomic positions of reacting molecules. Such images may provide information that is not available with other experimental methods. Here we report a study on bimolecular reactions of fullerene and metallofullerene molecules inside carbon nanotubes as a function of electron dose. Images of how the fullerenes move during the dimerization process reveal the specific orientations in which two molecules interact, as well as how bond reorganization occurs after their initial contact. Studies on the concentration, specimen temperature, effect of catalyst and accelerating voltage indicate that the reactions can be imaged under a variety of conditions.",chemistry
Dianionic species with a bond consisting of two pentacoordinated silicon atoms.,"Silicon can form bonds to other tetracoordinated silicon atoms and these bonds form the framework of many organosilicon compounds and crystalline silicon. Silicon can also form a pentacoordinated anionic structure-a so-called 'silicate'. No compounds containing a direct bond between two silicate moieties-'disilicates' where two silicate structures are combined in one species-have been reported because of the electronic repulsion between the anionic halves and difficulty preventing the release of anions. Here we report the synthesis of thermally stable and isolable disilicates by the reductive coupling reaction of a silane bearing two electron-withdrawing bidentate ligands. Two pentacoordinated silicons, positively charged despite the formal negative charge, constitute a single sigma-bond and bind eight negatively charged atoms. They can be reversibly protonated, cleaving two Si-O bonds, to afford a tetracoordinated disilane. Their unique electronic properties could be promising for the construction of functional materials with silicon wire made up of silicate chains.",chemistry
Towards quantum chemistry on a quantum computer.,"Exact first-principles calculations of molecular properties are currently intractable because their computational cost grows exponentially with both the number of atoms and basis set size. A solution is to move to a radically different model of computing by building a quantum computer, which is a device that uses quantum systems themselves to store and process data. Here we report the application of the latest photonic quantum computer technology to calculate properties of the smallest molecular system: the hydrogen molecule in a minimal basis. We calculate the complete energy spectrum to 20 bits of precision and discuss how the technique can be expanded to solve large-scale chemical problems that lie beyond the reach of modern supercomputers. These results represent an early practical step toward a powerful tool with a broad range of quantum-chemical applications.",chemistry
Chemoenzymatic synthesis of differentially protected 3-deoxysugars.,"3-Deoxysugars are important constituents of complex carbohydrates. For example, 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (KDO) is an essential component of lipopolysaccharides in Gram-negative bacteria, 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nonulosonic acid (KDN) is widely found in carbohydrates of the bacterial cell wall and in lower vertebrates, and sialic acid is a common cap of mammalian glycoproteins. Although ready access to such sugars would benefit the creation of vaccine candidates, antibiotics and small-molecule drugs, their chemical synthesis is difficult. Here we present a simple chemoenzymatic method for preparing differentially protected 3-deoxysugar derivatives from readily available starting materials. It exploits the promiscuous aldolase activity of the enzyme macrophomate synthase (MPS) to add pyruvate enolate diastereoselectively to a wide range of structurally complex aldehydes. A short synthesis of KDN illustrates the utility of this approach. Enzyme promiscuity, which putatively fosters large functional leaps in natural evolution, has great promise as a source of synthetically useful catalytic transformations.",chemistry
A synthetic small molecule that can walk down a track.,"Although chemists have made small-molecule rotary motors, to date there have been no reports of small-molecule linear motors. Here we describe the synthesis and operation of a 21-atom two-legged molecular unit that is able to walk up and down a four-foothold molecular track. High processivity is conferred by designing the track-binding interactions of the two feet to be labile under different sets of conditions such that each foot can act as a temporarily fixed pivot for the other. The walker randomly and processively takes zero or one step along the track using a 'passing-leg' gait each time the environment is switched between acid and base. Replacing the basic step with a redox-mediated, disulfide-exchange reaction directionally transports the bipedal molecules away from the minimum-energy distribution by a Brownian ratchet mechanism. The ultimate goal of such studies is to produce artificial, linear molecular motors that move directionally along polymeric tracks to transport cargoes and perform tasks in a manner reminiscent of biological motor proteins.",chemistry
Tailoring molecular layers at metal surfaces.,"The design of networks of organic molecules at metal surfaces, highly attractive for a variety of applications ranging from molecular electronics to gas sensors to protective coatings, has matured to a degree that patterns with multinanometre unit cells and almost any arbitrary geometry can be fabricated. This Review provides an overview of vacuum-deposited organic networks at metal surfaces, using intermolecular hydrogen bonding, metal-atom coordination and in situ polymerization. Recent progress in these areas highlights how the design of surface patterns can benefit from the wealth of information available from solution- and bulk-phase chemistry, while at the same time providing novel insights into the nature of such bonds through the applicability of direct scanning probe imaging at metal surfaces.",chemistry
Vapour-phase gold-surface-mediated coupling of aldehydes with methanol.,"Selective coupling of oxygenates is critical to many synthetic processes, including those necessary for the development of alternative fuels. We report a general process for selective coupling of aldehydes and methanol as a route to ester synthesis. All steps are mediated by oxygen-covered metallic gold nanoparticles on Au(111). Remarkably, cross-coupling of methanol with formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, benzaldehyde and benzeneacetaldehyde to methyl esters is promoted by oxygen-covered Au(111) below room temperature with high selectivity. The high selectivity is attributed to the ease of nucleophilic attack of the aldehydes by the methoxy intermediate-formed from methanol on the surface-which yields the methyl esters. The competing combustion occurs via attack of both methanol and the aldehydes by oxygen. The mechanistic model constructed in this study provides insight into factors that control selectivity and clearly elucidates the crucial role of Au nanoparticles as active species in the catalytic oxidation of alcohols, even in solution.",chemistry
A biocompatible condensation reaction for controlled assembly of nanostructures in living cells.,"Through controlled synthesis and molecular assembly, biological systems are able to organize molecules into supramolecular structures that carry out sophisticated processes. Although chemists have reported a few examples of supramolecular assembly in water, the controlled covalent synthesis of large molecules and structures in vivo has remained challenging. Here we report a condensation reaction between 1,2-aminothiol and 2-cyanobenzothiazole that occurs in vitro and in living cells under the control of either pH, disulfide reduction or enzymatic cleavage. In vitro, the size and shape of the condensation products, and the nanostructures subsequently assembled, were different in each case and could thus be controlled by tuning the structure of the monomers. Direct imaging of the products obtained in the cells revealed their locations-near the Golgi bodies under enzymatic cleavage control-demonstrating the feasibility of a controlled and localized reaction in living cells. This intracellular condensation process enabled the imaging of the proteolytic activity of furin.",chemistry
Pressure-induced bonding and compound formation in xenon-hydrogen solids.,"Closed electron shell systems, such as hydrogen, nitrogen or group 18 elements, can form weakly bound stoichiometric compounds at high pressures. An understanding of the stability of these van der Waals compounds is lacking, as is information on the nature of their interatomic interactions. We describe the formation of a stable compound in the Xe-H(2) binary system, revealed by a suite of X-ray diffraction and optical spectroscopy measurements. At 4.8 GPa, a unique hydrogen-rich structure forms that can be viewed as a tripled solid hydrogen lattice modulated by layers of xenon, consisting of xenon dimers. Varying the applied pressure tunes the Xe-Xe distances in the solid over a broad range from that of an expanded xenon lattice to the distances observed in metallic xenon at megabar pressures. Infrared and Raman spectra indicate a weakening of the intramolecular covalent bond as well as persistence of semiconducting behaviour in the compound to at least 255 GPa.",chemistry
Radically enhanced molecular recognition.,"The tendency for viologen radical cations to dimerize has been harnessed to establish a recognition motif based on their ability to form extremely strong inclusion complexes with cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) in its diradical dicationic redox state. This previously unreported complex involving three bipyridinium cation radicals increases the versatility of host-guest chemistry, extending its practice beyond the traditional reliance on neutral and charged guests and hosts. In particular, transporting the concept of radical dimerization into the field of mechanically interlocked molecules introduces a higher level of control within molecular switches and machines. Herein, we report that bistable and tristable [2]rotaxanes can be switched by altering electrochemical potentials. In a tristable [2]rotaxane composed of a cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) ring and a dumbbell with tetrathiafulvalene, dioxynaphthalene and bipyridinium recognition sites, the position of the ring can be switched. On oxidation, it moves from the tetrathiafulvalene to the dioxynaphthalene, and on reduction, to the bipyridinium radical cation, provided the ring is also reduced simultaneously to the diradical dication.",chemistry
Converting homogeneous to heterogeneous in electrophilic catalysis using monodisperse metal nanoparticles.,"A continuing goal in catalysis is to unite the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic processes. To this end, nanoparticles represent a new frontier in heterogeneous catalysis, where this unification can also be supplemented by the ability to obtain new or divergent reactivity and selectivity. We report a novel method for applying heterogeneous catalysts to known homogeneous catalytic reactions through the design and synthesis of electrophilic platinum nanoparticles. These nanoparticles are selectively oxidized by the hypervalent iodine species PhICl(2), and catalyse a range of pi-bond activation reactions previously only catalysed through homogeneous processes. Multiple experimental methods are used to unambiguously verify the heterogeneity of the catalytic process. The discovery of treatments for nanoparticles that induce the desired homogeneous catalytic activity should lead to the further development of reactions previously inaccessible in heterogeneous catalysis. Furthermore, a size and capping agent study revealed that Pt PAMAM dendrimer-capped nanoparticles demonstrate superior activity and recyclability compared with larger, polymer-capped analogues.",chemistry
Dinitrogen cleavage and functionalization by carbon monoxide promoted by a hafnium complex.,"Molecular nitrogen (N(2)) and carbon monoxide (CO) have the two strongest bonds in chemistry and present significant challenges in developing new transformations that exploit these two abundant feedstocks. At the core of this objective is the discovery of transition-metal compounds that promote the six-electron reductive cleavage of N(2) at ambient temperature and pressure and also promote new nitrogen-element bond formation. Here we show that an organometallic hafnium compound induces N(2) cleavage on the addition of CO, with a simultaneous assembly of new nitrogen-carbon and carbon-carbon bonds. Subsequent addition of a weak acid liberates oxamide, which demonstrates that an important agrochemical can be synthesized directly from N(2) and CO. These studies introduce an alternative paradigm for N(2) cleavage and functionalization in which the six-electron reductive cleavage is promoted by both the transition metal and the incoming ligand, CO, used for the new bond formations.",chemistry
Template synthesis of precisely monodisperse silica nanoparticles within self-assembled organometallic spheres.,"One of the key challenges in materials science is to control the size and shape of inorganic nanoparticles with a high degree of precision, as these parameters have a significant influence on the nanoparticles' properties and potential applications. Here, we describe the preparation of highly monodisperse silica nanoparticles smaller than 5 nm in diameter by using self-assembled, hollow, spherical compounds as 'endo-templates'. These coordination complexes with pendant sugar groups lining their interiors-assembled from 12 metal ions and 24 bis-pyridyl ligands containing glucose substituents-acted as structurally well-defined templates for the sol-gel condensation of alkoxysilanes. The polydispersities of the silica nanoparticles made with this method approached unity, with M(w)/M(n) < 1.01. The component ligands are modified easily, which enables an accurate expansion of the coordination complex and the subsequent control of the monodisperse silica nanoparticles that span molecular weights of 5,000 to 31,000 Da (corresponding to 2-4 nm in diameter). This method could be applicable to the preparation of other inorganic nanoparticles.",chemistry
Designing artificial enzymes by intuition and computation.,"The rational design of artificial enzymes, either by applying physico-chemical intuition of protein structure and function or with the aid of computational methods, is a promising area of research with the potential to tremendously impact medicine, industrial chemistry and energy production. Designed proteins also provide a powerful platform for dissecting enzyme mechanisms of natural systems. Artificial enzymes have come a long way from simple alpha-helical peptide catalysts to proteins that facilitate multistep chemical reactions designed by state-of-the-art computational methods. Looking forward, we examine strategies employed by natural enzymes that could be used to improve the speed and selectivity of artificial catalysts.",chemistry
A flash of magnesium.,Magnesium is commonly found in rocks and sea water as well as living organisms. Paul Knochel relates how this element has also sparked a great deal of interest among chemists.,chemistry
Dynamic hook-and-eye nanoparticle sponges.,"Systems in which nanoscale components of different types can be captured and/or released from organic scaffolds provide a fertile basis for the construction of dynamic, exchangeable functional materials. In such heterogeneous systems, the components interact with one another by means of programmable, noncovalent bonding interactions. Herein, we describe polymers that capture and release functionalized nanoparticles selectively during redox-controlled aggregation and disaggregation, respectively. The interactions between the polymer and the NPs are mediated by the reversible formation of polypseudorotaxanes, and give rise to architectures ranging from short chains composed of few nanoparticles to extended networks of nanoparticles crosslinked by the polymer. In the latter case, the polymer/nanoparticle aggregates precipitate from solution such that the polymer acts as a selective 'sponge' for the capture/release of the nanoparticles of different types.",chemistry
Complete chiral symmetry breaking of an amino acid derivative directed by circularly polarized light.,"Circularly polarized light (CPL) emitted from star-forming regions is an attractive candidate as a cause of single chirality in nature. It has remained difficult, however, to translate the relatively small chemical effects observed on irradiation of molecular systems with CPL into high enantiomeric excesses. Here we demonstrate that irradiation of a racemic amino acid derivative with CPL leads to a small amount of chiral induction that can be amplified readily to give an enantiopure solid phase. A racemate composed of equal amounts of left- and right-handed crystals in contact with the irradiated solution is converted completely into crystals of single-handedness through abrasive grinding when racemization is effected in the solution. The rotation sense of the CPL fully determines the handedness of the final solid state. These findings illustrate the potential effectiveness of CPL in the control of molecular asymmetry, which is relevant for the origin of the single chirality inherent to many biological molecules.",chemistry
Identification of active Zr-WO(x) clusters on a ZrO2 support for solid acid catalysts.,"Tungstated zirconia is a robust solid acid catalyst for light alkane (C(4)-C(8)) isomerization. Several structural models for catalytically active sites have been proposed, but the topic remains controversial, partly because of the absence of direct structural imaging information on the various supported WO(x) species. High-angle annular dark-field imaging of WO(3)/ZrO(2) catalysts in an aberration-corrected analytical electron microscope allows, for the first time, direct imaging of the various species present. Comparison of the relative distribution of these WO(x) species in materials showing low and high catalytic activities has allowed the deduction of the likely identity of the catalytic active site--namely, subnanometre Zr-WO(x) clusters. This information has subsequently been used in the design of new catalysts, in which the activity of a poor catalyst has been increased by two orders of magnitude using a synthesis procedure that deliberately increases the number density of catalytically relevant active species.",chemistry
Cooperative molecular dynamics in surface reactions.,"The controlled imprinting of surfaces with specified patterns is important in the development of nanoscale devices. Previously, such patterns were created using self-assembled physisorbed adsorbate molecules that can be stabilized on the surface by subsequent chemical bonding. Here we show a first step towards use of the bonding within a surface to propagate reactions for patterning, namely the cooperative reaction of adjacent silicon atoms. We exploit the double-bonded silicon dimer pairs present on the surface of Si(100)-2x1 and show that the halogenation of one silicon atom (induced by electrons or heat) results in cooperative halogenation of the neighbouring silicon atom with unit efficiency. The reactants used were two 1-halopentane molecules physisorbed over a pair of silicon atoms. This cooperative pair of halogenation reactions was shown by ab initio calculation to be sequential on a timescale of femtoseconds.",chemistry
Anhydrous proton conduction at 150 degrees C in a crystalline metal-organic framework.,"Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are particularly exciting materials that couple porosity, diversity and crystallinity. But although they have been investigated for a wide range of applications, MOF chemistry focuses almost exclusively on properties intrinsic to the empty frameworks; the use of guest molecules to control functions has been essentially unexamined. Here we report Na(3)(2,4,6-trihydroxy-1,3,5-benzenetrisulfonate) (named beta-PCMOF2), a MOF that conducts protons in regular one-dimensional pores lined with sulfonate groups. Proton conduction in beta-PCMOF2 was modulated by the controlled loading of 1H-1,2,4-triazole (Tz) guests within the pores and reached 5 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) at 150 degrees C in anhydrous H(2), as confirmed by electrical measurements in H(2) and D(2), and by solid-state NMR spectroscopy. To confirm its potential as a gas separator membrane, the partially loaded MOF (beta-PCMOF2(Tz)(0.45)) was also incorporated into a H(2)/air membrane electrode assembly. The resulting membrane proved to be gas tight, and gave an open circuit voltage of 1.18 V at 100 degrees C.",chemistry
Soft porous crystals.,"The field of host-guest complexation is intensely attractive from diverse perspectives, including materials science, chemistry and biology. The uptake and encapsulation of guest species by host frameworks are being investigated for a wide variety of purposes, including separation and storage using zeolites, and recognition and sensing by enzymes in solution. Here we focus on the concept of the cooperative integration of 'softness' and 'regularity'. Recent developments on porous coordination polymers (or metal-organic frameworks) have provided the inherent properties that combine these features. Such soft porous crystals exhibit dynamic frameworks that are able to respond to external stimuli such as light, electric fields or the presence of particular species, but they are also crystalline and can change their channels reversibly while retaining high regularity. We discuss the relationship between the structures and properties of these materials in view of their practical applications.",chemistry

Communicating chemistry.,"New web-based models of scholarly communication have made a significant impact in some scientific disciplines, but chemistry is not one of them. What has prevented the widespread adoption of these developments by chemists-and what are the prospects for adoption over time?",chemistry
Questioning 'chemistry'.,"The Nobel Prize in Chemistry for 2009 was awarded for research into the structure and function of the ribosome, sparking debate about its significance to chemists.",chemistry
Small-molecule-mediated G-quadruplex isolation from human cells.,"Nucleic acids containing stretches of tandem guanines can fold into four-stranded structures called G-quadruplexes. The existence of such sequences in genomic DNA suggests the occurrence of these motifs in cells, with potential implications in a number of biological processes relevant to cancer. Small molecules have proven to be valuable tools to dissect cell circuitry. Here, we describe a synthetic small molecule derived from an N,N'-bis(2-quinolinyl)pyridine-2,6-dicarboxamide, which is designed to mediate the selective isolation of G-quadruplex nucleic acids. The methodology was successfully applied to a range of DNA and RNA G-quadruplexes in vitro. We demonstrate the general applicability of the method by isolating telomeric DNA-containing G-quadruplex motifs from cells. We show that telomeres are targets for the probe, providing further evidence of the formation of G-quadruplexes in human cells.",chemistry
Biocatalytic induction of supramolecular order.,"Supramolecular gels, which demonstrate tunable functionalities, have attracted much interest in a range of areas, including healthcare, environmental protection and energy-related technologies. Preparing these materials in a reliable manner is challenging, with an increased level of kinetic defects observed at higher self-assembly rates. Here, by combining biocatalysis and molecular self-assembly, we have shown the ability to more quickly access higher-ordered structures. By simply increasing enzyme concentration, supramolecular order expressed at molecular, nano- and micro-levels is dramatically enhanced, and, importantly, the gelator concentrations remain identical. Amphiphile molecules were prepared by attaching an aromatic moiety to a dipeptide backbone capped with a methyl ester. Their self-assembly was induced by an enzyme that hydrolysed the ester. Different enzyme concentrations altered the catalytic activity and size of the enzyme clusters, affecting their mobility. This allowed structurally diverse materials that represent local minima in the free energy landscape to be accessed based on a single gelator structure.",chemistry
Mineralization of the metre-long biosilica structures of glass sponges is templated on hydroxylated collagen.,"The minerals involved in the formation of metazoan skeletons principally comprise glassy silica, calcium phosphate or carbonate. Because of their ancient heritage, glass sponges (Hexactinellida) may shed light on fundamental questions such as molecular evolution, the unique chemistry and formation of the first skeletal silica-based structures, and the origin of multicellular animals. We have studied anchoring spicules from the metre-long stalk of the glass rope sponge (Hyalonema sieboldi; Porifera, Class Hexactinellida), which are remarkable for their size, durability, flexibility and optical properties. Using slow-alkali etching of biosilica, we isolated the organic fraction, which was revealed to be dominated by a hydroxylated fibrillar collagen that contains an unusual [Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp] motif. We speculate that this motif is predisposed for silica precipitation, and provides a novel template for biosilicification in nature.",chemistry
Mutual modulation between membrane-embedded receptor clustering and ligand binding in lipid membranes.,"Thanks largely to a cooperative chelate effect, clustered membrane-embedded proteins favourably bind to multivalent ligands in solution and, conversely, a multivalent receptor can induce the clustering of membrane-embedded proteins. Here, we use a chemical model to show that the binding of a monovalent ligand and the clustering of a membrane-embedded receptor are closely related processes that modulate each other without the contribution of any apparent multivalence effect. Clearly, the confinement of the receptor within the surface reveals cooperative effects between clustering and binding that are too weak to detect in bulk-solution systems. This work shows that for membrane-embedded receptors that undergo some degree of spontaneous clustering, analyses based on multivalence-mediated cooperativity are insufficient to describe fully the molecular recognition events induced by ligands in solution. Instead, a binding-clustering thermodynamic cycle is proposed for the analysis of the interaction of any kind of ligand with membrane-embedded receptors.",chemistry
Crystallographic snapshots of the reaction of aromatic C-H with O(2) catalysed by a protein-bound iron complex.,"Chemical reactions inside single crystals are quite rare because crystallinity is difficult to retain owing to atomic rearrangements. Protein crystals in general have a high solvent content. This allows for some molecular flexibility, which makes it possible to trap reaction intermediates of enzymatic reactions without disrupting the crystal lattice. A similar approach has not yet been fully implemented in the field of inorganic chemistry. Here, we have combined model chemistry and protein X-ray crystallography to study the intramolecular aromatic dihydroxylation by an arene-containing protein-bound iron complex. The bound complex was able to activate dioxygen in the presence of a reductant, leading to the formation of catechol as the sole product. The structure determination of four of the catalytic cycle intermediates and the end product showed that the hydroxylation reaction implicates an iron peroxo, generated by reductive O(2) activation, an intermediate already observed in iron monooxygenases. This strategy also provided unexpected mechanistic details such as the rearrangement of the iron coordination sphere on metal reduction.",chemistry
A bioinspired approach for controlling accessibility in calix[4]arene-bound metal cluster catalysts.,"In enzymes, the electronic and steric environments of active centres, and therefore their activity in biological processes, are controlled by the surrounding amino acids. In a similar manner, organic ligands have been used for the 'passivation' of metal clusters, that is, inhibition of their aggregation and control of their environment. However, the ability of enzymes to maintain large degrees of accessibility has remained difficult to mimic in synthetic systems in which little room, if any, is typically left to bind to other species. Here, using calix[4]arene macrocycles bearing phosphines as crude mimics of the rigid backbones of proteins, we demonstrate the synthesis of gold clusters and the control of their accessibility through an interplay between the sizes of the calixarene ligands and metal cores. For 0.9-nm cores, 25% of all the gold atoms within the cluster bind to the chemisorption probe 2-naphthalenethiol. This accessibility dramatically decreases with 1.1-nm and 4-nm gold cores.",chemistry
Uranyl oxo activation and functionalization by metal cation coordination.,"The oxo groups in the uranyl ion [UO(2)](2+)-one of many oxo cations formed by metals from across the periodic table-are particularly inert, which explains the dominance of this ion in the laboratory and its persistence as an environmental contaminant. In contrast, transition metal oxo (M=O) compounds can be highly reactive and carry out difficult reactions such as the oxygenation of hydrocarbons. Here we show how the sequential addition of a lithium metal base to the uranyl ion constrained in a 'Pacman' environment results in lithium coordination to the U=O bonds and single-electron reduction. This reaction depends on the nature and stoichiometry of the lithium reagent and suggests that competing reduction and C-H bond activation reactions are occurring.",chemistry
Synergistic self-assembly of RNA and DNA molecules.,"DNA has recently been used as a programmable 'smart' building block for the assembly of a wide range of nanostructures. It remains difficult, however, to construct DNA assemblies that are also functional. Incorporating RNA is a promising strategy to circumvent this issue as RNA is structurally related to DNA but exhibits rich chemical, structural and functional diversities. However, only a few examples of rationally designed RNA structures have been reported. Herein, we describe a simple, general strategy for the de novo design of nanostructures in which the self-assembly of RNA strands is programmed by DNA strands. To demonstrate the versatility of this approach, we have designed and constructed three different RNA-DNA hybrid branched nanomotifs (tiles), which readily assemble into one-dimensional nanofibres, extended two-dimensional arrays and a discrete three-dimensional object. The current strategy could enable the integration of the precise programmability of DNA with the rich functionality of RNA.",chemistry
An efficient organocatalytic method for constructing biaryls through aromatic C-H activation.,"The direct functionalization of C-H bonds has drawn the attention of chemists for almost a century. C-H activation has mainly been achieved through four metal-mediated pathways: oxidative addition, electrophilic substitution, sigma-bond metathesis and metal-associated carbene/nitrene/oxo insertion. However, the identification of methods that do not require transition-metal catalysts is important because methods involving such catalysts are often expensive. Another advantage would be that the requirement to remove metallic impurities from products could be avoided, an important issue in the synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds. Here, we describe the identification of a cross-coupling between aryl iodides/bromides and the C-H bonds of arenes that is mediated solely by the presence of 1,10-phenanthroline as catalyst in the presence of KOt-Bu as a base. This apparently transition-metal-free process provides a new strategy with which to achieve direct C-H functionalization.",chemistry
Anion-switchable supramolecular gels for controlling pharmaceutical crystal growth.,"We describe the use of low-molecular-weight supramolecular gels as media for the growth of molecular crystals. Growth of a range of crystals of organic compounds, including pharmaceuticals, was achieved in bis(urea) gels. Low-molecular-weight supramolecular gelators allow access to an unlimited range of solvent systems, in contrast to conventional aqueous gels such as gelatin and agarose. A detailed study of carbamazepine crystal growth in four different bis(urea) gelators, including a metallogelator, is reported. The crystallization of a range of other drug substances, namely sparfloxacin, piroxicam, theophylline, caffeine, ibuprofen, acetaminophen (paracetamol), sulindac and indomethacin, was also achieved in supramolecular gel media without co-crystal formation. In many cases, crystals can be conveniently recovered from the gels by using supramolecular anion-triggered gel dissolution; however, crystals of substances that themselves bind to anions are dissolved by them. Overall, supramolecular gel-phase crystallization offers an extremely versatile new tool in pharmaceutical polymorph screening.",chemistry
Coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism by chemical design.,"Although the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism in one compound is rare, some examples of such materials are known to exist. Methods to physically prepare hybrid structures with both competing phases are also known, which rely on the nanofabrication of alternating conducting layers. Chemical methods of building up hybrid materials with organic molecules (superconducting layers) and metal complexes (magnetic layers) have provided examples of superconductivity with some magnetic properties, but not fully ordered. Now, we report a chemical design strategy that uses the self assembly in solution of macromolecular nanosheet building blocks to engineer the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism in [Ni(0.66)Al(0.33)(OH)(2)][TaS(2)] at approximately 4 K. The method is further demonstrated in the isostructural [Ni(0.66)Fe(0.33)(OH)(2)][TaS(2)], in which the magnetic ordering is shifted from 4 K to 16 K.",chemistry
"Storable, thermally activated, near-infrared chemiluminescent dyes and dye-stained microparticles for optical imaging.","Imaging techniques are a vital part of clinical diagnostics, biomedical research and nanotechnology. Optical molecular imaging makes use of relatively harmless, low-energy light and technically straightforward instrumentation. Self-illuminating, chemiluminescent systems are particularly attractive because they have inherently high signal contrast due to the lack of background emission. Currently, chemiluminescence imaging involves short-lived molecular species that are not stored but are instead generated in situ, and they typically emit visible light, which does not penetrate far through heterogeneous biological media. Here, we describe a new paradigm for optical molecular imaging using squaraine rotaxane endoperoxides, interlocked fluorescent and chemiluminescent dye molecules that have a squaraine chromophore encapsulated inside a macrocycle endoperoxide. Squaraine rotaxane endoperoxides can be stored indefinitely at temperatures below -20 degrees C, but upon warming to body temperature they undergo a unimolecular chemical reaction and emit near-infrared light that can pass through a living mouse.",chemistry
Graphene oxide as a chemically tunable platform for optical applications.,"Chemically derived graphene oxide (GO) is an atomically thin sheet of graphite that has traditionally served as a precursor for graphene, but is increasingly attracting chemists for its own characteristics. It is covalently decorated with oxygen-containing functional groups - either on the basal plane or at the edges - so that it contains a mixture of sp(2)- and sp(3)-hybridized carbon atoms. In particular, manipulation of the size, shape and relative fraction of the sp(2)-hybridized domains of GO by reduction chemistry provides opportunities for tailoring its optoelectronic properties. For example, as-synthesized GO is insulating but controlled deoxidation leads to an electrically and optically active material that is transparent and conducting. Furthermore, in contrast to pure graphene, GO is fluorescent over a broad range of wavelengths, owing to its heterogeneous electronic structure. In this Review, we highlight the recent advances in optical properties of chemically derived GO, as well as new physical and biological applications.",chemistry
Neglected neptunium.,"Jim Ibers talks about neptunium, an element that has remained largely unnoticed despite the flurry of activity devoted to its neighbours in the periodic table, uranium and plutonium.",chemistry
Catalytic enantioselective syn hydration of enones in water using a DNA-based catalyst.,"The enantioselective addition of water to olefins in an aqueous environment is a common transformation in biological systems, but was beyond the ability of synthetic chemists. Here, we present the first examples of a non-enzymatic catalytic enantioselective hydration of enones, for which we used a catalyst that comprises a copper complex, based on an achiral ligand, non-covalently bound to (deoxy)ribonucleic acid, which is the only source of chirality present under the reaction conditions. The chiral beta-hydroxy ketone product was obtained in up to 82% enantiomeric excess. Deuterium-labelling studies demonstrated that the reaction is diastereospecific, with only the syn hydration product formed. So far, this diastereospecific and enantioselective reaction had no equivalent in conventional homogeneous catalysis.",chemistry
A bidentate Lewis acid with a telluronium ion as an anion-binding site.,"The search for receptors that can selectively capture small and potentially toxic anions in protic media has sparked a renewed interest in the synthesis and anion-binding properties of polydentate Lewis acids. Seeking new paradigms to enhance the anion affinities of such systems, we synthesized a bidentate Lewis acid that contains a boryl and a telluronium moiety as Lewis acidic sites. Anion-complexation studies indicate that this telluronium borane displays a high affinity for fluoride in methanol. Structural and computational studies show that the unusual fluoride affinity of this bidentate telluronium borane can be correlated with the formation of a B-F --> Te chelate motif supported by a strong lone-pair(F) --> sigma*(Te-C) donor-acceptor interaction. These results, which illustrate the viability of heavier chalcogenium centres as anion-binding sites, allow us to introduce a novel strategy for the design of polydentate Lewis acids with enhanced anion affinities.",chemistry
Spectroscopic visualization of sound-induced liquid vibrations using a supramolecular nanofibre.,"The question of whether sound vibration of a medium can bring about any kind of molecular or macromolecular events is a long-standing scientific controversy. Although it is known that ultrasonic vibrations with frequencies of more than 1 MHz are able to align certain macromolecules in solution, no effect has yet been reported with audible sound, the frequency of which is much lower (20-20,000 Hz). Here, we report on the design of a supramolecular nanofibre that in solution becomes preferentially aligned parallel to the propagation direction of audible sound. This phenomenon can be used to spectroscopically visualize sound-induced vibrations in liquids and may find application in a wide range of vibration sensing technologies.",chemistry
Direct enantio-convergent transformation of racemic substrates without racemization or symmetrization.,"Asymmetric reactions that transform racemic mixtures into enantio-enriched products are in high demand, but classical kinetic resolution produces enantiopure compounds in <50% yield even in an ideal case. Many deracemization processes have thus been developed including dynamic kinetic resolution and dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation, which can provide enantio-enriched products even after complete conversion of the racemic starting materials. However, these dynamic processes require racemization or symmetrization of the substrates or intermediates. We demonstrate a direct chemical enantio-convergent transformation without a racemization or symmetrization process. Copper(I)-catalysed asymmetric allylic substitution of a racemic allylic ether afforded a single enantiomer of an alpha-chiral allylboronate with complete conversion and high enantioselectivity (up to 98% enantiomeric excess). One enantiomer of the substrate undergoes an anti-S(N)2'-type reaction whereas the other enantiomer reacts via a syn-S(N)2' pathway. The products, which cannot be prepared by dynamic procedures, have been used to construct all-carbon quaternary stereocentres.",chemistry
Synthesis of polyynes to model the sp-carbon allotrope carbyne.,"Carbyne is an allotrope of carbon composed of sp-hybridized carbon atoms. Although its formation in the laboratory is suggested, no well-defined sample is described. Interest in carbyne and its potential properties remains intense because of, at least in part, technological breakthroughs offered by other carbon allotropes, such as fullerenes, carbon nanotubes and graphene. Here, we describe the synthesis of a series of conjugated polyynes as models for carbyne. The longest of the series consists of 44 contiguous acetylenic carbons, and it maintains a framework clearly composed of alternating single and triple bonds. Spectroscopic analyses for these polyynes reveal a distinct trend towards a finite gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital for carbyne, which is estimated to be approximately 485 nm ( approximately 2.56 eV). Even the longest members of this series of polyynes are not particularly sensitive to light, moisture or oxygen, and they can be handled and characterized under normal laboratory conditions.",chemistry
Recognition-mediated activation of therapeutic gold nanoparticles inside living cells.,"Supramolecular chemistry provides a versatile tool for the organization of molecular systems into functional structures and the actuation of these assemblies for applications through the reversible association between complementary components. Use of this methodology in living systems, however, represents a significant challenge owing to the chemical complexity of cellular environments and lack of selectivity of conventional supramolecular interactions. Herein, we present a host-guest system featuring diaminohexane-terminated gold nanoparticles (AuNP-NH(2)) and complementary cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]). In this system, threading of CB[7] on the particle surface reduces the cytotoxicity of AuNP-NH(2) through sequestration of the particle in endosomes. Intracellular triggering of the therapeutic effect of AuNP-NH(2) was then achieved through the administration of 1-adamantylamine (ADA), removing CB[7] from the nanoparticle surface, causing the endosomal release and concomitant in situ cytotoxicity of AuNP-NH(2). This supramolecular strategy for intracellular activation provides a new tool for potential therapeutic applications.",chemistry
The maximum pentagon separation rule provides a guideline for the structures of endohedral metallofullerenes.,"Fullerenes tend to follow the isolated pentagon rule, which requires that each of the 12 pentagons is surrounded only by hexagons. Over the past decade many violations to this rule were reported for endohedral fullerenes. Based on the ionic model M(3)N(6+)@C(2n)(6-) and the orbital energies of the isolated cages, in 2005 we formulated a molecular orbital rule to identify the most suitable hosting cages in endohedral metallofullerenes. Now, we give physical support to the orbital rule, and we propose the maximum pentagon separation rule, which can be applied to either isolated pentagon rule cages or to non-isolated pentagon rule cages with the same number of adjacent pentagon pairs. The maximum pentagon separation rule can be formulated as 'The electron transfer from the internal cluster to the fullerene host preferentially adds electrons to the pentagons; therefore, the most suitable carbon cages are those with the largest separations among the 12 pentagons'.",chemistry
Synthesis of glycine-containing complexes in impacts of comets on early Earth.,"Delivery of prebiotic compounds to early Earth from an impacting comet is thought to be an unlikely mechanism for the origins of life because of unfavourable chemical conditions on the planet and the high heat from impact. In contrast, we find that impact-induced shock compression of cometary ices followed by expansion to ambient conditions can produce complexes that resemble the amino acid glycine. Our ab initio molecular dynamics simulations show that shock waves drive the synthesis of transient C-N bonded oligomers at extreme pressures and temperatures. On post impact quenching to lower pressures, the oligomers break apart to form a metastable glycine-containing complex. We show that impact from cometary ice could possibly yield amino acids by a synthetic route independent of the pre-existing atmospheric conditions and materials on the planet.",chemistry
De novo synthesis of a metal-organic framework material featuring ultrahigh surface area and gas storage capacities.,"Metal-organic frameworks--a class of porous hybrid materials built from metal ions and organic bridges--have recently shown great promise for a wide variety of applications. The large choice of building blocks means that the structures and pore characteristics of the metal-organic frameworks can be tuned relatively easily. However, despite much research, it remains challenging to prepare frameworks specifically tailored for particular applications. Here, we have used computational modelling to design and predictively characterize a metal-organic framework (NU-100) with a particularly high surface area. Subsequent experimental synthesis yielded a material, matching the calculated structure, with a high BET surface area (6,143 m(2) g(-1)). Furthermore, sorption measurements revealed that the material had high storage capacities for hydrogen (164 mg g(-1)) and carbon dioxide (2,315 mg g(-1))--gases of high importance in the contexts of clean energy and climate alteration, respectively--in excellent agreement with predictions from modelling.",chemistry
N-silyl oxyketene imines are underused yet highly versatile reagents for catalytic asymmetric synthesis.,"The reactions of acyl anion equivalents (d1 synthons) with carbonyl electrophiles allow for the construction of a wide range of molecules useful for the synthesis of biologically active compounds, natural products and chiral ligands. Despite their utility, significant challenges still exist for developing catalytic, enantioselective variants of these reactions. For example, the asymmetric benzoin process, arguably the most characteristic reaction of d synthetic equivalents, finds no general solution for reactions involving aliphatic acyl anions. In this Article, we introduce a new class of stable, isolable silyl ketene imines derived from protected cyanohydrins. These nucleophiles serve as acyl anion equivalents in Lewis base catalysed aldol addition reactions and allow for the preparation of cross-benzoin and glycolate-aldol products in high yield and with exceptional diastereo- and enantioselectivities.",chemistry
Photoelectrochemical complexes for solar energy conversion that chemically and autonomously regenerate.,"Naturally occurring photosynthetic systems use elaborate pathways of self-repair to limit the impact of photo-damage. Here, we demonstrate a complex consisting of two recombinant proteins, phospholipids and a carbon nanotube that mimics this process. The components self-assemble into a configuration in which an array of lipid bilayers aggregate on the surface of the carbon nanotube, creating a platform for the attachment of light-converting proteins. The system can disassemble upon the addition of a surfactant and reassemble upon its removal over an indefinite number of cycles. The assembly is thermodynamically metastable and can only transition reversibly if the rate of surfactant removal exceeds a threshold value. Only in the assembled state do the complexes exhibit photoelectrochemical activity. We demonstrate a regeneration cycle that uses surfactant to switch between assembled and disassembled states, resulting in an increased photoconversion efficiency of more than 300% over 168 hours and an indefinite extension of the system lifetime.",chemistry
A primary hydrogen-deuterium isotope effect observed at the single-molecule level.,"The covalent chemistry of reactants tethered within a single protein pore can be monitored by observing the time-dependence of ionic current flow through the pore, which responds to bond making and breaking in individual reactant molecules. Here we use this 'nanoreactor' approach to examine the reaction of a quinone with a thiol to form a substituted hydroquinone by reductive 1,4-Michael addition. Remarkably, a primary hydrogen-deuterium isotope effect is readily detected at the single-molecule level during prototropic rearrangement of an initial adduct. The observation of individual reaction intermediates allows the measurement of an isotope effect whether or not the step involved is rate limiting, which would not be the case in an ensemble measurement.",chemistry
Porous organic molecules.,"Most synthetic materials that show molecular-scale porosity consist of one-, two- or three-dimensional networks. Porous metal-organic frameworks in particular have attracted a lot of recent attention. By contrast, discrete molecules tend to pack efficiently in the solid state, leaving as little empty space as possible, which leads to non-porous materials. This Perspective discusses recent developments with discrete organic molecules that are porous in the solid state. Such molecules, which may be either crystalline or amorphous, can be categorized as either intrinsically porous (containing permanent covalent cavities) or extrinsically porous (inefficiently packed). We focus on the possible advantages of organic molecules over inorganic or hybrid systems in terms of molecular solubility, choice of components and functionalities, and structural mobility and responsiveness in non-covalent extended solids. We also highlight the potential for 'undiscovered' porous systems among the large number of cage-like organic molecules that are already known.",chemistry
Bridging-ligand-substitution strategy for the preparation of metal-organic polyhedra.,"Metal-organic polyhedra-discrete molecular architectures constructed through the coordination of metal ions and organic linkers-have recently attracted considerable attention due to their intriguing structures, their potential for a variety of applications and their relevance to biological self-assembly. Several synthetic routes have been investigated to prepare these complexes. However, to date, these preparative methods have typically been based on the direct assembly of metal ions and organic linkers. Although these routes are convenient, it remains difficult to find suitable reaction conditions or to control the outcome of the assembly process. Here, we demonstrate a synthetic strategy based on the substitution of bridging ligands in soluble metal-organic polyhedra. The introduction of linkers with different properties from those of the initial metal-organic polyhedra can thus lead to new metal-organic polyhedra with distinct properties (including size and shape). Furthermore, partial substitution can also occur and form mixed-ligand species that may be difficult to access by means of other approaches.",chemistry
"Synthesis of cortistatins A, J, K and L.","The cortistatins are a recently identified class of marine natural products characterized by an unusual steroidal skeleton, which have been found to inhibit differentially the proliferation of various mammalian cells in culture by an unknown mechanism. We describe a comprehensive route for the synthesis of cortistatins from a common precursor, which in turn is assembled from two fragments of similar structural complexity. Cortistatins A and J, and for the first time K and L, have been synthesized in parallel processes from like intermediates prepared from a single compound. With the identification of facile laboratory transformations linking intermediates in the cortistatin L synthetic series with corresponding intermediates to cortistatins A and J, we have been led to speculate that somewhat related paths might occur in nature, offering potential sequencing and chemical detail for cortistatin biosynthetic pathways.",chemistry
Enhanced electrocatalysis of the oxygen reduction reaction based on patterning of platinum surfaces with cyanide.,"The slow rate of the oxygen reduction reaction in the phosphoric acid fuel cell is the main factor limiting its wide application. Here, we present an approach that can be used for the rational design of cathode catalysts with potential use in phosphoric acid fuel cells, or in any environments containing strongly adsorbing tetrahedral anions. This approach is based on molecular patterning of platinum surfaces with cyanide adsorbates that can efficiently block the sites for adsorption of spectator anions while the oxygen reduction reaction proceeds unhindered. We also demonstrate that, depending on the supporting electrolyte anions and cations, on the same CN-covered Pt(111) surface, the oxygen reduction reaction activities can range from a 25-fold increase to a 50-fold decrease. This behaviour is discussed in the light of the role of covalent and non-covalent interactions in controlling the ensemble of platinum active sites required for high turn over rates of the oxygen reduction reaction.",chemistry
Highly stable tetrathiafulvalene radical dimers in [3]catenanes.,"Two [3]catenane 'molecular flasks' have been designed to create stabilized, redox-controlled tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) dimers, enabling their spectrophotometric and structural properties to be probed in detail. The mechanically interlocked framework of the [3]catenanes creates the ideal arrangement and ultrahigh local concentration for the encircled TTF units to form stable dimers associated with their discrete oxidation states. These dimerization events represent an affinity umpolung, wherein the inversion in electronic affinity replaces the traditional TTF-bipyridinium interaction, which is over-ridden by stabilizing mixed-valence (TTF)2*+ and radical-cation (TTF*+)2 states inside the 'molecular flasks.' The experimental data, collected in the solid state as well as in solution under ambient conditions, together with supporting quantum mechanical calculations, are consistent with the formation of stabilized paramagnetic mixed-valence dimers, and then diamagnetic radical-cation dimers following subsequent one-electron oxidations of the [3]catenanes.",chemistry
Synthesis of a stable adduct of dialane(4) (Al2H4) via hydrogenation of a magnesium(I) dimer.,"The desorption of dihydrogen from magnesium(II) hydride, MgH2 (containing 7.6 wt% H), is reversible. MgH2 therefore holds promise as a hydrogen storage material in devices powered by fuel cells. We believed that dimeric magnesium(I) dimers (LMgMgL, L=beta-diketiminate) could find use as soluble models to aid the study of the mechanisms and/or kinetics of the hydrogenation of magnesium and its alloys. Here, we show that LMgMgL can be readily hydrogenated to yield LMg(micro-H)2MgL by treatment with aluminium(III) hydride complexes. In one case, hydrogenation was reversed by treating LMg(micro-H)2MgL with potassium metal. The hydrogenation by-products are the first thermally stable, neutral aluminium(II) hydride complexes to be produced, one of which, [{(IPr)(H)2Al}2] (IPr=:C[{(C6H3-i-Pr(2)-2,6)NCH}2]), is an N-heterocyclic carbene adduct of the elusive parent dialane4 (Al2H4). A computational analysis of this compound is presented.",chemistry
Reconstitution of a fungal meroterpenoid biosynthesis reveals the involvement of a novel family of terpene cyclases.,"Meroterpenoids are hybrid natural products of both terpenoid and polyketide origin. We identified a biosynthetic gene cluster that is responsible for the production of the meroterpenoid pyripyropene in the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus through reconstituted biosynthesis of up to five steps in a heterologous fungal expression system. The cluster revealed a previously unknown terpene cyclase with an unusual sequence and protein primary structure. The wide occurrence of this sequence in other meroterpenoid and indole-diterpene biosynthetic gene clusters indicates the involvement of these enzymes in the biosynthesis of various terpenoid-bearing metabolites produced by fungi and bacteria. In addition, a novel polyketide synthase that incorporated nicotinyl-CoA as the starter unit and a prenyltransferase, similar to that in ubiquinone biosynthesis, was found to be involved in the pyripyropene biosynthesis. The successful production of a pyripyropene analogue illustrates the catalytic versatility of these enzymes for the production of novel analogues with useful biological activities.",chemistry
Charge transfer to solvent identified using dark channel fluorescence-yield L-edge spectroscopy.,"Aqueous ions are central to catalysis and biological function and play an important role in radiation biology as sources of damage-inducing electrons. Detailed knowledge of solute-solvent interactions is therefore crucial. For transition-metal ions, soft X-ray L-edge spectroscopy allows access to d orbitals, which are involved in chemical bonding. Using this technique, we show that the fluorescence-yield spectra of aqueous ionic species exhibit additional features compared with those of non-aqueous solvents. Some features dip below the fluorescence background of the solvent and this is rationalized by the competition between the fluorescence yields of the solute and solvent species, and between the solute radiative (fluorescence) and non-radiative channels; in particular, electron transfer to the water molecules. This method allows us to determine the nature, directionality and timescale of the electron transfer. Remarkably, we observe such features even for fully ligated metal atoms, which indicates a direct interaction with the water molecules.",chemistry
Kinetic resolution of constitutional isomers controlled by selective protection inside a supramolecular nanocapsule.,"The concept of self-assembling container molecules as yocto-litre reaction flasks is gaining prominence. However, the idea of using such containers as a means of protection is not well developed. Here, we illustrate this idea in the context of kinetic resolutions. Specifically, we report on the use of a water-soluble, deep-cavity cavitand to bring about kinetic resolutions within pairs of esters that otherwise cannot be resolved because they react at very similar rates. Resolution occurs because the presence of the cavitand leads to a competitive binding equilibrium in which the stronger binder primarily resides inside the host and the weaker binding ester primarily resides in the bulk hydrolytic medium. For the two families of ester examined, the observed kinetic resolutions were highest within the optimally fitting smaller esters.",chemistry
A series of isoreticular chiral metal-organic frameworks as a tunable platform for asymmetric catalysis.,"Metal-organic frameworks, built by bridging metal ions with organic linkers, represent a new class of porous hybrid materials with attractive tunability in compositions, structures and functions. In particular, the mild conditions typically employed for their synthesis allow for the functionalization of their building blocks, and thus the rational design of novel materials. Here we demonstrate the systematic design of eight mesoporous chiral metal-organic frameworks, with the framework formula [LCu2(solvent)2] (where L is a chiral tetracarboxylate ligand derived from 1,1'-bi-2-naphthol), that have the same structures but channels of different sizes. Chiral Lewis acid catalysts were generated by postsynthesis functionalization with Ti(OiPr)4, and the resulting materials proved to be highly active asymmetric catalysts for diethylzinc and alkynylzinc additions, which converted aromatic aldehydes into chiral secondary alcohols. The enantioselectivities of these reactions can be modified by tuning the size of the channels, which alters the diffusion rates of the organic substrates.",chemistry
A combinatorial approach to the identification of self-assembled ligands for rhodium-catalysed asymmetric hydrogenation.,"An effective and efficient means to catalyst discovery is the high-throughput screening of catalyst libraries. However, the current status of this approach suffers from a number of limitations, namely access to structurally diverse and meaningful ligand libraries and the enormous effort required for massive parallel screening of the resulting catalysts. We report an integrated solution to these drawbacks, which combines a diversity-oriented ligand synthesis, a catalyst-generation process driven by self-assembly and, finally, a combinatorial iterative library deconvolution strategy to identify the optimal catalyst. As a test case, rhodium-catalysed asymmetric hydrogenation was studied and, from a library of 120 self-assembling catalysts, highly enantioselective catalysts for the asymmetric hydrogenation of different olefinic substrates were identified within 17 experiments. Comparison of the results of the iterative library deconvolution strategy with those of the classic parallel-screening process confirmed the validity of this approach.",chemistry
Efficient water oxidation at carbon nanotube-polyoxometalate electrocatalytic interfaces.,"Water is the renewable, bulk chemical that nature uses to enable carbohydrate production from carbon dioxide. The dream goal of energy research is to transpose this incredibly efficient process and make an artificial device whereby the catalytic splitting of water is finalized to give a continuous production of oxygen and hydrogen. Success in this task would guarantee the generation of hydrogen as a carbon-free fuel to satisfy our energy demands at no environmental cost. Here we show that very efficient and stable nanostructured, oxygen-evolving anodes are obtained by the assembly of an oxygen-evolving polyoxometalate cluster (a totally inorganic ruthenium catalyst) with a conducting bed of multiwalled carbon nanotubes. Our bioinspired electrode addresses the one major challenge of artificial photosynthesis, namely efficient water oxidation, which brings us closer to being able to power the planet with carbon-free fuels.",chemistry
Organic structure determination using atomic-resolution scanning probe microscopy.,"Nature offers a huge and only partially explored variety of small molecules with potential pharmaceutical applications. Commonly used characterization methods for natural products include spectroscopic techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. In some cases, however, these techniques do not succeed in the unambiguous determination of the chemical structure of unknown compounds. To validate the usefulness of scanning probe microscopy as an adjunct to the other tools available for organic structure analysis, we used the natural product cephalandole A, which had previously been misassigned, and later corrected. Our results, corroborated by density functional theory, demonstrate that direct imaging of an organic compound with atomic-resolution force microscopy facilitates the accurate determination of its chemical structure. We anticipate that our method may be developed further towards molecular imaging with chemical sensitivity, and will become generally useful in solving certain classes of natural product structures.",chemistry
'Green' reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization.,"Reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization has revolutionized the field of polymer synthesis as a versatile tool for the production of complex polymeric architectures. As for all chemical processes, research and development in RAFT have to focus on the design and application of chemical products and processes that have a minimum environmental impact, and follow the principles of 'green' chemistry. In this Review, we summarize some of the green features of the RAFT process, and review the recent advances in the production of degradable polymers obtained from RAFT polymerization. Its use to modify biodegradable and renewable inorganic and organic materials to yield more functional products with enhanced applications is also covered. RAFT is a promising candidate for answering both the increasing need of modern society to employ highly functional polymeric materials and the global requirements for developing sustainable chemicals and processes.",chemistry
Behind platinum's sparkle.,"As a rare and precious metal that is also resistant to wear and tarnish, platinum is known to be particularly well-suited to jewellery. Vivian Yam reflects on how, beyond its prestigious image, platinum has also found its way into a variety of fields ranging from the petrochemical to the pharmaceutical industry.",chemistry
Two- and three-dimensional extended solids and metallization of compressed XeF2.,"The application of pressure, internal or external, transforms molecular solids into extended solids with more itinerant electrons to soften repulsive interatomic interactions in a tight space. Examples include insulator-to-metal transitions in O(2), Xe and I(2), as well as molecular-to-non-molecular transitions in CO(2) and N(2). Here, we present new discoveries of novel two- and three-dimensional extended non-molecular phases of solid XeF(2) and their metallization. At approximately 50 GPa, the transparent linear insulating XeF(2) transforms into a reddish two-dimensional graphite-like hexagonal layered structure of semiconducting XeF(4). Above 70 GPa, it further transforms into a black three-dimensional fluorite-like structure of the first observed metallic XeF(8) polyhedron. These simultaneously occurring molecular-to-non-molecular and insulator-to-metal transitions of XeF(2) arise from the pressure-induced delocalization of non-bonded lone-pair electrons to sp(3)d(2) hybridization in two-dimensional XeF(4) and to p(3)d(5) in three-dimensional XeF(8) through the chemical bonding of all eight valence electrons in Xe and, thereby, fulfilling the octet rule at high pressures.",chemistry
Networked molecular cages as crystalline sponges for fullerenes and other guests.,"Many molecular cages selectively bind guests in solution, but in the solid state close packing often prevents guest entry, which renders the cages inactive. We envisioned that coordination networks constructed from well-known molecular cages could transfer the richness of solution-state host-guest chemistry into the solid state. We report a crystalline coordination network generated from an infinite array of octahedral M(6)L(4) cage subunits (M = metal, L = ligand). This coordination network is a 'crystalline molecular sponge' engineered on the molecular level and retains similar guest recognition properties to those found in solution. The network crystallinity is robust and thus X-ray diffraction analysis can be used to unambiguously observe single-crystal to single-crystal guest inclusion. The void spaces define alternating M(12)L(8) and M(12)L(24) cuboctahedral molecular cages and these large cages absorb up to 35 weight per cent of C(60) or C(70) by simply soaking the crystals in a toluene solution of the fullerene. When the crystals are immersed in fullerene mixtures, C(70) is preferentially absorbed.",chemistry
A polyhedron made of tRNAs.,"Supramolecular assembly is a powerful strategy used by nature to build nanoscale architectures with predefined sizes and shapes. With synthetic systems, however, numerous challenges remain to be solved before precise control over the synthesis, folding and assembly of rationally designed three-dimensional nano-objects made of RNA can be achieved. Here, using the transfer RNA molecule as a structural building block, we report the design, efficient synthesis and structural characterization of stable, modular three-dimensional particles adopting the polyhedral geometry of a non-uniform square antiprism. The spatial control within the final architecture allows the precise positioning and encapsulation of proteins. This work demonstrates that a remarkable degree of structural control can be achieved with RNA structural motifs for the construction of thermostable three-dimensional nano-architectures that do not rely on helix bundles or tensegrity. RNA three-dimensional particles could potentially be used as carriers or scaffolds in nanomedicine and synthetic biology.",chemistry
Cooperative catalysis by carbenes and Lewis acids in a highly stereoselective route to gamma-lactams.,"Enzymes are a continuing source of inspiration for the design of new chemical reactions that proceed with efficiency, high selectivity and minimal waste. In many biochemical processes, different catalytic species, such as Lewis acids and bases, are involved in precisely orchestrated interactions to activate reactants simultaneously or sequentially. This type of 'cooperative catalysis', in which two or more catalytic cycles operate concurrently to achieve one overall transformation, has great potential in enhancing known reactivity and driving the development of new chemical reactions with high value. In this disclosure, a cooperative N-heterocyclic carbene/Lewis acid catalytic system promotes the addition of homoenolate equivalents to hydrazones, generating highly substituted gamma-lactams in moderate to good yields and with high levels of diastereo- and enantioselectivity.",chemistry
Raising the cycling stability of aqueous lithium-ion batteries by eliminating oxygen in the electrolyte.,"Aqueous lithium-ion batteries may solve the safety problem associated with lithium-ion batteries that use highly toxic and flammable organic solvents, and the poor cycling life associated with commercialized aqueous rechargeable batteries such as lead-acid and nickel-metal hydride systems. But all reported aqueous lithium-ion battery systems have shown poor stability: the capacity retention is typically less than 50% after 100 cycles. Here, the stability of electrode materials in an aqueous electrolyte was extensively analysed. The negative electrodes of aqueous lithium-ion batteries in a discharged state can react with water and oxygen, resulting in capacity fading upon cycling. By eliminating oxygen, adjusting the pH values of the electrolyte and using carbon-coated electrode materials, LiTi(2)(PO(4))(3)/Li(2)SO(4)/LiFePO(4) aqueous lithium-ion batteries exhibited excellent stability with capacity retention over 90% after 1,000 cycles when being fully charged/discharged in 10 minutes and 85% after 50 cycles even at a very low current rate of 8 hours for a full charge/discharge offering an energy storage system with high safety, low cost, long cycling life and appropriate energy density.",chemistry
Crystal structure of a metal ion-bound oxoiron(IV) complex and implications for biological electron transfer.,"Critical biological electron-transfer processes involving high-valent oxometal chemistry occur widely, for example in haem proteins [oxoiron(IV); Fe(IV)(O)] and in photosystem II. Photosystem II involves Ca(2+) as well as high-valent oxomanganese cluster species. However, there is no example of an interaction between metal ions and oxoiron(IV) complexes. Here, we report new findings concerning the binding of the redox-inactive metal ions Ca(2+) and Sc(3+) to a non-haem oxoiron(IV) complex, [(TMC)Fe(IV)(O)](2+) (TMC = 1,4,8,11-tetramethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane). As determined by X-ray diffraction analysis, an oxo-Sc(3+) interaction leads to a structural distortion of the oxoiron(IV) moiety. More importantly, this interaction facilitates a two-electron reduction by ferrocene, whereas only a one-electron reduction process occurs without the metal ions. This control of redox behaviour provides valuable mechanistic insights into oxometal redox chemistry, and suggests a possible key role that an auxiliary Lewis acid metal ion could play in nature, as in photosystem II.",chemistry
Triply interlocked covalent organic cages.,"Interlocked molecules comprise two or more separate components that are joined by 'mechanical' rather than covalent bonds. In other words, these molecular assemblies cannot be dissociated without the cleavage of one or more chemical bonds. Although recent progress has enabled the preparation of such topologies through coordination or templating interactions, three-dimensional interlocked covalent architectures remain difficult to prepare. Here, we present a template-free one-pot synthesis of triply interlocked organic cages. These 20-component dimers consist of two tetrahedral monomeric cages each built from four nodes and six linkers. The monomers exhibit axial chirality, which is recognized by their partner cage during the template-free interlocking assembly process. The dimeric cages also include two well-defined cavities per assembly, which for one of the systems studied led to the formation of a supramolecular host-guest chain. These interlocked organic molecules may prove useful as part of a toolkit for the modular construction of complex porous solids and other supramolecular assemblies.",chemistry
Electrically induced bonding of DNA to gold.,"The development of single-molecule techniques has afforded many new methods for the observation and assembly of supramolecular structures and biomolecular networks. We previously reported a method, known as the single-molecule cut-and-paste approach, to pick up and deposit individual DNA strands on a surface. This, however, required pre-functionalization of the surface with DNA strands complementary to those that were to be picked up and then deposited. Here we show that single molecules of double-stranded DNA, bound to the tip of an atomic force microscope, can be deposited on a bare gold electrode using an electrical trigger (surface potential cycling). The interactions between the DNA and the electrode were investigated and we found that double-stranded DNA chemisorbs to the gold electrode exclusively at its end through primary amine groups. We corroborated this finding in experiments in which only a single adenosine nucleotide on a polyethylene glycol spacer was 'electrosorbed' to the gold electrode.",chemistry
Molecules containing rare-earth atoms solely bonded by transition metals.,"Although metal-metal bonding is important in the chemistry of both solid-state intermetallic compounds and molecular species, the study of this bonding is limited by the compounds available and it is rarely possible to identify connections between these two areas. In this study, molecular intermetalloids [Ln(ReCp(2))(3)] (Ln = Sm, Lu and La) have been synthesized that contain lanthanoid metals bound only to transition metals. Although they are highly reactive species, such lanthanoid-core transition-metal-shell compounds can be stable in solution. They mimic the bonding situation of intermetallic compounds, as revealed by a direct comparison of molecular and solid state lanthanoid-transition metal bonding.",chemistry
Highly enantioselective synthesis and cellular evaluation of spirooxindoles inspired by natural products.,"In biology-oriented synthesis the underlying scaffold classes of natural products selected in evolution are used to define biologically relevant starting points in chemical structure space for the synthesis of compound collections with focused structural diversity. Here we describe a highly enantioselective synthesis of natural-product-inspired 3,3'-pyrrolidinyl spirooxindoles--which contain an all-carbon quaternary centre and three tertiary stereocentres. This synthesis takes place by means of an asymmetric Lewis acid-catalysed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of an azomethine ylide to a substituted 3-methylene-2-oxindole using 1-3 mol% of a chiral catalyst formed from a N,P-ferrocenyl ligand and CuPF(6)(CH(3)CN)(4). Cellular evaluation has identified a molecule that arrests mitosis, induces multiple microtubule organizing centres and multipolar spindles, causes chromosome congression defects during mitosis and inhibits tubulin regrowth in cells. Our findings support the concept that compound collections based on natural-product-inspired scaffolds constructed with complex stereochemistry will be a rich source of compounds with diverse bioactivity.",chemistry
The role of steps in surface catalysis and reaction oscillations.,"Atomic steps at the surface of a catalyst play an important role in heterogeneous catalysis, for example as special sites with increased catalytic activity. Exposure to reactants can cause entirely new structures to form at the catalyst surface, and these may dramatically influence the reaction by 'poisoning' it or by acting as the catalytically active phase. For example, thin metal oxide films have been identified as highly active structures that form spontaneously on metal surfaces during the catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide. Here, we present operando X-ray diffraction experiments on a palladium surface during this reaction. They reveal that a high density of steps strongly alters the stability of the thin, catalytically active palladium oxide film. We show that stabilization of the metal, caused by the steps and consequent destabilization of the oxide, is at the heart of the well-known reaction rate oscillations exhibited during CO oxidation at atmospheric pressure.",chemistry
Uranium azide photolysis results in C-H bond activation and provides evidence for a terminal uranium nitride.,"Uranium nitride [U[triple bond]N](x) is an alternative nuclear fuel that has great potential in the expanding future of nuclear power; however, very little is known about the U[triple bond]N functionality. We show, for the first time, that a terminal uranium nitride complex can be generated by photolysis of an azide (U-N=N=N) precursor. The transient U[triple bond]N fragment is reactive and undergoes insertion into a ligand C-H bond to generate new N-H and N-C bonds. The mechanism of this unprecedented reaction has been evaluated through computational and spectroscopic studies, which reveal that the photochemical azide activation pathway can be shut down through coordination of the terminal azide ligand to the Lewis acid B(C(6)F(5))(3). These studies demonstrate that photochemistry can be a powerful tool for inducing redox transformations for organometallic actinide complexes, and that the terminal uranium nitride fragment is reactive, cleaving strong C-H bonds.",chemistry
Heterogeneous oxidation of atmospheric aerosol particles by gas-phase radicals.,"Atmospheric aerosol particles play pivotal roles in climate and air quality. Just as chemically reduced gases experience oxidation in the atmosphere, it is now apparent that solid and liquid atmospheric particulates are also subject to similar oxidative processes. The most reactive atmospheric gas-phase radicals, in particular the hydroxyl radical, readily promote such chemistry through surficial interactions. This Review looks at progress made in this field, discussing the radical-initiated heterogeneous oxidation of organic and inorganic constituents of atmospheric aerosols. We focus on the kinetics and reaction mechanisms of such processes as well as how they can affect the physico-chemical properties of particles, such as their composition, size, density and hygroscopicity. Potential impacts on the atmosphere include the release of chemically reactive gases such as halogens, aldehydes and organic acids, reactive loss of particle-borne molecular tracer and toxic species, and enhanced hygroscopic properties of aerosols that may improve their ability to form cloud droplets.",chemistry
Uncertainty in chemistry.,"It might come as a disappointment to some chemists, but just as there are uncertainties in physics and mathematics, there are some chemistry questions we may never know the answer to either, suggests Fredric M. Menger.",chemistry

"Geometric and electronic structure and reactivity of a mononuclear ""side-on"" nickel(III)-peroxo complex.","Metal-dioxygen adducts, such as metal-superoxo and -peroxo species, are key intermediates often detected in the catalytic cycles of dioxygen activation by metalloenzymes and biomimetic compounds. The synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of an end-on nickel(II)-superoxo complex with a 14-membered macrocyclic ligand was reported previously. Here we report the isolation, spectroscopic characterization, and high-resolution crystal structure of a mononuclear side-on nickel(III)-peroxo complex with a 12-membered macrocyclic ligand, [Ni(12-TMC)(O(2))](+) (1) (12-TMC = 1,4,7,10-tetramethyl-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane). Different from the end-on Ni(II)-superoxo complex, the Ni(III)-peroxo complex is not reactive in electrophilic reactions, but is capable of conducting nucleophilic reactions. The Ni(III)-peroxo complex transfers the bound dioxygen to manganese(II) complexes, thus affording the corresponding nickel(II) and manganese(III)-peroxo complexes. The present results demonstrate the significance of supporting ligands in tuning the geometric and electronic structures and reactivities of metal-O(2) intermediates that have been shown to have biological as well as synthetic usefulness in biomimetic reactions.",chemistry
Amyloid-beta protein oligomerization and the importance of tetramers and dodecamers in the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease.,"In recent years, small protein oligomers have been implicated in the aetiology of a number of important amyloid diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. As a consequence, research efforts are being directed away from traditional targets, such as amyloid plaques, and towards characterization of early oligomer states. Here we present a new analysis method, ion mobility coupled with mass spectrometry, for this challenging problem, which allows determination of in vitro oligomer distributions and the qualitative structure of each of the aggregates. We applied these methods to a number of the amyloid-beta protein isoforms of Abeta40 and Abeta42 and showed that their oligomer-size distributions are very different. Our results are consistent with previous observations that Abeta40 and Abeta42 self-assemble via different pathways and provide a candidate in the Abeta42 dodecamer for the primary toxic species in Alzheimer's disease.",chemistry
A palladium-catalysed enolate alkylation cascade for the formation of adjacent quaternary and tertiary stereocentres.,"The catalytic enantioselective synthesis of densely functionalised organic molecules containing all-carbon quaternary stereocentres is a challenge to modern chemical methodology research. The catalytically controlled asymmetric alpha-alkylation of ketones represents another difficult task and has been of major interest to our and other research groups in the past. We now report a palladium-catalyzed enantioselective process that addresses both problems at once and allows the installation of vicinal all-carbon quaternary and tertiary stereocentres at the alpha-carbon of a ketone in a single step. This multiple bond forming process is carried out on readily available beta-ketoester starting materials and proceeds via conjugate addition of an in situ-generated palladium enolate to activated Michael acceptors. In other words, the CO(2)-moiety of the substrate is displaced by a C-C fragment in an asymmetric cut-and-paste reaction. The products are obtained in high yield, diastereomeric ratio, and enantiomeric excess.",chemistry
Photoreactivity examined through incorporation in metal-organic frameworks.,"Metal-organic frameworks, typically built by bridging metal centres with organic linkers, have recently shown great promise for a wide variety of applications, including gas separation and drug delivery. Here, we have used them as a scaffold to probe the photophysical and photochemical properties of metal-diimine complexes. We have immobilized a M(diimine)(CO)(3)X moiety (where M is Re or Mn, and X can be Cl or Br) by using it as the linker of a metal-organic framework, with Mn(II) cations acting as nodes. Time-resolved infrared measurements showed that the initial excited state formed on ultraviolet irradiation of the rhenium-based metal-organic framework was characteristic of an intra-ligand state, rather than the metal-ligand charge transfer state typically observed in solution, and revealed that the metal-diimine complexes rearranged from the fac- to mer-isomer in the crystalline solid state. This approach also enabled characterization of the photoactivity of Mn(diimine)(CO)(3)Br by single-crystal X-ray diffraction.",chemistry
Cascading transformations within a dynamic self-assembled system.,"Molecular subcomponents such as phosphate groups are often passed between biomolecules during complex signalling cascades, the flow of which define the motion of the machinery of life. Here, we show how an abiological system consisting of organic subcomponents knitted together by metal-ion coordination can respond to simple signals in complex ways. A Cu(I)(3) helicate transformed into its Zn(II)(2)Cu(I) analogue following the addition of zinc(II), and the ejected copper(I) went on to induce the self-assembly of a Cu(I)(2) helicate from other free subcomponents present in solution. The addition of an additional subcomponent, 8-aminoquinoline, resulted in the formation of a third, more stable Cu(I)(3) helicate, requiring the destruction of both the Zn(II)(2)Cu(I) and Cu(I)(2) helicates to scavenge sufficient Cu(I) for the new structure. This system thus demonstrates two examples in which the application of one signal provokes two distinct responses involving the creation or destruction of complex assemblies as the system seeks thermodynamic equilibrium following perturbation.",chemistry
A layered ionic crystal of polar Li@C(60) superatoms.,"If the physical properties of C(60) fullerene molecules can be controlled in C(60) products already in use in various applications, the potential for industrial development will be significant. Encapsulation of a metal atom in the C(60) fullerene molecule is a promising way to control its physical properties. However, the isolation of C(60)-based metallofullerenes has been difficult due to their insolubility. Here, we report the complete isolation and determination of the molecular and crystal structure of polar cationic Li@C(60) metallofullerene. The physical and chemical properties of Li@C(60) cation are compared with those of pristine C(60). It is found that the lithium cation is located at off-centre positions in the C(60)-I(h) cage interior and that the [Li(+)@C(60)] salt has a unique two-dimensional structure. The present method of purification and crystallization of C(60)-based metallofullerenes provides a new C(60) fullerene material that contains a metal atom.",chemistry
Lewis acid-catalysed formation of two-dimensional phthalocyanine covalent organic frameworks.,"Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer a new strategy for assembling organic semiconductors into robust networks with atomic precision and long-range order. General methods for COF synthesis will allow complex building blocks to be incorporated into these emerging materials. Here we report a new Lewis acid-catalysed protocol to form boronate esters directly from protected catechols and arylboronic acids. This transformation also provides crystalline boronate ester-linked COFs from protected polyfunctional catechols and bis(boronic acids). Using this method, we prepared a new COF that features a square lattice composed of phthalocyanine macrocycles joined by phenylene bis(boronic acid) linkers. The phthalocyanines stack in an eclipsed fashion within the COF to form 2.3 nm pores that run parallel to the stacked chromophores. The material's broad absorbance over the solar spectrum, potential for efficient charge transport through the stacked phthalocyanines, good thermal stability and the modular nature of COF synthesis, show strong promise for applications in organic photovoltaic devices.",chemistry
Computational evidence that hyperconjugative interactions are not responsible for the anomeric effect.,"The 'anomeric effect' is the thermodynamic preference for polar substituents to occupy the axial position in the chair conformation of various heterocycles. The most common explanation given for this effect at present is hyperconjugation from the lone pairs on the ring heteroatom to the antibonding orbital between the anomeric carbon and its linking substituent. Alternatively, the anomeric effect could be explained by intramolecular electrostatic interactions between local dipoles. Few models can provide convincing data for either theory at the quantum-mechanical level. Now, using the extended block-localized wavefunction method, which is the simplest form of valence bond theory, we have evaluated the degree of hyperconjugation in various compounds that display the anomeric effect and have interpreted their conformational preferences in terms of steric, hyperconjugation and dispersion effects. The results provide strong evidence that hyperconjugative interactions are not responsible for the anomeric effect and that it is better interpreted in terms of electrostatic interactions.",chemistry
Etching and narrowing of graphene from the edges.,"Large-scale graphene electronics requires lithographic patterning of narrow graphene nanoribbons for device integration. However, conventional lithography can only reliably pattern approximately 20-nm-wide GNR arrays limited by lithography resolution, while sub-5-nm GNRs are desirable for high on/off ratio field-effect transistors at room temperature. Here, we devised a gas phase chemical approach to etch graphene from the edges without damaging its basal plane. The reaction involved high temperature oxidation of graphene in a slightly reducing environment in the presence of ammonia to afford controlled etch rate (less than or approximately 1 nm min(-1)). We fabricated approximately 20-30-nm-wide graphene nanoribbon arrays lithographically, and used the gas phase etching chemistry to narrow the ribbons down to <10 nm. For the first time, a high on/off ratio up to approximately 10(4) was achieved at room temperature for field-effect transistors built with sub-5-nm-wide graphene nanoribbon semiconductors derived from lithographic patterning and narrowing. Our controlled etching method opens up a chemical way to control the size of various graphene nano-structures beyond the capability of top-down lithography.",chemistry
Sequence-selective assembly of tweezer molecules on linear templates enables frameshift-reading of sequence information.,"Information storage and processing is carried out at the level of individual macromolecules in biological systems, but there is no reason, in principle, why synthetic copolymers should not be used for the same purpose. Previous work has suggested that monomer sequence information in chain-folding synthetic copolyimides can be recognized by tweezer-type molecules binding to adjacent triplet sequences, and we show here that different tweezer molecules can show different sequence selectivities. This work, based on (1)H NMR spectroscopy in solution and on single-crystal X-ray analysis of tweezer-oligomer complexes in the solid state, provides the first clear-cut demonstration of polyimide chain-folding and adjacent-tweezer binding. It also reveals a new and entirely unexpected mechanism for sequence recognition, which, by analogy with a related process in biomolecular information processing, may be termed 'frameshift-reading'. The ability of one particular tweezer molecule to detect, with exceptionally high sensitivity, long-range sequence information in chain-folding aromatic copolyimides is readily explained by this novel process.",chemistry
Singlet fission in pentacene through multi-exciton quantum states.,"Multi-exciton generation-the creation of multiple charge carrier pairs from a single photon-has been reported for several materials and may dramatically increase solar cell efficiency. Singlet fission, its molecular analogue, may govern multi-exciton generation in a variety of materials, but a fundamental mechanism for singlet fission has yet to be described. Here, we use sophisticated ab initio calculations to show that singlet fission in pentacene proceeds through rapid internal conversion of the photoexcited state into a dark state of multi-exciton character that efficiently splits into two triplets. We show that singlet fission to produce a pair of triplet excitons must involve an intermediate state that (i) has a multi-exciton character, (ii) is energetically accessible from the optically allowed excited state, and (iii) efficiently dissociates into multiple electron-hole pairs. The rational design of photovoltaic materials that make use of singlet fission will require similar ab initio analysis of multi-exciton states such as the dark state studied here.",chemistry
Isolation of a radical dianion of nitrogen oxide (NO)(2-).,"Nitric oxide, NO, the diatomic hybrid of dinitrogen and dioxygen, has extensive biochemical, industrial and atmospheric chemistry. The unpaired electron on NO makes it highly reactive and its facile oxidation and reduction to make (NO)(1+) and (NO)(1-), respectively, have been heavily studied. Now the (NO)(2-) dianion has been isolated for the first time from the two-electron reduction of NO by the recently discovered (N(2))(3-) yttrium complex {[(Me(3)Si)(2)N](2)(THF)Y}(2)(micro(3)-eta(2):eta(2):eta(2)-N(2))K. NO reacts with this complex to form {[(Me(3)Si)(2)N](2)(THF)Y}(2)(micro-eta(2):eta(2)-NO), a paramagnetic complex that has an electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum definitive for the (NO)(2-) radical. Density functional theory reveals that a metal d(pi) to ligand pi* interaction is crucial for the stability of this complex, which reacts with additional NO to generate the diamagnetic (ON=NO)(2-) product, {[(Me(3)Si)(2)N](2)Y}(4)(micro(3)-ON=NO)(2)(THF)(2).",chemistry
Convergent and stereospecific synthesis of complex skipped polyenes and polyunsaturated fatty acids.,"Skipped polyenes (that is, 1,4-dienes and higher homologues) are stereodefined components of a vast array of biologically important natural products, including polyunsaturated fatty acids. Although widespread in nature, these architectures are generally considered to represent significant barriers to efficient chemical synthesis. Partial reduction of skipped poly-ynes provides a pathway to a subset of such structures, but general chemical methods for the preparation of skipped polyenes that contain varied stereochemistries and substitution patterns are lacking. Here, we describe a metal-promoted reductive cross-coupling reaction between vinylcyclopropanes and alkynes (or vinylsilanes) that provides stereoselective access to a diverse array of skipped polyenes through a process that establishes one C-C bond, generates up to three stereodefined alkenes, and can be used to introduce stereogenic centres at the central positions of the skipped polyene motif. We also demonstrate the significance of the present bond construction by preparing substituted and stereodefined polyunsaturated synthetic fatty acids.",chemistry
Selective sorption of oxygen and nitric oxide by an electron-donating flexible porous coordination polymer.,"Porous coordination polymers are materials formed from metal ions that are bridged together by organic linkers and that can combine two seemingly contradictory properties-crystallinity and flexibility. Porous coordination polymers can therefore create highly regular yet dynamic nanoporous domains that are particularly promising for sorption applications. Here, we describe the effective selective sorption of dioxygen and nitric oxide by a structurally and electronically dynamic porous coordination polymer built from zinc centres and tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) as a linker. In contrast to a variety of other gas molecules (C(2)H(2), Ar, CO(2), N(2) and CO), O(2) and NO are accommodated in its pores. This unprecedented preference arises from the concerted effect of the charge-transfer interaction between TCNQ and these guests, and the switchable gate opening and closing of the pores of the framework. This system provides further insight into the efficient recognition of small gas molecules.",chemistry
Experimental probing of conical intersection dynamics in the photodissociation of thioanisole.,"Chemical reactions that occur in the ground electronic state are described well by invoking the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, which allows their development to be rationalized by nuclear rearrangements that smoothly traverse an adiabatic potential energy surface. The situation is different, however, for reactions in electronically excited states, where non-adiabatic transitions occur between adiabatic surfaces. The conical intersection, in which two adiabatic surfaces touch, is accepted widely as the dynamic funnel for efficient non-adiabatic transitions, but its direct experimental probing is rare. Here, we investigate the photodissociation of thioanisole and observe a striking dependence of the relative yields of two reaction channels on the photoexcitation energy as indicated by a dynamic resonance in the product branching ratio. This results from the interference of two different adiabatic states that are in close proximity in the region of a conical intersection. The location of the observed resonance on the multidimensional potential energy surface thus reveals the nuclear configuration of the conical intersection and its dynamic role in the non-adiabatic transition.",chemistry
Reversible dioxygen binding in solvent-free liquid myoglobin.,"The ensemble of forces that stabilize protein structure and facilitate biological function are intimately linked with the ubiquitous aqueous environment of living systems. As a consequence, biomolecular activity is highly sensitive to the interplay of solvent-protein interactions, and deviation from the native conditions, for example by exposure to increased thermal energy or severe dehydration, results in denaturation and subsequent loss of function. Although certain enzymes can be extracted into non-aqueous solvents without significant loss of activity, there are no known examples of solvent-less (molten) liquids of functional metalloproteins. Here we describe the synthesis and properties of room-temperature solvent-free myoglobin liquids with near-native structure and reversible dioxygen binding ability equivalent to the haem protein under physiological conditions. The realization of room-temperature solvent-free myoglobin liquids with retained function presents novel challenges to existing theories on the role of solvent molecules in structural biology, and should offer new opportunities in protein-based nanoscience and bionanotechnology.",chemistry
Supramolecular catalysis beyond enzyme mimics.,"Supramolecular catalysis - the assembly of catalyst species by harnessing multiple weak intramolecular interactions - has, until recently, been dominated by enzyme-inspired approaches. Such approaches often attempt to create an enzyme-like 'active site' and have concentrated on reactions similar to those catalysed by enzymes themselves. Here, we discuss the application of supramolecular assembly to the more traditional transition metal catalysis and to small-molecule organocatalysis. The modularity of self-assembled multicomponent catalysts means that a relatively small pool of catalyst components can provide rapid access to a large number of catalysts that can be evaluated for industrially relevant reactions. In addition, we discuss how catalyst-substrate interactions can be tailored to direct substrates along particular reaction paths and selectivities.",chemistry
Watching conformational- and photo-dynamics of single fluorescent proteins in solution.,"Observing the dynamics of single biomolecules over prolonged time periods is difficult to achieve without significantly altering the molecule through immobilization. It can, however, be accomplished using the Anti-Brownian ELectrokinetic (ABEL) Trap, which allows extended investigation of solution-phase biomolecules - without immobilization -through real-time electrokinetic feedback. Here we apply the ABEL trap to study an important photosynthetic antenna protein, Allophycocyanin (APC). The technique allows the observation of single molecules of solution-phase APC for more than one second. We observe a complex relationship between fluorescence intensity and lifetime that cannot be explained by simple static kinetic models. Light-induced conformational changes are shown to occur and evidence is obtained for fluctuations in the spontaneous emission lifetime, which is typically assumed to be constant. Our methods provide a new window into the dynamics of fluorescent proteins and the observations are relevant for the interpretation of in vivo single-molecule imaging experiments, bacterial photosynthetic regulation, and biomaterials for solar energy harvesting.",chemistry
"Hydroacylation of alpha,beta-unsaturated esters via aerobic C-H activation.","The development of methods for carbon-carbon bond formation under benign conditions is an ongoing challenge for the synthetic chemist. In recent years there has been considerable interest in using selective C-H activation as a direct route for generating reactive intermediates. In this article, we describe the use of aldehyde auto-oxidation as a simple, clean and effective method for C-H activation, resulting in the generation of an acyl radical. This acyl radical can be used for carbon-carbon bond formation and herein we describe the application of this method for the hydroacylation of alpha,beta-unsaturated esters without the requirement of additional catalysts or reagents. This methodology generates unsymmetrical ketones, which have been shown to have broad use in organic synthesis.",chemistry
Cleave and capture chemistry illustrated through bimetallic-induced fragmentation of tetrahydrofuran.,"The cleavage of ethers is commonly encountered in organometallic chemistry, although rarely studied in the context of new, emerging bimetallic reagents. Recently, it was reported that a bimetallic sodium-zinc base can deprotonate cyclic tetrahydrofuran under mild conditions without opening its heterocyclic (OC(4)) ring. In marked contrast to this synergic sedation, herein we show that switching to the more reactive sodium-magnesium or sodium-manganese bases promotes cleavage of at least six bonds in tetrahydrofuran, but uniquely the ring fragments are captured in separate crystalline complexes. Oxide fragments occupy guest positions in bimetallic, inverse crown ethers and C(4) fragments ultimately appear in bimetallated butadiene molecules. These results demonstrate the special synergic reactivity that can be executed by bimetallic reagents, which include the ability to capture and control, and thereby study, reactive fragments from sensitive substrates.",chemistry
Structural evolution during the reduction of chemically derived graphene oxide.,"The excellent electrical, optical and mechanical properties of graphene have driven the search to find methods for its large-scale production, but established procedures (such as mechanical exfoliation or chemical vapour deposition) are not ideal for the manufacture of processable graphene sheets. An alternative method is the reduction of graphene oxide, a material that shares the same atomically thin structural framework as graphene, but bears oxygen-containing functional groups. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations to study the atomistic structure of progressively reduced graphene oxide. The chemical changes of oxygen-containing functional groups on the annealing of graphene oxide are elucidated and the simulations reveal the formation of highly stable carbonyl and ether groups that hinder its complete reduction to graphene. The calculations are supported by infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. Finally, more effective reduction treatments to improve the reduction of graphene oxide are proposed.",chemistry
From silicon(II)-based dioxygen activation to adducts of elusive dioxasiliranes and sila-ureas stable at room temperature.,"Dioxygen activation for the subsequent oxygenation of organic substrates that involves cheap and environmentally friendly chemical elements is at the cutting edge of chemical research. As silicon is a non-toxic and highly oxophilic element, the use of silylenes could be attractive for facile dioxygen activation to give dioxasiliranes with a SiO(2)-peroxo ring as versatile oxo-transfer reagents. However, the latter are elusive species, and have been generated and studied only in argon matrices at -233 degrees C. Recently, it was demonstrated that unstable silicon species can be isolated by applying the concept of donor-acceptor stabilization. We now report the first synthesis and crystallographic characterization of dioxasiliranes stabilized by N-heterocyclic carbenes that feature a three-membered SiO(2)-peroxide ring, isolable at room temperature. Unexpectedly, these can undergo internal oxygen transfer in toluene solution at ambient temperature to give a unique complex of cyclic sila-urea with C=O --> Si=O interaction and the shortest Si=O double-bond distance reported to date.",chemistry
Mechanistic insights into the ruthenium-catalysed diene ring-closing metathesis reaction.,"Ruthenium-catalysed ring-closing metathesis (RCM) is a powerful technique for the preparation of medium-to-large rings in organic synthesis, but the details of the intimate mechanism are obscure. The dynamic behaviour of an RCM-relevant ruthenacyclobutane complex and its reactivity with ethene were studied using low-temperature NMR spectroscopy to illuminate the mechanism of this widely used reaction. These kinetic and thermodynamic experiments allowed for mapping the energy surface of the key steps in the RCM reaction as mediated by Grubbs-type catalysts for alkene metathesis. The highest barrier along the RCM path is only 65 kJ mol(-1), which shows that this catalyst has extremely high inherent activity. Furthermore, this transition state corresponds to that connecting the intermediates in this reaction leading to ring opening of the cyclopentene product. This shows that ring closing is kinetically slightly favoured over ring opening, in addition to being driven by the loss of ethene.",chemistry
Monodisperse cylindrical micelles by crystallization-driven living self-assembly.,"Non-spherical nanostructures derived from soft matter and with uniform size-that is, monodisperse materials-are of particular utility and interest, but are very rare outside the biological domain. We report the controlled formation of highly monodisperse cylindrical block copolymer micelles (length dispersity < or = 1.03; length range, approximately 200 nm to 2 microm) by the use of very small (approximately 20 nm) uniform crystallite seeds that serve as initiators for the crystallization-driven living self-assembly of added block-copolymer unimers with a crystallizable, core-forming metalloblock. This process is analogous to the use of small initiator molecules in classical living polymerization reactions. The length of the nanocylinders could be precisely controlled by variation of the unimer-to-crystallite seed ratio. Samples of the highly monodisperse nanocylinders of different lengths that are accessible using this approach have been shown to exhibit distinct liquid-crystalline alignment behaviour.",chemistry
Triggering N(2) uptake via redox-induced expulsion of coordinated NH(3) and N(2) silylation at trigonal bipyramidal iron.,"The biological reduction of N(2) to give NH(3) may occur by one of two predominant pathways in which nitrogenous N(x)H(y) intermediates, including hydrazine (N(2)H(4)), diazene (N(2)H(2)), nitride (N(3-)) and imide (NH(2-)), may be involved. To test the validity of hypotheses on iron's direct role in the stepwise reduction of N(2), model systems for iron are needed. Such systems can test the chemical compatibility of iron with various proposed N(x)H(y) intermediates and the reactivity patterns of such species. Here we describe a trigonal bipyramidal Si(o-C(6)H(4)PR(2))(3)Fe-L scaffold (R = Ph or i-Pr) in which the apical site is occupied by nitrogenous ligands such as N(2), N(2)H(4), NH(3) and N(2)R. The system accommodates terminally bound N(2) in the three formal oxidation states (iron(0), +1 and +2). N(2) uptake is demonstrated by the displacement of its reduction partners NH(3) and N(2)H(4), and N(2) functionalizaton is illustrated by electrophilic silylation.",chemistry
"Chiral-auxiliary-mediated 1,2-cis-glycosylations for the solid-supported synthesis of a biologically important branched alpha-glucan.","Solid-phase oligosaccharide synthesis offers the promise of providing libraries of oligosaccharides for glycomics research. A major stumbling block to solid-phase oligosaccharide synthesis has been a lack of general methods for the stereoselective installation of 1,2-cis-glycosides, and intractable mixtures of compounds are obtained if several such glycosides need to be installed. We have prepared on-resin a biologically important glucoside containing multiple 1,2-cis-glycosidic linkages with complete anomeric control by using glycosyl donors having a participating (S)-(phenylthiomethyl)benzyl chiral auxiliary at C2. A branching point could be installed by using 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) and allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc) as a versatile set of orthogonal protecting groups. The synthetic strategy made it possible to achieve partial on-resin deprotection of the completed oligosaccharide, thereby increasing the overall efficiency of the synthesis. The combination of classical and auxiliary-mediated neighbouring-group participation for controlling anomeric selectivity is bringing the promise of routine automated solid-supported oligosaccharide synthesis closer.",chemistry
Enantioselective iron-catalysed O-H bond insertions.,"The ready availability, low price and environmentally benign character of iron mean that it is an ideal alternative to precious metals in catalysis. Recent growth in the number of iron-catalysed reactions reported reflects an increasing demand for sustainable chemistry. Only a limited number of chiral iron catalysts have been reported and these have, in general, proven less enantioselective than other transition-metal catalysts, thus limiting their appeal. Here, we report that iron complexes of spiro-bisoxazoline ligands are highly efficient catalysts for asymmetric O-H bond insertion reactions. These complexes catalyse insertions into the O-H bond of a wide variety of alcohols and even water, with exceptional enantioselectivities under mild reaction conditions. The selectivities surpass those obtained with other transition-metal catalysts. This study should inspire and encourage the use of iron instead of traditional precious metals in the development of greener catalysts for catalytic asymmetric synthesis.",chemistry
Synthesis of a metal oxide with a room-temperature photoreversible phase transition.,"Photoinduced phase-transition materials, such as chalcogenides, spin-crossover complexes, photochromic organic compounds and charge-transfer materials, are of interest because of their application to optical data storage. Here we report a photoreversible metal-semiconductor phase transition at room temperature with a unique phase of Ti(3)O(5), lambda-Ti(3)O(5). lambda-Ti(3)O(5) nanocrystals are made by the combination of reverse-micelle and sol-gel techniques. Thermodynamic analysis suggests that the photoinduced phase transition originates from a particular state of lambda-Ti(3)O(5) trapped at a thermodynamic local energy minimum. Light irradiation causes reversible switching between this trapped state (lambda-Ti(3)O(5)) and the other energy-minimum state (beta-Ti(3)O(5)), both of which are persistent phases. This is the first demonstration of a photorewritable phenomenon at room temperature in a metal oxide. lambda-Ti(3)O(5) satisfies the operation conditions required for a practical optical storage system (operational temperature, writing data by short wavelength light and the appropriate threshold laser power).",chemistry
Experimental evidence for the functional relevance of anion-pi interactions.,"Attractive in theory and confirmed to exist, anion-pi interactions have never really been seen at work. To catch them in action, we prepared a collection of monomeric, cyclic and rod-shaped naphthalenediimide transporters. Their ability to exert anion-pi interactions was demonstrated by electrospray tandem mass spectrometry in combination with theoretical calculations. To relate this structural evidence to transport activity in bilayer membranes, affinity and selectivity sequences were recorded. pi-acidification and active-site decrowding increased binding, transport and chloride > bromide > iodide selectivity, and supramolecular organization inverted acetate > nitrate to nitrate > acetate selectivity. We conclude that anion-pi interactions on monomeric surfaces are ideal for chloride recognition, whereas their supramolecular enhancement by pi,pi-interactions appears perfect to target nitrate. Chloride transporters are relevant to treat channelopathies, and nitrate sensors to monitor cellular signaling and cardiovascular diseases. A big impact on organocatalysis can be expected from the stabilization of anionic transition states on chiral pi-acidic surfaces.",chemistry
Visible light photocatalysis as a greener approach to photochemical synthesis.,"Light can be considered an ideal reagent for environmentally friendly, 'green' chemical synthesis; unlike many conventional reagents, light is non-toxic, generates no waste, and can be obtained from renewable sources. Nevertheless, the need for high-energy ultraviolet radiation in most organic photochemical processes has limited both the practicality and environmental benefits of photochemical synthesis on industrially relevant scales. This perspective describes recent approaches to the use of metal polypyridyl photocatalysts in synthetic organic transformations. Given the remarkable photophysical properties of these complexes, these new transformations, which use Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and related photocatalysts, can be conducted using almost any source of visible light, including both store-bought fluorescent light bulbs and ambient sunlight. Transition metal photocatalysis thus represents a promising strategy towards the development of practical, scalable industrial processes with great environmental benefits.",chemistry
Enhancement of anhydrous proton transport by supramolecular nanochannels in comb polymers.,"Transporting protons is essential in several biological processes as well as in renewable energy devices, such as fuel cells. Although biological systems exhibit precise supramolecular organization of chemical functionalities on the nanoscale to effect highly efficient proton conduction, to achieve similar organization in artificial systems remains a daunting challenge. Here, we are concerned with transporting protons on a micron scale under anhydrous conditions, that is proton transfer unassisted by any solvent, especially water. We report that proton-conducting systems derived from facially amphiphilic polymers that exhibit organized supramolecular assemblies show a dramatic enhancement in anhydrous conductivity relative to analogous materials that lack the capacity for self-organization. We describe the design, synthesis and characterization of these macromolecules, and suggest that nanoscale organization of proton-conducting functionalities is a key consideration in obtaining efficient anhydrous proton transport.",chemistry
Electrochemistry through glass.,"In this Article we have used new approaches to investigate a well-known chemical process, the propagation of electrochemical signals through a thin glass membrane. This process, which has been extensively studied over the last century, is the basis of the response of a potentiometric glass pH sensor; however, no amperometric glass sensors have yet been reported because of its high ohmic resistance. Voltammetry at nanoelectrodes has revealed that water molecules can diffuse through nanometre-thick layers of dry glass and undergo oxidation/reduction at the buried platinum surface. After soaking for a few hours in an aqueous solution, voltammetric waves of other redox couples, such as Ru(NH(3))(6)(3+/2+), could also be obtained at the glass-covered platinum nanoelectrodes. This behaviour suggests that the nanometre-thick insulating glass sheath surrounding the platinum core can be largely converted to hydrated gel, and electrochemical processes occur at the platinum/hydrogel interface. Potential applications range from use in nanometre-sized solid-state pH probes and determination of the water content in organic solvents to glass-modified voltammetric sensors and electrocatalysts.",chemistry
Nucleophilic catalysis of acylhydrazone equilibration for protein-directed dynamic covalent chemistry.,"Dynamic covalent chemistry uses reversible chemical reactions to set up an equilibrating network of molecules at thermodynamic equilibrium, which can adjust its composition in response to any agent capable of altering the free energy of the system. When the target is a biological macromolecule, such as a protein, the process corresponds to the protein directing the synthesis of its own best ligand. Here, we demonstrate that reversible acylhydrazone formation is an effective chemistry for biological dynamic combinatorial library formation. In the presence of aniline as a nucleophilic catalyst, dynamic combinatorial libraries equilibrate rapidly at pH 6.2, are fully reversible, and may be switched on or off by means of a change in pH. We have interfaced these hydrazone dynamic combinatorial libraries with two isozymes from the glutathione S-transferase class of enzyme, and observed divergent amplification effects, where each protein selects the best-fitting hydrazone for the hydrophobic region of its active site.",chemistry
Using first principles to predict bimetallic catalysts for the ammonia decomposition reaction.,"The facile decomposition of ammonia to produce hydrogen is critical to its use as a hydrogen storage medium in a hydrogen economy, and although ruthenium shows good activity for catalysing this process, its expense and scarcity are prohibitive to large-scale commercialization. The need to develop alternative catalysts has been addressed here, using microkinetic modelling combined with density functional studies to identify suitable monolayer bimetallic (surface or subsurface) catalysts based on nitrogen binding energies. The Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surface, with one monolayer of Ni atoms residing on a Pt(111) substrate, was predicted to be a catalytically active surface. This was verified using temperature-programmed desorption and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy experiments. The results reported here provide a framework for complex catalyst discovery. They also demonstrate the critical importance of combining theoretical and experimental approaches for identifying desirable monolayer bimetallic systems when the surface properties are not a linear function of the parent metals.",chemistry
Efficient stereo- and regioselective hydroxylation of alkanes catalysed by a bulky polyoxometalate.,"Direct functionalization of alkanes by oxidation of C-H bonds to form alcohols under mild conditions is a challenge for synthetic chemistry. Most alkanes contain a large number of C-H bonds that present difficulties for selectivity, and the oxidants employed often result in overoxidation. Here we describe a divanadium-substituted phosphotungstate that catalyses the stereo- and regioselective hydroxylation of alkanes with hydrogen peroxide as the sole oxidant. Both cyclic and acyclic alkanes were oxidized to form alcohols with greater than 96% selectivity. The bulky polyoxometalate framework of the catalyst results in an unusual selectivity that can lead to the oxidation of secondary rather than the weaker tertiary C-H bonds. The catalyst also avoids wasteful decomposition of the stoichiometric oxidant, which can result in the production of hydroxyl radicals and lead to non-selective oxidation and overoxidation of the desired products.",chemistry
Geometry-controlled kinetics.,"It has long been appreciated that the transport properties of molecules can control reaction kinetics. This effect can be characterized by the time it takes a diffusing molecule to reach a target-the first-passage time (FPT). Determining the FPT distribution in realistic confined geometries has until now, however, seemed intractable. Here, we calculate this FPT distribution analytically and show that transport processes as varied as regular diffusion, anomalous diffusion, and diffusion in disordered media and fractals, fall into the same universality classes. Beyond the theoretical aspect, this result changes our views on standard reaction kinetics and we introduce the concept of 'geometry-controlled kinetics'. More precisely, we argue that geometry-and in particular the initial distance between reactants in 'compact' systems-can become a key parameter. These findings could help explain the crucial role that the spatial organization of genes has in transcription kinetics, and more generally the impact of geometry on diffusion-limited reactions.",chemistry
Direct detection of CH/pi interactions in proteins.,"XH/pi interactions make important contributions to biomolecular structure and function. These weakly polar interactions, involving pi-system acceptor groups, are usually identified from the three-dimensional structures of proteins. Here, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has been used to directly detect methyl/pi (Me/pi) interactions in proteins at atomic resolution. Density functional theory calculations predict the existence of weak scalar (J) couplings between nuclei involved in Me/pi interactions. Using an optimized isotope-labelling strategy, these J couplings have been detected in proteins using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The resulting spectra provide direct experimental evidence of Me/pi interactions in proteins and allow a simple and unambiguous assignment of donor and acceptor groups. The use of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is an elegant way to identify and experimentally characterize Me/pi interactions in proteins without the need for arbitrary geometric descriptions or pre-existing three-dimensional structures.",chemistry
Assembly of a metal-organic framework by sextuple intercatenation of discrete adamantane-like cages.,"Metal-organic frameworks form a unique class of multifunctional hybrid materials and have myriad applications, including gas storage and catalysis. Their structure is usually achieved through the infinite coordination of metal ions and multidentate organic ligands by means of strong covalent bonds. Threaded molecules such as catenanes and rotaxanes have largely been restricted to comprising components of two-dimensional interlocking rings or polygons. There are very few examples of the catenation of polyhedral cages. Although it has been postulated that the infinite extended architecture can be obtained from the polycatenation of a discrete cage based on such threading, this has not been documented to date. Here we describe an infinite three-dimensional metal-organic framework composed of catenated polyhedral cages, in which the framework is achieved by mechanical interlocking of all of the vertices of the cages. The three-dimensional polycatenated framework shows twofold self-interpenetration in its crystal packing. The penetration of polycatenanes creates nanosized voids into which the Keggin polyoxometalate anions are perfectly accommodated as counteranions.",chemistry
Lattice-strain control of the activity in dealloyed core-shell fuel cell catalysts.,"Electrocatalysis will play a key role in future energy conversion and storage technologies, such as water electrolysers, fuel cells and metal-air batteries. Molecular interactions between chemical reactants and the catalytic surface control the activity and efficiency, and hence need to be optimized; however, generalized experimental strategies to do so are scarce. Here we show how lattice strain can be used experimentally to tune the catalytic activity of dealloyed bimetallic nanoparticles for the oxygen-reduction reaction, a key barrier to the application of fuel cells and metal-air batteries. We demonstrate the core-shell structure of the catalyst and clarify the mechanistic origin of its activity. The platinum-rich shell exhibits compressive strain, which results in a shift of the electronic band structure of platinum and weakening chemisorption of oxygenated species. We combine synthesis, measurements and an understanding of strain from theory to generate a reactivity-strain relationship that provides guidelines for tuning electrocatalytic activity.",chemistry
Direct transformation of graphene to fullerene.,"Although fullerenes can be efficiently generated from graphite in high yield, the route to the formation of these symmetrical and aesthetically pleasing carbon cages from a flat graphene sheet remains a mystery. The most widely accepted mechanisms postulate that the graphene structure dissociates to very small clusters of carbon atoms such as C(2), which subsequently coalesce to form fullerene cages through a series of intermediates. In this Article, aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy directly visualizes, in real time, a process of fullerene formation from a graphene sheet. Quantum chemical modelling explains four critical steps in a top-down mechanism of fullerene formation: (i) loss of carbon atoms at the edge of graphene, leading to (ii) the formation of pentagons, which (iii) triggers the curving of graphene into a bowl-shaped structure and which (iv) subsequently zips up its open edges to form a closed fullerene structure.",chemistry
Ion-triggered spring-like motion of a double helicate accompanied by anisotropic twisting.,"Molecules that extend and contract under external stimuli are used to build molecular machines with nanomechanical functions. But although common in biological systems, such extension and contraction motions with helical molecules have rarely been accompanied by unidirectional twisting in synthetic systems. Here we show that sodium ions can trigger the reversible anisotropic twisting of an enantiomeric double-stranded helicate, without racemization. An optically active helicate consisting of two tetraphenol strands bridged by two spiroborate groups sandwiches a sodium ion. On removal of the central sodium-through addition of a cryptand [2.2.1] in solution-the double helicate extends. Crystallographic and nuclear magnetic resonance studies reveal that the extended helicate is over twice as long as the initial molecule, and is twisted in the right-handed direction. Circular dichroism analysis suggests that the twisting doesn't affect the helicate's handedness. This anisotropic extension-contraction process is reversibly triggered by the successive addition and removal of sodium ions in solution.",chemistry
Robust dynamics.,"Although metal-organic frameworks are extensive in number and have found widespread applications, there remains a need to add complexity to their structures in a controlled manner. It is inevitable that frameworks capable of dynamics will be required. However, as in other extended structures, when they are flexible, they fail. We propose that mechanically interlocked molecules be inserted covalently into the rigid framework backbone such that they are mounted as integrated components, capable of dynamics, without compromising the fidelity of the entire system. We have coined the term 'robust dynamics' to describe constructs where the repeated dynamics of one entity does not affect the integrity of any others linked to it. The implication of this concept for dynamic molecules, whose performance has the disadvantages of random motion, is to bring them to a standstill in three-dimensional extended structures and thus significantly enhance their order, and ultimately their coherence and performance.",chemistry
Enantioselective protonation.,"Enantioselective protonation is a common process in biosynthetic sequences. The decarboxylase and esterase enzymes that effect this valuable transformation are able to control both the steric environment around the proton acceptor (typically an enolate) and the proton donor (typically a thiol). Recently, several chemical methods to achieve enantioselective protonation have been developed by exploiting various means of enantiocontrol in different mechanisms. These laboratory transformations have proven useful for the preparation of a number of valuable organic compounds.",chemistry
Catalyst selection based on intermediate stability measured by mass spectrometry.,"The power of natural selection through survival of the fittest is nature's ultimate tool for the improvement and advancement of species. To apply this concept in catalyst development is attractive and may lead to more rapid discoveries of new catalysts for the synthesis of relevant targets, such as pharmaceuticals. Recent advances in ligand synthesis using combinatorial methods have allowed the generation of a great diversity of catalysts. However, selection methods are few in number. We introduce a new selection method that focuses on the stability of catalytic intermediates measured by mass spectrometry. The stability of the intermediate relates inversely to the reactivity of the catalyst, which forms the basis of a catalyst-screening protocol in which less-abundant species represent the most-active catalysts, 'the survival of the weakest'. We demonstrate this concept in the palladium-catalysed allylic alkylation reaction using diphosphine and IndolPhos ligands and support our results with high-level density functional theory calculations.",chemistry
Rapid preparation of flexible porous coordination polymer nanocrystals with accelerated guest adsorption kinetics.,"Porous coordination polymers, in particular flexible porous coordination polymer networks that change their network structure on guest adsorption, have enormous potential in applications involving selective storage, separation and sensing. Despite the expected significant differences in their adsorption properties, porous coordination polymer nanocrystals remain largely unexplored, and there have been no reports about studies on flexible porous coordination polymer nanocrystals, mainly due to a lack of preparation methods. Here, we present a new technique for the rapid preparation of porous coordination polymer nanocrystals that combines non-aqueous inverse microemulsion with ultrasonication. Uniform nanocrystals of {[Zn(ip)(bpy)]}(n) (ip = isophthalate, bpy = 4,4'-bipyridyl; CID-1), a flexible porous coordination polymer, have been prepared by this method and analysed using field-emission scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray powder diffraction. A model for particle formation and growth is presented and discussed. Adsorption experiments with methanol show that the overall adsorption capacities of nanoparticles and bulk are almost identical, but the shapes of the sorption isotherms differ significantly and the adsorption kinetics increase dramatically.",chemistry
A 'Texas-sized' molecular box that forms an anion-induced supramolecular necklace.,"The 'blue box' (cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) or CBPQT(4+)), developed by Stoddart and colleagues, forms effective charge transfer complexes with a variety of electron-rich species and has been used to support the formation of a wide range of interlocked structures. However, little effort seems to have been devoted to generalizing the blue box concept. We describe a new flexible tetracationic macrocycle-a 'Texas-sized' molecular box. This positively charged receptor is capable of binding the mono-terephthalate anion, forming pseudorotaxanes. These pseudorotaxanes self-assemble into short supramolecular pseudo-oligorotaxanes in solution and more extended pseudo-polyrotaxanes in the solid state. The supramolecular oligomers formed in solution are environmentally responsive; they undergo deaggregation as the overall concentration of the cationic and anionic constituents is reduced, the temperature is increased, or the protonation state of the threading mono-terephthalate anion is changed.",chemistry
Million-fold activation of the [Fe(2)(micro-O)(2)] diamond core for C-H bond cleavage.,"In biological systems, the cleavage of strong C-H bonds is often carried out by iron centres-such as that of methane monooxygenase in methane hydroxylation-through dioxygen activation mechanisms. High valent species with [Fe(2)(micro-O)(2)] diamond cores are thought to act as the oxidizing moieties, but the synthesis of complexes that cleave strong C-H bonds efficiently has remained a challenge. We report here the conversion of a synthetic complex with a valence-delocalized [Fe(3.5)(micro-O)(2)Fe(3.5)](3+) diamond core (1) into a complex with a valence-localized [HO-Fe(III)-O-Fe(IV)=O](2+) open core (4), which cleaves C-H bonds over a million-fold faster. This activity enhancement results from three factors: the formation of a terminal oxoiron(iv) moiety, the conversion of the low-spin (S = 1) Fe(IV)=O centre to a high-spin (S = 2) centre, and the concentration of the oxidizing capability to the active terminal oxoiron(iv) moiety. This suggests that similar isomerization strategies might be used by nonhaem diiron enzymes.",chemistry
Self-assembly and optically triggered disassembly of hierarchical dendron-virus complexes.,"Nature offers a vast array of biological building blocks that can be combined with synthetic materials to generate a variety of hierarchical architectures. Viruses are particularly interesting in this respect because of their structure and the possibility of them functioning as scaffolds for the preparation of new biohybrid materials. We report here that cowpea chlorotic mottle virus particles can be assembled into well-defined micrometre-sized objects and then reconverted into individual viruses by application of a short optical stimulus. Assembly is achieved using photosensitive dendrons that bind on the virus surface through multivalent interactions and then act as a molecular glue between the virus particles. Optical triggering induces the controlled decomposition and charge switching of dendrons, which results in the loss of multivalent interactions and the release of virus particles. We demonstrate that the method is not limited to the virus particles alone, but can also be applied to other functional protein cages such as magnetoferritin.",chemistry
The rational design of helium bonds.,"The chemistry of helium has hitherto been confined to experimental and theoretical analysis of small molecules containing three to five atoms in the gas phase. Here a new suggestion is made for compounds of helium deriving from a recent proposal that five-coordinate carbon might be captured as a frozen S(N)2 transition state. A series of logical steps, originally discussed as postings and comments to two blogs, led to the outcome described here of a central hypervalent atom bound on one face by a small cyclic carbon ligand, with the other free face having an interaction to a helium atom with the topological properties of a charge-shift rather than a covalent bond. Although high-level theory predicts these helium bonds to be quite short with relatively high stretching frequencies, the kinetic barriers to the loss of helium are predicted to be small, and are not increased by the strategy of having bulky substituents on the ring ligand.",chemistry
An organic redox electrolyte to rival triiodide/iodide in dye-sensitized solar cells.,"Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have achieved impressive conversion efficiencies for solar energy of over 11% with an electrolyte that contains triiodide/iodide as a redox couple. Although triiodide/iodide redox couples work efficiently in DSCs, they suffer from two major disadvantages: electrolytes that contain triiodide/iodide corrode electrical contacts made of silver (which reduces the options for the scale up of DSCs to module size) and triiodide partially absorbs visible light. Here, we present a new disulfide/thiolate redox couple that has negligible absorption in the visible spectral range, a very attractive feature for flexible DSCs that use transparent conductors as current collectors. Using this novel, iodide-free redox electrolyte in conjunction with a sensitized heterojunction, we achieved an unprecedented efficiency of 6.4% under standard illumination test conditions. This novel redox couple offers a viable pathway to develop efficient DSCs with attractive properties for scale up and practical applications.",chemistry
Synergistic organocatalysis in the kinetic resolution of secondary thiols with concomitant desymmetrization of an anhydride.,"Kinetic resolution is an important method for the separation of racemates into their component enantiomers. Thiols are precursors to a variety of organosulfur compounds, with high utility in both chemistry and chemical biology, yet there is a surprising dearth of methodologies for their direct and efficient catalytic kinetic resolution. Here, we demonstrate an organocatalytic process involving the highly enantioselective desymmetrization of an achiral electrophile with the simultaneous kinetic resolution of a racemic thiol. The preparative potential of the methodology is exemplified by the synthesis of a drug precursor antipode in excellent yield and enantioselectivity as a by-product of a process that also resolves a sec-thiol substrate with a selectivity of S = 226 (that is, both thiol antipodes produced in >95% ee at 51% conversion). In a second example a racemic sec-thiol representing the stereocentre-containing core of the anti-asthma drug (R)-Montelukast was resolved with synthetically useful selectivity under mild conditions.",chemistry
Charge-transfer-induced structural rearrangements at both sides of organic/metal interfaces.,"Organic/metal interfaces control the performance of many optoelectronic organic devices, including organic light-emitting diodes or field-effect transistors. Using scanning tunnelling microscopy, low-energy electron diffraction, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we show that electron transfer at the interface between a metal surface and the organic electron acceptor tetracyano-p-quinodimethane leads to substantial structural rearrangements on both the organic and metallic sides of the interface. These structural modifications mediate new intermolecular interactions through the creation of stress fields that could not have been predicted on the basis of gas-phase neutral tetracyano-p-quinodimethane conformation.",chemistry
Isolation of crystalline carbene-stabilized P(2)-radical cations and P(2)-dications.,"The discovery in 1900 by Gomberg that the trityl radical (Ph(3)C(.)) exists at room temperature is often considered to be the beginning of radical chemistry. Since then, persistent and even room-temperature stable radicals based on second-row and heavier elements have been synthesized. However, few of them have been characterized crystallographically, because they are either too reactive or dimerize in the solid state. Here, we show that a P(2) fragment, capped with two bulky, strongly electron-releasing singlet carbenes (dicoordinate carbon compounds with only six valence electrons), can undergo one-electron oxidation, giving rise to room-temperature stable radical cations. Moreover, when N-heterocyclic carbenes are used, two-electron oxidation can also be performed, producing the corresponding stable dicationic diphosphene, which has to be regarded as a P(2)(2+) fragment coordinated by two carbenes. These results reveal a new application of stable singlet carbenes, the stabilization of paramagnetic species and electron-poor fragments.",chemistry
High-spin ground states via electron delocalization in mixed-valence imidazolate-bridged divanadium complexes.,"The field of molecular magnetism has grown tremendously since the discovery of single-molecule magnets, but it remains centred around the superexchange mechanism. The possibility of instead using a double-exchange mechanism (based on electron delocalization rather than Heisenberg exchange through a non-magnetic bridge) presents a tantalizing prospect for synthesizing molecules with high-spin ground states that are well isolated in energy. We now demonstrate that magnetic double exchange can be sustained by simple imidazolate bridging ligands, known to be well suited for the construction of coordination clusters and solids. A series of mixed-valence molecules of the type [(PY5Me(2))V(II)(micro-L(br)) V(III)(PY5Me(2))](4+) were synthesized and their electron delocalization probed through cyclic voltammetry and spectroelectrochemistry. Magnetic susceptibility data reveal a well-isolated S = 5/2 ground state arising from double exchange for [(PY5Me(2))(2)V(2)(micro-5,6-dimethylbenzimidazolate)](4+). Combined modelling of the magnetic data and spectral analysis leads to an estimate of the double-exchange parameter of B = 220 cm(-1) when vibronic coupling is taken into account.",chemistry
Induction of chiral porous solids containing only achiral building blocks.,"In many areas of chemistry the synthesis of chiral compounds is a target of increasing importance. They play a vital role in biological function and in many areas of society and science, including biology, medicine, biotechnology, chemistry and agriculture. Many pharmaceutical molecules, like their biological targets, are chiral and it is therefore easy to understand the growing demand for efficient methods of producing enantiomerically pure compounds. This is equally true for the preparation of chiral solids, which have potential applications in asymmetric catalysis, chiral separations and the like. In this Review we will consider recent progress and future potential in the development of methods for the preparation of chirally pure solids, in particular where the building blocks of the structure are achiral themselves. We will discuss strategies for the synthesis of both inorganic (for example, zeolites) and inorganic-organic hybrid (for example, metal organic framework) chiral porous solids.",chemistry
Type-zero copper proteins.,"Many proteins contain copper in a range of coordination environments, where it has various biological roles, such as transferring electrons or activating dioxygen. These copper sites can be classified by their function or spectroscopic properties. Those with a single copper atom are either type 1, with an intense absorption band near 600 nm, or type 2, with weak absorption in the visible region. We have built a novel copper(II) binding site within structurally modified Pseudomonas aeruginosa azurins that does not resemble either existing type, which we therefore call 'type zero'. X-ray crystallographic analysis shows that these sites adopt distorted tetrahedral geometries, with an unusually short Cu-O (G45 carbonyl) bond. Relatively weak absorption near 800 nm and narrow parallel hyperfine splittings in electron paramagnetic resonance spectra are the spectroscopic signatures of type zero copper. Cyclic voltammetric experiments demonstrate that the electron transfer reactivities of type-zero azurins are enhanced relative to that of the corresponding type 2 (C112D) protein.",chemistry
Enantioselective sulfonylation reactions mediated by a tetrapeptide catalyst.,"While Nature excels at performing selective modifications of complex polyfunctional molecules through the use of tailoring enzymes, synthetic chemistry has lagged behind in this regard. In prior work, we have applied a biomimetic approach to this problem, developing small peptides to achieve various group transfer reactions on polyol substrates with high enantio- or regioselectivity. The utility of sulfonates as synthetic building blocks and the scarcity of direct, selective methods for their preparation prompted our investigation into this area. In this article we report the development of a pi-methyl histidine-based tetrameric peptide that effects the desymmetrization of meso-1,3-diols through enantioselective (mono)sulfonylation. The catalyst exhibits structural similarities to another catalyst found to be effective in orthogonal group transfers, but results in modification of the enantiotopic alcohol. The practical and mechanistic implications of this discovery may extend beyond synthetic considerations and provide analogies to the diverse roles of histidine in enzyme active sites.",chemistry
Opportunities and challenges in synthetic oligosaccharide and glycoconjugate research.,"Synthetic oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates are increasingly used as probes for biological research and as lead compounds for drug and vaccine discovery. These endeavors are, however, complicated by a lack of general methods for the routine preparation of this important class of compounds. Recent development such as one-pot multi-step protecting group manipulations, the use of unified monosaccharide building blocks, the introduction of stereoselective glycosylation protocols, and convergent strategies for oligosaccharide assembly, are beginning to address these problems. Furthermore, oligosaccharide synthesis can be facilitated by chemo-enzymatic methods, which employ a range of glycosyl transferases to modify a synthetic oligosaccharide precursor. Glycosynthases, which are mutant glycosidases, that can readily form glycosidic linkages are addressing a lack of a wide range glycosyltransferases. The power of carbohydrate chemistry is highlighted by an ability to synthesize glycoproteins.",chemistry
Sensing of proteins in human serum using conjugates of nanoparticles and green fluorescent protein.,"There is a direct correlation between protein levels and disease states in human serum, which makes it an attractive target for sensors and diagnostics. However, this is challenging because serum features more than 20,000 proteins, with an overall protein content greater than 1 mM. Here we report a sensor based on a hybrid synthetic-biomolecule that uses arrays of green fluorescent protein and nanoparticles to detect proteins at biorelevant concentrations in both buffer and human serum. Distinct and reproducible fluorescence-response patterns were obtained from five serum proteins (human serum albumin, immunoglobulin G, transferrin, fibrinogen and a-antitrypsin), both in buffer and when spiked into human serum. Using linear discriminant analysis we identified these proteins with an identification accuracy of 100% in buffer and 97% in human serum. The arrays were also able to discriminate between different concentrations of the same protein, as well as a mixture of different proteins in human serum.",chemistry
A bonding model for gold(I) carbene complexes.,"The last decade has witnessed dramatic growth in the number of reactions catalyzed by electrophilic gold complexes. While proposed mechanisms often invoke the intermediacy of gold-stabilized cationic species, the nature of bonding in these intermediates remains unclear. Herein, we propose that the carbon-gold bond in these intermediates is comprised of varying degrees of both sigma and pi-bonding; however, the overall bond order is generally less than or equal to unity. The bonding in a given gold-stabilized intermediate, and the position of this intermediate on a continuum ranging from gold-stabilized singlet carbene to gold-coordinated carbocation, is dictated by the carbene substituents and the ancillary ligand. Experiments show that the correlation between bonding and reactivity is reflected in the yield of gold-catalyzed cyclopropanation reactions.",chemistry
An optoelectronic nose for the detection of toxic gases.,"We have developed a simple colorimetric sensor array that detects a wide range of volatile analytes and then applied it to the detection of toxic gases. The sensor consists of a disposable array of cross-responsive nanoporous pigments with colours that are changed by diverse chemical interactions with analytes. Although no single chemically responsive pigment is specific for any one analyte, the pattern of colour change for the array is a unique molecular fingerprint. Clear differentiation among 19 different toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) within two minutes of exposure at concentrations immediately dangerous to life or health were demonstrated. Based on the colour change of the array, quantification of each analyte was accomplished easily, and excellent detection limits were achieved, generally below the permissible exposure limits. Different TICs were identified readily using a standard chemometric approach (hierarchical clustering analysis), with no misclassifications over 140 trials.",chemistry
A diiron(IV) complex that cleaves strong C-H and O-H bonds.,"The controlled cleavage of strong C-H bonds like those of methane poses a significant challenge for chemists. In nature methane is oxidized to methanol by soluble methane monooxygenase via a diiron(IV) intermediate called Q. To model the chemistry of MMO-Q, an oxo-bridged diiron(IV) complex has been generated by electrochemical oxidation and characterized by several spectroscopic methods. This novel species has an Fe(IV/III) redox potential of +1.50 V vs. ferrocene (>2 V vs. NHE), the highest value thus far determined electrochemically for an iron complex. This species is quite an effective oxidant. It can attack C-H bonds as strong as 100 kcal mol(-1) and reacts with cyclohexane a hundred- to a thousand-fold faster than mononuclear Fe(IV)=O complexes of closely related ligands. Strikingly, this species can also cleave the strong O-H bonds of methanol and tert-butanol instead of their weaker C-H bonds, representing the first example of O-H bond activation for iron complexes.",chemistry
A ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complex for direct imaging of DNA structure in living cells.,"In the search for new biological imaging agents, metal coordination compounds able to emit from triplet metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) states offer many advantages as luminescent probes of DNA structure. However, poor cellular uptake restricts their use in live cells. Here, we present a dinuclear ruthenium(II) polypyridyl system that works as a multifunctional biological imaging agent staining the DNA of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells for both luminescence and transition electron microscopy. This MLCT 'light switch' complex directly images nuclear DNA of living cells without requiring prior membrane permeabilization. Furthermore, inhibition and transmission electron microscopy studies show this to be via a non-endocytotic, but temperature-dependent, mechanism of cellular uptake in MCF-7 cells, and confocal microscopy reveals multiple emission peaks that function as markers for cellular DNA structure.",chemistry
Streamlined microwave-assisted preparation of narrow-bandgap conjugated polymers for high-performance bulk heterojunction solar cells.,"The most efficient plastic solar cells comprise a blend of conjugated polymer and a suitable electron acceptor, typically a fullerene derivative. Therefore narrow-bandgap conjugated polymers are currently sought for the fabrication of such devices. A significant challenge is being able to predict device function and performance from consideration of the molecular connectivity and dimensions of the partners within the active layer. Improved chemical syntheses are therefore required to make structurally varied polymers and enable the delineation of structure-function relationships with the aim of improving power conversion efficiencies. Here, we demonstrate that microwave heating in combination with the screening of comonomer reactant ratios can be used to obtain donor-acceptor copolymers with high average molecular weights and properties that make them suitable for solar cell incorporation. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of high molecular weight and the contribution of solubilizing side groups in determining the final device properties.",chemistry
Hierarchical functional gradients of pH-responsive self-assembled monolayers using dynamic covalent chemistry on surfaces.,"Surface chemistry is an important field of research, especially for the study and design of (bio)nanostructures in which nearly every atom lies at an interface. Here we show that dynamic covalent chemistry is an efficient tool for functionalizing surfaces in such a way that their interfacial properties can be varied controllably in space and time. Modulation of pH is used to tune the fast, selective and reversible attachment of functional amines (with different pK(a) values) to an aldehyde-coated surface. To illustrate the potential of this technique, we developed dynamic self-assembled monolayers ('DynaSAMs'), which enable the hierarchical construction of mixed gradients comprising either small functional molecules or proteins. Control of the (bio)chemical composition at any point on the surface potentially provides a simple bottom-up method to access numerous surface patterns with a broad range of functionalities.",chemistry
In silico design of tubulin-targeted antimitotic peptides.,"Microtubules are polymeric structures formed by the self-assembly of tubulin dimers. The growth and shrinkage of these dynamic arrays have a key role during the cell-proliferation process. This makes tubulin the molecular target of many anticancer drugs currently in use or under clinical trial. Their impressive success is limited by the onset of resistant tumour cells during the treatment, so new resistance-proof molecules need to be developed. Here we use molecular dynamics and free-energy calculations to study the network of interactions that allow microtubule formation. Modelling the protein-protein interface allows us to identify the amino acids responsible for tubulin-tubulin binding and thus to design peptides, which correspond to tubulin subsequences, that interfere with microtubule formation. We show that the application of molecular modelling techniques leads to the identification of peptides that exhibit antitubulin activity both in vitro and in cultured cells.",chemistry
Rectification and stability of a single molecular diode with controlled orientation.,"In the molecular electronics field it is highly desirable to engineer the structure of molecules to achieve specific functions. In particular, diode (or rectification) behaviour in single molecules is an attractive device function. Here we study charge transport through symmetric tetraphenyl and non-symmetric diblock dipyrimidinyldiphenyl molecules covalently bound to two electrodes. The orientation of the diblock is controlled through a selective deprotection strategy, and a method in which the electrode-electrode distance is modulated unambiguously determines the current-voltage characteristics of the single-molecule device. The diblock molecule exhibits pronounced rectification behaviour compared with its homologous symmetric block, with current flowing from the dipyrimidinyl to the diphenyl moieties. This behaviour is interpreted in terms of localization of the wave function of the hole ground state at one end of the diblock under the applied field. At large forward current, the molecular diode becomes unstable and quantum point contacts between the electrodes form.",chemistry
Vesicular perylene dye nanocapsules as supramolecular fluorescent pH sensor systems.,"Water-soluble, self-assembled nanocapsules composed of a functional bilayer membrane and enclosed guest molecules can provide smart (that is, condition responsive) sensors for a variety of purposes. Owing to their outstanding optical and redox properties, perylene bisimide chromophores are interesting building blocks for a functional bilayer membrane in a water environment. Here, we report water-soluble perylene bisimide vesicles loaded with bispyrene-based energy donors in their aqueous interior. These loaded vesicles are stabilized by in situ photopolymerization to give nanocapsules that are stable over the entire aqueous pH range. On the basis of pH-tunable spectral overlap of donors and acceptors, the donor-loaded polymerized vesicles display pH-dependent fluorescence resonance energy transfer from the encapsulated donors to the bilayer dye membrane, providing ultrasensitive pH information on their aqueous environment with fluorescence colour changes covering the whole visible light range. At pH 9.0, quite exceptional white fluorescence could be observed for such water-soluble donor-loaded perylene vesicles.",chemistry
Mechanically induced luminescence changes in molecular assemblies.,"Altering the shape and properties of a material through external factors such as heat, light, pressure, pH, electric or magnetic fields, or the introduction of a guest molecule, is an attractive prospect. In this Perspective, piezochromic luminescent materials - which change the colour of their luminescence in response to mechanical stimuli - are described. Such piezochromism has been observed for a few molecular materials that contain luminescent cores in liquid-crystalline and crystalline solid states, as well as for polymeric materials doped with dyes. These changes in photoluminescent colour can be activated by various types of mechanical pressure such as shearing, grinding or elongation, which can trigger different mechanisms of producing the colour. Such stimuli-responsive materials have potential for various applications, including sensors, memory and displays.",chemistry
"Anefficient approach to chiral fullerene derivatives by catalytic enantioselective 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions.","Fullerene chirality is an important but undeveloped issue of paramount interest in fields such as materials science and medicinal chemistry. So far, enantiopure fullerene derivatives have been made from chiral starting materials or obtained by separating racemic mixtures. Here, we report the enantioselective catalytic synthesis of chiral pyrrolidinofullerenes (the most widely studied fullerene derivatives), which proceeds in high yields under very mild conditions at low temperatures. The combination of a particular metal catalyst-Ag(I) or Cu(II)-and a chiral ligand is able to direct the cycloaddition of buckminsterfullerene C(60), the first non-coordinating dipolarophile used in such reactions, to opposite enantiofaces of N-metallated azomethine ylides. This methodology has proven to be quite general, affording enantiomeric excesses of greater than 90%. Furthermore, well-defined chiral carbon atoms linked to the fullerene sphere are able to perturb the inherent symmetry of the fullerene pi-system as revealed by circular dichroism measurements.",chemistry
Highly dynamic motion of crown ethers along oligolysine peptide chains.,"Molecular mobility has attracted considerable attention in supramolecular chemistry and biochemistry, but the simple question of whether a small molecule can move directly between different binding sites of a multitopic host without intermediate dissociation has not been addressed so far. To study such processes, we consider hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments on a model system comprising complexes formed between 18-crown-6 and oligolysine peptides. Because direct binding-site hopping is indistinguishable in solution from a dissociation/reassociation mechanism, here we show that the high vacuum of a mass spectrometer offers a unique environment for probing such processes. The highly dynamic motion of crown ethers along oligolysine peptide chains proceeds mechanistically by a simultaneous transfer of the crown ether from its ammonium ion binding site to a nearby amino group together with a proton. Furthermore, the exchange experiments unambiguously reveal the zwitterionic structure of the 18-crown-6/oligolysine complexes, highlighting the versatility and potential of gas-phase experiments for investigating non-covalent interactions.",chemistry
Self-assembling nanoprobes that display off/on 19F nuclear magnetic resonance signals for protein detection and imaging.,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most promising techniques for the non-invasive visualization of biomarkers and biologically relevant species, both in vivo and ex vivo. Although (1)H MRI with paramagnetic contrast agents, such as Gd(3+) complexes and iron oxide, is widely used, it often suffers from low contrast because of the large background signals caused by the abundant distribution of protons in biological samples. Here we report the use of supramolecular organic nanoparticles to detect specific proteins by (19)F-based MRI in an off/on mode. In NMR spectroscopy these designed probes are silent when aggregated, but in the presence of a target protein they disassemble to produce a sharp signal. This 'turn-on' response allowed us to visualize clearly the protein within live cells by (19)F MRI and construct an in-cell inhibitor assay. This recognition-driven disassembly of nanoprobes for a turn-on (19)F signal is unprecedented and may extend the use of (19)F MRI for specific protein imaging.",chemistry
Alloys of platinum and early transition metals as oxygen reduction electrocatalysts.,"The widespread use of low-temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells for mobile applications will require significant reductions in the amount of expensive Pt contained within their cathodes, which drive the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Although progress has been made in this respect, further reductions through the development of more active and stable electrocatalysts are still necessary. Here we describe a new set of ORR electrocatalysts consisting of Pd or Pt alloyed with early transition metals such as Sc or Y. They were identified using density functional theory calculations as being the most stable Pt- and Pd-based binary alloys with ORR activity likely to be better than Pt. Electrochemical measurements show that the activity of polycrystalline Pt(3)Sc and Pt(3)Y electrodes is enhanced relative to pure Pt by a factor of 1.5-1.8 and 6-10, respectively, in the range 0.9-0.87 V.",chemistry
Total synthesis and study of 6-deoxyerythronolide B by late-stage C-H oxidation.,"Among the frontier challenges in chemistry in the twenty-first century are the interconnected goals of increasing synthetic efficiency and diversity in the construction of complex molecules. Oxidation reactions of C-H bonds, particularly when applied at late stages of complex molecule syntheses, hold special promise for achieving both these goals. Here we report a late-stage C-H oxidation strategy in the total synthesis of 6-deoxyerythronolide B (6-dEB), the aglycone precursor to the erythromycin antibiotics. An advanced intermediate is cyclized to give the 14-membered macrocyclic core of 6-dEB using a late-stage (step 19 of 22) C-H oxidative macrolactonization reaction that proceeds with high regio-, chemo- and diastereoselectivity (>40:1). A chelate-controlled model for macrolactonization predicted the stereochemical outcome of C-O bond formation and guided the discovery of conditions for synthesizing the first diastereomeric 13-epi-6-dEB precursor. Overall, this C-H oxidation strategy affords a highly efficient and stereochemically versatile synthesis of the erythromycin core.",chemistry
Functional end groups for polymers prepared using ring-opening metathesis polymerization.,"The precise placement of functional groups on the chain-ends of macromolecules is a major focus of polymer research. Most common living polymerization techniques offer specific methods of end-functionalization governed by the active propagating species and the kinetics of the polymerization reaction. Ring-opening metathesis polymerization has established itself as one of the most functional-group-tolerant living polymerization techniques known, but this tolerance has limited the number of available functionalization reactions. Metathesis chemists have therefore been required to develop a variety of end-functionalizations, adapting each of them to the reactivity scheme of the particular catalysts used and the complexity of the group to be attached. This review presents an overview of the methods developed for different types and generations of metathesis catalysts that are typically used in such polymerizations. We also present a 'field guide' of functionalization methods highlighting the factors to be considered when choosing the most appropriate approach.",chemistry
Ultrashort metal-metal distances and extreme bond orders.,"Chemical bonding is at the very heart of chemistry. Although main-group-element E-E' bond orders range up to triple bonds, higher formal bond orders are known between transition metals. Here we review recent developments related to the synthesis of formally quintuply bonded transition metals in coordination compounds, and their theoretical description. The quadruple bond fascinated chemists for about 40 years. Recently, a stable molecule containing a formal quintuple bond initiated a renaissance in synthesizing and understanding bonds with high bond orders. Ultrashort metal-metal distances as low as 1.73 A are one of the outcomes. First results indicate that the relevance of these bimetallic platforms to synthetic chemistry can be addressed through quintuple-bond reactivity studies. The theoretical description of the bonding situation in molecules with extreme bond orders has only just begun.",chemistry
Decorated carbon nanotubes with unique oxygen sensitivity.,"The relatively simple and robust architecture of microelectronic devices based on carbon nanotubes, in conjunction with their environmental sensitivity, places them among the leading candidates for incorporation into ultraportable or wearable chemical analysis platforms. We used single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) networks to establish a mechanistic understanding of the solid-state oxygen sensitivity of a Eu(3+)-containing dendrimer complex. After illumination with 365 nm light, the SWNT networks decorated with the Eu(3+) dendrimer show bimodal (optical spectroscopic and electrical conductance) sensitivity towards oxygen gas at room temperature under ambient pressure. We investigated the mechanism of this unique oxygen sensitivity with time-resolved and steady-state optical spectroscopy, analysis of excited-state luminescence lifetimes and solid-state electrical transport measurements. We demonstrate a potential application of this system by showing a reversible and linear electrical response to oxygen gas in the tested range (5-27%).",chemistry
Metal-free carbon-carbon bond-forming reductive coupling between boronic acids and tosylhydrazones.,"The formation of carbon-carbon bonds is a fundamental transformation in organic synthesis. In spite of the myriad methods available, advantageous methodologies in terms of selectivity, availability of starting materials, operational simplicity, functional-group tolerance, environmental sustainability and economy are in constant demand. In this context, the development of new cross-coupling reactions that use catalysts based on inexpensive and non-toxic metals is attracting increasing attention. Similarly, efficient processes that do not require a metal catalyst are of extraordinary interest. Here, we report a new and efficient metal-free carbon-carbon bond-forming coupling between tosylhydrazones and boronic acids. This reaction is very general and functional-group tolerant. As the required tosylhydrazones are easily generated from carbonyl compounds, it can be seen as a reductive coupling of carbonyls, a process of high synthetic relevance that requires several steps using other methodologies.",chemistry
Cation-induced kinetic trapping and enhanced hydrogen adsorption in a modulated anionic metal-organic framework.,"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)--microporous materials constructed by bridging metal centres with organic ligands--show promise for applications in hydrogen storage, which is a key challenge in the development of the 'hydrogen economy'. Their adsorption capacities, however, have remained insufficient for practical applications, and thus strategies to enhance hydrogen-MOF interactions are required. Here we describe an anionic MOF material built from In(III) centres and tetracarboxylic acid ligands (H(4)L) in which kinetic trapping behaviour--where hydrogen is adsorbed at high pressures but not released immediately on lowering the pressure--is modulated by guest cations. With piperazinium dications in its pores, the framework exhibits hysteretic hydrogen adsorption. On exchange of these dications with lithium cations, no hysteresis is seen, but instead there is an enhanced adsorption capacity coupled to an increase in the isosteric heat of adsorption. This is rationalized by the different locations of the cations within the pores, determined with precision by X-ray crystallography.",chemistry
The rational design of nitric oxide selectivity in single-walled carbon nanotube near-infrared fluorescence sensors for biological detection.,"A major challenge in the synthesis of nanotube or nanowire sensors is to impart selective analyte binding through means other than covalent linkages, which compromise electronic and optical properties. We synthesized a 3,4-diaminophenyl-functionalized dextran (DAP-dex) wrapping for single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) that imparts rapid and selective fluorescence detection of nitric oxide (NO), a messenger for biological signalling. The near-infrared (nIR) fluorescence of SWNT(DAP-dex) is immediately and directly bleached by NO, but not by other reactive nitrogen and oxygen species. This bleaching is reversible and shown to be caused by electron transfer from the top of the valence band of the SWNT to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of NO. The resulting optical sensor is capable of real-time and spatially resolved detection of NO produced by stimulating NO synthase in macrophage cells. We also demonstrate the potential of the optical sensor for in vivo detection of NO in a mouse model.",chemistry
The role of non-covalent interactions in electrocatalytic fuel-cell reactions on platinum.,"The classic models of metal electrode-electrolyte interfaces generally focus on either covalent interactions between adsorbates and solid surfaces or on long-range electrolyte-metal electrostatic interactions. Here we demonstrate that these traditional models are insufficient. To understand electrocatalytic trends in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and the oxidation of methanol on platinum surfaces in alkaline electrolytes, non-covalent interactions must be considered. We find that non-covalent interactions between hydrated alkali metal cations M(+)(H(2)O)(x) and adsorbed OH (OH(ad)) species increase in the same order as the hydration energies of the corresponding cations (Li(+) >> Na(+) > K(+) > Cs(+)) and also correspond to an increase in the concentration of OH(ad)-M(+)(H(2)O)(x) clusters at the interface. These trends are inversely proportional to the activities of the ORR, the HOR and the oxidation of methanol on platinum (Cs(+) > K(+) > Na(+) >> Li(+)), which suggests that the clusters block the platinum active sites for electrocatalytic reactions.",chemistry
The stabilization of fused-pentagon fullerene molecules.,"The isolated pentagon rule (IPR) is now widely accepted as a general rule for determining the stability of all-carbon fullerene cages composed of hexagons and pentagons. Fullerenes that violate this rule have been deemed too reactive to be synthesized. The stabilization of non-IPR endohedral fullerenes depends on charge transfer from the encapsulated metal clusters (endoclusters) to fullerene cages, the electronic properties of empty all-carbon cages, the matching size and geometries of fullerene and endocluster, as well as the strong coordination of the metal ions to fused pentagons. The stability of non-IPR exohedral fullerenes can be rationalized primarily by both the 'strain-relief' and 'local-aromaticity' principles. This Review focuses on recent work on stabilization of non-IPR fullerenes, including theoretical and empirical principles, experimental methods, and molecular structures of fused-pentagon fullerenes characterized so far. The special chemical properties of non-IPR fullerenes that distinguish them from IPR-satisfying ones are also emphasized.",chemistry
Charge-shift bonding and its manifestations in chemistry.,"Electron-pair bonding is a central chemical paradigm. Here, we show that alongside the two classical covalent and ionic bond families, there exists a class of charge-shift (CS) bonds wherein the electron-pair fluctuation has the dominant role. Charge-shift bonding shows large covalent-ionic resonance interaction energy, and depleted charge densities, and features typical to repulsive interactions, albeit the bond itself may well be strong. This bonding type is rooted in a mechanism whereby the bond achieves equilibrium defined by the virial ratio. The CS bonding territory involves, for example, homopolar bonds of compact electronegative and/or lone-pair-rich elements, heteropolar bonds of these elements among themselves and with other atoms (for example, the metalloids, such as silicon and germanium), hypercoordinated molecules, and bonds whose covalent components are weakened by exchange-repulsion strain (as in [1.1.1]propellane). Here, we discuss experimental manifestations of CS bonding in chemistry, and outline new directions demonstrating the portability of the new concept.",chemistry
Anion-tuning of supramolecular gel properties.,"The study of supramolecular gels has developed into a well-recognised field of materials science, pertaining to the general area of soft matter. The use of small molecules that aggregate through supramolecular interactions (such as hydrogen bonds, pi-pi interactions, coordination bonds and van der Waals interactions) has given materials scientists an alternative to polymeric compounds for the development of practical gels. There have been further attempts to functionalize, activate or control the physical properties of such gels by means of the reversibility of the interactions between the component molecules. Tuning of these characteristics has been accomplished by using mechanical, thermal, electrochemical, electromagnetic and chemical stimuli. The use of anions as a chemical stimulus has been a recent development and is the subject of this Perspective.",chemistry
Visualizing and identifying single atoms using electron energy-loss spectroscopy with low accelerating voltage.,"Visualizing atoms and discriminating between those of different elements is a goal in many analytical techniques. The use of electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in such single-atom analyses is hampered by an inherent difficulty related to the damage caused to specimens by incident electrons. Here, we demonstrate the successful EELS single-atom spectroscopy of various metallofullerene-doped single-wall nanotubes (known as peapods) without massive structural destruction. This is achieved by using an incident electron probe with a low accelerating voltage (60 kV). Single calcium atoms inside the peapods were unambiguously identified for the first time using EELS. Elemental analyses of lanthanum, cerium and erbium atoms were also demonstrated, which shows that single atoms with adjacent atomic numbers can be successfully discriminated with this technique.",chemistry
Drastic symmetry breaking in supramolecular organization of enantiomerically unbalanced monolayers at surfaces.,"There is considerable interest in skewing the transmission of chirality, or 'handedness', from the molecular to the supramolecular level so that single-handed superstructures are created from mixed enantiomer systems. One approach is to flip the chirality of all the molecular building blocks to the same handedness. However, manipulation of molecular chirality is not possible for non-interconvertible enantiomers, and mechanisms that skew such systems are unclear. Here, we track the molecule-to-supramolecular chiral transfer in such systems at the nanoscale by probing molecular monolayers at surfaces. Scanning tunnelling microscopy and theoretical modelling show that enantiomeric imbalances lead to nonlinear symmetry breaking in organization, driven by configurational entropy effects. Thus, the majority enantiomer readily organizes into its superstructure with the minority left fragmented and disorganized, and thus impeded from realizing its superstructure. Such effects promise new strategies in chiral separations and enantioselective processes, and may have contributed to the homochiral evolution of complex matter from prebiotic environments.",chemistry
New insights into the structure and reduction of graphite oxide.,"Graphite oxide is one of the main precursors of graphene-based materials, which are highly promising for various technological applications because of their unusual electronic properties. Although epoxy and hydroxyl groups are widely accepted as its main functionalities, the complete structure of graphite oxide has remained elusive. By interpreting spectroscopic data in the context of the major functional groups believed to be present in graphite oxide, we now show evidence for the presence of five- and six-membered-ring lactols. On the basis of this chemical composition, we devised a complete reduction process through chemical conversion by sodium borohydride and sulfuric acid treatment, followed by thermal annealing. Only small amounts of impurities are present in the final product (less than 0.5 wt% of sulfur and nitrogen, compared with about 3 wt% with other chemical reductions). This method is particularly effective in the restoration of the pi-conjugated structure, and leads to highly soluble and conductive graphene materials.",chemistry
Size-specific catalytic activity of platinum clusters enhances oxygen reduction reactions.,"Colloidal platinum nanoparticles with diameters of 2-5 nm on carbon supports are currently regarded as the best catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction. However, the particle size is limited by the conventional preparation methods that are used to synthesize small platinum particles; the inherent activity of ultrasmall nanoparticles has not yet been revealed. We present a practical synthesis for ultrafine subnanometre platinum clusters using a spherical macromolecular template with no disorder in molecular weight or structure. The template, a phenylazomethine dendrimer, offers control of the number of metal complexes in an assembly through stepwise complexation, allowing the complexes to accumulate in discrete nano-cages. Subsequent reduction of Pt(IV) chloride to Pt(0) results in the formation of platinum clusters composed of a defined number of atoms. As a result of exceptionally small particle size, the clusters exhibit very high catalytic activity for the four-electron reduction of oxygen molecules.",chemistry
Metal-nucleic acid cages.,"Metal-nucleic acid cages are a promising new class of materials. Like metallo-supramolecular cages, these systems can use their metals for redox, photochemical, magnetic and catalytic control over encapsulated cargo. However, using DNA provides the potential to program pore size, geometry, chemistry and addressability, and the ability to symmetrically and asymmetrically position transition metals within the three-dimensional framework. Here we report the quantitative construction of metal-DNA cages, with the site-specific incorporation of a range of metals within a three-dimensional DNA architecture. Oligonucleotide strands containing specific environments suitable for transition-metal coordination were first organized into two DNA triangles. These triangles were then assembled into a DNA prism with linking strands. Metal centres were subsequently incorporated into the prisms at the pre-programmed locations. This unprecedented ability to position transition metals within a three-dimensional framework could lead to metal-DNA hosts with applications for the encapsulation, sensing, modification and release of biomolecules and nanomaterials.",chemistry
A potential energy surface bifurcation in terpene biosynthesis.,"Terpenes comprise a class of natural products that includes molecules with thousands of distinct structurally and stereochemically complex molecular architectures. The core hydrocarbon frameworks of these molecules are constructed via carbocation rearrangements promoted by terpene synthase (cyclase) enzymes. Although many mechanistic details for such reactions have been uncovered, the factors that control which carbocation intermediates and transition-state structures form are not well understood. Here we show that rearrangement pathways that pass through particular transition-state structures can bifurcate after the transition state. The resulting pathways lead to terpenes with distinctly different skeletons from each other. Although these types of bifurcating pathways have been described previously for some small molecules, the possibility that they may have an important role in the production of complex molecules in nature has, to our knowledge, not previously been considered.",chemistry
Sugar synthesis in a protocellular model leads to a cell signalling response in bacteria.,"The design of systems with life-like properties from simple chemical components may offer insights into biological processes, with the ultimate goal of creating an artificial chemical cell that would be considered to be alive. Most efforts to create artificial cells have concentrated on systems based on complex natural molecules such as DNA and RNA. Here we have constructed a lipid-bound protometabolism that synthesizes complex carbohydrates from simple feedstocks, which are capable of engaging the natural quorum sensing mechanism of the marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi and stimulating a proportional bioluminescent response. This encapsulated system may represent the first step towards the realization of a cellular 'mimic' and a starting point for 'bottom-up' designs of other chemical cells, which could perhaps display complex behaviours such as communication with natural cells.",chemistry
Spin transition in a four-coordinate iron oxide.,"Spin transition has attracted the interest of researchers in various fields since the early 1930s, with thousands of examples now recognized, including those in minerals and biomolecules. However, so far the metal centres in which it has been found to occur are almost always octahedral six-coordinate 3d(4) to 3d(7) metals, such as Fe(II). A five-coordinate centre is only rarely seen. Here we report that under pressure SrFe(II)O(2), which features a four-fold square-planar coordination, exhibits a transition from high spin (S = 2) to intermediate spin (S = 1). This is accompanied by a transition from an antiferromagnetic insulating state to a ferromagnetic so-called half-metallic state: only half of the spin-down (d(xz),d(yz)) states are filled. These results highlight the square-planar coordinated iron oxides as a new class of magnetic and electric materials.",chemistry
Molecular printing.,"Molecular printing techniques, which involve the direct transfer of molecules to a substrate with submicrometre resolution, have been extensively developed over the past decade and have enabled many applications. Arrays of features on this scale have been used to direct materials assembly, in nanoelectronics, and as tools for genetic analysis and disease detection. The past decade has witnessed the maturation of molecular printing led by two synergistic technologies: dip-pen nanolithography and soft lithography. Both are characterized by material and substrate flexibility, but dip-pen nanolithography has unlimited pattern design whereas soft lithography has limited pattern flexibility but is low in cost and has high throughput. Advances in DPN tip arrays and inking methods have increased the throughput and enabled applications such as multiplexed arrays. A new approach to molecular printing, polymer-pen lithography, achieves low-cost, high-throughput and pattern flexibility. This Perspective discusses the evolution and future directions of molecular printing.",chemistry
Carboalumination of a chromium-chromium quintuple bond.,"Bonds are at the very heart of chemistry. Although the order of carbon-carbon bonds only extends to triple bonds, metal-metal bond orders of up to five are known for stable compounds, particularly between chromium atoms. Carbometallation and especially carboalumination reactions of carbon-carbon double and triple bonds are a well established synthetic protocol in organometallic chemistry and organic synthesis. We now extend these reactions to compounds containing chromium-chromium quintuple bonds. Analogous reactivity patterns indicate that such quintuple bonds are not as exotic as previously assumed. Yet the particularities of these reactions reflect the specific nature of the high metal-metal bond orders.",chemistry
Bimetallic Pd(III) complexes in palladium-catalysed carbon-heteroatom bond formation.,"Palladium is a common transition metal for catalysis, and the fundamental organometallic reactivity of palladium in its 0, I, II and IV oxidation states is well established. The potential role of Pd(III) in catalysis has not been investigated because organometallic reactions that involve Pd(III) have not been reported previously. In this article we present the formation of carbon-heteroatom bonds from discrete bimetallic Pd(III) complexes and show the synergistic involvement of two palladium atoms of the bimetallic core during both oxidation and reductive elimination. Our results challenge the currently accepted mechanism for oxidative palladium catalysis via Pd(II)-Pd(IV) redox cycles and implicate bimetallic palladium complexes in redox catalysis. The new mechanistic insight provides an opportunity to explore rationally the potential of bimetallic palladium catalysis for synthesis.",chemistry
Chemically blockable transformation and ultraselective low-pressure gas adsorption in a non-porous metal organic framework.,"Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are among the most exciting materials discovered recently, attracting particular attention for their gas-adsorption and -storage properties. Certain MOFs show considerable structural flexibility in response to various stimuli. Although there are several examples of 'breathing' MOFs, in which structural changes occur without any bond breaking, examples of transformations in which several bonds are broken and made are much rarer. In this paper we demonstrate how a flexible MOF, Cu2(OH)(C8H3O7S)(H2O)2H2O, can be synthesized by careful choice of the organic linker ligand. The flexibility can be controlled by addition of a supplementary coordinating molecule, which increases the thermal stability of the solid sufficiently for direct imaging with electron microscopy to be possible. We also demonstrate that the MOF shows unprecedented low-pressure selectivity towards nitric oxide through a coordination-driven gating mechanism. The chemical control over these behaviours offers new possibilities for the synthesis of MOFs with unusual and potentially exploitable properties.",chemistry
Designer magnetic superatoms.,"The quantum states in metal clusters are grouped into bunches of close-lying eigenvalues, termed electronic shells, similar to those of atoms. Filling of the electronic shells with paired electrons results in local minima in energy to give stable species called magic clusters. This led to the realization that selected clusters mimic chemical properties of elemental atoms on the periodic table and can be classified as superatoms. So far the work on superatoms has focused on non-magnetic species. Here we propose a framework for magnetic superatoms by invoking systems that have both localized and delocalized electronic states, in which localized electrons stabilize magnetic moments and filled nearly-free electron shells lead to stable species. An isolated VCs(8) and a ligated MnAu(24)(SH)(18) are shown to be such magnetic superatoms. The magnetic superatoms' assemblies could be ideal for molecular electronic devices, as the coupling could be altered by charging or weak fields.",chemistry
Coordination chemistry at carbon.,"Electron-rich allenes and heterocumulenes are commonly described by the regular notations of organic chemistry. Following on from published results and recent computational studies, we present here a host of crystallographic and reactivity data, as well as theoretical results, that indicate a highly non-canonical bonding situation in many members of this series. These must actually be interpreted as coordination compounds, in which carbon serves as a 'central atom' that interacts with its 'ligand sphere' via donor-acceptor bonds, even if these internal ligands themselves are carbon based. This captodative description is not limited to compounds that supposedly comprise a carbon(0) centre, a peculiar oxidation state that can be probed experimentally by geminal diauration. As the available data suggest that this unconventional interpretation of C-C and C-X bonds is more generally applicable than previously anticipated, it may well affect our understanding of organic chemistry in general.",chemistry
Nanostructured functional materials prepared by atom transfer radical polymerization.,"Atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) is the most extensively studied controlled/living radical polymerization (CRP) method, with the interest originating primarily in its simplicity and broad applicability, and in the ability to prepare previously inaccessible well-defined nanostructured polymeric materials. This review illustrates the range of well-defined advanced functional materials that can be prepared by ATRP. We detail the precise synthesis of macromolecules with predetermined molecular weight, designed molecular weight distribution, controlled topology, composition and functionality. The materials include polymers with site-specific functionalities and novel architectures that are starting to find commercial application--such as stars, bottle brushes, block and gradient copolymers. This is followed by discussing their self-assembly into materials with nanoscale morphologies. These macromolecular engineering procedures provide new avenues to nanostructured functional materials for many high-value applications, for example as thermoplastic elastomers, coatings, surfactants, dispersants and as optoelectronic and biomedical materials.",chemistry
"Metal-catalysed 1,2-diamination reactions.","The 1,2-diamine motif is present in a number of natural products with interesting biological activity and in many important pharmaceutical agents. Chiral 1,2-diamines are also widely used as the control elements in asymmetric synthesis and catalysis. Such compounds are thus an attractive target for the synthetic chemist. Although the diamination of an alkene seems an obvious route to these structures, far less research has been devoted to it than to the analogous dihydroxylation or aminohydroxylation reactions that are well-established processes in asymmetric synthesis. Here, we examine recent advances in metal-catalysed diamination reactions and their asymmetric variants. Given the prevalence of these structures, it seems likely that they will find extensive application in the construction of natural products and drug molecules in the near future.",chemistry
Manipulating single-wall carbon nanotubes by chemical doping and charge transfer with perylene dyes.,"Single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are emerging as materials with much potential in several disciplines, in particular in electronics and photovoltaics. The combination of SWNTs with electron donors or acceptors generates active materials, which can produce electrical energy when irradiated. However, SWNTs are very elusive species when characterization of their metastable states is required. This problem mainly arises because of the polydispersive nature of SWNT samples and the inevitable presence of SWNTs in bundles of different sizes. Here, we report the complete and thorough characterization of an SWNT radical ion-pair state induced by complexation with a perylene dye, which combines excellent electron-accepting and -conducting features with a five-fused ring pi-system. At the same time, the perylene dye enables the dispersion of SWNTs by means of pi-pi interactions, which gives individual SWNTs in solution. This work clears a path towards electronic and optoelectronic devices in which regulated electrical transport properties are important.",chemistry
Force-activated reactivity switch in a bimolecular chemical reaction.,"The effect of mechanical force on the free-energy surface that governs a chemical reaction is largely unknown. The combination of protein engineering with single-molecule force-clamp spectroscopy allows us to study the influence of mechanical force on the rate at which a protein disulfide bond is reduced by nucleophiles in a bimolecular substitution reaction (S(N)2). We found that cleavage of a protein disulfide bond by hydroxide anions exhibits an abrupt reactivity 'switch' at approximately 500 pN, after which the accelerating effect of force on the rate of an S(N)2 chemical reaction greatly diminishes. We propose that an abrupt force-induced conformational change of the protein disulfide bond shifts its ground state, drastically changing its reactivity in S(N)2 chemical reactions. Our experiments directly demonstrate the action of a force-activated switch in the chemical reactivity of a single molecule.",chemistry
Chlorotrinitromethane and its exceptionally short carbon-chlorine bond.,"Compounds that deviate from the normal range of bonding can help to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the models currently used to describe chemical bonds. Furthermore, computer simulations of molecules require experimental data to describe accurately the energies and forces between interacting molecules. Compounds that contain the trinitromethyl group, with three nitro groups bonded to one carbon atom, show remarkable inter- and intramolecular effects. In this paper, we report the structural features of chlorotrinitromethane in the solid state and present the first reliable solid-state geometry parameters of an alpha-halogen derivative of the trinitromethyl pseudohalogen. We found several intriguing geometrical features in terms of intra- and intermolecular interactions, as well as an exceptionally short carbon-chlorine bond (1.694(1) A). Using a combined crystallographic and computational approach, we show that these effects can be described in terms of the computed electrostatic potential of the molecular surface.",chemistry
Concise synthesis of ricciocarpin A and discovery of a more potent analogue.,"Cascade reactions enable the rapid build-up of molecular complexity from relatively simple starting materials. Both rapid construction and the ability to prepare related structures are crucial to the study of biological activities. Here, we report an efficient, highly enantioselective and diastereoselective total synthesis of ricciocarpin A. The key feature of the synthesis is a one-pot, three-step, organocatalytic reductive Michael-Tishchenko cascade. The conciseness and flexibility of this approach not only resulted in the synthesis of the natural product, but also of its antipode and four other structural analogues. A preliminary biological evaluation of these compounds identified an analogue with significantly improved molluscicidal activity.",chemistry
Spongy chalcogels of non-platinum metals act as effective hydrodesulfurization catalysts.,"Aerogels are low-density porous materials, made mostly of air, for which hundreds of applications have been found in recent years. Inorganic oxide-based aerogels have been known for a long time, carbon aerogels were discovered in the early 1990s and sulfur- and selenium-based aerogels (chalcogels) are the most recent additions to this family. Here we present new aerogels made of Co(Ni)-Mo(W)-S networks with extremely large surface areas and porosity. These systems are formed by the coordinative reactions of (MoS(4))(2-) and (WS(4))(2-) with Co(2+) and Ni(2+) salts in non-aqueous solvents. We show that these low-density sponge-like networks can absorb conjugated organic molecules and mercury ions, and preferentially adsorb CO(2) over H(2), which illustrates their high potential as gas-separation media. The chalcogels are shown to be twice as active as the conventional sulfided Co-Mo/Al(2)O(3) catalyst for the hydrodesulfurization of thiophene.",chemistry
Stellated polyhedral assembly of a topologically complicated Pd4L4 'Solomon cube'.,"Metallosupramolecular chemistry relies on self-assembly processes in which complicated species form through labile dative-covalent interactions. Two remarkable areas of this chemistry are the synthesis of topologically complicated threaded assemblies and of three-dimensional (3D) polyhedral assemblies. Very few polyhedral 3D metallosupramolecular assemblies show threaded motifs within them. Here we report an example of a new type of threaded 3D metallosupramolecular assembly built from four organic ligands and four palladium ions, a Pd(4)L(4) so-called 'Solomon's cube' in which interweaving and twisting of the ligands form both Solomon's links and figure-of-eight ring motifs. In the solid state, six of these Pd(4)L(4) tetramers assemble into a hollow spheroid that closely resembles a stellated truncated hexahedron.",chemistry
Room-temperature molecular-resolution characterization of self-assembled organic monolayers on epitaxial graphene.,"Graphene, a two-dimensional sheet of carbon atoms, is a promising material for next-generation technology because of its advantageous electronic properties, such as extremely high carrier mobilities. However, chemical functionalization schemes are needed to integrate graphene with the diverse range of materials required for device applications. In this paper, we report self-assembled monolayers of the molecular semiconductor perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) formed on epitaxial graphene grown on the SiC(0001) surface. The molecules possess long-range order with a herringbone arrangement, as shown by ultra-high vacuum scanning tunnelling microscopy at room temperature. The molecular ordering is unperturbed by defects in the epitaxial graphene or atomic steps in the underlying SiC surface. Scanning tunnelling spectra of the PTCDA monolayer show distinct features that are not observed on pristine graphene. The demonstration of robust, uniform organic functionalization of epitaxial graphene presents opportunities for graphene-based molecular electronics and sensors.",chemistry
Protecting-group-free synthesis as an opportunity for invention.,"The constant pressure to prepare compounds in a more efficient manner has placed the process by which traditional synthetic chemistry is conducted under scrutiny. Areas that have the potential to be improved must be highlighted and modified, so that we can approach the criterion of the 'ideal synthesis'. One area that offers this prospect is the minimization of the use of protecting groups in synthesis. A protection/deprotection event introduces at least two steps into a sequence, incurring costs from additional reagents and waste disposal, and generally leads to a reduced overall yield. Here we present relevant historical context and highlight recent (post-2004) total syntheses that have developed new chemistry in an effort to exclude protecting groups. The invention of chemoselective methodologies is crucial to the execution of 'protecting-group-free' synthesis, and recent advances in this area are also highlighted.",chemistry
The rise of fragment-based drug discovery.,"The search for new drugs is plagued by high attrition rates at all stages in research and development. Chemists have an opportunity to tackle this problem because attrition can be traced back, in part, to the quality of the chemical leads. Fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) is a new approach, increasingly used in the pharmaceutical industry, for reducing attrition and providing leads for previously intractable biological targets. FBDD identifies low-molecular-weight ligands ( approximately 150 Da) that bind to biologically important macromolecules. The three-dimensional experimental binding mode of these fragments is determined using X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy, and is used to facilitate their optimization into potent molecules with drug-like properties. Compared with high-throughput-screening, the fragment approach requires fewer compounds to be screened, and, despite the lower initial potency of the screening hits, offers more efficient and fruitful optimization campaigns. Here, we review the rise of FBDD, including its application to discovering clinical candidates against targets for which other chemistry approaches have struggled.",chemistry
Specific fluorogenic probes for ozone in biological and atmospheric samples.,"Ozone exposure is a growing global health problem, especially in urban areas. While ozone in the stratosphere protects the earth from harmful ultraviolet light, tropospheric or ground-level ozone is toxic and can damage the respiratory tract. It has recently been shown that ozone may be produced endogenously in inflammation and antibacterial responses of the immune system; however, these results have sparked controversy owing to the use of a non-specific colorimetric probe. Here we report the synthesis of fluorescent molecular probes able to unambiguously detect ozone in both biological and atmospheric samples. Unlike other ozone-detection methods, in which interference from different reactive oxygen species is often a problem, these probes are ozone specific. Such probes will prove useful for the study of ozone in environmental science and biology, and so possibly provide some insight into the role of ozone in cells.",chemistry
Chiral imprinting of palladium with cinchona alkaloids.,"In the search for new materials and concepts in materials science, metallo-organic hybrids are attractive candidates; they can combine the rich diversity of organic molecules with the advantages of metals. Transition metals such as palladium are widely applied in catalysis, and small organic molecules such as those in the cinchona alkaloid family can control the stereochemistry of a number of organic reactions. Here, we show that reducing a metal salt in the presence of a cinchona alkaloid dopant gives a chirally imprinted metallo-organic hybrid material that is catalytically active and shows moderate enantioselectivity in hydrogenation. Furthermore, using photoelectron emission spectroscopy, we show that the metal retains some chiral character even after extraction of the dopant. This simple and effective methodology opens exciting opportunities for developing a variety of chiral composite materials.",chemistry
Sequence-independent and rapid long-range charge transfer through DNA.,"Interest in using DNA as a building block for nanoelectronic sensors and devices stems from its efficient hole-conducting properties and the relative ease with which it can be organized into predictable nanometre-sized two- and three-dimensional structures. However, because a hole migrates along DNA through the highest occupied molecular orbital of the guanine bases, its conductivity decreases as the adenine-thymine base-pair content increases. This means that there are limitations on what sequences can be used to construct functional nanoelectronic circuits, particularly those rich in adenine-thymine pairs. Here we show that the charge-transfer efficiency can be dramatically increased in a manner independent of guanine-cytosine content by adjusting the highest occupied molecular orbital level of the adenine-thymine base pair to be closer to that of the guanine-cytosine pair. This is achieved by substituting the N7 nitrogen atom of adenine with a C-H group to give 7-deazaadenine, which does not disturb the complementary base pairing observed in DNA.",chemistry
G-quadruplex self-assembly regulated by Coulombic interactions.,"Self-assembly offers the possibility to organize molecules in a given architecture through a subtle interplay between different noncovalent interactions. Although the kind of molecular association can often be predicted from information present in the individual molecules, the synthesis of supramolecular assemblies having a perfectly defined size and shape remains challenging. Here, we introduce the use of Coulombic interactions to control the supramolecular synthesis of finite, well-defined nanostructures. In particular, we demonstrate that the energy associated with the separation of ion pairs can regulate very precisely guanosine self-assembly into discrete G-quadruplexes. Assemblies comprising 8, 12, 16 or 24 guanosine molecules can be selectively and quantitatively obtained simply by tuning the stabilization of the dissociated anions in the solvent environment. Thus, factors such as solvent polarity, the nature of the anion and the cation-anion distance are shown to have a decisive role in the growth of G-quadruplexes.",chemistry
Using small molecules to facilitate exchange of bicarbonate and chloride anions across liposomal membranes.,"Bicarbonate is involved in a wide range of biological processes, which include respiration, regulation of intracellular pH and fertilization. In this study we use a combination of NMR spectroscopy and ion-selective electrode techniques to show that the natural product prodigiosin, a tripyrrolic molecule produced by microorganisms such as Streptomyces and Serratia, facilitates chloride/bicarbonate exchange (antiport) across liposomal membranes. Higher concentrations of simple synthetic molecules based on a 4,6-dihydroxyisophthalamide core are also shown to facilitate this antiport process. Although it is well known that proteins regulate Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchange in cells, these results suggest that small molecules may also be able to regulate the concentration of these anions in biological systems.",chemistry
Activating catalysts with mechanical force.,"Homogeneously catalysed reactions can be 'switched on' by activating latent catalysts. Usually, activation is brought about by heat or an external chemical agent. However, activation of homogeneous catalysts with a mechanical trigger has not been demonstrated. Here, we introduce a general method to activate latent catalysts by mechanically breaking bonds between a metal and one of its ligands. We have found that silver(I) complexes of polymer-functionalized N-heterocyclic carbenes, which are latent organocatalysts, catalyse a transesterification reaction when exposed to ultrasound in solution. Furthermore, ultrasonic activation of a ruthenium biscarbene complex with appended polymer chains results in catalysis of olefin metathesis reactions. In each case, the catalytic activity results from ligand dissociation, brought about by transfer of mechanical forces from the polymeric substituents to the coordination bond. Mechanochemical catalyst activation has potential applications in transduction and amplification of mechanical signals, and mechanically initiated polymerizations hold promise as a novel repair mechanism in self-healing materials.",chemistry
A unique approach to aldol products for the creation of all-carbon quaternary stereocentres.,"Among the challenges facing asymmetric synthesis the selective construction of quaternary stereogenic centres, particularly those bearing all-carbon substituents, stands out. The aldol reaction has the potential to create such stereocentres, but, despite the many advances in this field, a highly selective and efficient procedure has remained elusive. Here we show that, by choosing an alternative retrosynthetic approach, such products can be prepared in a highly selective fashion. Through the consecutive addition of several organometallic derivatives, an allylzinc reagent is prepared and, on addition to an aldehyde, an aldol-type product is created. The one-pot operation involves the construction of three new carbon-carbon bonds and the formation of an all-carbon quaternary stereocentre. The products of the reaction are amenable to downstream modification, and the procedure should find applications in the fields of natural product synthesis and drug discovery.",chemistry
A tri-continuous mesoporous material with a silica pore wall following a hexagonal minimal surface.,"Ordered porous materials with unique pore structures and pore sizes in the mesoporous range (2-50 nm) have many applications in catalysis, separation and drug delivery. Extensive research has resulted in mesoporous materials with one-dimensional, cage-like and bi-continuous pore structures. Three families of bi-continuous mesoporous materials have been made, with two interwoven but unconnected channels, corresponding to the liquid crystal phases used as templates. Here we report a three-dimensional hexagonal mesoporous silica, IBN-9, with a tri-continuous pore structure that is synthesized using a specially designed cationic surfactant template. IBN-9 consists of three identical continuous interpenetrating channels, which are separated by a silica wall that follows a hexagonal minimal surface. Such a tri-continuous mesostructure was predicted mathematically, but until now has not been observed in real materials.",chemistry
Mobius aromaticity and antiaromaticity in expanded porphyrins.,"Aromaticity is a key concept in chemistry, dating back to Faraday's discovery of benzene in 1825 and Kekule's famous alternating-double-bond structure of 1865. In 1858, the Mobius strip was discovered by Mobius and Listing. The Huckel rules for predicting aromaticity, stating that [4n + 2] pi electrons result in an aromatic system, work for planar molecules. Although molecules with Mobius geometry are not found in nature, chemists have tried to synthesize such molecules since the first theoretical prediction by Heilbronner in 1964 and the prediction of Mobius aromaticity for suitable compounds with [4n] pi electrons. However, Mobius-aromatic molecules have proved difficult to synthesize, and sometimes even to identify. Here we summarize recent contributions of several research groups that have succeeded in synthesizing Mobius-type molecules. The results of this survey lead us to suggest that the generation of Mobius topologies in expanded porphyrins is easier than hitherto appreciated.",chemistry
Compressed alkanes in reversible encapsulation complexes.,"Simple alkanes feature fully extended conformations as their lowest-energy shapes but can assume coiled, compressed conformations in small spaces. A series of normal alkanes, C(16) to C(19), were encapsulated in self-assembled, hydrogen-bonded complexes. Coiling of the longer alkanes was observed by NMR spectroscopy. The coiling exerts pressure on the interior; the hydrogen bonding seams are loosened, and rotation of the capsule's components occurs on the NMR timescale. The rotation results in interconversion of mirror-image capsule assemblies (racemization). The racemization rates were determined and shown to increase with the length of the alkane, the longer alkanes exerting more pressure. Free energies of activation for racemization were determined at the coalescence temperatures, and were DeltaGdouble dagger = 15.7, 16.7 and 17.2 kcal mol(-1) for C(19), C(18) and C(17), respectively. The shorter C(16) was encapsulated in its fully extended conformation, and does not seem to exert pressure inside the capsule.",chemistry
Polymer nanofibre junctions of attolitre volume serve as zeptomole-scale chemical reactors.,"Methods allowing chemical reactions to be carried out on ultra-small scales in a controllable fashion are potentially important for a number of disciplines, including molecular electronics, photonics and molecular biology, and may provide fundamental insight into chemistry in confined spaces. Ultra-small-scale reactions also circumvent potential problems associated with reagent and product toxicity, and reduce energy consumption and waste generation. Here, we report a technique for performing chemical reactions on a zeptomole (10(-21) mol) scale. We show that electrospun polymer nanofibres with a diameter of 100-300 nm can be loaded with reactants, and that the junctions formed between crossed nanofibres can function as attolitre-volume reactors. Exposure to heat or solvent vapours fuses the fibres and initiates the reaction. The reaction products can be analysed directly within the nanofibre junctions by fluorescence measurements and mass spectrometry, and solvent extraction of multiple reactors allows product identification by common micromethods such as high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.",chemistry
Halogen bonds as orthogonal molecular interactions to hydrogen bonds.,"Halogen bonds (X-bonds) are shown to be geometrically perpendicular to and energetically independent of hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) that share a common carbonyl oxygen acceptor. This orthogonal relationship is accommodated by the in-plane and out-of-plane electronegative potentials of the oxygen, which are differentially populated by H- and X-bonds. Furthermore, the local conformation of a peptide helps to define the geometry of the H-bond and thus the oxygen surface that is accessible for X-bonding. These electrostatic and steric forces conspire to impose a strong preference for the orthogonal geometry of X- and H-bonds. Thus, the optimum geometry of an X-bond can be predicted from the pattern of H-bonds in a folded protein, enabling X-bonds to be introduced to improve ligand affinities without disrupting these structurally important interactions. This concept of orthogonal molecular interactions can be exploited for the rational design of halogenated ligands as inhibitors and drugs, and in biomolecular engineering.",chemistry
Imaging intracellular viscosity of a single cell during photoinduced cell death.,"Diffusion-mediated cellular processes, such as metabolism, signalling and transport, depend on the hydrodynamic properties of the intracellular matrix. Photodynamic therapy, used in the treatment of cancer, relies on the generation of short-lived cytotoxic agents within a cell on irradiation of a drug. The efficacy of this treatment depends on the viscosity of the medium through which the cytotoxic agent must diffuse. Here, spectrally resolved fluorescence measurements of a porphyrin-dimer-based molecular rotor are used to quantify intracellular viscosity changes in single cells. We show that there is a dramatic increase in the viscosity of the immediate environment of the rotor on photoinduced cell death. The effect of this viscosity increase is observed directly in the diffusion-dependent kinetics of the photosensitized formation and decay of a key cytotoxic agent, singlet molecular oxygen. Using these tools, we provide insight into the dynamics of diffusion in cells, which is pertinent to drug delivery, cell signalling and intracellular mass transport.",chemistry
Catalytic behaviour of dense hot water.,"Water is known to exhibit fascinating physical properties at high pressure and temperature. Its remarkable structural and phase complexities suggest the possibility of exotic chemical reactivity under extreme conditions, although this remains largely unstudied. Detonations of high explosives containing oxygen and hydrogen produce water at thousands of kelvin and tens of gigapascals, similar to conditions in the interiors of giant planets. These systems thus provide a unique means of elucidating the chemistry of 'extreme water'. Here, we show that water has an unexpected role in catalysing complex explosive reactions--contrary to the current view that it is simply a stable detonation product. Using first-principles atomistic simulations of the detonation of the high explosive pentaerythritol tetranitrate, we discovered that H(2)O (source), H (reducer) and OH (oxidizer) act as a dynamic team that transports oxygen between reaction centres. Our finding suggests that water may catalyse reactions in other explosives and in planetary interiors.",chemistry
Minimal nucleotide duplex formation in water through enclathration in self-assembled hosts.,"Short nucleotide fragments such as mono- and dinucleotides are generally unable to form stable hydrogen-bonded base pairs or duplexes in water. Within the hydrophobic pockets of enzymes, however, even short fragments form stable duplexes to transmit genetic information. Here, we demonstrate the efficient formation of hydrogen-bonded base pairs from mononucleotides in water through enclathration in the hydrophobic cavities of self-assembled cages. Crystallographic studies and 1H- and 15N-NMR spectroscopy clearly reveals pair-selective recognition of mononucleotides and the selective formation of an anti-Hoogsteen-type base pair in the cage's cavity. Within an analogous expanded cage, dinucleotides are also found to form a stable duplex in water. These results emphasize how hydrogen-bonded base pairing is amplified in a local hydrophobic area isolated from aqueous solution.",chemistry
Spontaneous assembly and real-time growth of micrometre-scale tubular structures from polyoxometalate-based inorganic solids.,"We report the spontaneous and rapid growth of micrometre-scale tubes from crystals of a metal oxide-based inorganic solid when they are immersed in an aqueous solution containing a low concentration of an organic cation. A membrane immediately forms around the crystal, and this membrane then forms micrometre-scale tubes that grow with vast aspect ratios at controllable rates along the surface on which the crystal is placed. The tubes are composed of an amorphous mixture of polyoxometalate-based anions and organic cations. It is possible for liquid to flow through the tubes, and for the direction of growth and the overall tube diameter to be controlled. We demonstrate that tube growth is driven by osmotic pressure within the membrane sack around the crystal, which ruptures to release the pressure. These robust, self-growing, micrometre-scale tubes offer opportunities in many areas, including the growth of microfluidic devices and the self-assembly of metal oxide-based semipermeable membranes for diverse applications.",chemistry
Towards the computational design of solid catalysts.,"Over the past decade the theoretical description of surface reactions has undergone a radical development. Advances in density functional theory mean it is now possible to describe catalytic reactions at surfaces with the detail and accuracy required for computational results to compare favourably with experiments. Theoretical methods can be used to describe surface chemical reactions in detail and to understand variations in catalytic activity from one catalyst to another. Here, we review the first steps towards using computational methods to design new catalysts. Examples include screening for catalysts with increased activity and catalysts with improved selectivity. We discuss how, in the future, such methods may be used to engineer the electronic structure of the active surface by changing its composition and structure.",chemistry
The 'wired' universe of organic chemistry.,"The millions of reactions performed and compounds synthesized by organic chemists over the past two centuries connect to form a network larger than the metabolic networks of higher organisms and rivalling the complexity of the World Wide Web. Despite its apparent randomness, the network of chemistry has a well-defined, modular architecture. The network evolves in time according to trends that have not changed since the inception of the discipline, and thus project into chemistry's future. Analysis of organic chemistry using the tools of network theory enables the identification of most 'central' organic molecules, and for the prediction of which and how many molecules will be made in the future. Statistical analyses based on network connectivity are useful in optimizing parallel syntheses, in estimating chemical reactivity, and more.",chemistry
Asymmetric total syntheses of (+)- and (-)-versicolamide B and biosynthetic implications.,"The Diels-Alder reaction is one of the most well-studied, synthetically useful organic transformations. While a significant number of naturally occurring substances are postulated to arise by biosynthetic Diels-Alder reactions, rigorous confirmation of a mechanistically distinct natural Diels-Alderase enzyme remains elusive. Within this context, several related fungi within the Aspergillus genus produce a number of metabolites of opposite absolute configuration including (+)- or (-)-versicolamide B. These alkaloids are hypothesized to arise via biosynthetic Diels-Alder reactions implying that each Aspergillus species possesses enantiomerically distinct Diels-Alderases. Herein, experimental validation of these biosynthetic proposals via deployment of the IMDA reaction as a key step in the asymmetric total syntheses of (+)- and (-)-versicolamide B is described. Laboratory validation of the proposed biosynthetic Diels-Alder construction, coupled with the secondary metabolite profile of the producing fungi, reveals that each Aspergillus species has evolved enantiomerically distinct indole oxidases, as well as enantiomerically distinct Diels-Alderases.",chemistry
