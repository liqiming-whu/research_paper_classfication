Genome mining- and synthetic biology-enabled production of hypermodified peptides.,"The polytheonamides are among the most complex and biosynthetically distinctive natural products known to date. These potent peptide cytotoxins are derived from a ribosomal precursor processed by 49 mostly non-canonical posttranslational modifications. As the producer is a 'microbial dark matter' bacterium only distantly related to any cultivated organism, >70-step chemical syntheses have been developed to access these unique compounds. Here, we mined prokaryotic diversity to establish a synthetic platform based on the new host Microvirgula aerodenitrificans that produces hypermodified peptides within two days. Using this system, we generated the aeronamides, new polytheonamide-type compounds with near-picomolar cytotoxicity. Aeronamides, as well as the polygeonamides produced from deep-rock biosphere DNA, contain the highest numbers of D-amino acids in known biomolecules. With increasing bacterial genomes being sequenced, similar host mining strategies might become feasible to access further elusive natural products from uncultivated life.",2
Towards the online computer-aided design of catalytic pockets.,"The engineering of catalysts with desirable properties can be accelerated by computer-aided design. To achieve this aim, features of molecular catalysts can be condensed into numerical descriptors that can then be used to correlate reactivity and structure. Based on such descriptors, we have introduced topographic steric maps that provide a three-dimensional image of the catalytic pocket-the region of the catalyst where the substrate binds and reacts-enabling it to be visualized and also reshaped by changing various parameters. These topographic steric maps, especially when used in conjunction with density functional theory calculations, enable catalyst structural modifications to be explored quickly, making the online design of new catalysts accessible to the wide chemical community. In this Perspective, we discuss the application of topographic steric maps either to rationalize the behaviour of known catalysts-from synthetic molecular species to metalloenzymes-or to design improved catalysts.",2
On-surface synthesis and characterization of individual polyacetylene chains.,"Polyacetylene (PA) comprises one-dimensional chains of sp(2)-hybridized carbon atoms that may take a cis or trans configuration. Owing to its simple chemical structure and exceptional electronic properties, PA is an ideal system to understand the nature of charge transport in conducting polymers. Here, we report the on-surface synthesis of both cis- and trans-PA chains and their atomic-scale characterization. The structure of individual PA chains was imaged by non-contact atomic force microscopy, which confirmed the formation of PA by resolving single chemical bond units. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy suggests a semiconductor-to-metal transition through doping-induced suppression of the Peierls bond alternation of trans-PA on Cu(110). Electronically decoupled trans-PAs exhibit a band gap of 2.4 eV following copper oxide intercalation. Our study provides a platform for studying individual PA chains in real and reciprocal space, which may be further extended to study the intrinsic properties of non-linear excitons in conducting polymers.",2
A closed cycle for esterifying aromatic hydrocarbons with CO2 and alcohol.,"The ability to functionalize hydrocarbons with CO2 could create opportunities for high-volume CO2 utilization. However, current methods to form carbon-carbon bonds between hydrocarbons and CO2 require stoichiometric consumption of very resource-intensive reagents to overcome the low reactivity of these substrates. Here, we report a simple semi-continuous cycle that converts aromatic hydrocarbons, CO2 and alcohol into aromatic esters without consumption of stoichiometric reagents. Our strategy centres on the use of solid bases composed of an alkali carbonate (M2CO3, where M(+) = K(+) or Cs(+)) dispersed over a mesoporous support. Nanoscale confinement disrupts the crystallinity of M2CO3 and engenders strong base reactivity at intermediate temperatures. The overall cycle involves two distinct steps: (1) CO3(2-)-promoted C-H carboxylation, in which the hydrocarbon substrate is deprotonated by the supported M2CO3 and reacts with CO2 to form a supported carboxylate (RCO2M); and (2) methylation, in which RCO2M reacts with methanol and CO2 to form an isolable methyl ester with concomitant regeneration of M2CO3.",2
The mechanisms of boronate ester formation and fluorescent turn-on in ortho-aminomethylphenylboronic acids.,"ortho-Aminomethylphenylboronic acids are used in receptors for carbohydrates and various other compounds containing vicinal diols. The presence of the o-aminomethyl group enhances the affinity towards diols at neutral pH, and the manner in which this group plays this role has been a topic of debate. Further, the aminomethyl group is believed to be involved in the turn-on of the emission properties of appended fluorophores upon diol binding. In this treatise, a uniform picture emerges for the role of this group: it primarily acts as an electron-withdrawing group that lowers the pKa of the neighbouring boronic acid thereby facilitating diol binding at neutral pH. The amine appears to play no role in the modulation of the fluorescence of appended fluorophores in the protic-solvent-inserted form of the boronic acid/boronate ester. Instead, fluorescence turn-on can be consistently tied to vibrational-coupled excited-state relaxation (a loose-bolt effect). Overall, this Review unifies and discusses the existing data as of 2019 whilst also highlighting why o-aminomethyl groups are so widely used, and the role they play in carbohydrate sensing using phenylboronic acids.",2
Formation of carbon-nitrogen bonds in carbon monoxide electrolysis.,"The electroreduction of CO2 is a promising technology for carbon utilization. Although electrolysis of CO2 or CO2-derived CO can generate important industrial multicarbon feedstocks such as ethylene, ethanol, n-propanol and acetate, most efforts have been devoted to promoting C-C bond formation. Here, we demonstrate that C-N bonds can be formed through co-electrolysis of CO and NH3 with acetamide selectivity of nearly 40% at industrially relevant reaction rates. Full-solvent quantum mechanical calculations show that acetamide forms through nucleophilic addition of NH3 to a surface-bound ketene intermediate, a step that is in competition with OH(-) addition, which leads to acetate. The C-N formation mechanism was successfully extended to a series of amide products through amine nucleophilic attack on the ketene intermediate. This strategy enables us to form carbon-heteroatom bonds through the electroreduction of CO, expanding the scope of products available from CO2 reduction.",2
Building in vitro transcriptional regulatory networks by successively integrating multiple functional circuit modules.,"The regulation of cellular dynamics and responses to stimuli by genetic regulatory networks suggests how in vitro chemical reaction networks might analogously direct the dynamics of synthetic materials or chemistries. A key step in developing genetic regulatory network analogues capable of this type of sophisticated regulation is the integration of multiple coordinated functions within a single network. Here, we demonstrate how such functional integration can be achieved using in vitro transcriptional genelet circuits that emulate essential features of cellular genetic regulatory networks. By successively incorporating functional genelet modules into a bistable circuit, we construct an integrated regulatory network that dynamically changes its state in response to upstream stimuli and coordinates the timing of downstream signal expression. We use quantitative models to guide module integration and develop strategies to mitigate undesired interactions between network components that arise as the size of the network increases. This approach could enable the construction of in vitro networks capable of multifaceted chemical and material regulation.",2
Identifying the components of the solid-electrolyte interphase in Li-ion batteries.,"The importance of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) for reversible operation of Li-ion batteries has been well established, but the understanding of its chemistry remains incomplete. The current consensus on the identity of the major organic SEI component is that it consists of lithium ethylene di-carbonate (LEDC), which is thought to have high Li-ion conductivity, but low electronic conductivity (to protect the Li/C electrode). Here, we report on the synthesis and structural and spectroscopic characterizations of authentic LEDC and lithium ethylene mono-carbonate (LEMC). Direct comparisons of the SEI grown on graphite anodes suggest that LEMC, instead of LEDC, is likely to be the major SEI component. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies on LEMC and lithium methyl carbonate (LMC) reveal unusual layered structures and Li(+) coordination environments. LEMC has Li(+) conductivities of >1 x 10(-6) S cm(-1), while LEDC is almost an ionic insulator. The complex interconversions and equilibria of LMC, LEMC and LEDC in dimethyl sulfoxide solutions are also investigated.",2
"Back-bonding between an electron-poor, high-oxidation-state metal and poor pi-acceptor ligand in a uranium(V)-dinitrogen complex.","A fundamental bonding model in coordination and organometallic chemistry is the synergic, donor-acceptor interaction between a metal and a neutral pi-acceptor ligand, in which the ligand sigma donates to the metal, which pi back-bonds to the ligand. This interaction typically involves a metal with an electron-rich, mid-, low- or even negative oxidation state and a ligand with a pi* orbital. Here, we report that treatment of a uranium-carbene complex with an organoazide produces a uranium(V)-bis(imido)-dinitrogen complex, stabilized by a lithium counterion. This complex, which was isolated in a crystalline form, involves an electron-poor, high-oxidation-state uranium(V) 5f(1) ion that is pi back-bonded to the poor pi-acceptor ligand dinitrogen. We propose that this is made possible by a combination of cooperative heterobimetallic uranium-lithium effects and the presence of suitable ancillary ligands that render the uranium ion unusually electron rich. This electron-poor back-bonding could have implications for the field of dinitrogen activation.",2
Incorporation of clusters within inorganic materials through their addition during nucleation steps.,"Nanomaterials are known to display chemical and physical behaviours that are different from those of their bulk counterparts, but assembly processes in the sub-nanometre region are difficult to control. The early growth of nanomaterials is typically thought to involve two separate steps: nucleation and the growth stage, as described by the LaMer model. Control of the shape and size of the final structure is typically determined during the growth stage by interactions between the nuclei and surrounding monomers. Here, we show that clusters with well-defined structures, such as polyoxometalates, can intervene at the nucleation stage of nickel oxysulfide and nickel-cobalt hydroxide by co-assembling with nuclei to produce uniform binary assemblies. Those can, in turn, incorporate a third, or also a fourth, type of nanocluster to form ternary or quaternary assemblies, respectively. Both binary and ternary assemblies are shown to serve as efficient atomic-site catalysts for room-temperature gasoline desulfurization and stereoselective catalytic reactions.",2
Ultra-fast intramolecular singlet fission to persistent multiexcitons by molecular design.,"Singlet fission-that is, the generation of two triplets from a lone singlet state-has recently resurfaced as a promising process for the generation of multiexcitons in organic systems. Although advances in this area have led to the discovery of modular classes of chromophores, controlling the fate of the multiexciton states has been a major challenge; for example, promoting fast multiexciton generation while maintaining long triplet lifetimes. Unravelling the dynamical evolution of the spin- and energy conversion processes from the transition of singlet excitons to correlated triplet pairs and individual triplet excitons is necessary to design materials that are optimized for translational technologies. Here, we engineer molecules featuring a discrete energy gradient that promotes the migration of strongly coupled triplet pairs to a spatially separated, weakly coupled state that readily dissociates into free triplets. This 'energy cleft' concept allows us to combine the amplification and migration processes within a single molecule, with rapid dissociation of tightly bound triplet pairs into individual triplets that exhibit lifetimes of ~20 micros.",2
Photosensitized oxidative addition to gold(I) enables alkynylative cyclization of o-alkylnylphenols with iodoalkynes.,"The well-established oxidative addition-reductive elimination pathway is the most followed one in transition metal-catalysed cross-coupling reactions. While readily occurring with a series of transition metals, gold(I) complexes have shown some reluctance to undergo oxidative addition unless special sets of ligands on gold(I), reagents or reaction conditions are used. Here we show that under visible-light irradiation, an iridium photocatalyst triggers-via triplet sensitization-the oxidative addition of an alkynyl iodide onto a vinylgold(I) intermediate to deliver C(sp)(2)-C(sp) coupling products after reductive elimination. Mechanistic and modelling studies support that an energy-transfer event takes place, rather than a redox pathway. This particular mode of activation in gold homogenous catalysis was applied in several dual catalytic processes. Alkynylbenzofuran derivatives were obtained from o-alkynylphenols and iodoalkynes in the presence of catalytic gold(I) and iridium(III) complexes under blue light-emitting diode irradiation.",2
"Heated gas bubbles enrich, crystallize, dry, phosphorylate and encapsulate prebiotic molecules.","Non-equilibrium conditions must have been crucial for the assembly of the first informational polymers of early life, by supporting their formation and continuous enrichment in a long-lasting environment. Here, we explore how gas bubbles in water subjected to a thermal gradient, a likely scenario within crustal mafic rocks on the early Earth, drive a complex, continuous enrichment of prebiotic molecules. RNA precursors, monomers, active ribozymes, oligonucleotides and lipids are shown to (1) cycle between dry and wet states, enabling the central step of RNA phosphorylation, (2) accumulate at the gas-water interface to drastically increase ribozymatic activity, (3) condense into hydrogels, (4) form pure crystals and (5) encapsulate into protecting vesicle aggregates that subsequently undergo fission. These effects occur within less than 30 min. The findings unite, in one location, the physical conditions that were crucial for the chemical emergence of biopolymers. They suggest that heated microbubbles could have hosted the first cycles of molecular evolution.",2
Ruthenium-catalysed oxidative conversion of ammonia into dinitrogen.,"Conversion of ammonia into dinitrogen has attracted broad scientific interest in relation to molecular models of the heterogeneous nitrogen fixation process, environmental treatment for denitrification and utilization of ammonia as an energy carrier. Here we show that some ruthenium complexes bearing 2,2'-bipyridyl-6,6'-dicarboxylate ligands work as catalysts for the ammonia oxidation reaction. Production of dinitrogen is observed when ammonium salts are treated with a triarylaminium radical as an oxidant and 2,4,6-collidine as a base in the presence of the ruthenium catalysts. Based on the characterization of some intermediates, we propose a reaction pathway via a bimetallic nitride-nitride coupling process. The proposed reaction pathway is supported by density functional theory calculations. Further investigation of the ammonia oxidation reaction under the electrochemical conditions revealed that the ruthenium complex works as a new anode catalyst for ammonia oxidation.",2
Morphology tuning of inorganic nanomaterials grown by precipitation through control of electrolytic dissociation and supersaturation.,"The precise control of the morphology of inorganic materials during their synthesis is important yet challenging. Here we report that the morphology of a wide range of inorganic materials, grown by rapid precipitation from a metal cation solution, can be tuned during their crystallization from one- to three-dimensional (1D to 3D) structures without the need for capping agents or templates. This control is achieved by adjusting the balance between the electrolytic dissociation (alpha) of the reactants and the supersaturation (S) of the solutions. Low-alpha, weak electrolytes promoted the growth of anisotropic (1D and 2D) samples, with 1D materials favoured in particular at low S. In contrast, isotropic 3D polyhedral structures could only be prepared in the presence of strong electrolyte reactants (alpha approximately 1) with low S. Using this strategy, a wide range of materials were prepared, including metal oxides, hydroxides, carbonates, molybdates, oxalates, phosphates, fluorides and iodate with a variety of morphologies.",2
Structural basis for stereoselective dehydration and hydrogen-bonding catalysis by the SAM-dependent pericyclase LepI.,"LepI is an S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent pericyclase that catalyses the formation of the 2-pyridone natural product leporin C. Biochemical characterization has shown that LepI can catalyse stereoselective dehydration to yield a reactive (E)-quinone methide that can undergo bifurcating intramolecular Diels-Alder (IMDA) and hetero-Diels-Alder (HDA) cyclizations from an ambimodal transition state, as well as a [3,3]-retro-Claisen rearrangement to recycle the IMDA product into leporin C. Here, we solve the X-ray crystal structures of SAM-bound LepI and in complex with a substrate analogue, the product leporin C, and a retro-Claisen reaction transition-state analogue to understand the structural basis for the multitude of reactions. Structural and mutational analysis reveals how nature evolves a classic methyltransferase active site into one that can serve as a dehydratase and a multifunctional pericyclase. Catalysis of both sets of reactions employs H133 and R295, two active-site residues that are not found in canonical methyltransferases. An alternative role of SAM, which is not found to be in direct contact with the substrate, is also proposed.",2
Enantioselective construction of remote tertiary carbon-fluorine bonds.,"The carbon-fluorine bond engenders distinctive physicochemical properties and significant changes to general reactivity. The development of catalytic, enantioselective methods to set stereocentres that contain a benzylic C-F bond is a rapidly evolving goal in synthetic chemistry. Although there have been notable advances that enable the construction of secondary stereocentres that contain both a C-F and a C-H bond on the same carbon, significantly fewer strategies are defined to access stereocentres that incorporate a tertiary C-F bond, especially those remote from pre-existing activating groups. Here we report a general method that establishes C-F tertiary benzylic stereocentres by forging a C-C bond via a Pd-catalysed enantioselective Heck reaction of acyclic alkenyl fluorides with arylboronic acids. This method provides a platform to rapidly incorporate significant functionality about the benzylic tertiary fluoride by virtue of the diversity of both reaction partners, as well as the ability to install the stereocentres remotely from pre-existing functional groups.",2
Kinetic modulation of graphene growth by fluorine through spatially confined decomposition of metal fluorides.,"Two-dimensional materials show a variety of promising properties, and controlling their growth is an important aspect for practical applications. To this end, active species such as hydrogen and oxygen are commonly introduced into reactors to promote the synthesis of two-dimensional materials with specific characteristics. Here, we demonstrate that fluorine can play a crucial role in tuning the growth kinetics of three representative two-dimensional materials (graphene, hexagonal boron nitride and WS2). When growing graphene by chemical vapour deposition on a copper foil, fluorine released from the decomposition of a metal fluoride placed near the copper foil greatly accelerates the growth of the graphene (up to a rate of ~200 mum s(-1)). Theoretical calculations show that it does so by promoting decomposition of the methane feedstock, which converts the endothermic growth process to an exothermic one. We further show that the presence of fluorine also accelerates the growth of two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride and WS2.",2
Ultrafast X-ray scattering reveals vibrational coherence following Rydberg excitation.,"The coherence and dephasing of vibrational motions of molecules constitute an integral part of chemical dynamics, influence material properties and underpin schemes to control chemical reactions. Considerable progress has been made in understanding vibrational coherence through spectroscopic measurements, but precise, direct measurement of the structure of a vibrating excited-state polyatomic organic molecule has remained unworkable. Here, we measure the time-evolving molecular structure of optically excited N-methylmorpholine through scattering with ultrashort X-ray pulses. The scattering signals are corrected for the differences in electron density in the excited electronic state of the molecule in comparison to the ground state. The experiment maps the evolution of the molecular geometry with femtosecond resolution, showing coherent motion that survives electronic relaxation and seems to persist for longer than previously seen using other methods.",2
Super-resolution imaging of non-fluorescent reactions via competition.,"Super-resolved fluorescence microscopy techniques have enabled substantial advances in the chemical and biological sciences. However, they can only interrogate entities that fluoresce, and most chemical or biological processes do not involve fluorescent species. Here we report a competition-enabled imaging technique with super-resolution (COMPEITS) that enables quantitative super-resolution imaging of non-fluorescent processes. It is based on the incorporation of competition into a single-molecule fluorescence-detection scheme. We demonstrate COMPEITS by investigating a photoelectrocatalytic reaction; we map, with nanometre precision, a non-fluorescent surface reaction that is important for water decontamination on single photocatalyst particles. The subparticle-level quantitative information of reactant adsorption affinities unambiguously decouples size- and shape-scaling laws on specific particle facets and uncovers a surprising biphasic shape dependence, leading to catalyst design principles for optimal reactant adsorption efficacy. With its ability to provide spatially resolved information on the behaviours of unlabelled, non-fluorescent entities under operando conditions, COMPEITS could interrogate a variety of surface processes in fields ranging from heterogeneous catalysis and materials engineering to nanotechnology and energy sciences.",2
Protein engineering through tandem transamidation.,"Semisynthetic proteins engineered to contain non-coded elements such as post-translational modifications (PTMs) represent a powerful class of tools for interrogating biological processes. Here, we introduce a one-pot, chemoenzymatic method that allows broad access to chemically modified proteins. The approach involves a tandem transamidation reaction cascade that integrates intein-mediated protein splicing with enzyme-mediated peptide ligation. We show that this approach can be used to introduce PTMs and biochemical probes into a range of proteins including Cas9 nuclease and the transcriptional regulator MeCP2, which causes Rett syndrome when mutated. The versatility of the approach is further illustrated through the chemical tailoring of histone proteins within a native chromatin setting. We expect our approach will extend the scope of semisynthesis in protein engineering.",2
Vibration-driven reaction of CO2 on Cu surfaces via Eley-Rideal-type mechanism.,"Understanding gas-surface reaction dynamics, such as the rupture and formation of bonds in vibrationally and translationally excited ('hot') molecules, is important to provide mechanistic insight into heterogeneous catalytic processes. Although it has been established that such excitation can affect the reactions occurring via dissociative mechanisms, for associative mechanisms-in which the gas-phase reactant collides directly with a surface-adsorbed species-only translational excitation has been observed to affect reactivity. Here we report a bond-formation reaction that is driven by the vibrational energy of reactant molecules and occurs via an (associative) Eley-Rideal-type mechanism, in which the reaction takes place in a single collision. Hot CO2 in a molecular beam is found to react with pre-adsorbed hydrogen atoms directly on cold Cu(111) and Cu(100) surfaces to form formate adspecies. The vibrational energy of CO2 is more effective at promoting the reaction than translational energy, the reaction rate is independent of the surface temperature and the experimental results are consistent with density functional theory calculations.",2
Enhanced reactivity of fluorine with para-hydrogen in cold interstellar clouds by resonance-induced quantum tunnelling.,"Chemical reactions are important in the evolution of low-temperature interstellar clouds, where the quantum tunnelling effect becomes significant. The F + para-H2 --> HF + H reaction, which has a significant barrier of 1.8 kcal mol(-1), is an important source of HF in interstellar clouds; however, the dynamics of this quantum-tunnelling-induced reactivity at low temperature is unknown. Here, we show that this quantum tunnelling is caused by a post-barrier resonance state. Quantum-state-resolved crossed-beam scattering measurements reveal that this resonance state has a collision energy of ~5 meV and a lifetime of ~80 fs, which are in excellent agreement with a recent anion photoelectron spectroscopic study. Accurate quantum reactive scattering calculations on the new iCSZ-LWAL potential energy surfaces provides a detailed explanation of the experimental results. The reaction rate for this system was also theoretically determined accurately at temperatures as low as 1 K.",2
Sequencing abasic sites in DNA at single-nucleotide resolution.,"In DNA, the loss of a nucleobase by hydrolysis generates an abasic site. Formed as a result of DNA damage, as well as a key intermediate during the base excision repair pathway, abasic sites are frequent DNA lesions that can lead to mutations and strand breaks. Here we present snAP-seq, a chemical approach that selectively exploits the reactive aldehyde moiety at abasic sites to reveal their location within DNA at single-nucleotide resolution. Importantly, the approach resolves abasic sites from other aldehyde functionalities known to exist in genomic DNA. snAP-seq was validated on synthetic DNA and then applied to two separate genomes. We studied the distribution of thymine modifications in the Leishmania major genome by enzymatically converting these modifications into abasic sites followed by abasic site mapping. We also applied snAP-seq directly to HeLa DNA to provide a map of endogenous abasic sites in the human genome.",2
Stimulus-responsive self-assembly of protein-based fractals by computational design.,"Fractal topologies, which are statistically self-similar over multiple length scales, are pervasive in nature. The recurrence of patterns in fractal-shaped branched objects, such as trees, lungs and sponges, results in a high surface area to volume ratio, which provides key functional advantages including molecular trapping and exchange. Mimicking these topologies in designed protein-based assemblies could provide access to functional biomaterials. Here we describe a computational design approach for the reversible self-assembly of proteins into tunable supramolecular fractal-like topologies in response to phosphorylation. Guided by atomic-resolution models, we develop fusions of Src homology 2 (SH2) domain or a phosphorylatable SH2-binding peptide, respectively, to two symmetric, homo-oligomeric proteins. Mixing the two designed components resulted in a variety of dendritic, hyperbranched and sponge-like topologies that are phosphorylation-dependent and self-similar over three decades (~10 nm-10 mum) of length scale, in agreement with models from multiscale computational simulations. Designed assemblies perform efficient phosphorylation-dependent capture and release of cargo proteins.",2
Modification and de novo design of non-ribosomal peptide synthetases using specific assembly points within condensation domains.,"Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are giant enzyme machines that activate amino acids in an assembly line fashion. As NRPSs are not restricted to the incorporation of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids, their efficient manipulation would enable microbial production of a diverse range of peptides; however, the structural requirements for reprogramming NRPSs to facilitate the production of new peptides are not clear. Here we describe a new fusion point inside the condensation domains of NRPSs that results in the development of the exchange unit condensation domain (XUC) concept, which enables the efficient production of peptides, even containing non-natural amino acids, in yields up to 280 mg l(-1). This allows the generation of more specific NRPSs, reducing the number of unwanted peptide derivatives, but also the generation of peptide libraries. The XUC might therefore be suitable for the future optimization of peptide production and the identification of bioactive peptide derivatives for pharmaceutical and other applications.",2
De novo macrocyclic peptides that specifically modulate Lys48-linked ubiquitin chains.,"A promising approach in cancer therapy is to find ligands that directly bind ubiquitin (Ub) chains. However, finding molecules capable of tightly and specifically binding Ub chains is challenging given the range of Ub polymer lengths and linkages and their subtle structural differences. Here, we use total chemical synthesis of proteins to generate highly homogeneous Ub chains for screening against trillion-member macrocyclic peptide libraries (RaPID system). De novo cyclic peptides were found that can bind tightly and specifically to K48-linked Ub chains, confirmed by NMR studies. These cyclic peptides protected K48-linked Ub chains from deubiquitinating enzymes and prevented proteasomal degradation of Ub-tagged proteins. The cyclic peptides could enter cells, inhibit growth and induce programmed cell death, opening new opportunities for therapeutic intervention. This highly synthetic approach, with both protein target generation and cyclic peptide discovery performed in vitro, will make other elaborate post-translationally modified targets accessible for drug discovery.",2
Overcoming chemical equilibrium limitations using a thermodynamically reversible chemical reactor.,"All real processes, be they chemical, mechanical or electrical, are thermodynamically irreversible and therefore suffer from thermodynamic losses. Here, we report the design and operation of a chemical reactor capable of approaching thermodynamically reversible operation. The reactor was employed for hydrogen production via the water-gas shift reaction, an important route to 'green' hydrogen. The reactor avoids mixing reactant gases by transferring oxygen from the (oxidizing) water stream to the (reducing) carbon monoxide stream via a solid-state oxygen reservoir consisting of a perovskite phase (La0.6Sr0.4FeO3-delta). This reservoir is able to remain close to equilibrium with the reacting gas streams because of its variable degree of non-stoichiometry and thus develops a 'chemical memory' that we employ to approach reversibility. We demonstrate this memory using operando, spatially resolved, real-time, high-resolution X-ray powder diffraction on a working reactor. The design leads to a reactor unconstrained by overall chemical equilibrium limitations, which can produce essentially pure hydrogen and carbon dioxide as separate product streams.",2
Side-impact collisions of Ar with NO.,"In the realm of molecular collision dynamics, stereochemistry refers to the dependence of the collision outcome on the mutual orientation of the colliding partners. This may involve directed end-on collisions along a molecular bond axis or encounters in which the partner approaches the bond of an oriented molecule from the side. Using both experiment and theory, we show here that in the simplest case of an inelastic collision between an atom and a nearly homonuclear diatom, in which the two atoms have almost the same mass, the scattering dynamics are very distinct for impacts on either side of the molecule. By recording the direction of the scattered particles after the collision, we demonstrate that the intensity of products scattered in the forward direction, near parallel to the initial motion, can be substantially controlled and even maximized by altering the side-on orientation of the quantum state selected NO molecules that collide with Ar atoms. In addition, our findings provide valuable information about the preferred collision mechanism and reveal interesting quantum interference effects.",2
A catalytically active [Mn]-hydrogenase incorporating a non-native metal cofactor.,"Nature carefully selects specific metal ions for incorporation into the enzymes that catalyse the chemical reactions necessary for life. Hydrogenases, enzymes that activate molecular H2, exclusively utilize Ni and Fe in [NiFe]-, [FeFe]- and [Fe]-hydrogeanses. However, other transition metals are known to activate or catalyse the production of hydrogen in synthetic systems. Here, we report the development of a biomimetic model complex of [Fe]-hydrogenase that incorporates a Mn, as opposed to a Fe, metal centre. This Mn complex is able to heterolytically cleave H2 as well as catalyse hydrogenation reactions. The incorporation of the model into an apoenzyme of [Fe]-hydrogenase results in a [Mn]-hydrogenase with an enhanced occupancy-normalized activity over an analogous semi-synthetic [Fe]-hydrogenase. These findings demonstrate a non-native metal hydrogenase that shows catalytic functionality and that hydrogenases based on a manganese active site are viable.",2
Unravelling mechanistic features of organocatalysis with in situ modifications at the secondary sphere.,"Secondary-sphere interactions serve a fundamental role in controlling the reactivity and selectivity of organometallic and enzymatic catalysts. However, there is a dearth of studies that explicitly incorporate secondary-sphere modifiers into organocatalytic systems. In this work, we introduce an approach for the in situ systematic modification of organocatalysts in their secondary sphere through dynamic covalent binding under the reaction conditions. As a proof-of-concept, we applied boronic acids as secondary-sphere modifiers of N-heterocyclic carbenes that contained a hydroxy handle. The bound system formed in the reaction mixture catalysed the enantioselective benzoin condensations of a challenging substrate class that contains electron-withdrawing groups. Linear regression coupled with data visualization served to pinpoint the divergent origins of enantioselectivity for different substrates and decision tree algorithms served to formulate selection criteria for the appropriate secondary-sphere modifiers. The combination of this highly modular catalytic approach with machine-learning techniques provided mechanistic insights and guided the streamlined optimization process of a gram-scale reaction at low organocatalyst loading.",2
Diverse compounds from pleuromutilin lead to a thioredoxin inhibitor and inducer of ferroptosis.,"The chemical diversification of natural products provides a robust and general method for the creation of stereochemically rich and structurally diverse small molecules. The resulting compounds have physicochemical traits different from those in most screening collections, and as such are an excellent source for biological discovery. Herein, we subject the diterpene natural product pleuromutilin to reaction sequences focused on creating ring system diversity in few synthetic steps. This effort resulted in a collection of compounds with previously unreported ring systems, providing a novel set of structurally diverse and highly complex compounds suitable for screening in a variety of different settings. Biological evaluation identified the novel compound ferroptocide, a small molecule that rapidly and robustly induces ferroptotic death of cancer cells. Target identification efforts and CRISPR knockout studies reveal that ferroptocide is an inhibitor of thioredoxin, a key component of the antioxidant system in the cell. Ferroptocide positively modulates the immune system in a murine model of breast cancer and will be a useful tool to study the utility of pro-ferroptotic agents for treatment of cancer.",2
Imaging defects and their evolution in a metal-organic framework at sub-unit-cell resolution.,"Defect engineering of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) offers promising opportunities for tailoring their properties to specific functions and applications. However, determining the structures of defects in MOFs-either point defects or extended ones-has proved challenging owing to the difficulty of directly probing local structures in these typically fragile crystals. Here we report the real-space observation, with sub-unit-cell resolution, of structural defects in the catalytic MOF UiO-66 using a combination of low-dose transmission electron microscopy and electron crystallography. Ordered 'missing linker' and 'missing cluster' defects were found to coexist. The missing-linker defects, reconstructed three-dimensionally with high precision, were attributed to terminating formate groups. The crystallization of the MOF was found to undergo an Ostwald ripening process, during which the defects also evolve: on prolonged crystallization, only the missing-linker defects remained. These observations were rationalized through density functional theory calculations. Finally, the missing-cluster defects were shown to be more catalytically active than their missing-linker counterparts for the isomerization of glucose to fructose.",2
Isotherms of individual pores by gas adsorption crystallography.,"Accurate measurements and assessments of gas adsorption isotherms are important to characterize porous materials and develop their applications. Although these isotherms provide knowledge of the overall gas uptake within a material, they do not directly give critical information concerning the adsorption behaviour of adsorbates in each individual pore, especially in porous materials in which multiple types of pore are present. Here we show how gas adsorption isotherms can be accurately decomposed into multiple sub-isotherms that correspond to each type of pore within a material. Specifically, two metal-organic frameworks, PCN-224 and ZIF-412, which contain two and three different types of pore, respectively, were used to generate isotherms of individual pores by combining gas adsorption measurements with in situ X-ray diffraction. This isotherm decomposition approach gives access to information about the gas uptake capacity, surface area and accessible pore volume of each individual pore, as well as the impact of pore geometry on the uptake and distribution of different adsorbates within the pores.",2
Reaction blockading in a reaction between an excited atom and a charged molecule at low collision energy.,"Recent advances have enabled studies of atom-ion chemistry at unprecedentedly low temperatures, allowing precision observation of chemical reactions and novel chemical dynamics. So far, these studies have primarily involved reactions between atoms and atomic ions or non-polar molecular ions, often in their electronic ground state. Here, we extend this work by studying an excited atom-polar-molecular-ion chemical reaction (Ca* + BaCl(+)) at low temperature in a hybrid atom-ion trapping system. The reaction rate and product branching fractions are measured and compared to model calculations as a function of both atomic quantum state and collision energy. At the lowest collision energy we find that the chemical dynamics differ dramatically from capture theory predictions and are primarily dictated by the radiative lifetime of the atomic quantum state instead of the underlying excited-state interaction potential. This reaction blockading effect, which greatly suppresses the reactivity of short-lived excited states, provides a means for directly probing the reaction range and also naturally suppresses unwanted chemical reactions in hybrid trapping experiments.",2

Identification of autoinducing thiodepsipeptides from staphylococci enabled by native chemical ligation.,"Staphylococci secrete autoinducing peptides (AIPs) as signalling molecules to regulate population-wide behaviour. AIPs from non-Staphylococcus aureus staphylococci have received attention as potential antivirulence agents to inhibit quorum sensing and virulence gene expression in the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. However, only a limited number of AIP structures from non-S. aureus staphylococci have been identified to date, as the minute amounts secreted in complex media render it difficult. Here, we report a method for the identification of AIPs by exploiting their thiolactone functionality for chemoselective trapping and enrichment of the compounds from the bacterial supernatant. Standard liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis, guided by genome sequencing data, then readily provides the AIP identities. Using this approach, we confirm the identity of five known AIPs and identify the AIPs of eleven non-S. aureus species, and we expect that the method should be extendable to AIP-expressing Gram-positive bacteria beyond the Staphylococcus genus.",2
Practical and regioselective amination of arenes using alkyl amines.,"The formation of carbon-nitrogen bonds for the preparation of aromatic amines is among the top five reactions carried out globally for the production of high-value materials, ranging from from bulk chemicals to pharmaceuticals and polymers. As a result of this ubiquity and diversity, methods for their preparation impact the full spectrum of chemical syntheses in academia and industry. In general, these molecules are assembled through the stepwise introduction of a reactivity handle in place of an aromatic C-H bond (that is, a nitro group, halogen or boronic acid) and a subsequent functionalization or cross-coupling. Here we show that aromatic amines can be constructed by direct reaction of arenes and alkyl amines using photocatalysis, without the need for pre-functionalization. The process enables the easy preparation of advanced building blocks, tolerates a broad range of functionalities, and multigram scale can be achieved via a batch-to-flow protocol. The merit of this strategy as a late-stage functionalization platform has been demonstrated by the modification of several drugs, agrochemicals, peptides, chiral catalysts, polymers and organometallic complexes.",2
A synthetic genetic polymer with an uncharged backbone chemistry based on alkyl phosphonate nucleic acids.,"The physicochemical properties of nucleic acids are dominated by their highly charged phosphodiester backbone chemistry. This polyelectrolyte structure decouples information content (base sequence) from bulk properties, such as solubility, and has been proposed as a defining trait of all informational polymers. However, this conjecture has not been tested experimentally. Here, we describe the encoded synthesis of a genetic polymer with an uncharged backbone chemistry: alkyl phosphonate nucleic acids (phNAs) in which the canonical, negatively charged phosphodiester is replaced by an uncharged P-alkyl phosphonodiester backbone. Using synthetic chemistry and polymerase engineering, we describe the enzymatic, DNA-templated synthesis of P-methyl and P-ethyl phNAs, and the directed evolution of specific streptavidin-binding phNA aptamer ligands directly from random-sequence mixed P-methyl/P-ethyl phNA repertoires. Our results establish an example of the DNA-templated enzymatic synthesis and evolution of an uncharged genetic polymer and provide a foundational methodology for their exploration as a source of novel functional molecules.",2
Autonomous dynamic control of DNA nanostructure self-assembly.,"Biological cells routinely reconfigure their shape using dynamic signalling and regulatory networks that direct self-assembly processes in time and space, through molecular components that sense, process and transmit information from the environment. A similar strategy could be used to enable life-like behaviours in synthetic materials. Nucleic acid nanotechnology offers a promising route towards this goal through a variety of sensors, logic and dynamic components and self-assembling structures. Here, by harnessing both dynamic and structural DNA nanotechnology, we demonstrate dynamic control of the self-assembly of DNA nanotubes-a well-known class of programmable DNA nanostructures. Nanotube assembly and disassembly is controlled with minimal synthetic gene systems, including an autonomous molecular oscillator. We use a coarse-grained computational model to capture nanotube length distribution dynamics in response to inputs from nucleic acid circuits. We hope that these results may find use for the development of responsive nucleic acid materials, with potential applications in biomaterials science, nanofabrication and drug delivery.",2
Closed-loop recycling of plastics enabled by dynamic covalent diketoenamine bonds.,"Recycled plastics are low-value commodities due to residual impurities and the degradation of polymer properties with each cycle of re-use. Plastics that undergo reversible polymerization allow high-value monomers to be recovered and re-manufactured into pristine materials, which should incentivize recycling in closed-loop life cycles. However, monomer recovery is often costly, incompatible with complex mixtures and energy-intensive. Here, we show that next-generation plastics-polymerized using dynamic covalent diketoenamine bonds-allow the recovery of monomers from common additives, even in mixed waste streams. Poly(diketoenamine)s 'click' together from a wide variety of triketones and aromatic or aliphatic amines, yielding only water as a by-product. Recovered monomers can be re-manufactured into the same polymer formulation, without loss of performance, as well as other polymer formulations with differentiated properties. The ease with which poly(diketoenamine)s can be manufactured, used, recycled and re-used-without losing value-points to new directions in designing sustainable polymers with minimal environmental impact.",2
Reversing conventional site-selectivity in C(sp(3))-H bond activation.,"One of the core barriers to developing C-H activation reactions is the ability to distinguish between multiple C-H bonds that are nearly identical in terms of electronic properties and bond strengths. Through recognition of distance and molecular geometry, remote C(sp(2))-H bonds have been selectively activated in the presence of proximate ones. Yet achieving such unconventional site selectivity with C(sp(3))-H bonds remains a paramount challenge. Here we report a combination of a simple pyruvic acid-derived directing group and a 2-pyridone ligand that enables the preferential activation of the distal gamma-C(sp(3))-H bond over the proximate beta-C(sp(3))-H bonds for a wide range of alcohol-derived substrates. A competition experiment between the five- and six-membered cyclopalladation step, as well as kinetic experiments, demonstrate the feasibility of using geometric strain to reverse the conventional site selectivity in C(sp(3))-H activation.",2
Computational advances in combating colloidal aggregation in drug discovery.,"Small molecule effectors are essential for drug discovery. Specific molecular recognition, reversible binding and dose-dependency are usually key requirements to ensure utility of a novel chemical entity. However, artefactual frequent-hitter and assay interference compounds may divert lead optimization and screening programmes towards attrition-prone chemical matter. Colloidal aggregates are the prime source of false positive readouts, either through protein sequestration or protein-scaffold mimicry. Nevertheless, assessment of colloidal aggregation remains somewhat overlooked and under-appreciated. In this Review, we discuss the impact of aggregation in drug discovery by analysing select examples from the literature and publicly-available datasets. We also examine and comment on technologies used to experimentally identify these potentially problematic entities. We focus on evidence-based computational filters and machine learning algorithms that may be swiftly deployed to flag chemical matter and mitigate the impact of aggregates in discovery programmes. We highlight the tools that can be used to scrutinize libraries, and identify and eliminate these problematic compounds.",2
N-heterocyclic carbene-functionalized magic-number gold nanoclusters.,"Magic-number gold nanoclusters are atomically precise nanomaterials that have enabled unprecedented insight into structure-property relationships in nanoscience. Thiolates are the most common ligand, binding to the cluster via a staple motif in which only central gold atoms are in the metallic state. The lack of other strongly bound ligands for nanoclusters with different bonding modes has been a significant limitation in the field. Here, we report a previously unknown ligand for gold(0) nanoclusters-N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs)-which feature a robust metal-carbon single bond and impart high stability to the corresponding gold cluster. The addition of a single NHC to gold nanoclusters results in significantly improved stability and catalytic properties in the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2. By varying the conditions, nature and number of equivalents of the NHC, predominantly or exclusively monosubstituted NHC-functionalized clusters result. Clusters can also be obtained with up to five NHCs, as a mixture of species.",2
"The photochemical ring-opening of 1,3-cyclohexadiene imaged by ultrafast electron diffraction.","The ultrafast photoinduced ring-opening of 1,3-cyclohexadiene constitutes a textbook example of electrocyclic reactions in organic chemistry and a model for photobiological reactions in vitamin D synthesis. Although the relaxation from the photoexcited electronic state during the ring-opening has been investigated in numerous studies, the accompanying changes in atomic distance have not been resolved. Here we present a direct and unambiguous observation of the ring-opening reaction path on the femtosecond timescale and subangstrom length scale using megaelectronvolt ultrafast electron diffraction. We followed the carbon-carbon bond dissociation and the structural opening of the 1,3-cyclohexadiene ring by the direct measurement of time-dependent changes in the distribution of interatomic distances. We observed a substantial acceleration of the ring-opening motion after internal conversion to the ground state due to a steepening of the electronic potential gradient towards the product minima. The ring-opening motion transforms into rotation of the terminal ethylene groups in the photoproduct 1,3,5-hexatriene on the subpicosecond timescale.",2
Radical polymerization inside living cells.,"Polymerization reactions conducted inside cells must be compatible with the complex intracellular environment, which contains numerous molecules and functional groups that could potentially prevent or quench polymerization reactions. Here we report a strategy for directly synthesizing unnatural polymers in cells through free radical photopolymerization using a number of biocompatible acrylic and methacrylic monomers. This offers a platform to manipulate, track and control cellular behaviour by the in cellulo generation of macromolecules that have the ability to alter cellular motility, label cells by the generation of fluorescent polymers for long-term tracking studies, as well as generate a variety of nanostructures within cells. It is remarkable that free radical polymerization chemistry can take place within such complex cellular environments. This demonstration opens up a multitude of new possibilities for how chemists can modulate cellular function and behaviour and for understanding cellular behaviour in response to the generation of free radicals.",2

Catalytic living ring-opening metathesis polymerization with Grubbs' second- and third-generation catalysts.,"In a conventional living ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), an equal number of ruthenium complexes to the number of polymer chains synthesized are required. This can lead to high loadings of ruthenium complexes when aiming for shorter polymers. Here, a reversible chain-transfer agent was used to produce living ROMP polymers from norbornene derivatives using catalytic amounts of Grubbs' ruthenium complexes. The polymers obtained by this method showed all of the characteristics of a living polymerization (that is, good molecular weight control, narrow molecular weight dispersities and the ability to form block copolymers). Monomers carrying functional moieties such as ferrocene, coumarin or a triisopropylsilyl-protected primary alcohol could also be catalytically polymerized in a living fashion. The method presented follows a degenerative chain-transfer process and is more economical and environmentally friendly compared with previous living ROMP procedures as it utilizes only catalytic amounts of costly and toxic ruthenium complexes.",2
Chemically stable polyarylether-based covalent organic frameworks.,"The development of crystalline porous materials with high chemical stability is of paramount importance for their practical application. Here, we report the synthesis of polyarylether-based covalent organic frameworks (PAE-COFs) with high crystallinity, porosity and chemical stability, including towards water, owing to the inert nature of their polyarylether-based building blocks. The PAE-COFs are synthesized through nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions between ortho-difluoro benzene and catechol building units, which form ether linkages. The resulting materials are shown to be stable against harsh chemical environments including boiling water, strong acids and bases, and oxidation and reduction conditions. Their stability surpasses the performance of other known crystalline porous materials such as zeolites, metal-organic frameworks and covalent organic frameworks. We also demonstrate the post-synthetic functionalization of these materials with carboxyl or amino functional groups. The functionalized PAE-COFs combine porosity, high stability and recyclability. A preliminary application of these materials is demonstrated with the removal of antibiotics from water over a wide pH range.",2
Optimization of the facet structure of transition-metal catalysts applied to the oxygen reduction reaction.,"Predicting the optimal structure for a catalytic material has been a long-standing goal, but typically an arbitrary active site on a uniform surface is modelled. Identification of the most-active facet structure for structure-sensitive chemistries, such as the oxygen reduction reaction, is lacking. Here we develop an approach to predict the optimal structure of a catalytic material by identifying the active site and identifying the density and spatial arrangement of such sites while minimizing the surface energy. We find that the theoretical peak performance predicted by linear scaling relations is unattainable because of the lack of suitable active sites on low-index planes, as well as geometric and stability constraints. A random array of vacancies results in a modest performance enhancement compared to ideal facets, whereas defect sites with a maximum density in disordered structures significantly increase the catalyst performance. We applied this methodology to the oxygen reduction reaction on defected Pt(111), Pt(100), Au(111) and Au(100) surfaces.",2
"E- and Z-, di- and tri-substituted alkenyl nitriles through catalytic cross-metathesis.","Nitriles are found in many bioactive compounds, and are among the most versatile functional groups in organic chemistry. Despite many notable recent advances, however, there are no approaches that may be used for the preparation of di- or tri-substituted alkenyl nitriles. Related approaches that are broad in scope and can deliver the desired products in high stereoisomeric purity are especially scarce. Here, we describe the development of several efficient catalytic cross-metathesis strategies, which provide direct access to a considerable range of Z- or E-di-substituted cyano-substituted alkenes or their corresponding tri-substituted variants. Depending on the reaction type, a molybdenum-based monoaryloxide pyrrolide or chloride (MAC) complex may be the optimal choice. The utility of the approach, enhanced by an easy to apply protocol for utilization of substrates bearing an alcohol or a carboxylic acid moiety, is highlighted in the context of applications to the synthesis of biologically active compounds.",2
Prebiotic phosphorylation of 2-thiouridine provides either nucleotides or DNA building blocks via photoreduction.,"Breakthroughs in the study of the origin of life have demonstrated how some of the building blocks essential to biology could have been formed under various primordial scenarios, and could therefore have contributed to the chemical evolution of life. Missing building blocks are then sometimes inferred to be products of primitive biosynthesis, which can stretch the limits of plausibility. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of 2'-deoxy-2-thiouridine, and subsequently 2'-deoxyadenosine and 2-deoxyribose, under prebiotic conditions. 2'-Deoxy-2-thiouridine is produced by photoreduction of 2,2'-anhydro-2-thiouridine, which is in turn formed by phosphorylation of 2-thiouridine-an intermediate of prebiotic RNA synthesis. 2'-Deoxy-2-thiouridine is an effective deoxyribosylating agent and may have functioned as such in either abiotic or proto-enzyme-catalysed pathways to DNA, as demonstrated by its conversion to 2'-deoxyadenosine by reaction with adenine, and 2-deoxyribose by hydrolysis. An alternative prebiotic phosphorylation of 2-thiouridine leads to the formation of its 5'-phosphate, showing that hypotheses in which 2-thiouridine was a key component of early RNA sequences are within the bounds of synthetic credibility.",2
Shear-induced assembly of a transient yet highly stretchable hydrogel based on pseudopolyrotaxanes.,"Dissipative self-assembly is common in biological systems, where it serves to maintain a far-from-equilibrium functional state through fuel consumption. Synthetic dissipative systems have been prepared that can mimic some of the properties of biological systems, but they often show poor mechanical performance. Here, we report a shear-induced transient hydrogel that is highly stretchable. The system is constructed by adding Cu(II) into the aqueous solution of a pseudopolyrotaxane, which is itself formed by threading molecular tubes on polyethylene glycol chains. Vigorous shaking transforms the solution into a gel, which gradually relaxes back to the sol state over time. This cycle can be repeated at least five times. A mechanism is proposed that relies on a shear-induced transition from intrachain to interchain coordination and subsequent thermal relaxation. The far-from-equilibrium hydrogel is highly stretchable, which is probably due to 'frictional' sliding of the molecular tubes on the polyethylene glycol chains. On shaking, the hydrogel undergoes fast self-healing.",2
Dual chemical probes enable quantitative system-wide analysis of protein prenylation and prenylation dynamics.,"Post-translational farnesylation or geranylgeranylation at a C-terminal cysteine residue regulates the localization and function of over 100 proteins, including the Ras isoforms, and is a therapeutic target in diseases including cancer and infection. Here, we report global and selective profiling of prenylated proteins in living cells enabled by the development of isoprenoid analogues YnF and YnGG in combination with quantitative chemical proteomics. Eighty prenylated proteins were identified in a single human cell line, 64 for the first time at endogenous abundance without metabolic perturbation. We further demonstrate that YnF and YnGG enable direct identification of post-translationally processed prenylated peptides, proteome-wide quantitative analysis of prenylation dynamics and alternative prenylation in response to four different prenyltransferase inhibitors, and quantification of defective Rab prenylation in a model of the retinal degenerative disease choroideremia.",2
Simplified immunosuppressive and neuroprotective agents based on gracilin A.,"The architecture and bioactivity of natural products frequently serve as embarkation points for the exploration of biologically relevant chemical space. Total synthesis followed by derivative synthesis has historically enabled a deeper understanding of structure-activity relationships. However, synthetic strategies towards a natural product are not always guided by hypotheses regarding the structural features required for bioactivity. Here, we report an approach to natural product total synthesis that we term 'pharmacophore-directed retrosynthesis'. A hypothesized, pharmacophore of a natural product is selected as an early synthetic target and this dictates the retrosynthetic analysis. In an ideal application, sequential increases in the structural complexity of this minimal structure enable development of a structure-activity relationship profile throughout the course of the total synthesis effort. This approach enables the identification of simpler congeners retaining bioactivity at a much earlier stage of a synthetic effort, as demonstrated here for the spongiane diterpenoid, gracilin A, leading to simplified derivatives with potent neuroprotective and immunosuppressive activity.",2
Molecular spins for quantum computation.,"Spins in solids or in molecules possess discrete energy levels, and the associated quantum states can be tuned and coherently manipulated by means of external electromagnetic fields. Spins therefore provide one of the simplest platforms to encode a quantum bit (qubit), the elementary unit of future quantum computers. Performing any useful computation demands much more than realizing a robust qubit-one also needs a large number of qubits and a reliable manner with which to integrate them into a complex circuitry that can store and process information and implement quantum algorithms. This 'scalability' is arguably one of the challenges for which a chemistry-based bottom-up approach is best-suited. Molecules, being much more versatile than atoms, and yet microscopic, are the quantum objects with the highest capacity to form non-trivial ordered states at the nanoscale and to be replicated in large numbers using chemical tools.",2
Publisher Correction: Hierarchical organization of perylene bisimides and polyoxometalates for photo-assisted water oxidation.,"In the version of this Article originally published, in the graphical abstract the y-axis units of the plot read 'mA cm(-2'), but should have read 'muA cm(-2'). Additionally, an erroneous gap appeared in the red trace. These errors have now been corrected.",2
Non-chemisorbed gold-sulfur binding prevails in self-assembled monolayers.,"Gold-thiol contacts are ubiquitous across the physical and biological sciences in connecting organic molecules to surfaces. When thiols bind to gold in self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) the fate of the hydrogen remains a subject of profound debate-with implications for our understanding of their physical properties, spectroscopic features and formation mechanism(s). Exploiting measurements of the transmission through a molecular junction, which is highly sensitive to the nature of the molecule-electrode contact, we demonstrate here that the nature of the gold-sulfur bond in SAMs can be probed via single-molecule conductance measurements. Critically, we find that SAM measurements of dithiol-terminated molecular junctions yield a significantly lower conductance than solution measurements of the same molecule. Through numerous control experiments, conductance noise analysis and transport calculations based on density functional theory, we show that the gold-sulfur bond in SAMs prepared from the solution deposition of dithiols does not have chemisorbed character, which strongly suggests that under these widely used preparation conditions the hydrogen is retained.",2
alpha-Fluorination of carbonyls with nucleophilic fluorine.,"Given the unique properties of fluorine, and the ability of fluorination to change the properties of organic molecules, there is significant interest from medicinal chemists in innovative methodologies that enable the synthesis of new fluorinated motifs. State-of-the-art syntheses of alpha-fluorinated carbonyl compounds invariably rely on electrophilic fluorinating agents, which can be strongly oxidizing and difficult to handle. Here we show that reversing the polarity of the enolate partner to that of an enolonium enables nucleophilic fluorinating agents to be used for direct chemoselective alpha-C-H-fluorination of amides. Reduction of these products enables facile access to beta-fluorinated amines and the value of this methodology is shown by the easy preparation of a number of fluorinated analogues of drugs and agrochemicals. A fluorinated analogue of citalopram, a marketed antidepressant drug, is presented as an example of the preserved biological activity after fluorination.",2
"Braiding, branching and chiral amplification of nanofibres in supramolecular gels.","Helical nanofibres play key roles in many biological processes. Entanglements between helices can aid gelation by producing thick, interconnected fibres, but the details of this process are poorly understood. Here, we describe the assembly of an achiral oligo(urea) peptidomimetic compound into supramolecular helices. Aggregation of adjacent helices leads to the formation of fibrils, which further intertwine to produce high-fidelity braids with periodic crossing patterns. A braid theory analysis suggests that braiding is governed by rigid topological constraints, and that branching occurs due to crossing defects in the developing braids. Mixed-chirality helices assemble into relatively complex, odd-stranded braids, but can also form helical bundles by undergoing inversions of chirality. The oligo(urea) assemblies are also highly sensitive to chiral amplification, proposed to occur through a majority-rules mechanism, whereby trace chiral materials can promote the formation of gels containing only homochiral helices.",2
Ion-mediated hydrogen-bond rearrangement through tunnelling in the iodide-dihydrate complex.,"A microscopic picture of hydrogen-bond structure and dynamics in ion hydration shells remains elusive. Small ion-dihydrate molecular complexes are ideal systems with which to investigate the interplay and competition between ion-water and water-water interactions. Here, state-of-the-art quantum dynamics simulations provide evidence for tunnelling in hydrogen-bond rearrangements in the iodide-dihydrate complex and show that it can be controlled through isotopic substitutions. We find that the iodide ion weakens the neighbouring water-water hydrogen bond, leading to faster water reorientation than in the analogous water trimer. These faster dynamics, which are apparently at odds with the slowdown observed in the first hydration shell of iodide in solution, can be traced back to the presence of a free OH bond in the iodide-dihydrate complex, which effectively triggers the overall structural rearrangements within it. Besides providing indirect support for cooperative hydrogen-bond dynamics in iodide solutions, the analysis presented here suggests that iodide ions may accelerate hydrogen-bond rearrangements at aqueous interfaces, where neighbouring water molecules can be undercoordinated.",2
Fluorogenic D-amino acids enable real-time monitoring of peptidoglycan biosynthesis and high-throughput transpeptidation assays.,"Peptidoglycan is an essential cell wall component that maintains the morphology and viability of nearly all bacteria. Its biosynthesis requires periplasmic transpeptidation reactions, which construct peptide crosslinkages between polysaccharide chains to endow mechanical strength. However, tracking the transpeptidation reaction in vivo and in vitro is challenging, mainly due to the lack of efficient, biocompatible probes. Here, we report the design, synthesis and application of rotor-fluorogenic D-amino acids (RfDAAs), enabling real-time, continuous tracking of transpeptidation reactions. These probes allow peptidoglycan biosynthesis to be monitored in real time by visualizing transpeptidase reactions in live cells, as well as real-time activity assays of D,D- and L,D-transpeptidases and sortases in vitro. The unique ability of RfDAAs to become fluorescent when incorporated into peptidoglycan provides a powerful new tool to study peptidoglycan biosynthesis with high temporal resolution and prospectively enable high-throughput screening for inhibitors of peptidoglycan biosynthesis.",2
An automated platform for the enzyme-mediated assembly of complex oligosaccharides.,"An automated platform that can synthesize a wide range of complex carbohydrates will greatly increase their accessibility and should facilitate progress in glycoscience. Here we report a fully automated process for enzyme-mediated oligosaccharide synthesis that can give easy access to different classes of complex glycans including poly-N-acetyllactosamine derivatives, human milk oligosaccharides, gangliosides and N-glycans. Our automated platform uses a catch and release approach in which glycosyltransferase-catalysed reactions are performed in solution and product purification is accomplished by solid phase extraction. We developed a sulfonate tag that can easily be installed and enables highly efficient solid phase extraction and product release using a single set of washing conditions, regardless of the complexity of the glycan. Using this custom-built synthesizer, as many as 15 reaction cycles can be performed in an automated fashion without a need for lyophilization or buffer exchange steps.",2
"An efficient, step-economical strategy for the design of functional metalloproteins.","The bottom-up design and construction of functional metalloproteins remains a formidable task in biomolecular design. Although numerous strategies have been used to create new metalloproteins, pre-existing knowledge of the tertiary and quaternary protein structure is often required to generate suitable platforms for robust metal coordination and activity. Here we report an alternative and easily implemented approach (metal active sites by covalent tethering or MASCoT) in which folded protein building blocks are linked by a single disulfide bond to create diverse metal coordination environments within evolutionarily naive protein-protein interfaces. Metalloproteins generated using this strategy uniformly bind a wide array of first-row transition metal ions (Mn(II), Fe(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), Zn(II) and vanadyl) with physiologically relevant thermodynamic affinities (dissociation constants ranging from 700 nM for Mn(II) to 50 fM for Cu(II)). MASCoT readily affords coordinatively unsaturated metal centres-including a penta-His-coordinated non-haem Fe site-and well-defined binding pockets that can accommodate modifications and enable coordination of exogenous ligands such as nitric oxide to the interfacial metal centre.",2
Liquid-liquid phase separation during amphiphilic self-assembly.,"The self-assembly of amphiphilic molecules in solution is a ubiquitous process in both natural and synthetic systems. The ability to effectively control the structure and properties of these systems is essential for tuning the quality of their functionality, yet the underlying mechanisms governing the transition from molecules to assemblies have not been fully resolved. Here we describe how amphiphilic self-assembly can be preceded by liquid-liquid phase separation. The assembly of a model block co-polymer system into vesicular structures was probed through a combination of liquid-phase electron microscopy, self-consistent field computations and Gibbs free energy calculations. This analysis shows the formation of polymer-rich liquid droplets that act as a precursor in the bottom-up formation of spherical micelles, which then evolve into vesicles. The liquid-liquid phase separation plays a role in determining the resulting vesicles' structural properties, such as their size and membrane thickness, and the onset of kinetic traps during self-assembly.",2
Publisher Correction: Unexpected intersystem crossing.,"In the version of this News & Views originally published, Fig. 1b incorrectly displayed the chemical formula ""CH3NHCH3"". This has been corrected to ""CH3NHCH2"".",2
Maleimide-thiol adducts stabilized through stretching.,"Maleimide-thiol reactions are widely used to produce protein-polymer conjugates for therapeutics. However, maleimide-thiol adducts are unstable in vivo or in the presence of thiol-containing compounds because of the elimination of the thiosuccinimide linkage through a retro-Michael reaction or thiol exchange. Here, using single-molecule force spectroscopy, we show that applying an appropriate stretching force to the thiosuccinimide linkage can considerably stabilize the maleimide-thiol adducts, in effect using conventional mechanochemistry of force-accelerated bond dissociation to unconventionally stabilize an adjacent bond. Single-molecule kinetic analysis and bulk structural characterizations suggest that hydrolysis of the succinimide ring is dominant over the retro-Michael reaction through a force-dependent kinetic control mechanism, and this leads to a product that is resistant to elimination. This unconventional mechanochemical approach enabled us to produce stable polymer-protein conjugates by simply applying a mechanical force to the maleimide-thiol adducts through mild ultrasonication. Our results demonstrate the great potential of mechanical force for stimulating important productive chemical transformations.",2
Transition-metal-bridged bimetallic clusters with multiple uranium-metal bonds.,"Heterometallic clusters are important in catalysis and small-molecule activation because of the multimetallic synergistic effects from different metals. However, multimetallic species that contain uranium-metal bonds remain very scarce due to the difficulties in their synthesis. Here we present a straightforward strategy to construct a series of heterometallic clusters with multiple uranium-metal bonds. These complexes were created by facile reactions of a uranium precursor with Ni(COD)2 (COD, cyclooctadiene). The multimetallic clusters' cores are supported by a heptadentate N4P3 scaffold. Theoretical investigations indicate the formation of uranium-nickel bonds in a U2Ni2 and a U2Ni3 species, but also show that they exhibit a uranium-uranium interaction; thus, the electronic configuration of uranium in these species is U(III)-5f(2)6d(1). This study provides further understanding of the bonding between f-block elements and transition metals, which may allow the construction of d-f heterometallic clusters and the investigation of their potential applications.",2
Mesopolymer synthesis by ligand-modulated direct arylation polycondensation towards n-type and ambipolar conjugated systems.,"Conjugated polymers are attractive components for plastic electronics, but their structural defects, low solubility and batch-to-batch variation-mainly in terms of molecular weight and dispersity-hinder practical applications. Here, we demonstrate that these issues can be circumvented by using conjugated mesopolymers, which have the advantages of both oligomers and polymers. A diketopyrrolopyrrole monomer and a benzothiadiazole derivative react through direct arylation polycondensation, promoted by sterically hindered adamantyl ligand coordinated palladium catalysts, to form mesopolymers. The reaction is facile, environmentally benign (it does not require tin or boron reagents) and occurs in high yields. The resulting mesopolymers have a strictly alternating donor-acceptor structure, without detectable homocoupling and beta-arylation defects, and exhibit number-averaged molecular weights (Mn) between 1 and 10 kDa. They also show good solution processability and have significantly enhanced electron mobilities, which makes them n-type and ambipolar semiconductors, with advantages over their polymer counterparts.",2
The formation of all-cis-(multi)fluorinated piperidines by a dearomatization-hydrogenation process.,"Piperidines and fluorine substituents are both independently indispensable components in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and materials. Logically, the incorporation of fluorine atoms into piperidine scaffolds is therefore an area of tremendous potential. However, synthetic approaches towards the formation of these architectures are often impractical. The diastereoselective synthesis of substituted monofluorinated piperidines often requires substrates with pre-defined stereochemistry. That of multifluorinated piperidines is even more challenging, and often needs to be carried out in multistep syntheses. In this report, we describe a straightforward process for the one-pot rhodium-catalysed dearomatization-hydrogenation of fluoropyridine precursors. This strategy enables the formation of a plethora of substituted all-cis-(multi)fluorinated piperidines in a highly diastereoselective fashion through pyridine dearomatization followed by complete saturation of the resulting intermediates by hydrogenation. Fluorinated piperidines with defined axial/equatorial orientation of fluorine substituents were successfully applied in the preparation of commercial drugs analogues. Additionally, fluorinated PipPhos as well as fluorinated ionic liquids were obtained by this dearomatization-hydrogenation process.",2
Copper atom-pair catalyst anchored on alloy nanowires for selective and efficient electrochemical reduction of CO2.,"The electrochemical reduction of CO2 could play an important role in addressing climate-change issues and global energy demands as part of a carbon-neutral energy cycle. Single-atom catalysts can display outstanding electrocatalytic performance; however, given their single-site nature they are usually only amenable to reactions that involve single molecules. For processes that involve multiple molecules, improved catalytic properties could be achieved through the development of atomically dispersed catalysts with higher complexities. Here we report a catalyst that features two adjacent copper atoms, which we call an 'atom-pair catalyst', that work together to carry out the critical bimolecular step in CO2 reduction. The atom-pair catalyst features stable Cu1(0)-Cu1(x+) pair structures, with Cu1(x+) adsorbing H2O and the neighbouring Cu1(0) adsorbing CO2, which thereby promotes CO2 activation. This results in a Faradaic efficiency for CO generation above 92%, with the competing hydrogen evolution reaction almost completely suppressed. Experimental characterization and density functional theory revealed that the adsorption configuration reduces the activation energy, which generates high selectivity, activity and stability under relatively low potentials.",2
Catalytic transport of molecular cargo using diffusive binding along a polymer track.,"Transport at the molecular scale is a prerequisite for the development of future molecular factories. Here, we have designed oligoanionic molecular sliders on polycationic tracks that exploit Brownian motion and diffusive binding to transport cargo without using a chemical fuel. The presence of the polymer tracks increases the rate of bimolecular reactions between modified sliders by over two orders of magnitude. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the sliders not only diffuse, but also jump and hop surprisingly efficiently along polymer tracks. Inspired by acetyl-coenzyme A transporting and delivering acetyl groups in many essential biochemical processes, we developed a new and unconventional type of catalytic transport involving sliders (including coenzyme A) picking up, transporting and selectively delivering molecular cargo. Furthermore, we show that the concept of diffusive binding can also be utilized for the spatially controlled transport of chemical groups across gels. This work represents a new concept for designing functional nanosystems based on random Brownian motion.",2
Fast galvanic lithium corrosion involving a Kirkendall-type mechanism.,"Developing a viable metallic lithium anode is a prerequisite for next-generation batteries. However, the low redox potential of lithium metal renders it prone to corrosion, which must be thoroughly understood for it to be used in practical energy-storage devices. Here we report a previously overlooked mechanism by which lithium deposits can corrode on a copper surface. Voids are observed in the corroded deposits and a Kirkendall-type mechanism is validated through electrochemical analysis. Although it is a long-held view that lithium corrosion in electrolytes involves direct charge-transfer through the lithium-electrolyte interphase, the corrosion observed here is found to be governed by a galvanic process between lithium and the copper substrate-a pathway largely neglected by previous battery corrosion studies. The observations are further rationalized by detailed analyses of the solid-electrolyte interphase formed on copper and lithium, where the disparities in electrolyte reduction kinetics on the two surfaces can account for the fast galvanic process.",2
A nucleophilic gold complex.,"Solid-state auride salts featuring the negatively charged Au(-) ion are known to be stable in the presence of alkali metal counterions. While such electron-rich species might be expected to be nucleophilic (in the same manner as I(-), for example), their instability in solution means that this has not been verified experimentally. Here we report a two-coordinate gold complex (NON)AlAuP(t)Bu3 (where NON is the chelating tridentate ligand 4,5-bis(2,6-diisopropylanilido)-2,7-di-tert-butyl-9,9-dimethylxanthene) that features a strongly polarized bond, Au(delta-)-Al(delta+). This is synthesized by reaction of the potassium aluminyl compound [K{Al(NON)}]2 with (t)Bu3PAuI. Computational studies of the complex, including quantum theory of atoms in molecules charge analysis, imply a charge at gold (-0.82) that is in line with the relative electronegativities of the two metals (Au: 2.54; Al: 1.61 on the Pauling scale). Consistently, the complex is found to act as a nucleophilic source of gold, reacting with diisopropylcarbodiimide and CO2 to give the Au-C bonded insertion products (NON)Al(X2C)AuP(t)Bu3 (X = N(i)Pr, 4; X = O, 5).",2
Supercharging enables organized assembly of synthetic biomolecules.,"Symmetrical protein oligomers are ubiquitous in biological systems and perform key structural and regulatory functions. However, there are few methods for constructing such oligomers. Here we have engineered completely synthetic, symmetrical oligomers by combining pairs of oppositely supercharged variants of a normally monomeric model protein through a strategy we term 'supercharged protein assembly' (SuPrA). We show that supercharged variants of green fluorescent protein can assemble into a variety of architectures including a well-defined symmetrical 16-mer structure that we solved using cryo-electron microscopy at 3.47 A resolution. The 16-mer is composed of two stacked rings of octamers, in which the octamers contain supercharged proteins of alternating charges, and interactions within and between the rings are mediated by a variety of specific electrostatic contacts. The ready assembly of this structure suggests that combining oppositely supercharged pairs of protein variants may provide broad opportunities for generating novel architectures via otherwise unprogrammed interactions.",2

Author Correction: Sequence-defined multifunctional polyethers via liquid-phase synthesis with molecular sieving.,"In the version of this Article originally published, the authors inadvertently cited ref. 10 in two places in the first paragraph. They would like to clarify that it should not have been cited in the sentence that starts ""Polymer chemists have employed strategies such as single monomer insertion..."" as it mistakenly implied that the IEG+ method described in ref. 10 could not produce unimolecular polymers; it can do so, as was demonstrated in ref. 10. The authors would also like to clarify that ref. 10 should not have been cited in the sentence that starts ""Moreover, solid-phase synthesis is generally difficult to scale up..."", as it implied that ref. 10 uses solid-phase synthesis; it does not, and is a purely liquid-phase process. The citation of ref. 10 has now been removed from these two sentences, but has been included elsewhere in the first two paragraphs of the Article as follows. In the first paragraph, at the end of the sentence ""In iterative synthesis, specific monomers are added one at a time, or as multiples, to the end of a growing polymer chain, then reaction debris is separated from the chain extended polymer, and the cycle is repeated using the next monomer in the sequence(10-12).""; this sentence has been further amended to indicate multiple monomers can also be added. The reference has also been added to the end of the first sentence of the second paragraph, which starts ""Consequently, liquid-phase iterative synthetic methods..."", and in the third sentence of that paragraph, which now starts ""For example, Johnson(10), Whiting(.)..."".",2
Chemoselective methylene oxidation in aromatic molecules.,"Despite significant progress in the development of site-selective aliphatic C-H oxidations over the past decade, the ability to oxidize strong methylene C-H bonds in the presence of more oxidatively labile aromatic functionalities remains a major unsolved problem. Such chemoselective reactivity is highly desirable for enabling late-stage oxidative derivatizations of pharmaceuticals and medicinally important natural products that often contain such functionality. Here, we report a simple manganese small-molecule catalyst Mn(CF3-PDP) system that achieves such chemoselectivity via an unexpected synergy of catalyst design and acid additive. Preparative remote methylene oxidation is obtained in 50 aromatic compounds housing medicinally relevant halogen, oxygen, heterocyclic and biaryl moieties. Late-stage methylene oxidation is demonstrated on four drug scaffolds, including the ethinylestradiol scaffold where other non-directed C-H oxidants that tolerate aromatic groups effect oxidation at only activated tertiary benzylic sites. Rapid generation of a known metabolite (piragliatin) from an advanced intermediate is demonstrated.",2
The reductive C3 functionalization of pyridinium and quinolinium salts through iridium-catalysed interrupted transfer hydrogenation.,"Aromatic rings are ubiquitous in organic chemistry and form the basis of many commercial products. Despite the numerous routes available for the preparation of aromatic compounds, there remain few methods that allow their conversion into synthetically useful partially saturated derivatives and even fewer that allow new C-C bonds to be formed at the same time. Here we set out to address this problem and uncover a unique catalytic partial reduction reaction that forms partially saturated azaheterocycles from aromatic precursors. In this reaction, methanol and formaldehyde are used for the reductive functionalization of pyridines and quinolines using catalytic iridium; thus, inexpensive and renewable feedstocks are utilized in the formation of complex N-heterocycles. By harnessing the formation of a nucleophilic enamine intermediate, the C-C bond-forming process reverses the normal pattern of reactivity and allows access to the C3 position of the arene. Mechanistic investigations using D-labelling experiments reveal the source of hydride added to the ring and show the reversible nature of the iridium-hydride addition.",2
Intersystem crossing in the exit channel.,"Intersystem crossing plays an important role in photochemistry. It is understood to be efficient when heavy atoms are present due to strong spin-orbit coupling, or when strongly bound long-lived complexes are formed that increase the chance of finding the singlet-triplet intersection seam. Here we present evidence for a different intersystem crossing mechanism in the bimolecular reaction of O((3)P) with alkylamines. In crossed-beam experiments, product velocity-flux maps are measured for aminoalkyl radicals produced from H abstraction from the methyl group, which also gives OH radicals as co-fragments. The low translational-energy release and isotropic angular distributions of the products indicate that such reactions undergo the formation of a complex before OH and aminoalkyl are produced. However, there is no well on the triplet potential energy surface that could support such a complex. Multi-reference ab initio calculations suggest, instead, that intersystem crossing occurs in the exit-channel region due to the long-range dipole-dipole interaction between the nascent radical product pair coupled with the vanishing singlet-triplet splitting at long range. Intersystem crossing then leads to a deep hydroxylamine well before OH elimination.",2
Rapamycin-inspired macrocycles with new target specificity.,"Rapamycin and FK506 are macrocyclic natural products with an extraordinary mode of action, in which they form binary complexes with FK506-binding protein (FKBP) through a shared FKBP-binding domain before forming ternary complexes with their respective targets, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and calcineurin, respectively. Inspired by this, we sought to build a rapamycin-like macromolecule library to target new cellular proteins by replacing the effector domain of rapamycin with a combinatorial library of oligopeptides. We developed a robust macrocyclization method using ring-closing metathesis and synthesized a 45,000-compound library of hybrid macrocycles (named rapafucins) using optimized FKBP-binding domains. Screening of the rapafucin library in human cells led to the discovery of rapadocin, an inhibitor of nucleoside uptake. Rapadocin is a potent, isoform-specific and FKBP-dependent inhibitor of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 and is efficacious in an animal model of kidney ischaemia reperfusion injury. Together, these results demonstrate that rapafucins are a new class of chemical probes and drug leads that can expand the repertoire of protein targets well beyond mTOR and calcineurin.",2
Streamlining the chemoenzymatic synthesis of complex N-glycans by a stop and go strategy.,"Contemporary chemoenzymatic approaches can provide highly complex multi-antennary N-linked glycans. These procedures are, however, very demanding and typically involve as many as 100 chemical steps to prepare advanced intermediates that can be diversified by glycosyltransferases in a branch-selective manner to give asymmetrical structures commonly found in nature. Only highly specialized laboratories can perform such syntheses, which greatly hampers progress in glycoscience. Here we describe a biomimetic approach in which a readily available bi-antennary glycopeptide can be converted in ten or fewer chemical and enzymatic steps into multi-antennary N-glycans that at each arm can be uniquely extended by glycosyltransferases to give access to highly complex asymmetrically branched N-glycans. A key feature of our approach is the installation of additional branching points using recombinant MGAT4 and MGAT5 in combination with unnatural sugar donors. At an appropriate point in the enzymatic synthesis, the unnatural monosaccharides can be converted into their natural counterpart, allowing each arm to be elaborated into a unique appendage.",2
Carbopalladation of C-C sigma-bonds enabled by strained boronate complexes.,"Transition-metal-catalysed cross-coupling reactions, particularly those mediated by palladium, are some of the most broadly used chemical transformations. The fundamental reaction steps of such cross-couplings typically include oxidative addition, transmetallation, carbopalladation of a pi-bond and/or reductive elimination. Herein, we describe an unprecedented fundamental reaction step: a C-C sigma-bond carbopalladation. Specifically, an aryl palladium(II) complex interacts with a sigma-bond of a strained bicyclo[1.1.0]butyl boronate complex to enable addition of the aryl palladium(II) species and an organoboronic ester substituent across a C-C sigma-bond. The overall process couples readily available aryl triflates and organoboronic esters across a cyclobutane unit with total diastereocontrol. The pharmaceutically relevant 1,1,3-trisubstituted cyclobutane products are decorated with an array of modular building blocks, including a boronic ester that can be readily derivatized.",2
Sequence-defined multifunctional polyethers via liquid-phase synthesis with molecular sieving.,"Synthetic chemists have devoted tremendous effort towards the production of precision synthetic polymers with defined sequences and specific functions. However, the creation of a general technology that enables precise control over monomer sequence, with efficient isolation of the target polymers, is highly challenging. Here, we report a robust strategy for the production of sequence-defined synthetic polymers through a combination of liquid-phase synthesis and selective molecular sieving. The polymer is assembled in solution with real-time monitoring to ensure couplings proceed to completion, on a three-armed star-shaped macromolecule to maximize efficiency during the molecular sieving process. This approach is applied to the construction of sequence-defined polyethers, with side-arms at precisely defined locations that can undergo site-selective modification after polymerization. Using this versatile strategy, we have introduced structural and functional diversity into sequence-defined polyethers, unlocking their potential for real-life applications in nanotechnology, healthcare and information storage.",2
Photochemical generation of radicals from alkyl electrophiles using a nucleophilic organic catalyst.,"Chemists extensively use free radical reactivity for applications in organic synthesis, materials science, and life science. Traditionally, generating radicals requires strategies that exploit the bond dissociation energy or the redox properties of the precursors. Here, we disclose a photochemical catalytic approach that harnesses different physical properties of the substrate to form carbon radicals. We use a nucleophilic dithiocarbamate anion catalyst, adorned with a well-tailored chromophoric unit, to activate alkyl electrophiles via an SN2 pathway. The resulting photon-absorbing intermediate affords radicals upon homolytic cleavage induced by visible light. This catalytic SN2-based strategy, which exploits a fundamental mechanistic process of ionic chemistry, grants access to open-shell intermediates from a variety of substrates that would be incompatible with or inert to classical radical-generating strategies. We also describe how the method's mild reaction conditions and high functional group tolerance could be advantageous for developing C-C bond-forming reactions, for streamlining the preparation of a marketed drug, for the late-stage elaboration of biorelevant compounds and for enantioselective radical catalysis.",2
Hierarchical organization of perylene bisimides and polyoxometalates for photo-assisted water oxidation.,"The oxygen in Earth's atmosphere is there primarily because of water oxidation performed by photosynthetic organisms using solar light and one specialized protein complex, photosystem II (PSII). High-resolution imaging of the PSII 'core' complex shows the ideal co-localization of multi-chromophore light-harvesting antennas with the functional reaction centre. Man-made systems are still far from replicating the complexity of PSII, as the majority of PSII mimetics have been limited to photocatalytic dyads based on a 1:1 ratio of a light absorber, generally a Ru-polypyridine complex, with a water oxidation catalyst. Here we report the self-assembly of multi-perylene-bisimide chromophores (PBI) shaped to function by interaction with a polyoxometalate water-oxidation catalyst (Ru4POM). The resulting [PBI]5Ru4POM complex shows a robust amphiphilic structure and dynamic aggregation into large two-dimensional paracrystalline domains, a redshifted light-harvesting efficiency of >40% and favourable exciton accumulation, with a peak quantum efficiency using 'green' photons (lambda > 500 nm). The modularity of the building blocks and the simplicity of the non-covalent chemistry offer opportunities for innovation in artificial photosynthesis.",2
Highly responsive nature of porous coordination polymer surfaces imaged by in situ atomic force microscopy.,"The ability of porous coordination polymers to undergo reversible structural transformations in response to the presence of guest molecules has been intensively investigated for applications such as molecular separation, storage, sensing and signalling processes. Here we report on the direct observation of the highly guest-responsive nature of the surface of a single-crystalline porous coordination polymer, which consists of paddlewheel zinc clusters and two types of ligand, by in situ liquid-phase atomic force microscopy. Observations were carried out in solution at constant temperature (28 degrees C) by high-speed atomic force microscopy with lattice resolution. A sharp and reversible response to the presence or absence of biphenyl guest molecules was observed, under conditions that can scarcely induce the transformation of the bulk crystal. Additionally, by modulating the surface coordination equilibrium, layer-by-layer delamination events were captured in real time at every ~13 s per frame.",2
Signalling and differentiation in emulsion-based multi-compartmentalized in vitro gene circuits.,"Multicellularity enables the growth of complex life forms as it allows for the specialization of cell types, differentiation and large-scale spatial organization. In a similar way, modular construction of synthetic multicellular systems will lead to dynamic biomimetic materials that can respond to their environment in complex ways. To achieve this goal, artificial cellular communication and developmental programs still have to be established. Here, we create geometrically controlled spatial arrangements of emulsion-based artificial cellular compartments containing synthetic in vitro gene circuitry, separated by lipid bilayer membranes. We quantitatively determine the membrane pore-dependent response of the circuits to artificial morphogen gradients, which are established via diffusion from dedicated organizer cells. Utilizing different types of feedforward and feedback in vitro gene circuits, we then implement artificial signalling and differentiation processes, demonstrating the potential for the realization of complex spatiotemporal dynamics in artificial multicellular systems.",2
Heteromultivalent peptide recognition by co-assembly of cyclodextrin and calixarene amphiphiles enables inhibition of amyloid fibrillation.,"Heteromultivalency, which involves the simultaneous interactions of more than one type of ligand with more than one type of receptor, is ubiquitous in living systems and provides a powerful strategy to improve the binding efficiency of heterotopic species such as proteins and membranes. However, the design and development of artificial heteromultivalent receptors is still challenging owing to tedious synthesis processes and the need for precise control over the spatial arrangement of the binding sites. Here, we have designed a heteromultivalent platform by co-assembling cyclodextrin and calixarene amphiphiles, so that two orthogonal, non-covalent binding sites are distributed on the surface of the co-assembly. Binding with model peptides shows a synergistic effect of the two receptors, (hetero)multivalency and self-adaptability. The co-assembly shows promise for inhibition of the fibrillation of amyloid-beta peptides and the dissolution of amyloid-beta fibrils, substantially reducing amyloid cytotoxicity. This self-assembled heteromultivalency concept is easily amenable to other ensembles and targets, so that versatile biomedical applications can be envisaged.",2
Identification of the strong Bronsted acid site in a metal-organic framework solid acid catalyst.,"It remains difficult to understand the surface of solid acid catalysts at the molecular level, despite their importance for industrial catalytic applications. A sulfated zirconium-based metal-organic framework, MOF-808-SO4, was previously shown to be a strong solid Bronsted acid material. In this report, we probe the origin of its acidity through an array of spectroscopic, crystallographic and computational characterization techniques. The strongest Bronsted acid site is shown to consist of a specific arrangement of adsorbed water and sulfate moieties on the zirconium clusters. When a water molecule adsorbs to one zirconium atom, it participates in a hydrogen bond with a sulfate moiety that is chelated to a neighbouring zirconium atom; this motif, in turn, results in the presence of a strongly acidic proton. On dehydration, the material loses its acidity. The hydrated sulfated MOF exhibits a good catalytic performance for the dimerization of isobutene (2-methyl-1-propene), and achieves a 100% selectivity for C8 products with a good conversion efficiency.",2
Enantioselective alpha-functionalizations of ketones via allylic substitution of silyl enol ethers.,"The enantioselective construction of carbon-heteroatom and carbon-carbon bonds that are alpha to ketones leads to the formation of substructures that are ubiquitous in natural products, pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Traditional methods to form such bonds have relied on combining ketone enolates with electrophiles. Reactions with heteroatom-based electrophiles require special reagents in which the heteroatom, which is typically nucleophilic, has been rendered electrophilic by changes to the oxidation state. The resulting products usually require post-synthetic transformations to unveil the functional group in the final desired products. Moreover, different catalytic systems are typically required for the reaction of different electrophiles. Here, we report a strategy for the formal enantioselective alpha-functionalization of ketones to form products containing a diverse array of substituents at the alpha position with a single catalyst. This strategy involves an unusual reversal of the role of the nucleophile and electrophile to form C-N, C-O, C-S and C-C bonds from a series of masked ketone electrophiles and a wide range of conventional heteroatom and carbon nucleophiles catalysed by a metallacyclic iridium catalyst.",2
Author Correction: Inhibiting amyloid-beta cytotoxicity through its interaction with the cell surface receptor LilrB2 by structure-based design.,"In the version of this Article originally published online, the upper right panel of Fig. 5a was mistakenly a repeat of the lower right panel. This has now been corrected in all versions of the Article.",2
Robust gold nanorods stabilized by bidentate N-heterocyclic-carbene-thiolate ligands.,"Although N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have demonstrated outstanding potential for use as surface anchors, synthetic challenges have limited their application to either large planar substrates or very small spherical nanoparticles. The development of a strategy to graft NHCs onto non-spherical nanomaterials, such as gold nanorods, would greatly expand their utility as surface ligands. Here, we use a bidentate thiolate-NHC-gold(I) complex that is easily grafted onto commercial cetyl trimethylammonium bromide-stabilized gold nanorods through ligand exchange. On mild reduction of the resulting surface-tethered NHC-gold(I) complexes, the gold atom attached to the NHC complex is added to the surface as an adatom, thereby precluding the need for reorganization of the underlying surface lattice upon NHC binding. The resulting thiolate-NHC-stabilized gold nanorods are stable towards excess glutathione for up to six days, and under conditions with large variations in pH, high and low temperatures, high salt concentrations, or in biological media and cell culture. We also demonstrate the utility of these nanorods for in vitro photothermal therapy.",2
A biomimetic receptor for glucose.,"Specific molecular recognition is routine for biology, but has proved difficult to achieve in synthetic systems. Carbohydrate substrates are especially challenging, because of their diversity and similarity to water, the biological solvent. Here we report a synthetic receptor for glucose, which is biomimetic in both design and capabilities. The core structure is simple and symmetrical, yet provides a cavity which almost perfectly complements the all-equatorial beta-pyranoside substrate. The receptor's affinity for glucose, at Ka ~ 18,000 M(-1), compares well with natural receptor systems. Selectivities also reach biological levels. Most other saccharides are bound approximately 100 times more weakly, while non-carbohydrate substrates are ignored. Glucose-binding molecules are required for initiatives in diabetes treatment, such as continuous glucose monitoring and glucose-responsive insulin. The performance and tunability of this system augur well for such applications.",2
Prevention of dendrite growth and volume expansion to give high-performance aprotic bimetallic Li-Na alloy-O2 batteries.,"Rechargeable aprotic alkali metal (Li or Na)-O2 batteries are the subject of great interest because of their high theoretical specific energy. However, the growth of dendrites and cracks at the Li or Na anode, as well as their corrosive oxidation lead to poor cycling stability and safety issues. Understanding the mechanism and improving Li/Na-ion plating and stripping electrochemistry are therefore essential to realizing their technological potential. Here, we report how the use of a Li-Na alloy anode and an electrolyte additive realizes an aprotic bimetal Li-Na alloy-O2 battery with improved cycling stability. Electrochemical investigations show that stripping and plating of Li and Na and the robust and flexible passivation film formed in situ (by 1,3-dioxolane additive reacting with the Li-Na alloy) suppress dendrite and buffer alloy anode volume expansion and thus prevent cracking, avoiding electrolyte consumption and ensuring high electron transport efficiency and continued electrochemical reactions.",2
The role of bridging ligands in dinitrogen reduction and functionalization by uranium multimetallic complexes.,"Cooperativity between metal centres is identified as a crucial step in dinitrogen reduction both for the industrial Haber-Bosch process and for the natural fixation of nitrogen by nitrogenase enzymes, but the mechanism of N2 reduction remains poorly understood. This is in large part because multimetallic complexes that reduce and functionalize dinitrogen in the absence of strong alkali reducing agents are crucial to establish a structure-activity relationship, but remain extremely rare. Recently, we reported a multimetallic nitride-bridged diuranium(III) complex capable of reducing and functionalizing dinitrogen. Here we show that an analogous complex assembled with an oxo instead of a nitride linker also effects the four-electron reduction of dinitrogen, but the reactivity of the resulting oxo-(N2) complex differs significantly from that of the nitride-(N2). Computational studies show a different bonding scheme for the dinitrogen where the bridging nitride does participate in the binding and consequent activation of N2, while the oxide does not.",2
Author Correction: From alkylarenes to anilines via site-directed carbon-carbon amination.,"The version of this Article originally published online did not include a caution statement relating to safety concerns over some of the reagents used. All versions of the Article now have the following text included at the start of the Methods section ""Caution: Sodium azide (NaN3) is highly toxic and also a potential explosion hazard; it can also react with organohalides to form explosive organic azides. Under acidic conditions, sodium azide can form hydrazoic acid (HN3) which is highly toxic. Considering these hazards, appropriate safety precautions should be taken when undertaking the C-C amination reactions reported in this Article."" Furthermore, in Fig. 2a, in the reaction conditions on the first equation it should have read DDQ not DDG; this has also been amended.",2
"Catalytic activation of unstrained C(aryl)-C(aryl) bonds in 2,2'-biphenols.","Transition metal catalysis has emerged as an important means for C-C activation that allows mild and selective transformations. However, the current scope of C-C bonds that can be activated is primarily restricted to either highly strained systems or more polarized C-C bonds. In contrast, the catalytic activation of non-polar and unstrained C-C moieties remains an unmet challenge. Here we report a general approach for the catalytic activation of the unstrained C(aryl)-C(aryl) bonds in 2,2'-biphenols. The key is to utilize the phenol moiety as a handle to install phosphinites as a recyclable directing group. Using hydrogen gas as the reductant, monophenols are obtained with a low catalyst loading and high functional group tolerance. This approach is also applied to the synthesis of 2,3,4-trisubstituted phenols. A further mechanistic study suggests that the C-C activation step is mediated by a rhodium(I) monohydride species. Finally, a preliminary study on breaking the inert biphenolic moieties in lignin models is illustrated.",2
A chemoselective strategy for late-stage functionalization of complex small molecules with polypeptides and proteins.,"Conjugates between proteins and small molecules enable access to a vast chemical space that is not achievable with either type of molecule alone; however, the paucity of specific reactions capable of functionalizing proteins and natural products presents a formidable challenge for preparing conjugates. Here we report a strategy for conjugating electron-rich (hetero)arenes to polypeptides and proteins. Our bioconjugation technique exploits the electrophilic reactivity of an oxidized selenocysteine residue in polypeptides and proteins, and the electron-rich character of certain small molecules to provide bioconjugates in excellent yields under mild conditions. This conjugation chemistry enabled the synthesis of peptide-vancomycin conjugates without the prefunctionalization of vancomycin. These conjugates have an enhanced in vitro potency for resistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. Additionally, we show that a 6 kDa affibody protein and a 150 kDa immunoglobulin-G antibody could be modified without diminishing bioactivity.",2
Visualizing pore architecture and molecular transport boundaries in catalyst bodies with fluorescent nanoprobes.,"The performances of porous materials are closely related to the accessibility and interconnectivity of their porous domains. Visualizing pore architecture and its role on functionality-for example, mass transport-has been a challenge so far, and traditional bulk and often non-visual pore measurements have to suffice in most cases. Here, we present an integrated, facile fluorescence microscopy approach to visualize the pore accessibility and interconnectivity of industrial-grade catalyst bodies, and link it unequivocally with their catalytic performance. Fluorescent nanoprobes of various sizes were imaged and correlated with the molecular transport of fluorescent molecules formed during a separate catalytic reaction. A direct visual relationship between the pore architecture-which depends on the pore sizes and interconnectivity of the material selected-and molecular transport was established. This approach can be applied to other porous materials, and the insight gained may prove useful in the design of more efficient heterogeneous catalysts.",2
A genetically encoded photosensitizer protein facilitates the rational design of a miniature photocatalytic CO2-reducing enzyme.,"Photosensitizers, which harness light energy to upgrade weak reductants to strong reductants, are pivotal components of the natural and artificial photosynthesis machineries. However, it has proved difficult to enhance and expand their functions through genetic engineering. Here we report a genetically encoded, 27 kDa photosensitizer protein (PSP), which facilitates the rational design of miniature photocatalytic CO2-reducing enzymes. Visible light drives PSP efficiently into a long-lived triplet excited state (PSP*), which reacts rapidly with reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide to generate a super-reducing radical (PSP(*)), which is strong enough to reduce many CO2-reducing catalysts. We determined the three-dimensional structure of PSP(*) at 1.8 A resolution by X-ray crystallography. Genetic engineering enabled the site-specific attachment of a nickel-terpyridine complex and the modular optimization of the photochemical properties of PSP, the chromophore/catalytic centre distance and the catalytic centre microenvironment, which culminated in a miniature photocatalytic CO2-reducing enzyme that has a CO2/CO conversion quantum efficiency of 2.6%.",2
Relativistic quantum chemical calculations show that the uranium molecule U2 has a quadruple bond.,"Understanding the bonding, reactivity and electronic structure of actinides is lagging behind that of the rest of the periodic table. This can be partly explained by the challenges that one faces in experimental studies of such radioactive compounds and also by the need to properly account for relativistic effects in theoretical studies. A further challenge is the very complicated electronic structures encountered in actinide chemistry, as vividly illustrated by the naked diuranium molecule U2. Here we report a computational study of this emblematic molecule using state-of-the-art relativistic quantum chemical methods. Notably, the variational inclusion of spin-orbit interactions leads not only to a different electronic ground state, but also to a lower bond multiplicity compared with those in previous studies.",2
From alkylarenes to anilines via site-directed carbon-carbon amination.,"Anilines are fundamental motifs in various chemical contexts, and are widely used in the industrial production of fine chemicals, polymers, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals. A recent development for the synthesis of anilines uses the primary amination of C-H bonds in electron-rich arenes. However, there are limitations to this strategy: the amination of electron-deficient arenes remains a challenging task and the amination of electron-rich arenes has a limited control over regioselectivity-the formation of meta-aminated products is especially difficult. Here we report a site-directed C-C bond primary amination of simple and readily available alkylarenes or benzyl alcohols for the direct and efficient preparation of anilines. This chemistry involves a novel C-C bond transformation and offers a versatile protocol for the synthesis of substituted anilines. The use of O2 as an environmentally benign oxidant is demonstrated, and studies on model compounds suggest that this method may also be used for the depolymerization of lignin.",2
5-Formylcytosine organizes nucleosomes and forms Schiff base interactions with histones in mouse embryonic stem cells.,"Nucleosomes are the basic unit of chromatin that help the packaging of genetic material while controlling access to the genetic information. The underlying DNA sequence, together with transcription-associated proteins and chromatin remodelling complexes, are important factors that influence the organization of nucleosomes. Here, we show that the naturally occurring DNA modification, 5-formylcytosine (5fC) is linked to tissue-specific nucleosome organization. Our study reveals that 5fC is associated with increased nucleosome occupancy in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that 5fC-associated nucleosomes at enhancers in the mammalian hindbrain and heart are linked to elevated gene expression. Our study also reveals the formation of a reversible-covalent Schiff base linkage between lysines of histone proteins and 5fC within nucleosomes in a cellular environment. We define their specific genomic loci in mouse embryonic stem cells and look into the biological consequences of these DNA-histone Schiff base sites. Collectively, our findings show that 5fC is a determinant of nucleosome organization and plays a role in establishing distinct regulatory regions that control transcription.",2
A crystalline monosubstituted carbene.,"By flanking a carbene carbon with two substituents, it is possible to synthesize persistent triplet carbenes and isolable singlet carbenes. Isolable singlet carbenes are among the most powerful tools in chemistry, and they have even found medicinal and materials science applications. Between the rich chemistry of disubstituted carbenes and the transient parent carbene are the monosubstituted carbenes that, so far, have only been observed in matrices at very low temperatures of just a few K. Herein, we describe the synthesis of a crystalline monosubstituted carbene. The key for isolating such a species was to design the correct substituent, namely a benzo[c]pyrrolidino heterocycle, which can single-handedly tame the intrinsic tendency of carbenes towards dimerization. The pi-donor ability of the nitrogen atom, coupled with the steric bulk of chemically inert substituents at the two adjacent quaternary carbons, make these scaffolds very attractive for the isolation of a variety of other hitherto elusive electron-deficient species.",2
Quantum-state-controlled channel branching in cold Ne((3)P2)+Ar chemi-ionization.,"A prerequisite to gain a complete understanding of the most basic aspects of chemical reactions is the ability to perform experiments with complete control over the reactant degrees of freedom. By controlling these, details of a reaction mechanism can be investigated and ultimately manipulated. Here, we present a study of chemi-ionization-a fundamental energy-transfer reaction-under completely controlled conditions. The collision energy of the reagents was tuned from 0.02 K to 1,000 K, with the orientation of the excited Ne atom relative to Ar fully specified by an external magnetic field. Chemi-ionization of Ne((3)P2) and Ar in these conditions enables a detailed investigation of how the reaction proceeds, and provides us with a means to control the branching ratio between the two possible reaction outcomes. The merged-beam experimental technique used here allows access to a low-energy regime in which the atoms dynamically reorient into a favourable configuration for reaction, irrespective of their initial orientations.",2
Cavitation energies can outperform dispersion interactions.,"The accurate dissection of binding energies into their microscopic components is challenging, especially in solution. Here we study the binding of noble gases (He-Xe) with the macrocyclic receptor cucurbit[5]uril in water by displacement of methane and ethane as (1)H NMR probes. We dissect the hydration free energies of the noble gases into an attractive dispersive component and a repulsive one for formation of a cavity in water. This allows us to identify the contributions to host-guest binding and to conclude that the binding process is driven by differential cavitation energies rather than dispersion interactions. The free energy required to create a cavity to accept the noble gas inside the cucurbit[5]uril is much lower than that to create a similarly sized cavity in bulk water. The recovery of the latter cavitation energy drives the overall process, which has implications for the refinement of gas-storage materials and the understanding of biological receptors.",2
Mining the cellular inventory of pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes with functionalized cofactor mimics.,"Pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) is an enzyme cofactor required for the chemical transformation of biological amines in many central cellular processes. PLP-dependent enzymes (PLP-DEs) are ubiquitous and evolutionarily diverse, making their classification based on sequence homology challenging. Here we present a chemical proteomic method for reporting on PLP-DEs using functionalized cofactor probes. We synthesized pyridoxal analogues modified at the 2'-position, which are taken up by cells and metabolized in situ. These pyridoxal analogues are phosphorylated to functional cofactor surrogates by cellular pyridoxal kinases and bind to PLP-DEs via an aldimine bond which can be rendered irreversible by NaBH4 reduction. Conjugation to a reporter tag enables the subsequent identification of PLP-DEs using quantitative, label-free mass spectrometry. Using these probes we accessed a significant portion of the Staphylococcus aureus PLP-DE proteome (73%) and annotate uncharacterized proteins as novel PLP-DEs. We also show that this approach can be used to study structural tolerance within PLP-DE active sites and to screen for off-targets of the PLP-DE inhibitor D-cycloserine.",2
Catalytic dehydrogenative decarboxyolefination of carboxylic acids.,"Alkenes are among the most versatile building blocks and are widely used for the production of polymers, detergents and synthetic lubricants. Currently, alkenes are sourced from petroleum feedstocks such as naphtha. In light of the necessity to invent sustainable production methods, multiple approaches to making alkenes from abundant fatty acids have been evaluated. However, all attempts so far have required at least one stoichiometric additive, which is an obstruction for applications at larger scales. Here, we report an approach to making olefins from carboxylic acids, in which every additional reaction constituent can be used as a catalyst. We show how abundant fatty acids can be converted to alpha-olefins, and expand the method to include structurally complex carboxylic acids, giving access to synthetically versatile intermediates. Our approach is enabled by the cooperative interplay between a cobalt catalyst, which functions as a proton reduction catalyst, and a photoredox catalyst, which mediates oxidative decarboxylation; coupling both processes enables catalytic conversion of carboxylic acids to olefins.",2
Inhibiting amyloid-beta cytotoxicity through its interaction with the cell surface receptor LilrB2 by structure-based design.,"Inhibiting the interaction between amyloid-beta (Abeta) and a neuronal cell surface receptor, LilrB2, has been suggested as a potential route for treating Alzheimer's disease. Supporting this approach, Alzheimer's-like symptoms are reduced in mouse models following genetic depletion of the LilrB2 homologue. In its pathogenic, oligomeric state, Abeta binds to LilrB2, triggering a pathway to synaptic loss. Here we identify the LilrB2 binding moieties of Abeta ((16)KLVFFA(21)) and identify its binding site on LilrB2 from a crystal structure of LilrB2 immunoglobulin domains D1D2 complexed to small molecules that mimic phenylalanine residues. In this structure, we observed two pockets that can accommodate the phenylalanine side chains of KLVFFA. These pockets were confirmed to be (16)KLVFFA(21) binding sites by mutagenesis. Rosetta docking revealed a plausible geometry for the Abeta-LilrB2 complex and assisted with the structure-guided selection of small molecule inhibitors. These molecules inhibit Abeta-LilrB2 interactions in vitro and on the cell surface and reduce Abeta cytotoxicity, which suggests these inhibitors are potential therapeutic leads against Alzheimer's disease.",2
Sulfone-containing covalent organic frameworks for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water.,"Nature uses organic molecules for light harvesting and photosynthesis, but most man-made water splitting catalysts are inorganic semiconductors. Organic photocatalysts, while attractive because of their synthetic tunability, tend to have low quantum efficiencies for water splitting. Here we present a crystalline covalent organic framework (COF) based on a benzo-bis(benzothiophene sulfone) moiety that shows a much higher activity for photochemical hydrogen evolution than its amorphous or semicrystalline counterparts. The COF is stable under long-term visible irradiation and shows steady photochemical hydrogen evolution with a sacrificial electron donor for at least 50 hours. We attribute the high quantum efficiency of fused-sulfone-COF to its crystallinity, its strong visible light absorption, and its wettable, hydrophilic 3.2 nm mesopores. These pores allow the framework to be dye-sensitized, leading to a further 61% enhancement in the hydrogen evolution rate up to 16.3 mmol g(-1) h(-1). The COF also retained its photocatalytic activity when cast as a thin film onto a support.",2
Superoxide dismutase activity enabled by a redox-active ligand rather than metal.,"Reactive oxygen species are integral to many physiological processes. Although their roles are still being elucidated, they seem to be linked to a variety of disorders and may represent promising drug targets. Mimics of superoxide dismutases, which catalyse the decomposition of O2(*-) to H2O2 and O2, have traditionally used redox-active metals, which are toxic outside of a tightly coordinating ligand. Purely organic antioxidants have also been investigated but generally require stoichiometric, rather than catalytic, doses. Here, we show that a complex of the redox-inactive metal zinc(II) with a hexadentate ligand containing a redox-active quinol can catalytically degrade superoxide, as demonstrated by both reactivity assays and stopped-flow kinetics studies of direct reactions with O2(*)(-) and the zinc(II) complex. The observed superoxide dismutase catalysis has an important advantage over previously reported work in that it is hastened, rather than impeded, by the presence of phosphate, the concentration of which is high under physiological conditions.",2
Thiophene and its sulfur inhibit indenoindenodibenzothiophene diradicals from low-energy lying thermal triplets.,"Many qualitative structure-property correlations between diradical character and emerging molecular properties are known. For example, the increase of diradical character further decreases the singlet-triplet energy gap. Here we show that inclusion of thiophenes within a quinoidal polycyclic hydrocarbon imparts appreciable diradical character yet retains the large singlet-triplet energy gap, a phenomenon that has no precedent in the literature. The low aromatic character of thiophene and its electron-rich nature are the key properties leading to these unique findings. A new indenoindenodibenzothiophene scaffold has been prepared and fully characterized by several spectroscopies, magnetic measurements, solid-state X-ray and state-of-the-art quantum chemical calculations, all corroborating this unique dichotomy between the diradical input and the emerging magnetic properties. New structure-property relationships such as these are not only extremely important in the field of diradical chemistry and organic electronics, but also provide new insights into the versatility of pi-electron chemical bonding.",2
Carbohydrate stabilization extends the kinetic limits of chemical polysaccharide depolymerization.,"Polysaccharide depolymerization is an essential step for valorizing lignocellulosic biomass. In inexpensive systems such as pure water or dilute acid mixtures, carbohydrate monomer degradation rates exceed hemicellulose-and especially cellulose-depolymerization rates at most easily accessible temperatures, limiting sugar yields. Here, we use a reversible stabilization of xylose and glucose by acetal formation with formaldehyde to alter this kinetic paradigm, preventing sugar dehydration to furans and their subsequent degradation. During a harsh organosolv pretreatment in the presence of formaldehyde, over 90% of xylan in beech wood was recovered as diformylxylose (compared to 16% xylose recovery without formaldehyde). The subsequent depolymerization of cellulose led to carbohydrate yields over 70% and a final concentration of ~5 wt%, whereas the same conditions without formaldehyde gave a yield of 28%. This stabilization strategy pushes back the longstanding kinetic limits of polysaccharide depolymerization and enables the recovery of biomass-derived carbohydrates in high yields and concentrations.",2
Spontaneous doping of the basal plane of MoS2 single layers through oxygen substitution under ambient conditions.,"The chemical inertness of the defect-free basal plane confers environmental stability to MoS2 single layers, but it also limits their chemical versatility and catalytic activity. The stability of pristine MoS2 basal plane against oxidation under ambient conditions is a widely accepted assumption however, here we report single-atom-level structural investigations that reveal that oxygen atoms spontaneously incorporate into the basal plane of MoS2 single layers during ambient exposure. The use of scanning tunnelling microscopy reveals a slow oxygen-substitution reaction, during which individual sulfur atoms are replaced one by one by oxygen, giving rise to solid-solution-type 2D MoS2-xOx crystals. Oxygen substitution sites present all over the basal plane act as single-atom reaction centres, substantially increasing the catalytic activity of the entire MoS2 basal plane for the electrochemical H2 evolution reaction.",2
Author Correction: Amine hemilability enables boron to mechanistically resemble either hydride or proton.,"During the revision of this Article prior to publication, a computational study was reported (Vallejos, M. M. & Pellegrinet, S. C. Theoretical study of the BF3-promoted rearrangement of oxiranyl N-methyliminodiacetic acid boronates. J. Org. Chem. 82, 5917-5925; 2017) that evaluates the nucleophilic boryl transfer mechanism predicted in this Article; this reference has now been added as number 19, and the subsequent references renumbered.",2
Chromopynones are pseudo natural product glucose uptake inhibitors targeting glucose transporters GLUT-1 and -3.,"The principles guiding the design and synthesis of bioactive compounds based on natural product (NP) structure, such as biology-oriented synthesis (BIOS), are limited by their partial coverage of the NP-like chemical space of existing NPs and retainment of bioactivity in the corresponding compound collections. Here we propose and validate a concept to overcome these limitations by de novo combination of NP-derived fragments to structurally unprecedented 'pseudo natural products'. Pseudo NPs inherit characteristic elements of NP structure yet enable the efficient exploration of areas of chemical space not covered by NP-derived chemotypes, and may possess novel bioactivities. We provide a proof of principle by designing, synthesizing and investigating the biological properties of chromopynone pseudo NPs that combine biosynthetically unrelated chromane- and tetrahydropyrimidinone NP fragments. We show that chromopynones define a glucose uptake inhibitor chemotype that selectively targets glucose transporters GLUT-1 and -3, inhibits cancer cell growth and promises to inspire new drug discovery programmes aimed at tumour metabolism.",2
Formation of the layered conductive magnet CrCl2(pyrazine)2 through redox-active coordination chemistry.,"The unique properties of graphene, transition-metal dichalcogenides and other two-dimensional (2D) materials have boosted interest in layered coordination solids. In particular, 2D materials that behave as both conductors and magnets could find applications in quantum magnetoelectronics and spintronics. Here, we report the synthesis of CrCl2(pyrazine)2, an air-stable layered solid, by reaction of CrCl2 with pyrazine (pyz). This compound displays a ferrimagnetic order below approximately 55 K, reflecting the presence of strong magnetic interactions. Electrical conductivity measurements demonstrate that CrCl2(pyz)2 reaches a conductivity of 32 mS cm(-1) at room temperature, which operates through a 2D hopping-based transport mechanism. These properties are induced by the redox-activity of the pyrazine ligand, which leads to a smearing of the Cr 3d and pyrazine pi states. We suggest that the combination of redox-active ligands and reducing paramagnetic metal ions represents a general approach towards tuneable 2D materials that consist of charge-neutral layers and exhibit both long-range magnetic order and high electronic conductivity.",2
Stereoselective synthesis of a composite knot with nine crossings.,"The simultaneous synthesis of a molecular nine-crossing composite knot that contains three trefoil tangles of the same handedness and a [Formula: see text] link (a type of cyclic [3]catenane topologically constrained to always have at least three twists within the links) is reported. Both compounds contain high degrees of topological writhe (w = 9), a structural feature of supercoiled DNA. The entwined products are generated from the cyclization of a hexameric Fe(II) circular helicate by ring-closing olefin metathesis, with the mixture of topological isomers formed as a result of different ligand connectivity patterns. The metal-coordinated composite knot was isolated by crystallization, the topology unambiguously proven by tandem mass spectrometry, with X-ray crystallography confirming that the 324-atom loop crosses itself nine times with matching handedness (all Delta or all Lambda) at every metal centre within each molecule. Controlling the connectivity of the ligand end groups on circular metal helicate scaffolds provides an effective synthetic strategy for the stereoselective synthesis of composite knots and other complex molecular topologies.",2
Gas-phase sugar formation using hydroxymethylene as the reactive formaldehyde isomer.,"Carbohydrates (CH2O)n are the formal adducts of carbon (atoms) to water with a repeating unit that structurally resembles H-C-OH (hydroxymethylene). Although hydroxymethylene has been suggested as a building block for sugar formation, it is a reactive species that had escaped detection until recently. Here we demonstrate that formaldehyde reacts with its isomer hydroxymethylene to give glycolaldehyde in a nearly barrierless reaction. This carbonyl-ene-type transformation operates in the absence of base and solvent at cryogenic temperatures similar to those found in extraterrestrial environments or interstellar clouds. Hydroxymethylene acts as a building block for an iterative sugar synthesis, as we demonstrate through the formation of the triose glyceraldehyde. The thermodynamically preferred ketose dihydroxyacetone does not form, and the formation of further branched sugars in the iterative synthesis presented here is unlikely. The results therefore provide a link between the well-known formose (Butlerow) reaction and sugar formation under non-aqueous conditions.",2
Dynamic self-correcting nucleophilic aromatic substitution.,"Dynamic covalent chemistry, with its ability to correct synthetic dead-ends, allows for the synthesis of elaborate extended network materials in high yields. However, the limited number of reactions amenable to dynamic covalent chemistry necessarily confines the scope and functionality of materials synthesized. Here, we explore the dynamic and self-correcting nature of nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr), using ortho-aryldithiols and ortho-aryldifluorides that condense to produce redox-active thianthrene units. We demonstrate the facile construction of two-, three- and four-point junctions by reaction between a dithiol nucleophile and three different model electrophiles that produces molecules with two, three and four thianthrene moieties, respectively, in excellent yields. The regioselectivity observed is driven by thermodynamics; other connections form under kinetic control. We also show that the same chemistry can be extended to the synthesis of novel ladder macrocycles and porous polymer networks with Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area of up to 813 m(2) g(-1).",2
Narrow-band single-photon emission through selective aryl functionalization of zigzag carbon nanotubes.,"The introduction of sp(3) defects into single-walled carbon nanotubes through covalent functionalization can generate new light-emitting states and thus dramatically expand their optical functionality. This may open up routes to enhanced imaging, photon upconversion, and room-temperature single-photon emission at telecom wavelengths. However, a significant challenge in harnessing this potential is that the nominally simple reaction chemistry of nanotube functionalization introduces a broad diversity of emitting states. Precisely defining a narrow band of emission energies necessitates constraining these states, which requires extreme selectivity in molecular binding configuration on the nanotube surface. We show here that such selectivity can be obtained through aryl functionalization of so-called 'zigzag' nanotube structures to achieve a threefold narrowing in emission bandwidth. Accompanying density functional theory modelling reveals that, because of the associated structural symmetry, the defect states become degenerate, thus limiting emission energies to a single narrow band. We show that this behaviour can only result from a predominant selectivity for ortho binding configurations of the aryl groups on the nanotube lattice.",2
A fluorescent membrane tension probe.,"Cells and organelles are delimited by lipid bilayers in which high deformability is essential to many cell processes, including motility, endocytosis and cell division. Membrane tension is therefore a major regulator of the cell processes that remodel membranes, albeit one that is very hard to measure in vivo. Here we show that a planarizable push-pull fluorescent probe called FliptR (fluorescent lipid tension reporter) can monitor changes in membrane tension by changing its fluorescence lifetime as a function of the twist between its fluorescent groups. The fluorescence lifetime depends linearly on membrane tension within cells, enabling an easy quantification of membrane tension by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. We further show, using model membranes, that this linear dependency between lifetime of the probe and membrane tension relies on a membrane-tension-dependent lipid phase separation. We also provide calibration curves that enable accurate measurement of membrane tension using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy.",2
Isoreticular two-dimensional magnetic coordination polymers prepared through pre-synthetic ligand functionalization.,"Chemical functionalization is a powerful approach to tailor the physical and chemical properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials, increase their processability and stability, tune their functionalities and, even, create new 2D materials. This is typically achieved through post-synthetic functionalization by anchoring molecules on the surface of an exfoliated 2D crystal, but it inevitably alters the long-range structural order of the material. Here we present a pre-synthetic approach that allows the isolation of crystalline, robust and magnetic functionalized monolayers of coordination polymers. A series of five isostructural layered magnetic coordination polymers based on Fe(II) centres and different benzimidazole derivatives (bearing a Cl, H, CH3, Br or NH2 side group) were first prepared. On mechanical exfoliation, 2D materials are obtained that retain their long-range structural order and exhibit good mechanical and magnetic properties. This combination, together with the possibility to functionalize their surface at will, makes them good candidates to explore magnetism in the 2D limit and to fabricate mechanical resonators for selective gas sensing.",2
Free-atom-like d states in single-atom alloy catalysts.,"Alloying provides a means by which to tune a metal catalyst's electronic structure and thus tailor its performance; however, mean-field behaviour in metals imposes limits. To access unprecedented catalytic behaviour, materials must exhibit emergent properties that are not simply interpolations of the constituent components' properties. Here we show an emergent electronic structure in single-atom alloys, whereby weak wavefunction mixing between minority and majority elements results in a free-atom-like electronic structure on the minority element. This unusual electronic structure alters the minority element's adsorption properties such that the bonding with adsorbates resembles the bonding in molecular metal complexes. We demonstrate this phenomenon with AgCu alloys, dilute in Cu, where the Cu d states are nearly unperturbed from their free-atom state. In situ electron spectroscopy demonstrates that this unusual electronic structure persists in reaction conditions and exhibits a 0.1 eV smaller activation barrier than bulk Cu in methanol reforming. Theory predicts that several other dilute alloys exhibit this phenomenon, which offers a design approach that may lead to alloys with unprecedented catalytic properties.",2
Micrometre-long covalent organic fibres by photoinitiated chain-growth radical polymerization on an alkali-halide surface.,"On-surface polymerization is a promising technique to prepare organic functional nanomaterials that are challenging to synthesize in solution, but it is typically used on metal substrates, which play a catalytic role. Previous examples on insulating surfaces have involved intermediate self-assembled structures, which face high barriers to diffusion, or annealing to higher temperatures, which generally causes rapid dewetting and desorption of the monomers. Here we report the photoinitiated radical polymerization, initiated from a two-dimensional gas phase, of a dimaleimide monomer on an insulating KCl surface. Polymer fibres up to 1 mum long are formed through chain-like rather than step-like growth. Interactions between potassium cations and the dimaleimide's oxygen atoms facilitate the propagation of the polymer fibres along a preferred axis of the substrate over long distances. Density functional theory calculations, non-contact atomic force microscopy imaging and manipulations at room temperature were used to explore the initiation and propagation processes, as well as the structure and stability of the resulting one-dimensional polymer fibres.",2
Efficient and stereodivergent synthesis of unsaturated acyclic fragments bearing contiguous stereogenic elements.,"Synthetic organic strategies that enable the catalytic and rapid assembly of a large array of organic compounds that possess multiple stereocentres in acyclic systems are somewhat rare, especially when it comes to reaching today's high standards of efficiency and selectivity. In particular, the catalytic preparation of a three-dimensional molecular layout of a simple acyclic hydrocarbon skeleton that possesses several stereocentres from simple and readily available reagents still represents a vastly uncharted domain. Here we report a rapid, modular, stereodivergent and diversity-oriented unified strategy to construct acyclic molecular frameworks that bear up to four contiguous and congested stereogenic elements, with remarkably high levels of stereocontrol and in only three catalytic steps from commercially available alkynes. A regio- and diastereoselective catalytic Heck migratory insertion reaction of alkenylcyclopropyl carbinols that merges selective C-C bond cleavage of a cyclopropane represents the key step.",2
Non-intuitive rotational reorientation in collisions of NO(A (2)Sigma(+)) with Ne from direct measurement of a four-vector correlation.,"Stereodynamic descriptions of molecular collisions concern the angular correlations that exist between vector properties of the motion of the participating species, including their velocities and rotational angular momenta. Measurements of vector correlations provide a unique view of the forces acting during collisions, and are a stringent test of electronic-structure calculations of molecular interactions. Here, we present direct measurement of the four-vector correlation between initial and final relative velocities and rotational angular momenta in a molecular collision. This property, which quantifies the extent to which a molecule retains a memory of its initial sense of rotation, or handedness, as a function of scattering angle, yields insight into the dynamics of a molecular collision. We report non-intuitive changes in the handedness for specific states and scattering angles, reproduced by classical and quantum scattering calculations. Comparison to calculations on different ab initio potential energy surfaces demonstrates this measurement's exquisite sensitivity to the underlying intermolecular forces.",2
Activation of diverse carbon-heteroatom and carbon-carbon bonds via palladium(II)-catalysed beta-X elimination.,"Chemists' ability to synthesize structurally complex, high-value organic molecules from simple starting materials is limited by methods to selectively activate and functionalize strong alkyl C(sp(3)) covalent bonds. Recent activity has focused on the activation of abundant C-O, C-N and C-C bonds via a mechanistic paradigm of oxidative addition of a low-valent, electron-rich transition metal. This approach typically employs nickel(0), rhodium(I), ruthenium(0) and iron catalysts under conditions finely tuned for specific, electronically activated substrates, sometimes assisted by chelating functional groups or ring strain. By adopting a redox-neutral strategy involving palladium(II)-catalysed C-H activation followed by beta-heteroatom/carbon elimination, we describe here a catalytic method to activate alkyl C(sp(3))-oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, fluorine and sulfur bonds with high regioselectivity. Directed hydrofunctionalization of the resultant palladium(II)-bound alkene leads to formal functional group metathesis. The method is applied to amino acid upgrading with complete regioselectivity and moderate to high retention of enantiomeric excess. Low-strain heterocycles undergo strong-bond activation and substitution, giving ring-opened products.",2
Enzyme-powered motility in buoyant organoclay/DNA protocells.,"Reconstitution and simulation of cellular motility in microcompartmentalized colloidal objects have important implications for microcapsule-based remote sensing, environmentally induced signalling between artificial cell-like entities and programming spatial migration in synthetic protocell consortia. Here we describe the design and construction of catalase-containing organoclay/DNA semipermeable microcapsules, which in the presence of hydrogen peroxide exhibit enzyme-powered oxygen gas bubble-dependent buoyancy. We determine the optimum conditions for single and/or multiple bubble generation per microcapsule, monitor the protocell velocities and resilience, and use remote magnetic guidance to establish reversible changes in the buoyancy. Co-encapsulation of catalase and glucose oxidase is exploited to establish a spatiotemporal response to antagonistic bubble generation and depletion to produce protocells capable of sustained oscillatory vertical movement. We demonstrate that the motility of the microcapsules can be used for the flotation of macroscopic objects, self-sorting of mixed protocell communities and the delivery of a biocatalyst from an inert to chemically active environment. These results highlight new opportunities to constructing programmable microcompartmentalized colloids with buoyancy-derived motility.",2
Light-driven molecular trap enables bidirectional manipulation of dynamic covalent systems.,"Bond formation between two molecular entities in a closed system strictly obeys the principle of microscopic reversibility and occurs in favour of the thermodynamically more stable product. Here, we demonstrate how light can bypass this fundamental limitation by driving and controlling the reversible bimolecular reaction between an N-nucleophile and a photoswitchable carbonyl electrophile. Light-driven tautomerization cycles reverse the reactivity of the C=O/C=N-electrophiles ('umpolung') to activate substrates and remove products, respectively, solely depending on the illumination wavelength. By applying either red or blue light, selective and nearly quantitative intermolecular bond formation/scission can be achieved, even if the underlying condensation/hydrolysis equilibrium is thermodynamically disfavoured. Exploiting light-driven in situ C=N exchange, our approach can be used to externally regulate a closed dynamic covalent system by actively and reversibly removing specific components, resembling a molecular and bidirectional version of a macroscopic Dean-Stark trap.",2
Hydrolytic stability in hemilabile metal-organic frameworks.,"Highly porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which have undergone exciting developments over the past few decades, show promise for a wide range of applications. However, many studies indicate that they suffer from significant stability issues, especially with respect to their interactions with water, which severely limits their practical potential. Here we demonstrate how the presence of 'sacrificial' bonds in the coordination environment of its metal centres (referred to as hemilability) endows a dehydrated copper-based MOF with good hydrolytic stability. On exposure to water, in contrast to the indiscriminate breaking of coordination bonds that typically results in structure degradation, it is non-structural weak interactions between the MOF's copper paddlewheel clusters that are broken and the framework recovers its as-synthesized, hydrated structure. This MOF retained its structural integrity even after contact with water for one year, whereas HKUST-1, a compositionally similar material that lacks these sacrificial bonds, loses its crystallinity in less than a day under the same conditions.",2
Highly reduced and protonated aqueous solutions of [P2W18O62](6-) for on-demand hydrogen generation and energy storage.,"As our reliance on renewable energy sources grows, so too does our need to store this energy to mitigate against troughs in supply. Energy storage in batteries or by conversion to chemical fuels are the two most flexible and scalable options, but are normally considered mutually exclusive. Energy storage solutions that can act as both batteries and fuel generation devices (depending on the requirements of the user) could therefore revolutionize the uptake and use of renewably generated energy. Here, we present a polyoxoanion, [P2W18O62](6-), that can be reversibly reduced and protonated by 18 electrons/H(+) per anion in aqueous solution, and that can act either as a high-performance redox flow battery electrolyte (giving a practical discharged energy density of 225 Wh l(-1) with a theoretical energy density of more than 1,000 Wh l(-1)), or as a mediator in an electrolytic cell for the on-demand generation of hydrogen.",2
The energy-transfer-enabled biocompatible disulfide-ene reaction.,"Sulfur-containing molecules participate in many essential biological processes. Of utmost importance is the methylthioether moiety, present in the proteinogenic amino acid methionine and installed in tRNA by radical-S-adenosylmethionine methylthiotransferases. Although the thiol-ene reaction for carbon-sulfur bond formation has found widespread applications in materials or medicinal science, a biocompatible chemo- and regioselective hydrothiolation of unactivated alkenes and alkynes remains elusive. Here, we describe the design of a general chemoselective anti-Markovnikov hydroalkyl/aryl thiolation of alkenes and alkynes-also allowing the biologically important hydromethylthiolation-by triplet-triplet energy transfer activation of disulfides. This fast disulfide-ene reaction shows extraordinary functional group tolerance and biocompatibility. Transient absorption spectroscopy was used to study the sensitization process in detail. The hereby gained mechanistic insights were successfully employed for optimization of the catalytic system. This photosensitized transformation should stimulate bioimaging applications and carbon-sulfur bond-forming late-stage functionalization chemistry, especially in the context of metabolic labelling.",2
Design of catalysts for site-selective and enantioselective functionalization of non-activated primary C-H bonds.,"C-H functionalization represents a promising approach for the synthesis of complex molecules. Instead of relying on modifying the functional groups present in a molecule, the synthetic sequence is achieved by carrying out selective reactions on the C-H bonds, which traditionally would have been considered to be the unreactive components of a molecule. A major challenge is to design catalysts to control both the site- and stereoselectivity of the C-H functionalization. We have been developing dirhodium catalysts with different selectivity profiles in C-H functionalization reactions with donor/acceptor carbenes as reactive intermediates. Here we describe a new dirhodium catalyst capable of the functionalization of non-activated primary C-H bonds with high levels of site selectivity and enantioselectivity.",2
Few-layer graphdiyne doped with sp-hybridized nitrogen atoms at acetylenic sites for oxygen reduction electrocatalysis.,"The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a fundamental reaction for energy storage and conversion. It has mainly relied on platinum-based electrocatalysts, but the chemical doping of carbon-based materials has proven to be a promising strategy for preparing metal-free alternatives. Nitrogen doping in particular provides a diverse range of nitrogen forms. Here, we introduce a new form of nitrogen doping moieties -sp-hybridized nitrogen (sp-N) atoms into chemically defined sites of ultrathin graphdiyne, through pericyclic replacement of the acetylene groups. The as-prepared sp-N-doped graphdiyne catalyst exhibits overall good ORR performance, in particular with regards to peak potential, half-wave potential and current density. Under alkaline conditions it was comparable to commercial Pt/C, and showed more rapid kinetics. And although its performances are a bit lower than those of Pt/C in acidic media they surpass those of other metal-free materials. Taken together, experimental data and density functional theory calculations suggest that the high catalytic activity originates from the sp-N dopant, which facilitates O2 adsorption and electron transfer on the surface of the catalyst. This incorporation of chemically defined sp-N atoms provides a new synthetic route to high-performance carbon-based and other metal-free catalysts.",2
Metathesis-active ligands enable a catalytic functional group metathesis between aroyl chlorides and aryl iodides.,"Current methods for functional group interconversion have, for the most part, relied on relatively strong driving forces which often require highly reactive reagents to generate irreversibly a desired product in high yield and selectivity. These approaches generally prevent the use of the same catalytic strategy to perform the reverse reaction. Here we describe a catalytic functional group metathesis approach to interconvert, under CO-free conditions, two synthetically important classes of electrophiles that are often employed in the preparation of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals-aroyl chlorides (ArCOCl) and aryl iodides (ArI). Our reaction design relies on the implementation of a key reversible ligand C-P bond cleavage event, which enables a non-innocent, metathesis-active phosphine ligand to mediate a rapid aryl group transfer between the two different electrophiles. Beyond enabling a practical and safer approach to the interconversion of ArCOCl and ArI, this type of ligand non-innocence provides a blueprint for the development of a broad range of functional group metathesis reactions employing synthetically relevant aryl electrophiles.",2
Direct alpha-alkylation of primary aliphatic amines enabled by CO2 and electrostatics.,"Primary aliphatic amines are important building blocks in organic synthesis due to the presence of a synthetically versatile NH2 group. N-functionalization of primary amines is well established, but selective C-functionalization of unprotected primary amines remains challenging. Here, we report the use of CO2 as an activator for the direct transformation of abundant primary aliphatic amines into valuable gamma-lactams under photoredox and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalysis. Experimental and computational studies suggest that CO2 not only inhibits undesired N-alkylation of primary amines, but also promotes selective intermolecular HAT by an electrostatically accelerated interaction between the in situ-generated negatively charged carbamate and the positively charged quinuclidinium radical. This electrostatic attraction overwhelms the inherent bond dissociation energies which suggest that HAT should occur unselectively. We anticipate that our findings will open up new avenues for amine functionalizations as well as selectivity control in HAT reactions.",2
Hydrogenation catalyst generates cyclic peptide stereocentres in sequence.,"Molecular recognition plays a key role in enzyme-substrate specificity, the regulation of genes, and the treatment of diseases. Inspired by the power of molecular recognition in enzymatic processes, we sought to exploit its use in organic synthesis. Here we demonstrate how a synthetic rhodium-based catalyst can selectively bind a dehydroamino acid residue to initiate a sequential and stereoselective synthesis of cyclic peptides. Our combined experimental and theoretical study reveals the underpinnings of a cascade reduction that occurs with high stereocontrol and in one direction around a macrocyclic ring. As the catalyst can dissociate from the peptide, the C to N directionality of the hydrogenation reactions is controlled by catalyst-substrate recognition rather than a processive mechanism in which the catalyst remains bound to the macrocycle. This mechanistic insight provides a foundation for the use of cascade hydrogenations.",2
Amine hemilability enables boron to mechanistically resemble either hydride or proton.,"Tetracoordinate MIDA (N-methyliminodiacetic acid) boronates have found broad utility in chemical synthesis. Here, we describe mechanistic insights into the migratory aptitude of the MIDA boryl group in boron transfer processes, and show that the hemilability of the nitrogen atom on the MIDA ligand enables boron to mechanistically resemble either a hydride or a proton. The first case involves a 1,2-boryl shift, in which boron migrates as a nucleophile in its tetracoordinate form. The second case involves a neighbouring atom-promoted 1,4-boryl shift, in which boron migrates as an electrophile in its pseudo-tricoordinate form. Density functional theory studies and in situ NMR measurements all suggest that MIDA can act as a dynamic switch. These findings encouraged the development of novel migration processes involving boron that exploit the chameleonic behaviour of boron by acting as both a nucleophile and an electrophile, including the first report of a compound with a boronate functionality bound to carbon in the carboxylic acid oxidation state.",2
Diels-Alder cycloadditions of strained azacyclic allenes.,"For over a century, the structures and reactivities of strained organic compounds have captivated the chemical community. Whereas triple-bond-containing strained intermediates have been well studied, cyclic allenes have received far less attention. Additionally, studies of cyclic allenes that bear heteroatoms in the ring are scarce. We report an experimental and computational study of azacyclic allenes, which features syntheses of stable allene precursors, the mild generation and Diels-Alder trapping of the desired cyclic allenes, and explanations of the observed regio- and diastereoselectivities. Furthermore, we show that stereochemical information can be transferred from an enantioenriched silyl triflate starting material to a Diels-Alder cycloadduct by way of a stereochemically defined azacyclic allene intermediate. These studies demonstrate that heteroatom-containing cyclic allenes, despite previously being overlooked as valuable synthetic intermediates, may be harnessed for the construction of complex molecular scaffolds bearing multiple stereogenic centres.",2
"Isolation, synthesis and bioactivity studies of phomactin terpenoids.","Studies of secondary metabolites (natural products) that cover their isolation, chemical synthesis and bioactivity investigation present myriad opportunities for discovery. For example, the isolation of novel secondary metabolites can inspire advances in chemical synthesis strategies to achieve their practical preparation for biological evaluation. In the process, chemical synthesis can also provide unambiguous structural characterization of the natural products. Although the isolation, chemical synthesis and bioactivity studies of natural products are mutually beneficial, they are often conducted independently. Here, we demonstrate the benefits of a collaborative study of the phomactins, diterpenoid fungal metabolites that serve as antagonists of the platelet activating factor receptor. Our isolation of novel phomactins has spurred the development of a bioinspired, unified approach that achieves the total syntheses of six congeners. We also demonstrate in vitro the beneficial effects of several phomactins in suppressing the rate of repopulation of tumour cells following gamma radiation therapy.",2
Broadband 2D IR spectroscopy reveals dominant asymmetric H5O2(+) proton hydration structures in acid solutions.,"Given the critical role of the aqueous excess proton in redox chemistry, determining its structure and the mechanism of its transport in water are intense areas of experimental and theoretical research. The ultrafast dynamics of the proton's hydration structure has made it extremely challenging to study experimentally. Using ultrafast broadband two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy, we show that the vibrational spectrum of the aqueous proton is fully consistent with a protonated water complex broadly defined as a Zundel-like H5O2(+) motif. Analysis of the inhomogeneously broadened proton stretch two-dimensional lineshape indicates an intrinsically asymmetric, low-barrier O-H(+)-O potential that exhibits surprisingly persistent distributions in both its asymmetry and O-O distance. This structural characterization has direct implications for the extent of delocalization exhibited by a proton's excess charge and for the possible mechanisms of proton transport in water.",2
Publisher Correction: A new fundamental type of conformational isomerism.,"In the version of this Article originally published, the word 'stereoisomerism' was erroneously included in the label of the upper-right box of Fig. 1. The label within the box has been corrected and it now reads: ""Constitutional isomerism (same formula, different connectivity)"". This has been corrected in the online version of the Article.",2
Microporous membranes comprising conjugated polymers with rigid backbones enable ultrafast organic-solvent nanofiltration.,"Conventional technology for the purification of organic solvents requires massive energy consumption, and to reduce such expending calls for efficient filtration membranes capable of high retention of large molecular solutes and high permeance for solvents. Herein, we report a surface-initiated polymerization strategy through C-C coupling reactions for preparing conjugated microporous polymer (CMP) membranes. The backbone of the membranes consists of all-rigid conjugated systems and shows high resistance to organic solvents. We show that 42-nm-thick CMP membranes supported on polyacrylonitrile substrates provide excellent retention of solutes and broad-spectrum nanofiltration in both non-polar hexane and polar methanol, the permeance for which reaches 32 and 22 l m(-2) h(-1) bar(-1), respectively. Both experiments and simulations suggest that the performance of CMP membranes originates from substantially open and interconnected voids formed in the highly rigid networks.",2
Direct knock-on of desolvated ions governs strict ion selectivity in K(+) channels.,"The seeming contradiction that K(+) channels conduct K(+) ions at maximal throughput rates while not permeating slightly smaller Na(+) ions has perplexed scientists for decades. Although numerous models have addressed selective permeation in K(+) channels, the combination of conduction efficiency and ion selectivity has not yet been linked through a unified functional model. Here, we investigate the mechanism of ion selectivity through atomistic simulations totalling more than 400 mus in length, which include over 7,000 permeation events. Together with free-energy calculations, our simulations show that both rapid permeation of K(+) and ion selectivity are ultimately based on a single principle: the direct knock-on of completely desolvated ions in the channels' selectivity filter. Herein, the strong interactions between multiple 'naked' ions in the four filter binding sites give rise to a natural exclusion of any competing ions. Our results are in excellent agreement with experimental selectivity data, measured ion interaction energies and recent two-dimensional infrared spectra of filter ion configurations.",2
Site-selective photoinduced cleavage and profiling of DNA by chiral semiconductor nanoparticles.,"Gene editing is an important genetic engineering technique that enables gene manipulation at the molecular level. It mainly relies on engineered nucleases of biological origin, whose precise functions cannot be replicated in any currently known abiotic artificial material. Here, we show that chiral cysteine-modified CdTe nanoparticles can specifically recognize and, following photonic excitation, cut at the restriction site GAT'ATC (' indicates the cut site) in double-stranded DNA exceeding 90 base pairs, mimicking a restriction endonuclease. Although photoinduced reactive oxygen species are found to be responsible for the cleavage activity, the sequence selectivity arises from the affinity between cysteine and the conformation of the specific DNA sequence, as confirmed by quantum-chemical calculations. In addition, we demonstrate non-enzymatic sequence-specific DNA incision in living cells and in vivo using these CdTe nanoparticles, which may help in the design of abiotic materials for gene editing and other biological applications.",2
The domino hexadehydro-Diels-Alder reaction transforms polyynes to benzynes to naphthynes to anthracynes to tetracynes (and beyond?).,"Polyacenes are organic compounds that have multiple, fused, aromatic rings. These highly conjugated molecules often have interesting photonic and/or electronic properties that afford them the potential for application in a host of organoelectronic devices such as sensors, light-emitting diodes, photovoltaic devices and field-effect transistors. Here, we show the development and use of the domino hexadehydro-Diels-Alder reaction to synthesize structurally diverse polyacenes from acyclic polyyne precursors. The key event in these transformations is the successive reaction of multiple 1,3-butadiyne units with a series of in-situ-generated, diynophilic arynes. The polyyne substrates were designed to allow for rapid engagement of each progressively larger aryne following the initiating (and ratelimiting) production of the first reactive intermediate-the benzyne. We show that aryne-trapping reactions are broad in scope and that these cascade or domino processes can be quite efficient.",2
Dopant-induced electron localization drives CO2 reduction to C2 hydrocarbons.,"The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to multi-carbon products has attracted much attention because it provides an avenue to the synthesis of value-added carbon-based fuels and feedstocks using renewable electricity. Unfortunately, the efficiency of CO2 conversion to C2 products remains below that necessary for its implementation at scale. Modifying the local electronic structure of copper with positive valence sites has been predicted to boost conversion to C2 products. Here, we use boron to tune the ratio of Cu(delta+) to Cu(0) active sites and improve both stability and C2-product generation. Simulations show that the ability to tune the average oxidation state of copper enables control over CO adsorption and dimerization, and makes it possible to implement a preference for the electrosynthesis of C2 products. We report experimentally a C2 Faradaic efficiency of 79 +/- 2% on boron-doped copper catalysts and further show that boron doping leads to catalysts that are stable for in excess of ~40 hours while electrochemically reducing CO2 to multi-carbon hydrocarbons.",2
Concerted nucleophilic aromatic substitutions.,"Nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) is one of the most widely applied reaction classes in pharmaceutical and chemical research, providing a broadly useful platform for the modification of aromatic ring scaffolds. The generally accepted mechanism for SNAr reactions involves a two-step addition-elimination sequence via a discrete, non-aromatic Meisenheimer complex. Here we use (12)C/(13)C kinetic isotope effect (KIE) studies and computational analyses to provide evidence that prototypical SNAr reactions in fact proceed through concerted mechanisms. The KIE measurements were made possible by a new technique that leverages the high sensitivity of (19)F as an NMR nucleus to quantitate the degree of isotopic fractionation. This sensitive technique permits the measurement of KIEs on 10 mg of natural abundance material in one overnight acquisition. As a result, it provides a practical tool for performing detailed mechanistic analyses of reactions that form or break C-F bonds.",2
Accelerating proton-coupled electron transfer of metal hydrides in catalyst model reactions.,"Metal hydrides are key intermediates in catalytic proton reduction and dihydrogen oxidation. There is currently much interest in appending proton relays near the metal centre to accelerate catalysis by proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET). However, the elementary PCET steps and the role of the proton relays are still poorly understood, and direct kinetic studies of these processes are scarce. Here, we report a series of tungsten hydride complexes as proxy catalysts, with covalently attached pyridyl groups as proton acceptors. The rate of their PCET reaction with external oxidants is increased by several orders of magnitude compared to that of the analogous systems with external pyridine on account of facilitated proton transfer. Moreover, the mechanism of the PCET reaction is altered by the appended bases. A unique feature is that the reaction can be tuned to follow three distinct PCET mechanisms-electron-first, proton-first or a concerted reaction-with very different sensitivities to oxidant and base strength. Such knowledge is crucial for rational improvements of solar fuel catalysts.",2
Publisher Correction: Structure-performance descriptors and the role of Lewis acidity in the methanol-to-propylene process.,"In the version of this Article originally published, on the right side of Fig. 4b, the 'Aromatic cycle' label was erroneously shifted outside of the central circular arrow into a position on part of the reaction cycle. This has been corrected in the online versions of the Article.",2
Author Correction: Foldamers wave to the ribosome.,"In the News & Views 'Foldamers wave to the ribosome', multiple changes to the main text were required.

In the penultimate paragraph, 'appendages 5-9' should have been ""appendages 5 and 7-9""; in the sentence starting ""Based on these criteria..."", QPQ should have been QQQ and vice versa; and the whole sentence starting ""What is interesting..."" needed revising to ""What is interesting is that an alternating sequence with a terminal P monomer appears essential: PQPQ is unfolded and an initiator tRNA carrying PQPQ-Gly-Phe initiates translation, whereas QPQPQ is folded and does not.""

Towards simple kinetic models of functional dynamics for a kinase subfamily.,"Kinases are ubiquitous enzymes involved in the regulation of critical cellular pathways. However, in silico modelling of the conformational ensembles of these enzymes is difficult due to inherent limitations and the cost of computational approaches. Recent algorithmic advances combined with homology modelling and parallel simulations have enabled researchers to address this computational sampling bottleneck. Here, we present the results of molecular dynamics studies for seven Src family kinase (SFK) members: Fyn, Lyn, Lck, Hck, Fgr, Yes and Blk. We present a sequence invariant extension to Markov state models, which allows us to quantitatively compare the structural ensembles of the seven kinases. Our findings indicate that in the absence of their regulatory partners, SFK members have similar in silico dynamics with active state populations ranging from 4 to 40% and activation timescales in the hundreds of microseconds. Furthermore, we observe several potentially druggable intermediate states, including a pocket next to the adenosine triphosphate binding site that could potentially be targeted via a small-molecule inhibitor.",2
Approaching sub-ppm-level asymmetric organocatalysis of a highly challenging and scalable carbon-carbon bond forming reaction.,"The chemical synthesis of organic molecules involves, at its very essence, the creation of carbon-carbon bonds. In this context, the aldol reaction is among the most important synthetic methods, and a wide variety of catalytic and stereoselective versions have been reported. However, aldolizations yielding tertiary aldols, which result from the reaction of an enolate with a ketone, are challenging and only a few catalytic asymmetric Mukaiyama aldol reactions with ketones as electrophiles have been described. These methods typically require relatively high catalyst loadings, deliver substandard enantioselectivity or need special reagents or additives. We now report extremely potent catalysts that readily enable the reaction of silyl ketene acetals with a diverse set of ketones to furnish the corresponding tertiary aldol products in excellent yields and enantioselectivities. Parts per million (ppm) levels of catalyst loadings can be routinely used and provide fast and quantitative product formation in high enantiopurity. In situ spectroscopic studies and acidity measurements suggest a silylium ion based, asymmetric counteranion-directed Lewis acid catalysis mechanism.",2
Author Correction: Hidden hassium.,"The original version of this In Your Element contained some inaccuracies regarding the stability of fermium, cold and hot fusion techniques, the naming process and chemical investigations; see the correction notice for details.",2
A designer enzyme for hydrazone and oxime formation featuring an unnatural catalytic aniline residue.,"Creating designer enzymes with the ability to catalyse abiological transformations is a formidable challenge. Efforts toward this goal typically consider only canonical amino acids in the initial design process. However, incorporating unnatural amino acids that feature uniquely reactive side chains could significantly expand the catalytic repertoire of designer enzymes. To explore the potential of such artificial building blocks for enzyme design, here we selected p-aminophenylalanine as a potentially novel catalytic residue. We demonstrate that the catalytic activity of the aniline side chain for hydrazone and oxime formation reactions is increased by embedding p-aminophenylalanine into the hydrophobic pore of the multidrug transcriptional regulator from Lactococcus lactis. Both the recruitment of reactants by the promiscuous binding pocket and a judiciously placed aniline that functions as a catalytic residue contribute to the success of the identified artificial enzyme. We anticipate that our design strategy will prove rewarding to significantly expand the catalytic repertoire of designer enzymes in the future.",2
Polyyne formation via skeletal rearrangement induced by atomic manipulation.,"Rearrangements that change the connectivity of a carbon skeleton are often useful in synthesis, but it can be difficult to follow their mechanisms. Scanning probe microscopy can be used to manipulate a skeletal rearrangement at the single-molecule level, while monitoring the geometry of reactants, intermediates and final products with atomic resolution. We studied the reductive rearrangement of 1,1-dibromo alkenes to polyynes on a NaCl surface at 5 K, a reaction that resembles the Fritsch-Buttenberg-Wiechell rearrangement. Voltage pulses were used to cleave one C-Br bond, forming a radical, then to cleave the remaining C(*)-Br bond, triggering the rearrangement. These experiments provide structural insight into the bromo-vinyl radical intermediates, showing that the C=C(*)-Br unit is nonlinear. Long polyynes, up to the octayne Ph-(C identical withC)8-Ph, have been prepared in this way. The control of skeletal rearrangements opens a new window on carbon-rich materials and extends the toolbox for molecular synthesis by atom manipulation.",2
Author Correction: Dynamic actuation of glassy polymersomes through isomerization of a single azobenzene unit at the block copolymer interface.,"In the version of this Article originally published, multiple changes to the ""Results and discussion"" section were required.

Complementary site-selectivity in arene functionalization enabled by overcoming the ortho constraint in palladium/norbornene catalysis.,"Achieving site-selectivity in arene functionalization that is complementary to the site-selectivity from electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions has been a long-standing quest in organic synthesis. Palladium/norbornene cooperative catalysis potentially offers a unique approach to this problem, but its use has been hampered by the ortho constraint, which is the requirement of an ortho substituent for mono ortho functionalization of haloarenes. Here, we show that such a challenge could be addressed using a new class of bridgehead-modified norbornenes, thereby enabling a broadly useful strategy for arene functionalization with complementary site-selectivity. A range of ortho-unsubstituted aryl iodides, previously problematic substrates, can now be employed to provide mono ortho-functionalized products effectively. This method is applicable for late-stage functionalization of complex bioactive molecules at positions that are difficult to reach by conventional approaches.",2
Structure-performance descriptors and the role of Lewis acidity in the methanol-to-propylene process.,"The combination of well-defined acid sites, shape-selective properties and outstanding stability places zeolites among the most practically relevant heterogeneous catalysts. The development of structure-performance descriptors for processes that they catalyse has been a matter of intense debate, both in industry and academia, and the direct conversion of methanol to olefins is a prototypical system in which various catalytic functions contribute to the overall performance. Propylene selectivity and resistance to coking are the two most important parameters in developing new methanol-to-olefin catalysts. Here, we present a systematic investigation on the effect of acidity on the performance of the zeolite 'ZSM-5' for the production of propylene. Our results demonstrate that the isolation of Bronsted acid sites is key to the selective formation of propylene. Also, the introduction of Lewis acid sites prevents the formation of coke, hence drastically increasing catalyst lifetime.",2
Non-aqueous homogenous biocatalytic conversion of polysaccharides in ionic liquids using chemically modified glucosidase.,"The increasing requirement to produce platform chemicals and fuels from renewable sources means advances in biocatalysis are rapidly becoming a necessity. Biomass is widely used in nature as a source of energy and as chemical building blocks. However, recalcitrance towards traditional chemical processes and solvents provides a significant barrier to widespread utility. Here, by optimizing enzyme solubility in ionic liquids, we have discovered solvent-induced substrate promiscuity of glucosidase, demonstrating an unprecedented example of homogeneous enzyme bioprocessing of cellulose. Specifically, chemical modification of glucosidase for solubilization in ionic liquids can increase thermal stability to up to 137 degrees C, allowing for enzymatic activity 30 times greater than is possible in aqueous media. These results establish that through a synergistic combination of chemical biology (enzyme modification) and reaction engineering (solvent choice), the biocatalytic capability of enzymes can be intensified: a key step towards the full-scale deployment of industrial biocatalysis.",2
Cyclometallated ruthenium catalyst enables late-stage directed arylation of pharmaceuticals.,"Biaryls are ubiquitous core structures in drugs, agrochemicals and organic materials that have profoundly improved many aspects of our society. Although traditional cross-couplings have made practical the synthesis of many biaryls, C-H arylation represents a more attractive and cost-effective strategy for building these structural motifs. Furthermore, the ability to install biaryl units in complex molecules via late-stage C-H arylation would allow access to valuable structural diversity, novel chemical space and intellectual property in only one step. However, known C-H arylation protocols are not suitable for substrates decorated with polar and delicate functionalities, which are commonly found in molecules that possess biological activity. Here we introduce a class of ruthenium catalysts that display a unique efficacy towards late-stage arylation of heavily functionalized substrates. The design and development of this class of catalysts was enabled by a mechanistic breakthrough on the Ru(II)-catalysed C-H arylation of N-chelating substrates with aryl (pseudo)halides, which has remained poorly understood for nearly two decades.",2
A human MUTYH variant linking colonic polyposis to redox degradation of the [4Fe4S](2+) cluster.,"The human DNA repair enzyme MUTYH excises mispaired adenine residues in oxidized DNA. Homozygous MUTYH mutations underlie the autosomal, recessive cancer syndrome MUTYH-associated polyposis. We report a MUTYH variant, p.C306W (c.918C>G), with a tryptophan residue in place of native cysteine, that ligates the [4Fe4S] cluster in a patient with colonic polyposis and family history of early age colon cancer. In bacterial MutY, the [4Fe4S] cluster is redox active, allowing rapid localization to target lesions by long-range, DNA-mediated signalling. In the current study, using DNA electrochemistry, we determine that wild-type MUTYH is similarly redox-active, but MUTYH C306W undergoes rapid oxidative degradation of its cluster to [3Fe4S](+), with loss of redox signalling. In MUTYH C306W, oxidative cluster degradation leads to decreased DNA binding and enzyme function. This study confirms redox activity in eukaryotic DNA repair proteins and establishes MUTYH C306W as a pathogenic variant, highlighting the essential role of redox signalling by the [4Fe4S] cluster.",2
Infrared spectroscopy reveals multi-step multi-timescale photoactivation in the photoconvertible protein archetype dronpa.,"Photochromic fluorescent proteins play key roles in super-resolution microscopy and optogenetics. The light-driven structural changes that modulate the fluorescence involve both trans-to-cis isomerization and proton transfer. The mechanism, timescale and relative contribution of chromophore and protein dynamics are currently not well understood. Here, the mechanism of off-to-on-state switching in dronpa is studied using femtosecond-to-millisecond time-resolved infrared spectroscopy and isotope labelling. Chromophore and protein dynamics are shown to occur on multiple timescales, from picoseconds to hundreds of microseconds. Following excitation of the trans chromophore, a ground-state primary product is formed within picoseconds. Surprisingly, the characteristic vibrational spectrum of the neutral cis isomer appears only after several tens of nanoseconds. Further fluctuations in protein structure around the neutral cis chromophore are required to form a new intermediate, which promotes the final proton-transfer reaction. These data illustrate the interplay between chromophore dynamics and the protein environment underlying fluorescent protein photochromism.",2
Catalytic promiscuity enabled by photoredox catalysis in nicotinamide-dependent oxidoreductases.,"Strategies that provide enzymes with the ability to catalyse non-natural reactions are of considerable synthetic value. Photoredox catalysis has proved adept at expanding the synthetic repertoire of existing catalytic platforms, yet, in the realm of biocatalysis it has primarily been used for cofactor regeneration. Here we show that photoredox catalysts can be used to enable new catalytic function in nicotinamide-dependent enzymes. Under visible-light irradiation, xanthene-based photocatalysts enable a double-bond reductase to catalyse an enantioselective deacetoxylation. Mechanistic experiments support the intermediacy of an alpha-acyl radical, formed after the elimination of acetate. Isotopic labelling experiments support nicotinamide as the source of the hydrogen atom. Preliminary calculations and mechanistic experiments suggest that binding to the protein attenuates the reduction potential of the starting material, an important feature for localizing radical formation to the enzyme active site. The generality of this approach is highlighted with the radical dehalogenation of alpha-bromoamides catalysed by ketoreductases with Eosin Y as a photocatalyst.",2
Controlling Pd(IV) reductive elimination pathways enables Pd(II)-catalysed enantioselective C(sp(3))-H fluorination.,"The development of a Pd(II)-catalysed enantioselective fluorination of C(sp(3))-H bonds would offer a new approach to making chiral organofluorines. However, such a strategy is particularly challenging because of the difficulty in differentiating prochiral C(sp(3))-H bonds through Pd(II)-insertion, as well as the sluggish reductive elimination involving Pd-F bonds. Here, we report the development of a Pd(II)-catalysed enantioselective C(sp(3))-H fluorination using a chiral transient directing group strategy. In this work, a bulky, amino amide transient directing group was developed to control the stereochemistry of the C-H insertion step and selectively promote the C(sp(3))-F reductive elimination pathway from the Pd(IV)-F intermediate. Stereochemical analysis revealed that while the desired C(sp(3))-F formation proceeds via an inner-sphere pathway with retention of configuration, the undesired C(sp(3))-O formation occurs through an SN2-type mechanism. Elucidation of the dual mechanism allows us to rationalize the profound ligand effect on controlling reductive elimination selectivity from high-valent Pd species.",2
Shape-preserving transformation of carbonate minerals into lead halide perovskite semiconductors based on ion exchange/insertion reactions.,"Biological and bio-inspired mineralization processes yield a variety of three-dimensional structures with relevance for fields such as photonics, electronics and photovoltaics. However, these processes are only compatible with specific material compositions, often carbonate salts, thereby hampering widespread applications. Here we present a strategy to convert a wide range of metal carbonate structures into lead halide perovskite semiconductors with tunable bandgaps, while preserving the 3D shape. First, we introduce lead ions by cation exchange. Second, we use carbonate as a leaving group, facilitating anion exchange with halide, which is followed rapidly by methylammonium insertion to form the perovskite. As proof of principle, pre-programmed carbonate salt shapes such as vases, coral-like forms and helices are transformed into perovskites while preserving the morphology and crystallinity of the initial micro-architectures. This approach also readily converts calcium carbonate biominerals into semiconductors, furnishing biological and programmable synthetic shapes with the performance of artificial compositions such as perovskite-based semiconductors.",2
Publisher Correction: Ribosomal synthesis and folding of peptide-helical aromatic foldamer hybrids.,"In the version of this Article originally published, in Fig.1f there was an erroneous 'Gly-Gly' label placed above the foldamer-peptide structure. Furthermore, in Fig. 2a, the expected target structures from substrates 9 and 10 were inadvertently swapped. These errors have been corrected in the online versions.",2
Mutually orthogonal pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pairs.,"Genetically encoding distinct non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins synthesized in cells requires mutually orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS)/tRNA pairs. The pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase/(Pyl)tRNA pair from Methanosarcina mazei (Mm) has been engineered to incorporate diverse ncAAs and is commonly considered an ideal pair for genetic code expansion. However, finding new aaRS/tRNA pairs that share the advantages of the MmPylRS/Mm(Pyl)tRNA pair and are orthogonal to both endogenous aaRS/tRNA pairs and the MmPylRS/Mm(Pyl)tRNA pair has proved challenging. Here we demonstrate that several DeltaNPylRS/(Pyl)tRNACUA pairs, in which PylRS lacks an N-terminal domain, are active, orthogonal and efficiently incorporate ncAAs in Escherichia coli. We create new PylRS/(Pyl)tRNA pairs that are mutually orthogonal to the MmPylRS/Mm(Pyl)tRNA pair and show that transplanting mutations that reprogram the ncAA specificity of MmPylRS into the new PylRS reprograms its substrate specificity. Finally, we show that distinct PylRS/(Pyl)tRNA-derived pairs can function in the same cell, decode distinct codons and incorporate distinct ncAAs.",2
Identification and characterization of diverse coherences in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex.,"The idea that excitonic (electronic) coherences are of fundamental importance to natural photosynthesis gained popularity when slowly dephasing quantum beats (QBs) were observed in the two-dimensional electronic spectra of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex at 77 K. These were assigned to superpositions of excitonic states, a controversial interpretation, as the strong chromophore-environment interactions in the complex suggest fast dephasing. Although it has been pointed out that vibrational motion produces similar spectral signatures, a concrete assignment of these oscillatory signals to distinct physical processes is still lacking. Here we revisit the coherence dynamics of the FMO complex using polarization-controlled two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy, supported by theoretical modelling. We show that the long-lived QBs are exclusively vibrational in origin, whereas the dephasing of the electronic coherences is completed within 240 fs even at 77 K. We further find that specific vibrational coherences are produced via vibronically coupled excited states. The presence of such states suggests that vibronic coupling is relevant for photosynthetic energy transfer.",2
Solvents can control solute molecular identity.,"For solution-phase chemical reactions, the solvent is often considered simply as a medium to allow the reactants to encounter each other by diffusion. Although examples of direct solvent effects on molecular solutes exist, such as the compression of solute bonding electrons due to Pauli repulsion interactions, the solvent is not usually considered a part of the chemical species of interest. We show, using quantum simulations of Na2, that when there are local specific interactions between a solute and solvent that are energetically on the same order as a hydrogen bond, the solvent controls not only the bond dynamics but also the chemical identity of the solute. In tetrahydrofuran, dative bonding interactions between the solvent and Na atoms lead to unique coordination states that must cross a free energy barrier of ~8 kBT-undergoing a chemical reaction-to interconvert. Each coordination state has its own dynamics and spectroscopic signatures, highlighting the importance of considering the solvent in the identity of condensed-phase chemical systems.",2
A new fundamental type of conformational isomerism.,"Isomerism is a fundamental chemical concept, reflecting the fact that the arrangement of atoms in a molecular entity has a profound influence on its chemical and physical properties. Here we describe a previously unclassified fundamental form of conformational isomerism through four resolved stereoisomers of a transoid (BF)O(BF)-quinoxalinoporphyrin. These comprise two pairs of enantiomers that manifest structural relationships not describable within existing IUPAC nomenclature and terminology. They undergo thermal diastereomeric interconversion over a barrier of 104 +/- 2 kJ mol(-1), which we term 'akamptisomerization'. Feasible interconversion processes between conceivable synthesis products and reaction intermediates were mapped out by density functional theory calculations, identifying bond-angle inversion (BAI) at a singly bonded atom as the reaction mechanism. We also introduce the necessary BAI stereodescriptors parvo and amplo. Based on an extended polytope formalism of molecular structure and stereoisomerization, BAI-driven akamptisomerization is shown to be the final fundamental type of conformational isomerization.",2
Fragment-derived inhibitors of human N-myristoyltransferase block capsid assembly and replication of the common cold virus.,"Rhinoviruses (RVs) are the pathogens most often responsible for the common cold, and are a frequent cause of exacerbations in asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis. Here we report the discovery of IMP-1088, a picomolar dual inhibitor of the human N-myristoyltransferases NMT1 and NMT2, and use it to demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of host-cell N-myristoylation rapidly and completely prevents rhinoviral replication without inducing cytotoxicity. The identification of cooperative binding between weak-binding fragments led to rapid inhibitor optimization through fragment reconstruction, structure-guided fragment linking and conformational control over linker geometry. We show that inhibition of the co-translational myristoylation of a specific virus-encoded protein (VP0) by IMP-1088 potently blocks a key step in viral capsid assembly, to deliver a low nanomolar antiviral activity against multiple RV strains, poliovirus and foot and-mouth disease virus, and protection of cells against virus-induced killing, highlighting the potential of host myristoylation as a drug target in picornaviral infections.",2
Enrichment-triggered prodrug activation demonstrated through mitochondria-targeted delivery of doxorubicin and carbon monoxide.,"Controlled activation is a critical component in prodrug development. Here we report a concentration-sensitive platform approach for bioorthogonal prodrug activation by taking advantage of reaction kinetics. Using two 'click and release' systems, we demonstrate enrichment and prodrug activation specifically in mitochondria to demonstrate the principle of the approach. In both cases, the payload (doxorubicin or carbon monoxide) was released inside the mitochondrial matrix following the enrichment-initiated click reaction. Furthermore, mitochondria-targeted delivery yielded substantial augmentation of functional biological and therapeutic effects in vitro and in vivo when compared to controls, which did not result in enrichment. This method is thus a platform for targeted drug delivery that is amenable to conjugation with a variety of molecules and is not limited to cell-surface delivery. Taken together, these two 'click and release' pairs clearly demonstrate the concept of enrichment-triggered drug release and the critical feasibility of treating clinically relevant diseases such as acute liver injury and cancer.",2
Cholesterol catalyses Abeta42 aggregation through a heterogeneous nucleation pathway in the presence of lipid membranes.,"Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with the aberrant aggregation of the amyloid-beta peptide. Although increasing evidence implicates cholesterol in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, the detailed mechanistic link between this lipid molecule and the disease process remains to be fully established. To address this problem, we adopt a kinetics-based strategy that reveals a specific catalytic role of cholesterol in the aggregation of Abeta42 (the 42-residue form of the amyloid-beta peptide). More specifically, we demonstrate that lipid membranes containing cholesterol promote Abeta42 aggregation by enhancing its primary nucleation rate by up to 20-fold through a heterogeneous nucleation pathway. We further show that this process occurs as a result of cooperativity in the interaction of multiple cholesterol molecules with Abeta42. These results identify a specific microscopic pathway by which cholesterol dramatically enhances the onset of Abeta42 aggregation, thereby helping rationalize the link between Alzheimer's disease and the impairment of cholesterol homeostasis.",2
Harvesting multiple electron-hole pairs generated through plasmonic excitation of Au nanoparticles.,"Multi-electron redox reactions, although central to artificial photosynthesis, are kinetically sluggish. Amidst the search for synthetic catalysts for such processes, plasmonic nanoparticles have been found to catalyse multi-electron reduction of CO2 under visible light. This example motivates the need for a general, insight-driven framework for plasmonic catalysis of such multi-electron chemistry. Here, we elucidate the principles underlying the extraction of multiple redox equivalents from a plasmonic photocatalyst. We measure the kinetics of electron harvesting from a gold nanoparticle photocatalyst as a function of photon flux. Our measurements, supported by theoretical modelling, reveal a regime where two-electron transfer from the excited gold nanoparticle becomes prevalent. Multiple electron harvesting becomes possible under continuous-wave, visible-light excitation of moderate intensity due to strong interband transitions in gold and electron-hole separation accomplished using a hole scavenger. These insights will help expand the utility of plasmonic photocatalysis beyond CO2 reduction to other challenging multi-electron, multi-proton transformations such as N2 fixation.",2
Two-dimensional Na-Cl crystals of unconventional stoichiometries on graphene surface from dilute solution at ambient conditions.,"NaCl in a 1:1 stoichiometry is the only known stable form of the Na-Cl crystal under ambient conditions, and non-1:1 Na-Cl species can only form under extreme conditions, such as high pressures. Here we report the direct observation, under ambient conditions, of Na2Cl and Na3Cl as two-dimensional (2D) Na-Cl crystals, together with regular NaCl, on reduced graphene oxide membranes and on the surfaces of natural graphite powders from salt solutions far below the saturated concentration. Molecular dynamics and density functional theory calculations suggest that this unconventional crystallization process originates from the cation-pi interaction between the ions and the pi-conjugated system in the graphitic surface, which promotes the ion-surface adsorption. The strong Na(+)-pi interaction and charge transfer lead to stoichiometries with an excess of Na(+). With unique electron and spin distributions and bonding, the resulting 2D crystals may have unusual electronic, magnetic, optical and mechanical properties.",2
Publisher Correction: O2-O2 and O2-N2 collision-induced absorption mechanisms unravelled.,"In the version of this Article originally published, Figures 3 and 4 were erroneously swapped, this has been corrected in all versions of the Article.",2
Manganese-catalysed benzylic C(sp(3))-H amination for late-stage functionalization.,"Reactions that directly install nitrogen into C-H bonds of complex molecules are significant because of their potential to change the chemical and biological properties of a given compound. Although selective intramolecular C-H amination reactions are known, achieving high levels of reactivity while maintaining excellent site selectivity and functional-group tolerance remains a challenge for intermolecular C-H amination. Here, we report a manganese perchlorophthalocyanine catalyst [MnIII(ClPc)] for intermolecular benzylic C-H amination of bioactive molecules and natural products that proceeds with unprecedented levels of reactivity and site selectivity. In the presence of a Bronsted or Lewis acid, the [MnIII(ClPc)]-catalysed C-H amination demonstrates unique tolerance for tertiary amine, pyridine and benzimidazole functionalities. Mechanistic studies suggest that C-H amination likely proceeds through an electrophilic metallonitrene intermediate via a stepwise pathway where C-H cleavage is the rate-determining step of the reaction. Collectively, these mechanistic features contrast with previous base-metal-catalysed C-H aminations and provide new opportunities for tunable selectivities.",2
Engineering the entropy-driven free-energy landscape of a dynamic nanoporous protein assembly.,"De novo design and construction of stimuli-responsive protein assemblies that predictably switch between discrete conformational states remains an essential but highly challenging goal in biomolecular design. We previously reported synthetic, two-dimensional protein lattices self-assembled via disulfide bonding interactions, which endows them with a unique capacity to undergo coherent conformational changes without losing crystalline order. Here, we carried out all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to map the free-energy landscape of these lattices, validated this landscape through extensive structural characterization by electron microscopy and established that it is predominantly governed by solvent reorganization entropy. Subsequent redesign of the protein surface with conditionally repulsive electrostatic interactions enabled us to predictably perturb the free-energy landscape and obtain a new protein lattice whose conformational dynamics can be chemically and mechanically toggled between three different states with varying porosities and molecular densities.",2
Cyclization of peptides with two chemical bridges affords large scaffold diversities.,"Successful screening campaigns depend on large and structurally diverse collections of compounds. In macrocycle screening, variation of the molecular scaffold is important for structural diversity, but so far it has been challenging to diversify this aspect in large combinatorial libraries. Here, we report the cyclization of peptides with two chemical bridges to provide rapid access to thousands of different macrocyclic scaffolds in libraries that are easy to synthesize, screen and decode. Application of this strategy to phage-encoded libraries allowed for the screening of an unprecedented structural diversity of macrocycles against plasma kallikrein, which is important in the swelling disorder hereditary angioedema. These libraries yielded inhibitors with remarkable binding properties (subnanomolar Ki, >1,000-fold selectivity) despite the small molecular mass (~1,200 Da). An interlaced bridge format characteristic of this strategy provided high proteolytic stability (t1/2 in plasma of >3 days), making double-bridged peptides potentially amenable to topical or oral delivery.",2
Dynamic actuation of glassy polymersomes through isomerization of a single azobenzene unit at the block copolymer interface.,"Nature has engineered exquisitely responsive systems where molecular-scale information is transferred across an interface and propagated over long length scales. Such systems rely on multiple interacting, signalling and adaptable molecular and supramolecular networks that are built on dynamic, non-equilibrium structures. Comparable synthetic systems are still in their infancy. Here, we demonstrate that the light-induced actuation of a molecularly thin interfacial layer, assembled from a hydrophilic- azobenzene -hydrophobic diblock copolymer, can result in a reversible, long-lived perturbation of a robust glassy membrane across a range of over 500 chemical bonds. We show that the out-of-equilibrium actuation is caused by the photochemical trans-cis isomerization of the azo group, a single chemical functionality, in the middle of the interfacial layer. The principles proposed here are implemented in water-dispersed nanocapsules, and have implications for on-demand release of embedded cargo molecules.",2
Rapid phenolic O-glycosylation of small molecules and complex unprotected peptides in aqueous solvent.,"Glycosylated natural products and synthetic glycopeptides represent a significant and growing source of biochemical probes and therapeutic agents. However, methods that enable the aqueous glycosylation of endogenous amino acid functionality in peptides without the use of protecting groups are scarce. Here, we report a transformation that facilitates the efficient aqueous O-glycosylation of phenolic functionality in a wide range of small molecules, unprotected tyrosine, and tyrosine residues embedded within a range of complex, fully unprotected peptides. The transformation, which uses glycosyl fluoride donors and is promoted by Ca(OH)2, proceeds rapidly at room temperature in water, with good yields and selective formation of unique anomeric products depending on the stereochemistry of the glycosyl donor. High functional group tolerance is observed, and the phenol glycosylation occurs selectively in the presence of virtually all side chains of the proteinogenic amino acids with the singular exception of Cys. This method offers a highly selective, efficient, and operationally simple approach for the protecting-group-free synthesis of O-aryl glycosides and Tyr-O-glycosylated peptides in water.",2
A molecular multi-gene classifier for disease diagnostics.,"Despite its early promise as a diagnostic and prognostic tool, gene expression profiling remains cost-prohibitive and challenging to implement in a clinical setting. Here, we introduce a molecular computation strategy for analysing the information contained in complex gene expression signatures without the need for costly instrumentation. Our workflow begins by training a computational classifier on labelled gene expression data. This in silico classifier is then realized at the molecular level to enable expression analysis and classification of previously uncharacterized samples. Classification occurs through a series of molecular interactions between RNA inputs and engineered DNA probes designed to differentially weigh each input according to its importance. We validate our technology with two applications: a classifier for early cancer diagnostics and a classifier for differentiating viral and bacterial respiratory infections based on host gene expression. Together, our results demonstrate a general and modular framework for low-cost gene expression analysis.",2
Amino-acid-encoded biocatalytic self-assembly enables the formation of transient conducting nanostructures.,"Aqueous compatible supramolecular materials hold promise for applications in environmental remediation, energy harvesting and biomedicine. One remaining challenge is to actively select a target structure from a multitude of possible options, in response to chemical signals, while maintaining constant, physiological conditions. Here, we demonstrate the use of amino acids to actively decorate a self-assembling core molecule in situ, thereby controlling its amphiphilicity and consequent mode of assembly. The core molecule is the organic semiconductor naphthalene diimide, functionalized with D- and L- tyrosine methyl esters as competing reactive sites. In the presence of alpha-chymotrypsin and a selected encoding amino acid, kinetic competition between ester hydrolysis and amidation results in covalent or non-covalent amino acid incorporation, and variable supramolecular self-assembly pathways. Taking advantage of the semiconducting nature of the naphthalene diimide core, electronic wires could be formed and subsequently degraded, giving rise to temporally regulated electro-conductivity.",2
Ring-through-ring molecular shuttling in a saturated [3]rotaxane.,"Mechanically interlocked molecules such as rotaxanes and catenanes comprise two or more components whose motion relative to each other can be controlled. A [2]rotaxane molecular shuttle, for example, consists of an axle bearing two recognition sites and a single macrocyclic wheel that can undergo a to-and-fro motion along the axle-shuttling between the recognition sites. The ability of mechanically interlocked molecules to undergo this type of large-amplitude change is the core mechanism behind almost every interlocked molecular switch or machine, including sophisticated mechanical systems such as a molecular elevator and a peptide synthesizer. Here, as a way to expand the scope of dynamics possible at the molecular level, we have developed a molecular shuttling mechanism involving the exchange of rings between two recognition sites in a saturated [3]rotaxane (one with no empty recognition sites). This was accomplished by passing a smaller ring through a larger one, thus achieving ring-through-ring molecular shuttling.",2
Reversible calcium alloying enables a practical room-temperature rechargeable calcium-ion battery with a high discharge voltage.,"Calcium-ion batteries (CIBs) are attractive candidates for energy storage because Ca(2+) has low polarization and a reduction potential (-2.87 V versus standard hydrogen electrode, SHE) close to that of Li(+) (-3.04 V versus SHE), promising a wide voltage window for a full battery. However, their development is limited by difficulties such as the lack of proper cathode/anode materials for reversible Ca(2+) intercalation/de-intercalation, low working voltages (<2 V), low cycling stability, and especially poor room-temperature performance. Here, we report a CIB that can work stably at room temperature in a new cell configuration using graphite as the cathode and tin foils as the anode as well as the current collector. This CIB operates on a highly reversible electrochemical reaction that combines hexafluorophosphate intercalation/de-intercalation at the cathode and a Ca-involved alloying/de-alloying reaction at the anode. An optimized CIB exhibits a working voltage of up to 4.45 V with capacity retention of 95% after 350 cycles.",2
Direct observation of forward-scattering oscillations in the H+HD-->H2+D reaction.,"Accurate measurements of product state-resolved angular distributions are central to fundamental studies of chemical reaction dynamics. Yet, fine quantum-mechanical structures in product angular distributions of a reactive scattering process, such as the fast oscillations in the forward-scattering direction, have never been observed experimentally and the nature of these oscillations has not been fully explored. Here we report the crossed-molecular-beam experimental observation of these fast forward-scattering oscillations in the product angular distribution of the benchmark chemical reaction, H + HD --> H2 + D. Clear oscillatory structures are observed for the H2(v' = 0, j' = 1, 3) product states at a collision energy of 1.35 eV, in excellent agreement with the quantum-mechanical dynamics calculations. Our analysis reveals that the oscillatory forward-scattering components are mainly contributed by the total angular momentum J around 28. The partial waves and impact parameters responsible for the forward scatterings are also determined from these observed oscillations, providing crucial dynamics information on the transient reaction process.",2
I-motif DNA structures are formed in the nuclei of human cells.,"Human genome function is underpinned by the primary storage of genetic information in canonical B-form DNA, with a second layer of DNA structure providing regulatory control. I-motif structures are thought to form in cytosine-rich regions of the genome and to have regulatory functions; however, in vivo evidence for the existence of such structures has so far remained elusive. Here we report the generation and characterization of an antibody fragment (iMab) that recognizes i-motif structures with high selectivity and affinity, enabling the detection of i-motifs in the nuclei of human cells. We demonstrate that the in vivo formation of such structures is cell-cycle and pH dependent. Furthermore, we provide evidence that i-motif structures are formed in regulatory regions of the human genome, including promoters and telomeric regions. Our results support the notion that i-motif structures provide key regulatory roles in the genome.",2
Cold quantum-controlled rotationally inelastic scattering of HD with H2 and D2 reveals collisional partner reorientation.,"Molecular interactions are best probed by scattering experiments. Interpretation of these studies has been limited by lack of control over the quantum states of the incoming collision partners. We report here the rotationally inelastic collisions of quantum-state prepared deuterium hydride (HD) with H2 and D2 using a method that provides an improved control over the input states. HD was coexpanded with its partner in a single supersonic beam, which reduced the collision temperature to 0-5 K, and thereby restricted the involved incoming partial waves to s and p. By preparing HD with its bond axis preferentially aligned parallel and perpendicular to the relative velocity of the colliding partners, we observed that the rotational relaxation of HD depends strongly on the initial bond-axis orientation. We developed a partial-wave analysis that conclusively demonstrates that the scattering mechanism involves the exchange of internal angular momentum between the colliding partners. The striking differences between H2/HD and D2/HD scattering suggest the presence of anisotropically sensitive resonances.",2
Tracing the 'ninth sulfur' of the nitrogenase cofactor via a semi-synthetic approach.,"The M-cluster is the [(homocitrate)MoFe7S9C] active site of nitrogenase that is derived from an 8Fe core assembled viacoupling and rearrangement of two [Fe4S4] clusters concomitant with the insertion of an interstitial carbon and a 'ninth sulfur'. Combining synthetic [Fe4S4] clusters with an assembly protein template, here we show that sulfite can give rise to the ninth sulfur that is incorporated in the catalytically important belt region of the cofactor after the radical S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent carbide insertion and the concurrent 8Fe-core rearrangement have already taken place. Based on the differential reactivity of the formed cluster species, we also propose a new [Fe8S8C] cluster intermediate, the L*-cluster, which is similar to the [Fe8S9C] L-cluster, but lacks the ninth sulfur from sulfite. This work provides a semi-synthetic tool for protein reconstitution that could be widely applicable for the functional analysis of other FeS systems.",2
Understanding the quantum nature of low-energy C((3)P j ) + He inelastic collisions.,"Inelastic collisions that occur between open-shell atoms and other atoms or molecules, and that promote a spin-orbit transition, involve multiple interaction potentials. They are non-adiabatic by nature and cannot be described within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation; in particular, their theoretical modelling becomes very challenging when the collision energies have values comparable to the spin-orbit splitting. Here we study inelastic collisions between carbon in its ground state C((3)Pj=0) and helium atoms-at collision energies in the vicinity of spin-orbit excitation thresholds (~0.2 and 0.5 kJ mol(-1))-that result in spin-orbit excitation to C((3)Pj=1) and C((3)Pj=2). State-to-state integral cross-sections are obtained from crossed-beam experiments with a beam source that provides an almost pure beam of C((3)Pj=0) . We observe very good agreement between experimental and theoretical results (acquired using newly calculated potential energy curves), which validates our characterization of the quantum dynamical resonances that are observed. Rate coefficients at very low temperatures suitable for chemical modelling of the interstellar medium are also calculated.",2
Retraction Note: Catalytic living ring-opening metathesis polymerization.,"We the authors are retracting this Article because of our failure to reproduce the molecular weight dispersities (PDI) shown in Fig. 4 using the chain-transfer agent described in the paper (CTA1). While the degenerate chain-transfer mechanism described in Fig. 3 is correct, the best molecular weight dispersities that could be reproduced with the chain-transfer agent shown in the Article are much larger (PDI > 2.0) than reported.We have since studied the kinetics of CTA1 in comparison with several other chain-transfer agents we are currently investigating and we now understand that the reactivity of CTA1 towards propagating ruthenium alkylidene complexes is very low. Very long monomer addition times would therefore have been necessary to gain control over the molecular weight distribution. Such long addition times would exceed the lifetime of the Grubbs catalyst in solution. Faster addition of the monomer has since repeatedly been shown to broaden the molecular weight dispersity.Additionally, the best chain-transfer agents we are currently investigating are orders of magnitude more reactive than CTA1 but give broader molecular weight dispersities than reported in Fig. 4. Molecular weight and dispersity control as shown in Fig. 4 is therefore an inappropriate claim for CTA1.The authors deeply regret these errors and apologize to the community.",2
O2-O2 and O2-N2 collision-induced absorption mechanisms unravelled.,"Collision-induced absorption is the phenomenon in which interactions between colliding molecules lead to absorption of light, even for transitions that are forbidden for the isolated molecules. Collision-induced absorption contributes to the atmospheric heat balance and is important for the electronic excitations of O2 that are used for remote sensing. Here, we present a theoretical study of five vibronic transitions in O2-O2 and O2-N2, using analytical models and numerical quantum scattering calculations. We unambiguously identify the underlying absorption mechanism, which is shown to depend explicitly on the collision partner-contrary to textbook knowledge. This explains experimentally observed qualitative differences between O2-O2 and O2-N2 collisions in the overall intensity, line shape and vibrational dependence of the absorption spectrum. It is shown that these results can be used to discriminate between conflicting experimental data and even to identify unphysical results, thus impacting future experimental studies and atmospheric applications.",2
A [4Fe-4S]-Fe(CO)(CN)-L-cysteine intermediate is the first organometallic precursor in [FeFe] hydrogenase H-cluster bioassembly.,"Biosynthesis of the [FeFe] hydrogenase active site (the 'H-cluster') requires the interplay of multiple proteins and small molecules. Among them, the radical S-adenosylmethionine enzyme HydG, a tyrosine lyase, has been proposed to generate a complex that contains an Fe(CO)2(CN) moiety that is eventually incorporated into the H-cluster. Here we describe the characterization of an intermediate in the HydG reaction: a [4Fe-4S][(Cys)Fe(CO)(CN)] species, 'Complex A', in which a CO, a CN(-) and a cysteine (Cys) molecule bind to the unique 'dangler' Fe site of the auxiliary [5Fe-4S] cluster of HydG. The identification of this intermediate-the first organometallic precursor to the H-cluster-validates the previously hypothesized HydG reaction cycle and provides a basis for elucidating the biosynthetic origin of other moieties of the H-cluster.",2
A general strategy for synthesis of cyclophane-braced peptide macrocycles via palladium-catalysed intramolecular sp(3) C-H arylation.,"New methods capable of effecting cyclization, and forming novel three-dimensional structures while maintaining favourable physicochemical properties are needed to facilitate the development of cyclic peptide-based drugs that can engage challenging biological targets, such as protein-protein interactions. Here, we report a highly efficient and generally applicable strategy for constructing new types of peptide macrocycles using palladium-catalysed intramolecular C(sp(3))-H arylation reactions. Easily accessible linear peptide precursors of simple and versatile design can be selectively cyclized at the side chains of either aromatic or modified non-aromatic amino acid units to form various cyclophane-braced peptide cycles. This strategy provides a powerful tool to address the long-standing challenge of size- and composition-dependence in peptide macrocyclization, and generates novel peptide macrocycles with uniquely buttressed backbones and distinct loop-type three-dimensional structures. Preliminary cell proliferation screening of the pilot library revealed a potent lead compound with selective cytotoxicity toward proliferative Myc-dependent cancer cell lines.",2
Single helically folded aromatic oligoamides that mimic the charge surface of double-stranded B-DNA.,"Numerous essential biomolecular processes require the recognition of DNA surface features by proteins. Molecules mimicking these features could potentially act as decoys and interfere with pharmacologically or therapeutically relevant protein-DNA interactions. Although naturally occurring DNA-mimicking proteins have been described, synthetic tunable molecules that mimic the charge surface of double-stranded DNA are not known. Here, we report the design, synthesis and structural characterization of aromatic oligoamides that fold into single helical conformations and display a double helical array of negatively charged residues in positions that match the phosphate moieties in B-DNA. These molecules were able to inhibit several enzymes possessing non-sequence-selective DNA-binding properties, including topoisomerase 1 and HIV-1 integrase, presumably through specific foldamer-protein interactions, whereas sequence-selective enzymes were not inhibited. Such modular and synthetically accessible DNA mimics provide a versatile platform to design novel inhibitors of protein-DNA interactions.",2
Single-cell mRNA cytometry via sequence-specific nanoparticle clustering and trapping.,"Cell-to-cell variation in gene expression creates a need for techniques that can characterize expression at the level of individual cells. This is particularly true for rare circulating tumour cells, in which subtyping and drug resistance are of intense interest. Here we describe a method for cell analysis-single-cell mRNA cytometry-that enables the isolation of rare cells from whole blood as a function of target mRNA sequences. This approach uses two classes of magnetic particles that are labelled to selectively hybridize with different regions of the target mRNA. Hybridization leads to the formation of large magnetic clusters that remain localized within the cells of interest, thereby enabling the cells to be magnetically separated. Targeting specific intracellular mRNAs enablescirculating tumour cells to be distinguished from normal haematopoietic cells. No polymerase chain reaction amplification is required to determine RNA expression levels and genotype at the single-cell level, and minimal cell manipulation is required. To demonstrate this approach we use single-cell mRNA cytometry to detect clinically important sequences in prostate cancer specimens.",2
Second-generation DNA-templated macrocycle libraries for the discovery of bioactive small molecules.,"DNA-encoded libraries have emerged as a widely used resource for the discovery of bioactive small molecules, and offer substantial advantages compared with conventional small-molecule libraries. Here, we have developed and streamlined multiple fundamental aspects of DNA-encoded and DNA-templated library synthesis methodology, including computational identification and experimental validation of a 20 x 20 x 20 x 80 set of orthogonal codons, chemical and computational tools for enhancing the structural diversity and drug-likeness of library members, a highly efficient polymerase-mediated template library assembly strategy, and library isolation and purification methods. We have integrated these improved methods to produce a second-generation DNA-templated library of 256,000 small-molecule macrocycles with improved drug-like physical properties. In vitro selection of this library for insulin-degrading enzyme affinity resulted in novel insulin-degrading enzyme inhibitors, including one of unusual potency and novel macrocycle stereochemistry (IC50 = 40 nM). Collectively, these developments enable DNA-templated small-molecule libraries to serve as more powerful, accessible, streamlined and cost-effective tools for bioactive small-molecule discovery.",2
High phase-purity 1T'-MoS2- and 1T'-MoSe2-layered crystals.,"Phase control plays an important role in the precise synthesis of inorganic materials, as the phase structure has a profound influence on properties such as conductivity and chemical stability. Phase-controlled preparation has been challenging for the metallic-phase group-VI transition metal dichalcogenides (the transition metals are Mo and W, and the chalcogens are S, Se and Te), which show better performance in electrocatalysis than their semiconducting counterparts. Here, we report the large-scale preparation of micrometre-sized metallic-phase 1T'-MoX2 (X = S, Se)-layered bulk crystals in high purity. We reveal that 1T'-MoS2 crystals feature a distorted octahedral coordination structure and are convertible to 2H-MoS2 following thermal annealing or laser irradiation. Electrochemical measurements show that the basal plane of 1T'-MoS2 is much more active than that of 2H-MoS2 for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction in an acidic medium.",2
An artificial interphase enables reversible magnesium chemistry in carbonate electrolytes.,"Magnesium-based batteries possess potential advantages over their lithium counterparts. However, reversible Mg chemistry requires a thermodynamically stable electrolyte at low potential, which is usually achieved with corrosive components and at the expense of stability against oxidation. In lithium-ion batteries the conflict between the cathodic and anodic stabilities of the electrolytes is resolved by forming an anode interphase that shields the electrolyte from being reduced. This strategy cannot be applied to Mg batteries because divalent Mg(2+) cannot penetrate such interphases. Here, we engineer an artificial Mg(2+)-conductive interphase on the Mg anode surface, which successfully decouples the anodic and cathodic requirements for electrolytes and demonstrate highly reversible Mg chemistry in oxidation-resistant electrolytes. The artificial interphase enables the reversible cycling of a Mg/V2O5 full-cell in the water-containing, carbonate-based electrolyte. This approach provides a new avenue not only for Mg but also for other multivalent-cation batteries facing the same problems, taking a step towards their use in energy-storage applications.",2
Distinct thermodynamic signatures of oligomer generation in the aggregation of the amyloid-beta peptide.,"Mapping free-energy landscapes has proved to be a powerful tool for studying reaction mechanisms. Many complex biomolecular assembly processes, however, have remained challenging to access using this approach, including the aggregation of peptides and proteins into amyloid fibrils implicated in a range of disorders. Here, we generalize the strategy used to probe free-energy landscapes in protein folding to determine the activation energies and entropies that characterize each of the molecular steps in the aggregation of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta42), which is associated with Alzheimer's disease. Our results reveal that interactions between monomeric Abeta42 and amyloid fibrils during fibril-dependent secondary nucleation fundamentally reverse the thermodynamic signature of this process relative to primary nucleation, even though both processes generate aggregates from soluble peptides. By mapping the energetic and entropic contributions along the reaction trajectories, we show that the catalytic efficiency of Abeta42 fibril surfaces results from the enthalpic stabilization of adsorbing peptides in conformations amenable to nucleation, resulting in a dramatic lowering of the activation energy for nucleation.",2
Cooperative communication within and between single nanocatalysts.,"Enzymes often show catalytic allostery in which reactions occurring at different sites communicate cooperatively over distances of up to a few nanometres. Whether such effects can occur with non-biological nanocatalysts remains unclear, even though these nanocatalysts can undergo restructuring and molecules can diffuse over catalyst surfaces. Here we report that phenomenologically similar, but mechanistically distinct, cooperative effects indeed exist for nanocatalysts. Using spatiotemporally resolved single-molecule catalysis imaging, we find that catalytic reactions on a single Pd or Au nanocatalyst can communicate with each other, probably via hopping of positively charged holes on the catalyst surface, over ~10(2) nanometres and with a temporal memory of ~10(1) to 10(2) seconds, giving rise to positive cooperativity among its surface active sites. Similar communication is also observed between individual nanocatalysts, however it operates via a molecular diffusion mechanism involving negatively charged product molecules, and its communication distance is many micrometres. Generalization of these long-range intra- and interparticle catalytic communication mechanisms may introduce a novel conceptual framework for understanding nanoscale catalysis.",2
Strategies for microbial synthesis of high-value phytochemicals.,"Phytochemicals are of great pharmaceutical and agricultural importance, but often exhibit low abundance in nature. Recent demonstrations of industrial-scale production of phytochemicals in yeast have shown that microbial production of these high-value chemicals is a promising alternative to sourcing these molecules from native plant hosts. However, a number of challenges remain in the broader application of this approach, including the limited knowledge of plant secondary metabolism and the inefficient reconstitution of plant metabolic pathways in microbial hosts. In this Review, we discuss recent strategies to achieve microbial biosynthesis of complex phytochemicals, including strategies to: (1) reconstruct plant biosynthetic pathways that have not been fully elucidated by mining enzymes from native and non-native hosts or by enzyme engineering; (2) enhance plant enzyme activity, specifically cytochrome P450 activity, by improving efficiency, selectivity, expression or electron transfer; and (3) enhance overall reaction efficiency of multi-enzyme pathways by dynamic control, compartmentalization or optimization with the host's metabolism. We also highlight remaining challenges to - and future opportunities of - this approach.",2
Organic synthesis provides opportunities to transform drug discovery.,"Despite decades of ground-breaking research in academia, organic synthesis is still a rate-limiting factor in drug-discovery projects. Here we present some current challenges in synthetic organic chemistry from the perspective of the pharmaceutical industry and highlight problematic steps that, if overcome, would find extensive application in the discovery of transformational medicines. Significant synthesis challenges arise from the fact that drug molecules typically contain amines and N-heterocycles, as well as unprotected polar groups. There is also a need for new reactions that enable non-traditional disconnections, more C-H bond activation and late-stage functionalization, as well as stereoselectively substituted aliphatic heterocyclic ring synthesis, C-X or C-C bond formation. We also emphasize that syntheses compatible with biomacromolecules will find increasing use, while new technologies such as machine-assisted approaches and artificial intelligence for synthesis planning have the potential to dramatically accelerate the drug-discovery process. We believe that increasing collaboration between academic and industrial chemists is crucial to address the challenges outlined here.",2
Experimental and computational evidence of halogen bonds involving astatine.,"The importance of halogen bonds-highly directional interactions between an electron-deficient sigma-hole moiety in a halogenated compound and an acceptor such as a Lewis base-is being increasingly recognized in a wide variety of fields from biomedicinal chemistry to materials science. The heaviest halogens are known to form stronger halogen bonds, implying that if this trend continues down the periodic table, astatine should exhibit the highest halogen-bond donating ability. This may be mitigated, however, by the relativistic effects undergone by heavy elements, as illustrated by the metallic character of astatine. Here, the occurrence of halogen-bonding interactions involving astatine is experimentally evidenced. The complexation constants of astatine monoiodide with a series of organic ligands in cyclohexane solution were derived from distribution coefficient measurements and supported by relativistic quantum mechanical calculations. Taken together, the results show that astatine indeed behaves as a halogen-bond donor-a stronger one than iodine-owing to its much more electrophilic sigma-hole.",2
Ribosomal synthesis and folding of peptide-helical aromatic foldamer hybrids.,"Translation, the mRNA-templated synthesis of peptides by the ribosome, can be manipulated to incorporate variants of the 20 cognate amino acids. Such approaches for expanding the range of chemical entities that can be produced by the ribosome may accelerate the discovery of molecules that can perform functions for which poorly folded, short peptidic sequences are ill suited. Here, we show that the ribosome tolerates some artificial helical aromatic oligomers, so-called foldamers. Using a flexible tRNA-acylation ribozyme-flexizyme-foldamers were attached to tRNA, and the resulting acylated tRNAs were delivered to the ribosome to initiate the synthesis of non-cyclic and cyclic foldamer-peptide hybrid molecules. Passing through the ribosome exit tunnel requires the foldamers to unfold. Yet foldamers encode sufficient folding information to influence the peptide structure once translation is completed. We also show that in cyclic hybrids, the foldamer portion can fold into a helix and force the peptide segment to adopt a constrained and stretched conformation.",2
Evidence for a vibrational phase-dependent isotope effect on the photochemistry of vision.,"Vibronic coupling is key to efficient energy flow in molecular systems and a critical component of most mechanisms invoking quantum effects in biological processes. Despite increasing evidence for coherent coupling of electronic states being mediated by vibrational motion, it is not clear how and to what degree properties associated with vibrational coherence such as phase and coupling of atomic motion can impact the efficiency of light-induced processes under natural, incoherent illumination. Here, we show that deuteration of the H11-C11=C12-H12 double-bond of the 11-cis retinal chromophore in the visual pigment rhodopsin significantly and unexpectedly alters the photoisomerization yield while inducing smaller changes in the ultrafast isomerization dynamics assignable to known isotope effects. Combination of these results with non-adiabatic molecular dynamics simulations reveals a vibrational phase-dependent isotope effect that we suggest is an intrinsic attribute of vibronically coherent photochemical processes.",2
Versatile protein recognition by the encoded display of multiple chemical elements on a constant macrocyclic scaffold.,"In nature, specific antibodies can be generated as a result of an adaptive selection and expansion of lymphocytes with suitable protein binding properties. We attempted to mimic antibody-antigen recognition by displaying multiple chemical diversity elements on a defined macrocyclic scaffold. Encoding of the displayed combinations was achieved using distinctive DNA tags, resulting in a library size of 35,393,112. Specific binders could be isolated against a variety of proteins, including carbonic anhydrase IX, horseradish peroxidase, tankyrase 1, human serum albumin, alpha-1 acid glycoprotein, calmodulin, prostate-specific antigen and tumour necrosis factor. Similar to antibodies, the encoded display of multiple chemical elements on a constant scaffold enabled practical applications, such as fluorescence microscopy procedures or the selective in vivo delivery of payloads to tumours. Furthermore, the versatile structure of the scaffold facilitated the generation of protein-specific chemical probes, as illustrated by photo-crosslinking.",2
Genetically encoded lipid-polypeptide hybrid biomaterials that exhibit temperature-triggered hierarchical self-assembly.,"Post-translational modification of proteins is a strategy widely used in biological systems. It expands the diversity of the proteome and allows for tailoring of both the function and localization of proteins within cells as well as the material properties of structural proteins and matrices. Despite their ubiquity in biology, with a few exceptions, the potential of post-translational modifications in biomaterials synthesis has remained largely untapped. As a proof of concept to demonstrate the feasibility of creating a genetically encoded biohybrid material through post-translational modification, we report here the generation of a family of three stimulus-responsive hybrid materials-fatty-acid-modified elastin-like polypeptides-using a one-pot recombinant expression and post-translational lipidation methodology. These hybrid biomaterials contain an amphiphilic domain, composed of a beta-sheet-forming peptide that is post-translationally functionalized with a C14 alkyl chain, fused to a thermally responsive elastin-like polypeptide. They exhibit temperature-triggered hierarchical self-assembly across multiple length scales with varied structure and material properties that can be controlled at the sequence level.",2
Crystal phase-based epitaxial growth of hybrid noble metal nanostructures on 4H/fcc Au nanowires.,"Crystal-phase engineering offers opportunities for the rational design and synthesis of noble metal nanomaterials with unusual crystal phases that normally do not exist in bulk materials. However, it remains a challenge to use these materials as seeds to construct heterometallic nanostructures with desired crystal phases and morphologies for promising applications such as catalysis. Here, we report a strategy for the synthesis of binary and ternary hybrid noble metal nanostructures. Our synthesized crystal-phase heterostructured 4H/fcc Au nanowires enable the epitaxial growth of Ru nanorods on the 4H phase and fcc-twin boundary in Au nanowires, resulting in hybrid Au-Ru nanowires. Moreover, the method can be extended to the epitaxial growth of Rh, Ru-Rh and Ru-Pt nanorods on the 4H/fcc Au nanowires to form unique hybrid nanowires. Importantly, the Au-Ru hybrid nanowires with tunable compositions exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance towards the hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline media.",2
Hydroxide diffuses slower than hydronium in water because its solvated structure inhibits correlated proton transfer.,"Proton transfer via hydronium and hydroxide ions in water is ubiquitous. It underlies acid-base chemistry, certain enzyme reactions, and even infection by the flu. Despite two centuries of investigation, the mechanism underlying why hydroxide diffuses slower than hydronium in water is still not well understood. Herein, we employ state-of-the-art density-functional-theory-based molecular dynamics-with corrections for non-local van der Waals interactions, and self-interaction in the electronic ground state-to model water and hydrated water ions. At this level of theory, we show that structural diffusion of hydronium preserves the previously recognized concerted behaviour. However, by contrast, proton transfer via hydroxide is less temporally correlated, due to a stabilized hypercoordination solvation structure that discourages proton transfer. Specifically, the latter exhibits non-planar geometry, which agrees with neutron-scattering results. Asymmetry in the temporal correlation of proton transfer leads to hydroxide diffusing slower than hydronium.",2
Dynamic protein assembly by programmable DNA strand displacement.,"Inspired by the remarkable ability of natural protein switches to sense and respond to a wide range of environmental queues, here we report a strategy to engineer synthetic protein switches by using DNA strand displacement to dynamically organize proteins with highly diverse and complex logic gate architectures. We show that DNA strand displacement can be used to dynamically control the spatial proximity and the corresponding fluorescence resonance energy transfer between two fluorescent proteins. Performing Boolean logic operations enabled the explicit control of protein proximity using multi-input, reversible and amplification architectures. We further demonstrate the power of this technology beyond sensing by achieving dynamic control of an enzyme cascade. Finally, we establish the utility of the approach as a synthetic computing platform that drives the dynamic reconstitution of a split enzyme for targeted prodrug activation based on the sensing of cancer-specific miRNAs.",2
Evolution of sequence-defined highly functionalized nucleic acid polymers.,"The evolution of sequence-defined synthetic polymers made of building blocks beyond those compatible with polymerase enzymes or the ribosome has the potential to generate new classes of receptors, catalysts and materials. Here we describe a ligase-mediated DNA-templated polymerization and in vitro selection system to evolve highly functionalized nucleic acid polymers (HFNAPs) made from 32 building blocks that contain eight chemically diverse side chains on a DNA backbone. Through iterated cycles of polymer translation, selection and reverse translation, we discovered HFNAPs that bind proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and interleukin-6, two protein targets implicated in human diseases. Mutation and reselection of an active PCSK9-binding polymer yielded evolved polymers with high affinity (KD = 3 nM). This evolved polymer potently inhibited the binding between PCSK9 and the low-density lipoprotein receptor. Structure-activity relationship studies revealed that specific side chains at defined positions in the polymers are required for binding to their respective targets. Our findings expand the chemical space of evolvable polymers to include densely functionalized nucleic acids with diverse, researcher-defined chemical repertoires.",2
Control over phase separation and nucleation using a laser-tweezing potential.,"Control over the nucleation of new phases is highly desirable but elusive. Even though there is a long history of crystallization engineering by varying physicochemical parameters, controlling which polymorph crystallizes or whether a molecule crystallizes or forms an amorphous precipitate is still a poorly understood practice. Although there are now numerous examples of control using laser-induced nucleation, the absence of physical understanding is preventing progress. Here we show that the proximity of a liquid-liquid critical point or the corresponding binodal line can be used by a laser-tweezing potential to induce concentration gradients. A simple theoretical model shows that the stored electromagnetic energy of the laser beam produces a free-energy potential that forces phase separation or triggers the nucleation of a new phase. Experiments in a liquid mixture using a low-power laser diode confirm the effect. Phase separation and nucleation using a laser-tweezing potential explains the physics behind non-photochemical laser-induced nucleation and suggests new ways of manipulating matter.",2
Chemical evolution of atmospheric organic carbon over multiple generations of oxidation.,"The evolution of atmospheric organic carbon as it undergoes oxidation has a controlling influence on concentrations of key atmospheric species, including particulate matter, ozone and oxidants. However, full characterization of organic carbon over hours to days of atmospheric processing has been stymied by its extreme chemical complexity. Here we study the multigenerational oxidation of alpha-pinene in the laboratory, characterizing products with several state-of-the-art analytical techniques. Although quantification of some early generation products remains elusive, full carbon closure is achieved (within measurement uncertainty) by the end of the experiments. These results provide new insights into the effects of oxidation on organic carbon properties (volatility, oxidation state and reactivity) and the atmospheric lifecycle of organic carbon. Following an initial period characterized by functionalization reactions and particle growth, fragmentation reactions dominate, forming smaller species. After approximately one day of atmospheric aging, most carbon is sequestered in two long-lived reservoirs-volatile oxidized gases and low-volatility particulate matter.",2
Observation of the adsorption and desorption of vibrationally excited molecules on a metal surface.,"The most common mechanism of catalytic surface chemistry is that of Langmuir and Hinshelwood (LH). In the LH mechanism, reactants adsorb, become thermalized with the surface, and subsequently react. The measured vibrational (relaxation) lifetimes of molecules adsorbed at metal surfaces are in the range of a few picoseconds. As a consequence, vibrational promotion of LH chemistry is rarely observed, with the exception of LH reactions occurring via a molecular physisorbed intermediate. Here, we directly detect adsorption and subsequent desorption of vibrationally excited CO molecules from a Au(111) surface. Our results show that CO (v = 1) survives on a Au(111) surface for ~1 x 10(-10) s. Such long vibrational lifetimes for adsorbates on metal surfaces are unexpected and pose an interesting challenge to the current understanding of vibrational energy dissipation on metal surfaces. They also suggest that vibrational promotion of surface chemistry might be more common than is generally believed.",2
Palladium-catalysed anti-Markovnikov selective oxidative amination.,"In recent years, the synthesis of amines and other nitrogen-containing motifs has been a major area of research in organic chemistry because they are widely represented in biologically active molecules. Current strategies rely on a multistep approach and require one reactant to be activated prior to the carbon-nitrogen bond formation. This leads to a reaction inefficiency and functional group intolerance. As such, a general approach to the synthesis of nitrogen-containing compounds from readily available and benign starting materials is highly desirable. Here we present a palladium-catalysed oxidative amination reaction in which the addition of the nitrogen occurs at the less-substituted carbon of a double bond, in what is known as anti-Markovnikov selectivity. Alkenes are shown to react with imides in the presence of a palladate catalyst to generate the terminal imide through trans-aminopalladation. Subsequently, olefin isomerization occurs to afford the thermodynamically favoured products. Both the scope of the transformation and mechanistic investigations are reported.",2
Oxygen redox chemistry without excess alkali-metal ions in Na2/3[Mg0.28Mn0.72]O2.,"The search for improved energy-storage materials has revealed Li- and Na-rich intercalation compounds as promising high-capacity cathodes. They exhibit capacities in excess of what would be expected from alkali-ion removal/reinsertion and charge compensation by transition-metal (TM) ions. The additional capacity is provided through charge compensation by oxygen redox chemistry and some oxygen loss. It has been reported previously that oxygen redox occurs in O 2p orbitals that interact with alkali ions in the TM and alkali-ion layers (that is, oxygen redox occurs in compounds containing Li(+)-O(2p)-Li(+) interactions). Na2/3[Mg0.28Mn0.72]O2 exhibits an excess capacity and here we show that this is caused by oxygen redox, even though Mg(2+) resides in the TM layers rather than alkali-metal (AM) ions, which demonstrates that excess AM ions are not required to activate oxygen redox. We also show that, unlike the alkali-rich compounds, Na2/3[Mg0.28Mn0.72]O2 does not lose oxygen. The extraction of alkali ions from the alkali and TM layers in the alkali-rich compounds results in severely underbonded oxygen, which promotes oxygen loss, whereas Mg(2+) remains in Na2/3[Mg0.28Mn0.72]O2, which stabilizes oxygen.",2
Direct observation of the influence of cardiolipin and antibiotics on lipid II binding to MurJ.,"Translocation of lipid II across the cytoplasmic membrane is essential in peptidoglycan biogenesis. Although most steps are understood, identifying the lipid II flippase has yielded conflicting results, and the lipid II binding properties of two candidate flippases-MurJ and FtsW-remain largely unknown. Here we apply native mass spectrometry to both proteins and characterize lipid II binding. We observed lower levels of lipid II binding to FtsW compared to MurJ, consistent with MurJ having a higher affinity. Site-directed mutagenesis of MurJ suggests that mutations at A29 and D269 attenuate lipid II binding to MurJ, whereas chemical modification of A29 eliminates binding. The antibiotic ramoplanin dissociates lipid II from MurJ, whereas vancomycin binds to form a stable complex with MurJ:lipid II. Furthermore, we reveal cardiolipins associate with MurJ but not FtsW, and exogenous cardiolipins reduce lipid II binding to MurJ. These observations provide insights into determinants of lipid II binding to MurJ and suggest roles for endogenous lipids in regulating substrate binding.",2

The role of uranium-arene bonding in H2O reduction catalysis.,"The reactivity of uranium compounds towards small molecules typically occurs through stoichiometric rather than catalytic processes. Examples of uranium catalysts reacting with water are particularly scarce, because stable uranyl groups form that preclude the recovery of the uranium compound. Recently, however, an arene-anchored, electron-rich uranium complex has been shown to facilitate the electrocatalytic formation of H2 from H2O. Here, we present the precise role of uranium-arene delta bonding in intermediates of the catalytic cycle, as well as details of the atypical two-electron oxidative addition of H2O to the trivalent uranium catalyst. Both aspects were explored by synthesizing mid- and high-valent uranium-oxo intermediates and by performing comparative studies with a structurally related complex that cannot engage in delta bonding. The redox activity of the arene anchor and a covalent delta-bonding interaction with the uranium ion during H2 formation were supported by density functional theory analysis. Detailed insight into this catalytic system may inspire the design of ligands for new uranium catalysts.",2
Endothermic singlet fission is hindered by excimer formation.,"Singlet fission is a process whereby two triplet excitons can be produced from one photon, potentially increasing the efficiency of photovoltaic devices. Endothermic singlet fission is desired for a maximum energy-conversion efficiency, and such systems have been considered to form an excimer-like state with multiexcitonic character prior to the appearance of triplets. However, the role of the excimer as an intermediate has, until now, been unclear. Here we show, using 5,12-bis((triisopropylsilyl)ethynyl)tetracene in solution as a prototypical example, that, rather than acting as an intermediate, the excimer serves to trap excited states to the detriment of singlet-fission yield. We clearly demonstrate that singlet fission and its conjugate process, triplet-triplet annihilation, occur at a longer intermolecular distance than an excimer intermediate would impute. These results establish that an endothermic singlet-fission material must be designed to avoid excimer formation, thus allowing singlet fission to reach its full potential in enhancing photovoltaic energy conversion.",2
Ultrafast dynamics of low-energy electron attachment via a non-valence correlation-bound state.,"The primary electron-attachment process in electron-driven chemistry represents one of the most fundamental chemical transformations with wide-ranging importance in science and technology. However, the mechanistic detail of the seemingly simple reaction of an electron and a neutral molecule to form an anion remains poorly understood, particularly at very low electron energies. Here, time-resolved photoelectron imaging was used to probe the electron-attachment process to a non-polar molecule using time-resolved methods. An initially populated diffuse non-valence state of the anion that is bound by correlation forces evolves coherently in approximately 30 fs into a valence state of the anion. The extreme efficiency with which the correlation-bound state serves as a doorway state for low-energy electron attachment explains a number of electron-driven processes, such as anion formation in the interstellar medium and electron attachment to fullerenes.",2
Engineered modular biomaterial logic gates for environmentally triggered therapeutic delivery.,"The successful transport of drug- and cell-based therapeutics to diseased sites represents a major barrier in the development of clinical therapies. Targeted delivery can be mediated through degradable biomaterial vehicles that utilize disease biomarkers to trigger payload release. Here, we report a modular chemical framework for imparting hydrogels with precise degradative responsiveness by using multiple environmental cues to trigger reactions that operate user-programmable Boolean logic. By specifying the molecular architecture and connectivity of orthogonal stimuli-labile moieties within material cross-linkers, we show selective control over gel dissolution and therapeutic delivery. To illustrate the versatility of this methodology, we synthesized 17 distinct stimuli-responsive materials that collectively yielded all possible YES/OR/AND logic outputs from input combinations involving enzyme, reductant and light. Using these hydrogels we demonstrate the first sequential and environmentally stimulated release of multiple cell lines in well-defined combinations from a material. We expect these platforms will find utility in several diverse fields including drug delivery, diagnostics and regenerative medicine.",2
Nonribosomal biosynthesis of backbone-modified peptides.,"Biosynthetic modification of nonribosomal peptide backbones represents a potentially powerful strategy to modulate the structure and properties of an important class of therapeutics. Using a high-throughput assay for catalytic activity, we show here that an L-Phe-specific module of an archetypal nonribosomal peptide synthetase can be reprogrammed to accept and process the backbone-modified amino acid (S)-beta-Phe with near-native specificity and efficiency. A co-crystal structure with a non-hydrolysable aminoacyl-AMP analogue reveals the origins of the 40,000-fold alpha/beta-specificity switch, illuminating subtle but precise remodelling of the active site. When the engineered catalyst was paired with downstream module(s), (S)-beta-Phe-containing peptides were produced at preparative scale in vitro (~1 mmol) and high titres in vivo (~100 mg l(-1)), highlighting the potential of biosynthetic pathway engineering for the construction of novel nonribosomal beta-frameworks.",2
Complex supramolecular interfacial tessellation through convergent multi-step reaction of a dissymmetric simple organic precursor.,"Interfacial supramolecular self-assembly represents a powerful tool for constructing regular and quasicrystalline materials. In particular, complex two-dimensional molecular tessellations, such as semi-regular Archimedean tilings with regular polygons, promise unique properties related to their nontrivial structures. However, their formation is challenging, because current methods are largely limited to the direct assembly of precursors, that is, where structure formation relies on molecular interactions without using chemical transformations. Here, we have chosen ethynyl-iodophenanthrene (which features dissymmetry in both geometry and reactivity) as a single starting precursor to generate the rare semi-regular (3.4.6.4) Archimedean tiling with long-range order on an atomically flat substrate through a multi-step reaction. Intriguingly, the individual chemical transformations converge to form a symmetric alkynyl-Ag-alkynyl complex as the new tecton in high yields. Using a combination of microscopy and X-ray spectroscopy tools, as well as computational modelling, we show that in situ generated catalytic Ag complexes mediate the tecton conversion.",2
Transferring the entatic-state principle to copper photochemistry.,"The entatic state denotes a distorted coordination geometry of a complex from its typical arrangement that generates an improvement to its function. The entatic-state principle has been observed to apply to copper electron-transfer proteins and it results in a lowering of the reorganization energy of the electron-transfer process. It is thus crucial for a multitude of biochemical processes, but its importance to photoactive complexes is unexplored. Here we study a copper complex-with a specifically designed constraining ligand geometry-that exhibits metal-to-ligand charge-transfer state lifetimes that are very short. The guanidine-quinoline ligand used here acts on the bis(chelated) copper(I) centre, allowing only small structural changes after photoexcitation that result in very fast structural dynamics. The data were collected using a multimethod approach that featured time-resolved ultraviolet-visible, infrared and X-ray absorption and optical emission spectroscopy. Through supporting density functional calculations, we deliver a detailed picture of the structural dynamics in the picosecond-to-nanosecond time range.",2
Asymmetric transfer hydrogenation by synthetic catalysts in cancer cells.,"Catalytic anticancer metallodrugs active at low doses could minimize side-effects, introduce novel mechanisms of action that combat resistance and widen the spectrum of anticancer-drug activity. Here we use highly stable chiral half-sandwich organometallic Os(II) arene sulfonyl diamine complexes, [Os(arene)(TsDPEN)] (TsDPEN, N-(p-toluenesulfonyl)-1,2-diphenylethylenediamine), to achieve a highly enantioselective reduction of pyruvate, a key intermediate in metabolic pathways. Reduction is shown both in aqueous model systems and in human cancer cells, with non-toxic concentrations of sodium formate used as a hydride source. The catalytic mechanism generates selectivity towards ovarian cancer cells versus non-cancerous fibroblasts (both ovarian and lung), which are commonly used as models of healthy proliferating cells. The formate precursor N-formylmethionine was explored as an alternative to formate in PC3 prostate cancer cells, which are known to overexpress a deformylase enzyme. Transfer-hydrogenation catalysts that generate reductive stress in cancer cells offer a new approach to cancer therapy.",2
Evolving artificial metalloenzymes via random mutagenesis.,"Random mutagenesis has the potential to optimize the efficiency and selectivity of protein catalysts without requiring detailed knowledge of protein structure; however, introducing synthetic metal cofactors complicates the expression and screening of enzyme libraries, and activity arising from free cofactor must be eliminated. Here we report an efficient platform to create and screen libraries of artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) via random mutagenesis, which we use to evolve highly selective dirhodium cyclopropanases. Error-prone PCR and combinatorial codon mutagenesis enabled multiplexed analysis of random mutations, including at sites distal to the putative ArM active site that are difficult to identify using targeted mutagenesis approaches. Variants that exhibited significantly improved selectivity for each of the cyclopropane product enantiomers were identified, and higher activity than previously reported ArM cyclopropanases obtained via targeted mutagenesis was also observed. This improved selectivity carried over to other dirhodium-catalysed transformations, including N-H, S-H and Si-H insertion, demonstrating that ArMs evolved for one reaction can serve as starting points to evolve catalysts for others.",2
Substrate-driven chemotactic assembly in an enzyme cascade.,"Enzymatic catalysis is essential to cell survival. In many instances, enzymes that participate in reaction cascades have been shown to assemble into metabolons in response to the presence of the substrate for the first enzyme. However, what triggers metabolon formation has remained an open question. Through a combination of theory and experiments, we show that enzymes in a cascade can assemble via chemotaxis. We apply microfluidic and fluorescent spectroscopy techniques to study the coordinated movement of the first four enzymes of the glycolysis cascade: hexokinase, phosphoglucose isomerase, phosphofructokinase and aldolase. We show that each enzyme independently follows its own specific substrate gradient, which in turn is produced by the preceding enzymatic reaction. Furthermore, we find that the chemotactic assembly of enzymes occurs even under cytosolic crowding conditions.",2
Pt/Cu single-atom alloys as coke-resistant catalysts for efficient C-H activation.,"The recent availability of shale gas has led to a renewed interest in C-H bond activation as the first step towards the synthesis of fuels and fine chemicals. Heterogeneous catalysts based on Ni and Pt can perform this chemistry, but deactivate easily due to coke formation. Cu-based catalysts are not practical due to high C-H activation barriers, but their weaker binding to adsorbates offers resilience to coking. Using Pt/Cu single-atom alloys (SAAs), we examine C-H activation in a number of systems including methyl groups, methane and butane using a combination of simulations, surface science and catalysis studies. We find that Pt/Cu SAAs activate C-H bonds more efficiently than Cu, are stable for days under realistic operating conditions, and avoid the problem of coking typically encountered with Pt. Pt/Cu SAAs therefore offer a new approach to coke-resistant C-H activation chemistry, with the added economic benefit that the precious metal is diluted at the atomic limit.",2
Evaluating differences in the active-site electronics of supported Au nanoparticle catalysts using Hammett and DFT studies.,"Supported metal catalysts, which are composed of metal nanoparticles dispersed on metal oxides or other high-surface-area materials, are ubiquitous in industrially catalysed reactions. Identifying and characterizing the catalytic active sites on these materials still remains a substantial challenge, even though it is required to guide rational design of practical heterogeneous catalysts. Metal-support interactions have an enormous impact on the chemistry of the catalytic active site and can determine the optimum support for a reaction; however, few direct probes of these interactions are available. Here we show how benzyl alcohol oxidation Hammett studies can be used to characterize differences in the catalytic activity of Au nanoparticles hosted on various metal-oxide supports. We combine reactivity analysis with density functional theory calculations to demonstrate that the slope of experimental Hammett plots is affected by electron donation from the underlying oxide support to the Au particles.",2
De novo design and engineering of non-ribosomal peptide synthetases.,"Peptides derived from non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) represent an important class of pharmaceutically relevant drugs. Methods to generate novel non-ribosomal peptides or to modify peptide natural products in an easy and predictable way are therefore of great interest. However, although the overall modular structure of NRPSs suggests the possibility of adjusting domain specificity and selectivity, only a few examples have been reported and these usually show a severe drop in production titre. Here we report a new strategy for the modification of NRPSs that uses defined exchange units (XUs) and not modules as functional units. XUs are fused at specific positions that connect the condensation and adenylation domains and respect the original specificity of the downstream module to enable the production of the desired peptides. We also present the use of internal condensation domains as an alternative to other peptide-chain-releasing domains for the production of cyclic peptides.",2
Observation of correlated excitations in bimolecular collisions.,"Although collisions between atoms and molecules are largely understood, collisions between two molecules have proven much harder to study. In both experiment and theory, our ability to determine quantum-state-resolved bimolecular cross-sections lags behind their atom-molecule counterparts by decades. For many bimolecular systems, even rules of thumb-much less intuitive understanding-of scattering cross sections are lacking. Here, we report the measurement of state-to-state differential cross sections on the collision of state-selected and velocity-controlled nitric oxide (NO) radicals and oxygen (O2) molecules. Using velocity map imaging of the scattered NO radicals, the full product-pair correlations of rotational excitation that occurs in both collision partners from individual encounters are revealed. The correlated cross sections show surprisingly good agreement with quantum scattering calculations using ab initio NO-O2 potential energy surfaces. The observations show that the well-known energy-gap law that governs atom-molecule collisions does not generally apply to bimolecular excitation processes, and reveal a propensity rule for the vector correlation of product angular momenta.",2
Scattering resonances in bimolecular collisions between NO radicals and H2 challenge the theoretical gold standard.,"Over the last 25 years, the formalism known as coupled-cluster (CC) theory has emerged as the method of choice for the ab initio calculation of intermolecular interaction potentials. The implementation known as CCSD(T) is often referred to as the gold standard in quantum chemistry. It gives excellent agreement with experimental observations for a variety of energy-transfer processes in molecular collisions, and it is used to calibrate density functional theory. Here, we present measurements of low-energy collisions between NO radicals and H2 molecules with a resolution that challenges the most sophisticated quantum chemistry calculations at the CCSD(T) level. Using hitherto-unexplored anti-seeding techniques to reduce the collision energy in a crossed-beam inelastic-scattering experiment, a resonance structure near 14 cm(-1) is clearly resolved in the state-to-state integral cross-section, and a unique resonance fingerprint is observed in the corresponding differential cross-section. This resonance structure discriminates between two NO-H2 potentials calculated at the CCSD(T) level and pushes the required accuracy beyond the gold standard.",2
Structure-based inhibitors of tau aggregation.,"Aggregated tau protein is associated with over 20 neurological disorders, which include Alzheimer's disease. Previous work has shown that tau's sequence segments VQIINK and VQIVYK drive its aggregation, but inhibitors based on the structure of the VQIVYK segment only partially inhibit full-length tau aggregation and are ineffective at inhibiting seeding by full-length fibrils. Here we show that the VQIINK segment is the more powerful driver of tau aggregation. Two structures of this segment determined by the cryo-electron microscopy method micro-electron diffraction explain its dominant influence on tau aggregation. Of practical significance, the structures lead to the design of inhibitors that not only inhibit tau aggregation but also inhibit the ability of exogenous full-length tau fibrils to seed intracellular tau in HEK293 biosensor cells into amyloid. We also raise the possibility that the two VQIINK structures represent amyloid polymorphs of tau that may account for a subset of prion-like strains of tau.",2
A general approach to intermolecular carbonylation of arene C-H bonds to ketones through catalytic aroyl triflate formation.,"The development of metal-catalysed methods to functionalize inert C-H bonds has become a dominant research theme in the past decade as an approach to efficient synthesis. However, the incorporation of carbon monoxide into such reactions to form valuable ketones has to date proved a challenge, despite its potential as a straightforward and green alternative to Friedel-Crafts reactions. Here we describe a new approach to palladium-catalysed C-H bond functionalization in which carbon monoxide is used to drive the generation of high-energy electrophiles. This offers a method to couple the useful features of metal-catalysed C-H functionalization (stable and available reagents) and electrophilic acylations (broad scope and selectivity), and synthesize ketones simply from aryl iodides, CO and arenes. Notably, the reaction proceeds in an intermolecular fashion, without directing groups and at very low palladium-catalyst loadings. Mechanistic studies show that the reaction proceeds through the catalytic build-up of potent aroyl triflate electrophiles.",2
DNA-imprinted polymer nanoparticles with monodispersity and prescribed DNA-strand patterns.,"As colloidal self-assembly increasingly approaches the complexity of natural systems, an ongoing challenge is to generate non-centrosymmetric structures. For example, patchy, Janus or living crystallization particles have significantly advanced the area of polymer assembly. It has remained difficult, however, to devise polymer particles that associate in a directional manner, with controlled valency and recognition motifs. Here, we present a method to transfer DNA patterns from a DNA cage to a polymeric nanoparticle encapsulated inside the cage in three dimensions. The resulting DNA-imprinted particles (DIPs), which are 'moulded' on the inside of the DNA cage, consist of a monodisperse crosslinked polymer core with a predetermined pattern of different DNA strands covalently 'printed' on their exterior, and further assemble with programmability and directionality. The number, orientation and sequence of DNA strands grafted onto the polymeric core can be controlled during the process, and the strands are addressable independently of each other.",2
Labelling and determination of the energy in reactive intermediates in solution enabled by energy-dependent reaction selectivity.,"Any long-lived chemical structure in solution is subject to statistical energy equilibration, so the history of any specific structure does not affect its subsequent reactions. This is not true for very short-lived intermediates because energy equilibration takes time. Here, this idea is applied to achieve the 'energy labelling' of a reactive intermediate. The selectivity of the ring-opening alpha-cleavage reaction of the 1-methylcyclobutoxy radical is found here to vary broadly depending on how the radical was formed. Reactions that provide little excess energy to the intermediate lead to a high selectivity in the subsequent cleavage (measured as a kinetic isotope effect), whereas reactions that provide more excess energy to the intermediate exhibit a lower selectivity. Accounting for the expected excess energy allows the prediction of the observed product ratios and, in turn, the product ratios can be used to determine the energy present in an intermediate.",2
Oxidase catalysis via aerobically generated hypervalent iodine intermediates.,"The development of sustainable oxidation chemistry demands strategies to harness O2 as a terminal oxidant. Oxidase catalysis, in which O2 serves as a chemical oxidant without necessitating incorporation of oxygen into reaction products, would allow diverse substrate functionalization chemistry to be coupled to O2 reduction. Direct O2 utilization suffers from intrinsic challenges imposed by the triplet ground state of O2 and the disparate electron inventories of four-electron O2 reduction and two-electron substrate oxidation. Here, we generate hypervalent iodine reagents-a broadly useful class of selective two-electron oxidants-from O2. This is achieved by intercepting reactive intermediates of aldehyde autoxidation to aerobically generate hypervalent iodine reagents for a broad array of substrate oxidation reactions. The use of aryl iodides as mediators of aerobic oxidation underpins an oxidase catalysis platform that couples substrate oxidation directly to O2 reduction. We anticipate that aerobically generated hypervalent iodine reagents will expand the scope of aerobic oxidation chemistry in chemical synthesis.",2
Theory-driven design of high-valence metal sites for water oxidation confirmed using in situ soft X-ray absorption.,"The efficiency with which renewable fuels and feedstocks are synthesized from electrical sources is limited at present by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in pH-neutral media. We took the view that generating transition-metal sites with high valence at low applied bias should improve the activity of neutral OER catalysts. Here, using density functional theory, we find that the formation energy of desired Ni(4+) sites is systematically modulated by incorporating judicious combinations of Co, Fe and non-metal P. We therefore synthesized NiCoFeP oxyhydroxides and probed their oxidation kinetics with in situ soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS). In situ sXAS studies of neutral-pH OER catalysts indicate ready promotion of Ni(4+) under low overpotential conditions. The NiCoFeP catalyst outperforms IrO2 and retains its performance following 100 h of operation. We showcase NiCoFeP in a membrane-free CO2 electroreduction system that achieves a 1.99 V cell voltage at 10 mA cm(-2), reducing CO2 into CO and oxidizing H2O to O2 with a 64% electricity-to-chemical-fuel efficiency.",2
Coherent wavepackets in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex are robust to excitonic-structure perturbations caused by mutagenesis.,"Femtosecond pulsed excitation of light-harvesting complexes creates oscillatory features in their response. This phenomenon has inspired a large body of work aimed at uncovering the origin of the coherent beatings and possible implications for function. Here we exploit site-directed mutagenesis to change the excitonic level structure in Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complexes and compare the coherences using broadband pump-probe spectroscopy. Our experiments detect two oscillation frequencies with dephasing on a picosecond timescale-both at 77 K and at room temperature. By studying these coherences with selective excitation pump-probe experiments, where pump excitation is in resonance only with the lowest excitonic state, we show that the key contributions to these oscillations stem from ground-state vibrational wavepackets. These experiments explicitly show that the coherences-although in the ground electronic state-can be probed at the absorption resonances of other bacteriochlorophyll molecules because of delocalization of the electronic excitation over several chromophores.",2
Artificial muscle-like function from hierarchical supramolecular assembly of photoresponsive molecular motors.,"A striking feature of living systems is their ability to produce motility by amplification of collective molecular motion from the nanoscale up to macroscopic dimensions. Some of nature's protein motors, such as myosin in muscle tissue, consist of a hierarchical supramolecular assembly of very large proteins, in which mechanical stress induces a coordinated movement. However, artificial molecular muscles have often relied on covalent polymer-based actuators. Here, we describe the macroscopic contractile muscle-like motion of a supramolecular system (comprising 95% water) formed by the hierarchical self-assembly of a photoresponsive amphiphilic molecular motor. The molecular motor first assembles into nanofibres, which further assemble into aligned bundles that make up centimetre-long strings. Irradiation induces rotary motion of the molecular motors, and propagation and accumulation of this motion lead to contraction of the fibres towards the light source. This system supports large-amplitude motion, fast response, precise control over shape, as well as weight-lifting experiments in water and air.",2
Decarboxylative alkylation for site-selective bioconjugation of native proteins via oxidation potentials.,"The advent of antibody-drug conjugates as pharmaceuticals has fuelled a need for reliable methods of site-selective protein modification that furnish homogeneous adducts. Although bioorthogonal methods that use engineered amino acids often provide an elegant solution to the question of selective functionalization, achieving homogeneity using native amino acids remains a challenge. Here, we explore visible-light-mediated single-electron transfer as a mechanism towards enabling site- and chemoselective bioconjugation. Specifically, we demonstrate the use of photoredox catalysis as a platform to selectivity wherein the discrepancy in oxidation potentials between internal versus C-terminal carboxylates can be exploited towards obtaining C-terminal functionalization exclusively. This oxidation potential-gated technology is amenable to endogenous peptides and has been successfully demonstrated on the protein insulin. As a fundamentally new approach to bioconjugation this methodology provides a blueprint toward the development of photoredox catalysis as a generic platform to target other redox-active side chains for native conjugation.",2
Programmable autonomous synthesis of single-stranded DNA.,"DNA performs diverse functional roles in biology, nanotechnology and biotechnology, but current methods for autonomously synthesizing arbitrary single-stranded DNA are limited. Here, we introduce the concept of primer exchange reaction (PER) cascades, which grow nascent single-stranded DNA with user-specified sequences following prescribed reaction pathways. PER synthesis happens in a programmable, autonomous, in situ and environmentally responsive fashion, providing a platform for engineering molecular circuits and devices with a wide range of sensing, monitoring, recording, signal-processing and actuation capabilities. We experimentally demonstrate a nanodevice that transduces the detection of a trigger RNA into the production of a DNAzyme that degrades an independent RNA substrate, a signal amplifier that conditionally synthesizes long fluorescent strands only in the presence of a particular RNA signal, molecular computing circuits that evaluate logic (AND, OR, NOT) combinations of RNA inputs, and a temporal molecular event recorder that records in the PER transcript the order in which distinct RNA inputs are sequentially detected.",2
Acceleration of a ground-state reaction by selective femtosecond-infrared-laser-pulse excitation.,"Infrared (IR) excitation of vibrations that participate in the reaction coordinate of an otherwise thermally driven chemical reaction are believed to lead to its acceleration. Attempts at the practical realization of this concept have been hampered so far by competing processes leading to sample heating. Here we demonstrate, using femtosecond IR-pump IR-probe experiments, the acceleration of urethane and polyurethane formation due to vibrational excitation of the reactants for 1:1 mixtures of phenylisocyanate and cyclohexanol, and toluene-2,4-diisocyanate and 2,2,2-trichloroethane-1,1-diol, respectively. We measured reaction rate changes upon selective vibrational excitation with negligible heating of the sample and observed an increase of the reaction rate up to 24%. The observation is rationalized using reactant and transition-state structures obtained from quantum chemical calculations. We subsequently used IR-driven reaction acceleration to write a polyurethane square on sample windows using a femtosecond IR pulse.",2
A dual role for a polyketide synthase in dynemicin enediyne and anthraquinone biosynthesis.,"Dynemicin A is a member of a subfamily of enediyne antitumour antibiotics characterized by a 10-membered carbocycle fused to an anthraquinone, both of polyketide origin. Sequencing of the dynemicin biosynthetic gene cluster in Micromonospora chersina previously identified an enediyne polyketide synthase (PKS), but no anthraquinone PKS, suggesting gene(s) for biosynthesis of the latter were distant from the core dynemicin cluster. To identify these gene(s), we sequenced and analysed the genome of M. chersina. Sequencing produced a short list of putative PKS candidates, yet CRISPR-Cas9 mutants of each locus retained dynemicin production. Subsequently, deletion of two cytochromes P450 in the dynemicin cluster suggested that the dynemicin enediyne PKS, DynE8, may biosynthesize the anthraquinone. Together with (18)O-labelling studies, we now present evidence that DynE8 produces the core scaffolds of both the enediyne and anthraquinone, and provide a working model to account for their formation from the programmed octaketide of the enediyne PKS.",2

Biocatalytic site- and enantioselective oxidative dearomatization of phenols.,"The biocatalytic transformations used by chemists are often restricted to simple functional-group interconversions. In contrast, nature has developed complexity-generating biocatalytic reactions within natural product pathways. These sophisticated catalysts are rarely employed by chemists, because the substrate scope, selectivity and robustness of these catalysts are unknown. Our strategy to bridge the gap between the biosynthesis and synthetic chemistry communities leverages the diversity of catalysts available within natural product pathways. Here we show that, starting from a suite of biosynthetic enzymes, catalysts with complementary substrate scope as well as selectivity can be identified. This strategy has been applied to the oxidative dearomatization of phenols, a chemical transformation that rapidly builds molecular complexity from simple starting materials and cannot be accomplished with high selectivity using existing catalytic methods. Using enzymes from biosynthetic pathways, we have successfully developed a method to produce ortho-quinol products with controlled site- and stereoselectivity. Furthermore, we have capitalized on the scalability and robustness of this method in gram-scale reactions as well as multi-enzyme and chemoenzymatic cascades.",2
Thermally activated delayed photoluminescence from pyrenyl-functionalized CdSe quantum dots.,"The generation and transfer of triplet excitons across semiconductor nanomaterial-molecular interfaces will play an important role in emerging photonic and optoelectronic technologies, and understanding the rules that govern such phenomena is essential. The ability to cooperatively merge the photophysical properties of semiconductor quantum dots with those of well-understood and inexpensive molecular chromophores is therefore paramount. Here we show that 1-pyrenecarboxylic acid-functionalized CdSe quantum dots undergo thermally activated delayed photoluminescence. This phenomenon results from a near quantitative triplet-triplet energy transfer from the nanocrystals to 1-pyrenecarboxylic acid, producing a molecular triplet-state 'reservoir' that thermally repopulates the photoluminescent state of CdSe through endothermic reverse triplet-triplet energy transfer. The photoluminescence properties are systematically and predictably tuned through variation of the quantum dot-molecule energy gap, temperature and the triplet-excited-state lifetime of the molecular adsorbate. The concepts developed are likely to be applicable to semiconductor nanocrystals interfaced with molecular chromophores, enabling potential applications of their combined excited states.",2
"Phosphorylation, oligomerization and self-assembly in water under potential prebiotic conditions.","Prebiotic phosphorylation of (pre)biological substrates under aqueous conditions is a critical step in the origins of life. Previous investigations have had limited success and/or require unique environments that are incompatible with subsequent generation of the corresponding oligomers or higher-order structures. Here, we demonstrate that diamidophosphate (DAP)-a plausible prebiotic agent produced from trimetaphosphate-efficiently (amido)phosphorylates a wide variety of (pre)biological building blocks (nucleosides/tides, amino acids and lipid precursors) under aqueous (solution/paste) conditions, without the need for a condensing agent. Significantly, higher-order structures (oligonucleotides, peptides and liposomes) are formed under the same phosphorylation reaction conditions. This plausible prebiotic phosphorylation process under similar reaction conditions could enable the systems chemistry of the three classes of (pre)biologically relevant molecules and their oligomers, in a single-pot aqueous environment.",2
Direct alpha-C-H bond functionalization of unprotected cyclic amines.,"Cyclic amines are ubiquitous core structures of bioactive natural products and pharmaceutical drugs. Although the site-selective abstraction of C-H bonds is an attractive strategy for preparing valuable functionalized amines from their readily available parent heterocycles, this approach has largely been limited to substrates that require protection of the amine nitrogen atom. In addition, most methods rely on transition metals and are incompatible with the presence of amine N-H bonds. Here we introduce a protecting-group-free approach for the alpha-functionalization of cyclic secondary amines. An operationally simple one-pot procedure generates products via a process that involves intermolecular hydride transfer to generate an imine intermediate that is subsequently captured by a nucleophile, such as an alkyl or aryl lithium compound. Reactions are regioselective and stereospecific and enable the rapid preparation of bioactive amines, as exemplified by the facile synthesis of anabasine and (-)-solenopsin A.",2
An integrated native mass spectrometry and top-down proteomics method that connects sequence to structure and function of macromolecular complexes.,"Mass spectrometry (MS) has become a crucial technique for the analysis of protein complexes. Native MS has traditionally examined protein subunit arrangements, while proteomics MS has focused on sequence identification. These two techniques are usually performed separately without taking advantage of the synergies between them. Here we describe the development of an integrated native MS and top-down proteomics method using Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) to analyse macromolecular protein complexes in a single experiment. We address previous concerns of employing FTICR MS to measure large macromolecular complexes by demonstrating the detection of complexes up to 1.8 MDa, and we demonstrate the efficacy of this technique for direct acquirement of sequence to higher-order structural information with several large complexes. We then summarize the unique functionalities of different activation/dissociation techniques. The platform expands the ability of MS to integrate proteomics and structural biology to provide insights into protein structure, function and regulation.",2

Iridium-catalysed arylation of C-H bonds enabled by oxidatively induced reductive elimination.,"Direct arylation of C-H bonds is in principle a powerful way of preparing value-added molecules that contain carbon-aryl fragments. Unfortunately, currently available synthetic methods are not sufficiently effective to be practical alternatives to conventional cross-coupling reactions. We propose that the main problem lies in the late portion of the catalytic cycle where reductive elimination gives the desired carbon-aryl bond. Accordingly, we have developed a strategy where the Ir(III) centre of the key intermediate is first oxidized to Ir(IV). Density functional theory calculations indicate that the barrier to reductive elimination is reduced by nearly 19 kcal mol(-1) for this oxidized complex compared with that of its Ir(III) counterpart. Various experiments confirm this prediction, affording a new methodology capable of directly arylating C-H bonds at room temperature with a broad substrate scope and in good yields. This work highlights how the oxidation states of intermediates can be targeted deliberately to catalyse an otherwise impossible reaction.",2
Bioinspired chemical synthesis of monomeric and dimeric stephacidin A congeners.,"Stephacidin A and its congeners are a collection of secondary metabolites that possess intriguing structural motifs. They stem from unusual biosynthetic sequences that lead to the incorporation of a prenyl or reverse-prenyl group into a bicyclo[2.2.2]diazaoctane framework, a chromene unit or the vestige thereof. To complement biosynthetic studies, which normally play a significant role in unveiling the biosynthetic pathways of natural products, here we demonstrate that chemical synthesis can provide important insights into biosynthesis. We identify a short total synthesis of congeners in the reverse-prenylated indole alkaloid family related to stephacidin A by taking advantage of a direct indole C6 halogenation of the related ketopremalbrancheamide. This novel strategic approach has now made possible the syntheses of several natural products, including malbrancheamides B and C, notoamides F, I and R, aspergamide B, and waikialoid A, which is a heterodimer of avrainvillamide and aspergamide B. Our approach to the preparation of these prenylated and reverse-prenylated indole alkaloids is bioinspired, and may also inform the as-yet undetermined biosynthesis of several congeners.",2
Collaborative routes to clarifying the murky waters of aqueous supramolecular chemistry.,"On planet Earth, water is everywhere: the majority of the surface is covered with it; it is a key component of all life; its vapour and droplets fill the lower atmosphere; and even rocks contain it and undergo geomorphological changes because of it. A community of physical scientists largely drives studies of the chemistry of water and aqueous solutions, with expertise in biochemistry, spectroscopy and computer modelling. More recently, however, supramolecular chemists - with their expertise in macrocyclic synthesis and measuring supramolecular interactions - have renewed their interest in water-mediated non-covalent interactions. These two groups offer complementary expertise that, if harnessed, offer to accelerate our understanding of aqueous supramolecular chemistry and water writ large. This Review summarizes the state-of-the-art of the two fields, and highlights where there is latent chemical space for collaborative exploration by the two groups.",2

Atomic resolution of structural changes in elastic crystals of copper(II) acetylacetonate.,"Single crystals are typically brittle, inelastic materials. Such mechanical responses limit their use in practical applications, particularly in flexible electronics and optical devices. Here we describe single crystals of a well-known coordination compound-copper(II) acetylacetonate-that are flexible enough to be reversibly tied into a knot. Mechanical measurements indicate that the crystals exhibit an elasticity similar to that of soft materials such as nylon, and thus display properties normally associated with both hard and soft matter. Using microfocused synchrotron radiation, we mapped the changes in crystal structure that occur on bending, and determined the mechanism that allows this flexibility with atomic precision. We show that, under strain, the molecules in the crystal reversibly rotate, and thus reorganize to allow the mechanical compression and expansion required for elasticity and still maintain the integrity of the crystal structure.",2
Chromophore twisting in the excited state of a photoswitchable fluorescent protein captured by time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography.,"Chromophores absorb light in photosensitive proteins and thereby initiate fundamental biological processes such as photosynthesis, vision and biofluorescence. An important goal in their understanding is the provision of detailed structural descriptions of the ultrafast photochemical events that they undergo, in particular of the excited states that connect chemistry to biological function. Here we report on the structures of two excited states in the reversibly photoswitchable fluorescent protein rsEGFP2. We populated the states through femtosecond illumination of rsEGFP2 in its non-fluorescent off state and observed their build-up (within less than one picosecond) and decay (on the several picosecond timescale). Using an X-ray free-electron laser, we performed picosecond time-resolved crystallography and show that the hydroxybenzylidene imidazolinone chromophore in one of the excited states assumes a near-canonical twisted configuration halfway between the trans and cis isomers. This is in line with excited-state quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics and classical molecular dynamics simulations. Our new understanding of the structure around the twisted chromophore enabled the design of a mutant that displays a twofold increase in its off-to-on photoswitching quantum yield.",2
Direct observation of sequential oxidations of a titania-bound molecular proxy catalyst generated through illumination of molecular sensitizers.,"Natural photosynthesis uses the energy in sunlight to oxidize or reduce reaction centres multiple times, therefore preparing each reaction centre for a multiple-electron-transfer reaction that will ultimately generate stable reaction products. This process relies on multiple chromophores per reaction centre to quickly generate the active state of the reaction centre and to outcompete deleterious charge recombination. Using a similar design principle, we report spectroscopic evidence for the generation of a twice-oxidized TiO2-bound molecular proxy catalyst after low-intensity visible-light excitation of co-anchored molecular Ru(II)-polypyridyl dyes. Electron transfer from an excited dye to TiO2 generated a Ru(III) state that subsequently and repeatedly reacted with neighbouring Ru(II) dyes via self-exchange electron transfer to ultimately oxidize a distant co-anchored proxy catalyst before charge recombination. The largest yield for twice-oxidized proxy catalysts occurred when they were present at low coverage, suggesting that large dye/electrocatalyst ratios are also desired in dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells.",2
Dynamic covalent chemistry enables formation of antimicrobial peptide quaternary assemblies in a completely abiotic manner.,"Naturally occurring peptides and proteins often use dynamic disulfide bonds to impart defined tertiary/quaternary structures for the formation of binding pockets with uniform size and function. Although peptide synthesis and modification are well established, controlling quaternary structure formation remains a significant challenge. Here, we report the facile incorporation of aryl aldehyde and acyl hydrazide functionalities into peptide oligomers via solid-phase copper-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SP-CuAAC) click reactions. When mixed, these complementary functional groups rapidly react in aqueous media at neutral pH to form peptide-peptide intermolecular macrocycles with highly tunable ring sizes. Moreover, sequence-specific figure-of-eight, dumbbell-shaped, zipper-like and multi-loop quaternary structures were formed selectively. Controlling the proportions of reacting peptides with mismatched numbers of complementary reactive groups results in the formation of higher-molecular-weight sequence-defined ladder polymers. This also amplified antimicrobial effectiveness in select cases. This strategy represents a general approach to the creation of complex abiotic peptide quaternary structures.",2
Designing cooperatively folded abiotic uni- and multimolecular helix bundles.,"Abiotic foldamers, that is foldamers that have backbones chemically remote from peptidic and nucleotidic skeletons, may give access to shapes and functions different to those of peptides and nucleotides. However, design methodologies towards abiotic tertiary and quaternary structures are yet to be developed. Here we report rationally designed interactional patterns to guide the folding and assembly of abiotic helix bundles. Computational design facilitated the introduction of hydrogen-bonding functionalities at defined locations on the aromatic amide backbones that promote cooperative folding into helix-turn-helix motifs in organic solvents. The hydrogen-bond-directed aggregation of helices not linked by a turn unit produced several thermodynamically and kinetically stable homochiral dimeric and trimeric bundles with structures that are distinct from the designed helix-turn-helix. Relative helix orientation within the bundles may be changed from parallel to tilted on subtle solvent variations. Altogether, these results prefigure the richness and uniqueness of abiotic tertiary structure behaviour.",2
Mechanism-based enhancement of scope and enantioselectivity for reactions involving a copper-substituted stereogenic carbon centre.,"A rapidly emerging set of catalytic reactions involves intermediates that contain a copper-substituted stereogenic carbon centre. Here, we demonstrate that an intimate understanding of this distinction provides ways for addressing limitations in reaction scope and explaining why unexpected variations in enantioselectivity often occur. By using catalytic enantioselective Cu-boryl addition to alkenes as the model process, we elucidate several key mechanistic principles. We show that higher electrophile concentration can lead to elevated enantioselectivity. This is because diastereoselective Cu-H elimination may be avoided and/or achiral Cu-boryl intermediates can be converted to allyl-B(pin) rather than add to an alkene. We illustrate that lower alkene amounts and/or higher chiral ligand concentration can minimize the deleterious influence of achiral Cu-alkyl species, resulting in improved enantiomeric ratios. Moreover, and surprisingly, we find that enantioselectivities are higher with the less reactive allylphenyl carbonates as chemoselective copper-hydride elimination is faster with an achiral Cu-alkyl species.",2
Organocatalytic asymmetric arylation of indoles enabled by azo groups.,"Arylation is a fundamental reaction that can be mostly fulfilled by electrophilic aromatic substitution and transition-metal-catalysed aryl functionalization. Although the azo group has been used as a directing group for many transformations via transition-metal-catalysed aryl carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond activation, there remain significant unmet challenges in organocatalytic arylation. Here, we show that the azo group can effectively act as both a directing and activating group for organocatalytic asymmetric arylation of indoles via formal nucleophilic aromatic substitution of azobenzene derivatives. Thus, a wide range of axially chiral arylindoles have been achieved in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities by utilizing chiral phosphoric acid as catalyst. Furthermore, highly enantioenriched pyrroloindoles bearing two contiguous quaternary chiral centres have also been obtained via a cascade enantioselective formal nucleophilic aromatic substitution-cyclization process. This strategy should be useful in other related research fields and will open new avenues for organocatalytic asymmetric aryl functionalization.",2
Synthetic nat- or ent-steroids in as few as five chemical steps from epichlorohydrin.,"Today, more than 100 Food and Drug Administration-approved steroidal agents are prescribed daily for indications including heart failure, inflammation, pain and cancer. While triumphs in organic chemistry have enabled the establishment and sustained growth of the steroid pharmaceutical industry, the production of highly functionalized synthetic steroids of varying substitution and stereochemistry remains challenging, despite the numerous reports of elegant strategies for their de novo synthesis. Here, we describe an advance in chemical synthesis that has established an enantiospecific means to access novel steroids with unprecedented facility and flexibility through the sequential use of two powerful ring-forming reactions: a modern metallacycle-mediated annulative cross-coupling and a new acid-catalysed vinylcyclopropane rearrangement cascade. In addition to accessing synthetic steroids of either enantiomeric series, these steroidal products have been selectively functionalized within each of the four carbocyclic rings, a synthetic ent-steroid has been prepared on a multigram scale, the enantiomer of a selective oestrogen has been synthesized, and a novel ent-steroid with growth inhibitory properties in three cancer cell lines has been discovered.",2

Late-stage chemoselective functional-group manipulation of bioactive natural products with super-electrophilic silylium ions.,"The selective (and controllable) modification of complex molecules with disparate functional groups (for example, natural products) is a long-standing challenge that has been addressed using catalysts tuned to perform singular transformations (for example, C-H hydroxylation). A method whereby reactions with diverse functional groups within a single natural product are feasible depending on which catalyst or reagent is chosen would widen the possible structures one could obtain. Fluoroarylborane catalysts can heterolytically split Si-H bonds to yield an oxophilic silylium (R3Si(+)) equivalent along with a reducing (H(-)) equivalent. Together, these reactive intermediates enable the reduction of multiple functional groups. Exogenous phosphine Lewis bases further modify the catalyst speciation and attenuate aggressive silylium ions for the selective modification of complex natural products. Manipulation of the catalyst, silane reagent and the reaction conditions provides experimental control over which site is modified (and how). Applying this catalytic method to complex bioactive compounds (natural products or drugs) provides a powerful tool for studying structure-activity relationships.",2
Predicting DNA hybridization kinetics from sequence.,"Hybridization is a key molecular process in biology and biotechnology, but so far there is no predictive model for accurately determining hybridization rate constants based on sequence information. Here, we report a weighted neighbour voting (WNV) prediction algorithm, in which the hybridization rate constant of an unknown sequence is predicted based on similarity reactions with known rate constants. To construct this algorithm we first performed 210 fluorescence kinetics experiments to observe the hybridization kinetics of 100 different DNA target and probe pairs (36 nt sub-sequences of the CYCS and VEGF genes) at temperatures ranging from 28 to 55 degrees C. Automated feature selection and weighting optimization resulted in a final six-feature WNV model, which can predict hybridization rate constants of new sequences to within a factor of 3 with approximately 91% accuracy, based on leave-one-out cross-validation. Accurate prediction of hybridization kinetics allows the design of efficient probe sequences for genomics research.",2
Self-assembly of polyhedral metal-organic framework particles into three-dimensional ordered superstructures.,"Self-assembly of particles into long-range, three-dimensional, ordered superstructures is crucial for the design of a variety of materials, including plasmonic sensing materials, energy or gas storage systems, catalysts and photonic crystals. Here, we have combined experimental and simulation data to show that truncated rhombic dodecahedral particles of the metal-organic framework (MOF) ZIF-8 can self-assemble into millimetre-sized superstructures with an underlying three-dimensional rhombohedral lattice that behave as photonic crystals. Those superstructures feature a photonic bandgap that can be tuned by controlling the size of the ZIF-8 particles and is also responsive to the adsorption of guest substances in the micropores of the ZIF-8 particles. In addition, superstructures with different lattices can also be assembled by tuning the truncation of ZIF-8 particles, or by using octahedral UiO-66 MOF particles instead. These well-ordered, sub-micrometre-sized superstructures might ultimately facilitate the design of three-dimensional photonic materials for applications in sensing.",2
Polyoxometalate electrocatalysts based on earth-abundant metals for efficient water oxidation in acidic media.,"Water splitting is a promising approach to the efficient and cost-effective production of renewable fuels, but water oxidation remains a bottleneck in its technological development because it largely relies on noble-metal catalysts. Although inexpensive transition-metal oxides are competitive water oxidation catalysts in alkaline media, they cannot compete with noble metals in acidic media, in which hydrogen production is easier and faster. Here, we report a water oxidation catalyst based on earth-abundant metals that performs well in acidic conditions. Specifically, we report the enhanced catalytic activity of insoluble salts of polyoxometalates with caesium or barium counter-cations for oxygen evolution. In particular, the barium salt of a cobalt-phosphotungstate polyanion outperforms the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst even at pH < 1, with an overpotential of 189 mV at 1 mA cm(-2). In addition, we find that a carbon-paste conducting support with a hydrocarbon binder can improve the stability of metal-oxide catalysts in acidic media by providing a hydrophobic environment.",2
Enantioselective cyclizations and cyclization cascades of samarium ketyl radicals.,"The rapid generation of molecular complexity from simple starting materials is a key challenge in synthesis. Enantioselective radical cyclization cascades have the potential to deliver complex, densely packed, polycyclic architectures, with control of three-dimensional shape, in one step. Unfortunately, carrying out reactions with radicals in an enantiocontrolled fashion remains challenging due to their high reactivity. This is particularly the case for reactions of radicals generated using the classical reagent, SmI2. Here, we demonstrate that enantioselective SmI2-mediated radical cyclizations and cascades that exploit a simple, recyclable chiral ligand can convert symmetrical ketoesters to complex carbocyclic products bearing multiple stereocentres with high enantio- and diastereocontrol. A computational study has been used to probe the origin of the enantioselectivity. Our studies suggest that many processes that rely on SmI2 can be rendered enantioselective by the design of suitable ligands.",2
De novo design of a hyperstable non-natural protein-ligand complex with sub-A accuracy.,"Protein catalysis requires the atomic-level orchestration of side chains, substrates and cofactors, and yet the ability to design a small-molecule-binding protein entirely from first principles with a precisely predetermined structure has not been demonstrated. Here we report the design of a novel protein, PS1, that binds a highly electron-deficient non-natural porphyrin at temperatures up to 100 degrees C. The high-resolution structure of holo-PS1 is in sub-A agreement with the design. The structure of apo-PS1 retains the remote core packing of the holoprotein, with a flexible binding region that is predisposed to ligand binding with the desired geometry. Our results illustrate the unification of core packing and binding-site definition as a central principle of ligand-binding protein design.",2
A unifying paradigm for naphthoquinone-based meroterpenoid (bio)synthesis.,"Bacterial meroterpenoids constitute an important class of natural products with diverse biological properties and therapeutic potential. The biosynthetic logic for their production is unknown and defies explanation via classical biochemical paradigms. A large subgroup of naphthoquinone-based meroterpenoids exhibits a substitution pattern of the polyketide-derived aromatic core that seemingly contradicts the established reactivity pattern of polyketide phenol nucleophiles and terpene diphosphate electrophiles. We report the discovery of a hitherto unprecedented enzyme-promoted alpha-hydroxyketone rearrangement catalysed by vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases to account for these discrepancies in the merochlorin and napyradiomycin class of meroterpenoid antibiotics, and we demonstrate that the alpha-hydroxyketone rearrangement is potentially a conserved biosynthetic reaction in this molecular class. The biosynthetic alpha-hydroxyketone rearrangement was applied in a concise total synthesis of naphthomevalin, a prominent member of the napyradiomycin meroterpenes, and sheds further light on the mechanism of this unifying enzymatic transformation.",2
Vibronically coherent ultrafast triplet-pair formation and subsequent thermally activated dissociation control efficient endothermic singlet fission.,"Singlet exciton fission (SF), the conversion of one spin-singlet exciton (S1) into two spin-triplet excitons (T1), could provide a means to overcome the Shockley-Queisser limit in photovoltaics. SF as measured by the decay of S1 has been shown to occur efficiently and independently of temperature, even when the energy of S1 is as much as 200 meV less than that of 2T1. Here we study films of triisopropylsilyltetracene using transient optical spectroscopy and show that the triplet pair state (TT), which has been proposed to mediate singlet fission, forms on ultrafast timescales (in 300 fs) and that its formation is mediated by the strong coupling of electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom. This is followed by a slower loss of singlet character as the excitation evolves to become only TT. We observe the TT to be thermally dissociated on 10-100 ns timescales to form free triplets. This provides a model for 'temperature-independent' efficient TT formation and thermally activated TT separation.",2
"Site-selective oxidation, amination and epimerization reactions of complex polyols enabled by transfer hydrogenation.","Polyoxygenated hydrocarbons that bear one or more hydroxyl groups comprise a large set of natural and synthetic compounds, often with potent biological activity. In synthetic chemistry, alcohols are important precursors to carbonyl groups, which then can be converted into a wide range of oxygen- or nitrogen-based functionality. Therefore, the selective conversion of a single hydroxyl group in natural products into a ketone would enable the selective introduction of unnatural functionality. However, the methods known to convert a simple alcohol, or even an alcohol in a molecule that contains multiple protected functional groups, are not suitable for selective reactions of complex polyol structures. We present a new ruthenium catalyst with a unique efficacy for the selective oxidation of a single hydroxyl group among many in unprotected polyol natural products. This oxidation enables the introduction of nitrogen-based functional groups into such structures that lack nitrogen atoms and enables a selective alcohol epimerization by stepwise or reversible oxidation and reduction.",2
Structure and reactivity of a mononuclear gold(II) complex.,"Mononuclear gold(II) complexes are very rare labile species. Transient gold(II) species have been suggested in homogeneous catalysis and in medical applications, but their geometric and electronic structures have remained essentially unexplored: even fundamental data, such as the ionic radius of gold(II), are unknown. Now, an unprecedentedly stable neutral gold(II) complex of a porphyrin derivative has been isolated, and its structural and spectroscopic features determined. The gold atom adopts a 2+2 coordination mode in between those of gold(III) (four-coordinate square planar) and gold(I) (two-coordinate linear), owing to a second-order Jahn-Teller distortion enabled by the relativistically lowered 6s orbital of gold. The reactivity of this gold(II) complex towards dioxygen, nitrosobenzene and acids is discussed. This study provides insight on the ionic radius of gold(II), and allows it to be placed within the homologous series of nd(9) Cu/Ag/Au divalent ions and the 5d(8/9/10) Pt/Au/Hg 'relativistic' triad in the periodic table.",2
Single-crystal-to-single-crystal intercalation of a low-bandgap superatomic crystal.,"The controlled introduction of impurities into the crystal lattice of solid-state compounds is a cornerstone of materials science. Intercalation, the insertion of guest atoms, ions or molecules between the atomic layers of a host structure, can produce novel electronic, magnetic and optical properties in many materials. Here we describe an intercalation compound in which the host [Co6Te8(P(n)Pr3)6][C60]3, formed from the binary assembly of atomically precise molecular clusters, is a superatomic analogue of traditional layered atomic compounds. We find that tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) can be inserted into the superstructure through a single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation. Using electronic absorption spectroscopy, electrical transport measurements and electronic structure calculations, we demonstrate that the intercalation is driven by the exchange of charge between the host [Co6Te8(P(n)Pr3)6][C60]3 and the intercalant TCNE. These results show that intercalation is a powerful approach to manipulate the material properties of superatomic crystals.",2
Modular probes for enriching and detecting complex nucleic acid sequences.,"Complex DNA sequences are difficult to detect and profile, but are important contributors to human health and disease. Existing hybridization probes lack the capability to selectively bind and enrich hypervariable, long or repetitive sequences. Here, we present a generalized strategy for constructing modular hybridization probes (M-Probes) that overcomes these challenges. We demonstrate that M-Probes can tolerate sequence variations of up to 7 nt at prescribed positions while maintaining single nucleotide sensitivity at other positions. M-Probes are also shown to be capable of sequence-selectively binding a continuous DNA sequence of more than 500 nt. Furthermore, we show that M-Probes can detect genes with triplet repeats exceeding a programmed threshold. As a demonstration of this technology, we have developed a hybrid capture method to determine the exact triplet repeat expansion number in the Huntington's gene of genomic DNA using quantitative PCR.",2

Infrared spectrum and structure of the homochiral serine octamer-dichloride complex.,"The amino acid serine is known to form a very stable octamer that has properties that set it apart from serine complexes of different sizes or from complexes composed of other amino acids. For example, both singly protonated serine octamers and anionic octamers complexed with two halogen ions strongly prefer homochirality, even when assembled from racemic D,L mixtures. Consequently, the structures of these complexes are of great interest, but no acceptable candidates have so far been identified. Here, we investigate anionic serine octamers coordinated with two chloride ions using a novel technique coupling ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry with infrared spectroscopy, in combination with theoretical calculations. The results allow the identification of a unique structure for (Ser8Cl2)(2-) that is highly symmetric, very stable and homochiral and whose calculated properties match those observed in experiments.",2
Catalyst-controlled oligomerization for the collective synthesis of polypyrroloindoline natural products.,"In nature, many organisms generate large families of natural product metabolites that have related molecular structures as a means to increase functional diversity and gain an evolutionary advantage against competing systems within the same environment. One pathway commonly employed by living systems to generate these large classes of structurally related families is oligomerization, wherein a series of enzymatically catalysed reactions is employed to generate secondary metabolites by iteratively appending monomers to a growing serial oligomer chain. The polypyrroloindolines are an interesting class of oligomeric natural products that consist of multiple cyclotryptamine subunits. Herein we describe an iterative application of asymmetric copper catalysis towards the synthesis of six distinct oligomeric polypyrroloindoline natural products: hodgkinsine, hodgkinsine B, idiospermuline, quadrigemine H and isopsychotridine B and C. Given the customizable nature of the small-molecule catalysts employed, we demonstrate that this strategy is further amenable to the construction of quadrigemine H-type alkaloids not isolated previously from natural sources.",2
Global profiling of lysine reactivity and ligandability in the human proteome.,"Nucleophilic amino acids make important contributions to protein function, including performing key roles in catalysis and serving as sites for post-translational modification. Electrophilic groups that target amino-acid nucleophiles have been used to create covalent ligands and drugs, but have, so far, been mainly limited to cysteine and serine. Here, we report a chemical proteomic platform for the global and quantitative analysis of lysine residues in native biological systems. We have quantified, in total, more than 9,000 lysines in human cell proteomes and have identified several hundred residues with heightened reactivity that are enriched at protein functional sites and can frequently be targeted by electrophilic small molecules. We have also discovered lysine-reactive fragment electrophiles that inhibit enzymes by active site and allosteric mechanisms, as well as disrupt protein-protein interactions in transcriptional regulatory complexes, emphasizing the broad potential and diverse functional consequences of liganding lysine residues throughout the human proteome.",2
Bicyclic Baird-type aromaticity.,"Classic formulations of aromaticity have long been associated with topologically planar conjugated macrocyclic systems. The theoretical possibility of so-called bicycloaromaticity was noted early on. However, it has yet to be demonstrated by experiment in a simple synthetic organic molecule. Conjugated organic systems are attractive for studying the effect of structure on electronic features. This is because, in principle, they can be modified readily through dedicated synthesis. As such, they can provide useful frameworks for testing by experiment with fundamental insights provided by theory. Here we detail the synthesis and characterization of two purely organic non-planar dithienothiophene-bridged [34]octaphyrins that permit access to two different aromatic forms as a function of the oxidation state. In their neutral forms, these congeneric systems contain competing 26 and 34 pi-electronic circuits. When subject to two-electron oxidation, electronically mixed [4n+1]/[4n+1] triplet biradical species in the ground state are obtained that display global aromaticity in accord with Baird's rule.",2
UV-light-driven prebiotic synthesis of iron-sulfur clusters.,"Iron-sulfur clusters are ancient cofactors that play a fundamental role in metabolism and may have impacted the prebiotic chemistry that led to life. However, it is unclear whether iron-sulfur clusters could have been synthesized on prebiotic Earth. Dissolved iron on early Earth was predominantly in the reduced ferrous state, but ferrous ions alone cannot form polynuclear iron-sulfur clusters. Similarly, free sulfide may not have been readily available. Here we show that UV light drives the synthesis of [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters through the photooxidation of ferrous ions and the photolysis of organic thiols. Iron-sulfur clusters coordinate to and are stabilized by a wide range of cysteine-containing peptides and the assembly of iron-sulfur cluster-peptide complexes can take place within model protocells in a process that parallels extant pathways. Our experiments suggest that iron-sulfur clusters may have formed easily on early Earth, facilitating the emergence of an iron-sulfur-cluster-dependent metabolism.",2
Direct mapping of the angle-dependent barrier to reaction for Cl + CHD3 using polarized scattering data.,"The transition state, which gates and modulates reactive flux, serves as the central concept in our understanding of activated reactions. The barrier height of the transition state can be estimated from the activation energy taken from thermal kinetics data or from the energetic threshold in the measured excitation function (the dependence of reaction cross-sections on initial collision energies). However, another critical and equally important property, the angle-dependent barrier to reaction, has not yet been amenable to experimental determination until now. Here, using the benchmark reaction of Cl + CHD3(v1 = 1) as an example, we show how to map this anisotropic property of the transition state as a function of collision energy from the preferred reactant bond alignment of the backward-scattered products-the imprints of small impact-parameter collisions. The deduced bend potential at the transition state agrees with ab initio calculations. We expect that the method should be applicable to many other direct reactions with a collinear barrier.",2
Structural snapshots of concerted double E-H bond activation at a transition metal centre.,"Bond activation at a transition metal centre is a key fundamental step in numerous chemical transformations. The oxidative addition of element-hydrogen bonds, for example, represents a critical step in a range of widely applied catalytic processes. Despite this, experimental studies defining steps along the bond activation pathway are very rare. In this work, we report on fundamental studies defining a new oxidative activation pathway: combined experimental and computational approaches yield structural snapshots of the simultaneous activation of both bonds of a beta-diketiminate-stabilized GaH2 unit at a single metal centre. Systematic variation of the supporting phosphine ligands and single crystal X-ray/neutron diffraction are exploited in tandem to allow structural visualization of the activation process, from a eta(2)-H,H sigma-complex showing little Ga-H bond activation, through species of intermediate geometry featuring stretched Ga-H and compressed M-H/M-Ga bonds, to a fully activated metal dihydride featuring a neutral (carbene-type) N-heterocyclic Ga(I) ligand.",2
Catalytic diastereo- and enantioselective additions of versatile allyl groups to N-H ketimines.,"There are many biologically active organic molecules that contain one or more nitrogen-containing moieties, and broadly applicable and efficient catalytic transformations that deliver them diastereoselectively and/or enantioselectively are much sought after. Various methods for enantioselective synthesis of alpha-secondary amines are available (for example, from additions to protected/activated aldimines), but those involving ketimines are much less common. There are no reported additions of carbon-based nucleophiles to unprotected/unactivated (or N-H) ketimines. Here, we report a catalytic, diastereo- and enantioselective three-component strategy for merging an N-H ketimine, a monosubstituted allene and B2(pin)2, affording products in up to 95% yield, >98% diastereoselectivity and >99:1 enantiomeric ratio. The utility of the approach is highlighted by synthesis of the tricyclic core of a class of compounds that have been shown to possess anti-Alzheimer activity. Stereochemical models developed with the aid of density functional theory calculations, which account for the observed trends and levels of enantioselectivity, are presented.",2
Supramolecular heterostructures formed by sequential epitaxial deposition of two-dimensional hydrogen-bonded arrays.,"Two-dimensional (2D) supramolecular arrays provide a route to the spatial control of the chemical functionality of a surface, but their deposition is in almost all cases limited to a monolayer termination. Here we investigated the sequential deposition of one 2D array on another to form a supramolecular heterostructure and realize the growth-normal to the underlying substrate-of distinct ordered layers, each of which is stabilized by in-plane hydrogen bonding. For heterostructures formed by depositing terephthalic acid or trimesic acid on cyanuric acid/melamine, we have determined, using atomic force microscopy under ambient conditions, a clear epitaxial arrangement despite the intrinsically distinct symmetries and/or lattice constants of each layer. Structures calculated using classical molecular dynamics are in excellent agreement with the orientation, registry and dimensions of the epitaxial layers. Calculations confirm that van der Waals interactions provide the dominant contribution to the adsorption energy and registry of the layers.",2
Phase behaviour of disordered proteins underlying low density and high permeability of liquid organelles.,"Many intracellular membraneless organelles form via phase separation of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) or regions (IDRs). These include the Caenorhabditis elegans protein LAF-1, which forms P granule-like droplets in vitro. However, the role of protein disorder in phase separation and the macromolecular organization within droplets remain elusive. Here, we utilize a novel technique, ultrafast-scanning fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, to measure the molecular interactions and full coexistence curves (binodals), which quantify the protein concentration within LAF-1 droplets. The binodals of LAF-1 and its IDR display a number of unusual features, including 'high concentration' binodal arms that correspond to remarkably dilute droplets. We find that LAF-1 and other in vitro and intracellular droplets are characterized by an effective mesh size of approximately 3-8 nm, which determines the size scale at which droplet properties impact molecular diffusion and permeability. These findings reveal how specific IDPs can phase separate to form permeable, low-density (semi-dilute) liquids, whose structural features are likely to strongly impact biological function.",2
Directing the path of light-induced electron transfer at a molecular fork using vibrational excitation.,"Ultrafast electron transfer in condensed-phase molecular systems is often strongly coupled to intramolecular vibrations that can promote, suppress and direct electronic processes. Recent experiments exploring this phenomenon proved that light-induced electron transfer can be strongly modulated by vibrational excitation, suggesting a new avenue for active control over molecular function. Here, we achieve the first example of such explicit vibrational control through judicious design of a Pt(II)-acetylide charge-transfer donor-bridge-acceptor-bridge-donor 'fork' system: asymmetric (13)C isotopic labelling of one of the two -C identical withC- bridges makes the two parallel and otherwise identical donor-->acceptor electron-transfer pathways structurally distinct, enabling independent vibrational perturbation of either. Applying an ultrafast UVpump(excitation)-IRpump(perturbation)-IRprobe(monitoring) pulse sequence, we show that the pathway that is vibrationally perturbed during UV-induced electron transfer is dramatically slowed down compared to its unperturbed counterpart. One can thus choose the dominant electron transfer pathway. The findings deliver a new opportunity for precise perturbative control of electronic energy propagation in molecular devices.",2
A new and selective cycle for dehydrogenation of linear and cyclic alkanes under mild conditions using a base metal.,"Selectively converting linear alkanes to alpha-olefins under mild conditions is a highly desirable transformation given the abundance of alkanes as well as the use of olefins as building blocks in the chemical community. Until now, this reaction has been primarily the remit of noble-metal catalysts, despite extensive work showing that base-metal alkylidenes can mediate the reaction in a stoichiometric fashion. Here, we show how the presence of a hydrogen acceptor, such as the phosphorus ylide, when combined with the alkylidene complex (PNP)Ti=CH(t)Bu(CH3) (PNP=N[2-P(CHMe2)2-4-methylphenyl]2(-)), catalyses the dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes to cyclic alkenes, and linear alkanes with chain lengths of C4 to C8 to terminal olefins under mild conditions. This Article represents the first example of a homogeneous and selective alkane dehydrogenation reaction using a base-metal titanium catalyst. We also propose a unique mechanism for the transfer dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons to olefins and discuss a complete cycle based on a combined experimental and computational study.",2
Thermally bisignate supramolecular polymerization.,"One of the enticing characteristics of supramolecular polymers is their thermodynamic reversibility, which is attractive, in particular, for stimuli-responsive applications. These polymers usually disassemble upon heating, but here we report a supramolecular polymerization that occurs upon heating as well as cooling. This behaviour arises from the use of a metalloporphyrin-based tailored monomer bearing eight amide-containing side chains, which assembles into a highly thermostable one-dimensional polymer through pi-stacking and multivalent hydrogen-bonding interactions, and a scavenger, 1-hexanol, in a dodecane-based solvent. At around 50 degrees C, the scavenger locks the monomer into a non-polymerizable form through competing hydrogen bonding. On cooling, the scavenger preferentially self-aggregates, unlocking the monomer for polymerization. Heating also results in unlocking the monomer for polymerization, by disrupting the dipole and hydrogen-bonding interactions with the scavenger. Analogous to 'upper and lower critical solution temperature phenomena' for covalently bonded polymers, such a thermally bisignate feature may lead to supramolecular polymers with tailored complex thermoresponsive properties.",2
Ephemeral collision complexes mediate chemically termolecular transformations that affect system chemistry.,"Termolecular association reactions involve ephemeral collision complexes-formed from the collision of two molecules-that collide with a third and chemically inert 'bath gas' molecule that simply transfers energy to/from the complex. These collision complexes are generally not thought to react chemically on collision with a third molecule in the gas-phase systems of combustion and planetary atmospheres. Such 'chemically termolecular' reactions, in which all three molecules are involved in bond making and/or breaking, were hypothesized long ago in studies establishing radical chain branching mechanisms, but were later concluded to be unimportant. Here, with data from ab initio master equation and kinetic-transport simulations, we reveal that reactions of H + O2 collision complexes with other radicals constitute major kinetic pathways under common combustion situations. These reactions are also found to influence flame propagation speeds, a common measure of global reactivity. Analogous chemically termolecular reactions mediated by ephemeral collision complexes are probably of significance in various combustion and planetary environments.",2
CO- and HCl-free synthesis of acid chlorides from unsaturated hydrocarbons via shuttle catalysis.,"The synthesis of carboxylic acid derivatives from unsaturated hydrocarbons is an important process for the preparation of polymers, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and agrochemicals. Despite its industrial relevance, the traditional Reppe-type carbonylation reaction using pressurized CO is of limited applicability to laboratory-scale synthesis because of: (1) the safety hazards associated with the use of CO, (2) the need for special equipment to handle pressurized gas, (3) the low reactivity of several relevant nucleophiles and (4) the necessity to employ different, often tailor-made, catalytic systems for each nucleophile. Herein we demonstrate that a shuttle-catalysis approach enables a CO- and HCl-free transfer process between an inexpensive reagent, butyryl chloride, and a wide range of unsaturated substrates to access the corresponding acid chlorides in good yields. This new transformation provides access to a broad range of carbonyl-containing products through the in situ transformation of the reactive acid chloride intermediate. In a broader context, this work demonstrates that isodesmic shuttle-catalysis reactions can unlock elusive catalytic reactions.",2
Bifluoride-catalysed sulfur(VI) fluoride exchange reaction for the synthesis of polysulfates and polysulfonates.,"Polysulfates and polysulfonates possess exceptional mechanical properties making them potentially valuable engineering polymers. However, they have been little explored due to a lack of reliable synthetic access. Here we report bifluoride salts (Q(+)[FHF](-), where Q(+) represents a wide range of cations) as powerful catalysts for the sulfur(VI) fluoride exchange (SuFEx) reaction between aryl silyl ethers and aryl fluorosulfates (or alkyl sulfonyl fluorides). The bifluoride salts are significantly more active in catalysing the SuFEx reaction compared to organosuperbases, therefore enabling much lower catalyst-loading (down to 0.05 mol%). Using this chemistry, we are able to prepare polysulfates and polysulfonates with high molecular weight, narrow polydispersity and excellent functional group tolerance. The process is practical with regard to the reduced cost of catalyst, polymer purification and by-product recycling. We have also observed that the process is not sensitive to scale-up, which is essential for its future translation from laboratory research to industrial applications.",2
Synthesis facilitates an understanding of the structural basis for translation inhibition by the lissoclimides.,"The lissoclimides are unusual succinimide-containing labdane diterpenoids that were reported to be potent cytotoxins. Our short semisynthesis and analogue-oriented synthesis approaches provide a series of lissoclimide natural products and analogues that expand the structure-activity relationships (SARs) in this family. The semisynthesis approach yielded significant quantities of chlorolissoclimide (CL) to permit an evaluation against the National Cancer Institute's 60-cell line panel and allowed us to obtain an X-ray co-crystal structure of the synthetic secondary metabolite with the eukaryotic 80S ribosome. Although it shares a binding site with other imide-based natural product translation inhibitors, CL engages in a particularly interesting and novel face-on halogen-pi interaction between the ligand's alkyl chloride and a guanine residue. Our analogue-oriented synthesis provides many more lissoclimide compounds, which were tested against aggressive human cancer cell lines and for protein synthesis inhibitory activity. Finally, computational modelling was used to explain the SARs of certain key compounds and set the stage for the structure-guided design of better translation inhibitors.",2
A triaxial supramolecular weave.,"Despite recent advances in the synthesis of increasingly complex topologies at the molecular level, nano- and microscopic weaves have remained difficult to achieve. Only a few diaxial molecular weaves exist-these were achieved by templation with metals. Here, we present an extended triaxial supramolecular weave that consists of self-assembled organic threads. Each thread is formed by the self-assembly of a building block comprising a rigid oligoproline segment with two perylene-monoimide chromophores spaced at 18 A. Upon pi stacking of the chromophores, threads form that feature alternating up- and down-facing voids at regular distances. These voids accommodate incoming building blocks and establish crossing points through CH-pi interactions on further assembly of the threads into a triaxial woven superstructure. The resulting micrometre-scale supramolecular weave proved to be more robust than non-woven self-assemblies of the same building block. The uniform hexagonal pores of the interwoven network were able to host iridium nanoparticles, which may be of interest for practical applications.",2
Assembly of a biocompatible triazole-linked gene by one-pot click-DNA ligation.,"The chemical synthesis of oligonucleotides and their enzyme-mediated assembly into genes and genomes has significantly advanced multiple scientific disciplines. However, these approaches are not without their shortcomings; enzymatic amplification and ligation of oligonucleotides into genes and genomes makes automation challenging, and site-specific incorporation of epigenetic information and/or modified bases into large constructs is not feasible. Here we present a fully chemical one-pot method for the assembly of oligonucleotides into a gene by click-DNA ligation. We synthesize the 335 base-pair gene that encodes the green fluorescent protein iLOV from ten functionalized oligonucleotides that contain 5'-azide and 3'-alkyne units. The resulting click-linked iLOV gene contains eight triazoles at the sites of chemical ligation, and yet is fully biocompatible; it is replicated by DNA polymerases in vitro and encodes a functional iLOV protein in Escherichia coli. We demonstrate the power and potential of our one-pot gene-assembly method by preparing an epigenetically modified variant of the iLOV gene.",2
Fluorescent nucleobases as tools for studying DNA and RNA.,"Understanding the diversity of dynamic structures and functions of DNA and RNA in biology requires tools that can selectively and intimately probe these biomolecules. Synthetic fluorescent nucleobases that can be incorporated into nucleic acids alongside their natural counterparts have emerged as a powerful class of molecular reporters of location and environment. They are enabling new basic insights into DNA and RNA, and are facilitating a broad range of new technologies with chemical, biological and biomedical applications. In this Review, we will present a brief history of the development of fluorescent nucleobases and explore their utility as tools for addressing questions in biophysics, biochemistry and biology of nucleic acids. We provide chemical insights into the two main classes of these compounds: canonical and non-canonical nucleobases. A point-by-point discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of both types of fluorescent nucleobases is made, along with a perspective into the future challenges and outlook for this burgeoning field.",2
Engineering nucleic acid structures for programmable molecular circuitry and intracellular biocomputation.,"Nucleic acids have attracted widespread attention due to the simplicity with which they can be designed to form discrete structures and programmed to perform specific functions at the nanoscale. The advantages of DNA/RNA nanotechnology offer numerous opportunities for in-cell and in-vivo applications, and the technology holds great promise to advance the growing field of synthetic biology. Many elegant examples have revealed the potential in integrating nucleic acid nanostructures in cells and in vivo where they can perform important physiological functions. In this Review, we summarize the current abilities of DNA/RNA nanotechnology to realize applications in live cells and then discuss the key problems that must be solved to fully exploit the useful properties of nanostructures. Finally, we provide viewpoints on how to integrate the tools provided by DNA/RNA nanotechnology and related new technologies to construct nucleic acid nanostructure-based molecular circuitry for synthetic biology.",2
Local epigenetic reprogramming induced by G-quadruplex ligands.,"DNA and histone modifications regulate transcriptional activity and thus represent valuable targets to reprogram the activity of genes. Current epigenetic therapies target the machinery that regulates these modifications, leading to global transcriptional reprogramming with the potential for extensive undesired effects. Epigenetic information can also be modified as a consequence of disrupting processive DNA replication. Here, we demonstrate that impeding replication by small-molecule-mediated stabilization of G-quadruplex nucleic acid secondary structures triggers local epigenetic plasticity. We report the use of the BU-1 locus of chicken DT40 cells to screen for small molecules able to induce G-quadruplex-dependent transcriptional reprogramming. Further characterization of the top hit compound revealed its ability to induce a dose-dependent inactivation of BU-1 expression in two steps: the loss of H3K4me3 and then subsequent DNA cytosine methylation, changes that were heritable across cell divisions even after the compound was removed. Targeting DNA secondary structures thus represents a potentially new approach for locus-specific epigenetic reprogramming.",2
"Direct, enantioselective alpha-alkylation of aldehydes using simple olefins.","Although the alpha-alkylation of ketones has already been established, the analogous reaction using aldehyde substrates has proven surprisingly elusive. Despite the structural similarities between the two classes of compounds, the sensitivity and unique reactivity of the aldehyde functionality has typically required activated substrates or specialized additives. Here, we show that the synergistic merger of three catalytic processes-photoredox, enamine and hydrogen-atom transfer (HAT) catalysis-enables an enantioselective alpha-aldehyde alkylation reaction that employs simple olefins as coupling partners. Chiral imidazolidinones or prolinols, in combination with a thiophenol, iridium photoredox catalyst and visible light, have been successfully used in a triple catalytic process that is temporally sequenced to deliver a new hydrogen and electron-borrowing mechanism. This multicatalytic process enables both intra- and intermolecular aldehyde alpha-methylene coupling with olefins to construct both cyclic and acyclic products, respectively. With respect to atom and step-economy ideals, this stereoselective process allows the production of high-value molecules from feedstock chemicals in one step while consuming only photons.",2
Salinomycin kills cancer stem cells by sequestering iron in lysosomes.,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) represent a subset of cells within tumours that exhibit self-renewal properties and the capacity to seed tumours. CSCs are typically refractory to conventional treatments and have been associated to metastasis and relapse. Salinomycin operates as a selective agent against CSCs through mechanisms that remain elusive. Here, we provide evidence that a synthetic derivative of salinomycin, which we named ironomycin (AM5), exhibits a more potent and selective activity against breast CSCs in vitro and in vivo, by accumulating and sequestering iron in lysosomes. In response to the ensuing cytoplasmic depletion of iron, cells triggered the degradation of ferritin in lysosomes, leading to further iron loading in this organelle. Iron-mediated production of reactive oxygen species promoted lysosomal membrane permeabilization, activating a cell death pathway consistent with ferroptosis. These findings reveal the prevalence of iron homeostasis in breast CSCs, pointing towards iron and iron-mediated processes as potential targets against these cells.",2
Total synthesis of (-)-tubingensin B enabled by the strategic use of an aryne cyclization.,"Tubingensin B is an indole diterpenoid that bears a daunting chemical structure featuring a disubstituted carbazole unit, five stereogenic centres-three of which are quaternary-and a decorated [3.2.2]-bridged bicycle. We describe our synthetic design toward a concise and enantiospecific total synthesis of tubingensin B, which hinges on the strategic use of a transient aryne intermediate. Although initial studies led to unexpected reaction outcomes, we ultimately implemented a sequence of carbazolyne cyclization followed by Rh-catalysed fragmentation to install the seven-membered ring and vicinal quaternary stereocentres of the natural product. Coupled with a late-stage radical cyclization to construct the [3.2.2]-bridged bicycle, these efforts have enabled the total synthesis of tubingensin B. The design and evolution of our succinct total synthesis underscores the utility of long-avoided aryne intermediates for the introduction of structural motifs that have conventionally been viewed as challenging.",2
Anionic silicate organic frameworks constructed from hexacoordinate silicon centres.,"Crystalline frameworks composed of hexacoordinate silicon species have thus far only been observed in a few high pressure silicate phases. By implementing reversible Si-O chemistry for the crystallization of covalent organic frameworks, we demonstrate the simple one-pot synthesis of silicate organic frameworks based on octahedral dianionic SiO6 building units. Clear evidence of the hexacoordinate environment around the silicon atoms is given by (29)Si nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. Characterization by high-resolution powder X-ray diffraction, density functional theory calculation and analysis of the pair-distribution function showed that those anionic frameworks-M2[Si(C16H10O4)1.5], where M = Li, Na, K and C16H10O4 is 9,10-dimethylanthracene-2,3,6,7-tetraolate-crystallize as two-dimensional hexagonal layers stabilized in a fully eclipsed stacking arrangement with pronounced disorder in the stacking direction. Permanent microporosity with high surface area (up to 1,276 m(2) g(-1)) was evidenced by gas-sorption measurements. The negatively charged backbone balanced with extra-framework cations and the permanent microporosity are characteristics that are shared with zeolites.",2
Synthesis and materialization of a reaction-diffusion French flag pattern.,"During embryo development, patterns of protein concentration appear in response to morphogen gradients. These patterns provide spatial and chemical information that directs the fate of the underlying cells. Here, we emulate this process within non-living matter and demonstrate the autonomous structuration of a synthetic material. First, we use DNA-based reaction networks to synthesize a French flag, an archetypal pattern composed of three chemically distinct zones with sharp borders whose synthetic analogue has remained elusive. A bistable network within a shallow concentration gradient creates an immobile, sharp and long-lasting concentration front through a reaction-diffusion mechanism. The combination of two bistable circuits generates a French flag pattern whose 'phenotype' can be reprogrammed by network mutation. Second, these concentration patterns control the macroscopic organization of DNA-decorated particles, inducing a French flag pattern of colloidal aggregation. This experimental framework could be used to test reaction-diffusion models and fabricate soft materials following an autonomous developmental programme.",2
Coherent singlet fission activated by symmetry breaking.,"Singlet fission, in which a singlet exciton is converted to two triplet excitons, is a process that could be beneficial in photovoltaic applications. A full understanding of the dynamics of singlet fission in molecular systems requires detailed knowledge of the relevant potential energy surfaces and their (conical) intersections. However, obtaining such information is a nontrivial task, particularly for molecular aggregates. Here we investigate singlet fission in rubrene crystals using transient absorption spectroscopy and state-of-the-art quantum chemical calculations. We observe a coherent and ultrafast singlet-fission channel as well as the well-known and conventional thermally assisted incoherent channel. This coherent channel is accessible because the conical intersection for singlet fission on the excited-state potential energy surface is located very close to the equilibrium position of the ground-state potential energy surface and also because of the excitation of an intermolecular symmetry-breaking mode, which activates the electronic coupling necessary for singlet fission.",2
"Catalytic asymmetric trifluoromethylthiolation via enantioselective [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of sulfonium ylides.","The trifluoromethylthio (SCF3) functional group has been of increasing importance in drug design and development as a consequence of its unique electronic properties and high stability coupled with its high lipophilicity. As a result, methods to introduce this highly electronegative functional group have attracted considerable attention in recent years. Although significant progress has been made in the introduction of SCF3 functionality into a variety of molecules, there remain significant challenges regarding the enantioselective synthesis of SCF3-containing compounds. Here, an asymmetric trifluoromethylthiolation that proceeds through the enantioselective [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of a sulfonium ylide generated from a metal carbene and sulfide (Doyle-Kirmse reaction) has been developed using chiral Rh(II) and Cu(I) catalysts. This transformation features mild reaction conditions and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98% yield and 98% e.e.), thus providing a unique, highly efficient and enantioselective method for the construction of C(sp(3))-SCF3 bonds bearing chiral centres.",2
Feshbach resonances in the exit channel of the F + CH3OH --> HF + CH3O reaction observed using transition-state spectroscopy.,"The transition state governs how chemical bonds form and cleave during a chemical reaction and its direct characterization is a long-standing challenge in physical chemistry. Transition state spectroscopy experiments based on negative-ion photodetachment provide a direct probe of the vibrational structure and metastable resonances that are characteristic of the reactive surface. Dynamical resonances are extremely sensitive to the topography of the reactive surface and provide an exceptional point of comparison with theory. Here we study the seven-atom F + CH3OH --> HF + CH3O reaction using slow photoelectron velocity-map imaging spectroscopy of cryocooled CH3OHF(-) anions. These measurements reveal spectral features associated with a manifold of vibrational Feshbach resonances and bound states supported by the post-transition state potential well. Quantum dynamical calculations yield excellent agreement with the experimental results, allow the assignment of spectral structure and demonstrate that the key dynamics of complex bimolecular reactions can be captured with a relatively simple theoretical framework.",2
In situ solid-state NMR and XRD studies of the ADOR process and the unusual structure of zeolite IPC-6.,"The assembly-disassembly-organization-reassembly (ADOR) mechanism is a recent method for preparing inorganic framework materials and, in particular, zeolites. This flexible approach has enabled the synthesis of isoreticular families of zeolites with unprecedented continuous control over porosity, and the design and preparation of materials that would have been difficult-or even impossible-to obtain using traditional hydrothermal techniques. Applying the ADOR process to a parent zeolite with the UTL framework topology, for example, has led to six previously unknown zeolites (named IPC-n, where n = 2, 4, 6, 7, 9 and 10). To realize the full potential of the ADOR method, however, a further understanding of the complex mechanism at play is needed. Here, we probe the disassembly, organization and reassembly steps of the ADOR process through a combination of in situ solid-state NMR spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffraction experiments. We further use the insight gained to explain the formation of the unusual structure of zeolite IPC-6.",2
Complete protein-protein association kinetics in atomic detail revealed by molecular dynamics simulations and Markov modelling.,"Protein-protein association is fundamental to many life processes. However, a microscopic model describing the structures and kinetics during association and dissociation is lacking on account of the long lifetimes of associated states, which have prevented efficient sampling by direct molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Here we demonstrate protein-protein association and dissociation in atomistic resolution for the ribonuclease barnase and its inhibitor barstar by combining adaptive high-throughput MD simulations and hidden Markov modelling. The model reveals experimentally consistent intermediate structures, energetics and kinetics on timescales from microseconds to hours. A variety of flexibly attached intermediates and misbound states funnel down to a transition state and a native basin consisting of the loosely bound near-native state and the tightly bound crystallographic state. These results offer a deeper level of insight into macromolecular recognition and our approach opens the door for understanding and manipulating a wide range of macromolecular association processes.",2
Direct conversion of CO2 into liquid fuels with high selectivity over a bifunctional catalyst.,"Although considerable progress has been made in carbon dioxide (CO2) hydrogenation to various C1 chemicals, it is still a great challenge to synthesize value-added products with two or more carbons, such as gasoline, directly from CO2 because of the extreme inertness of CO2 and a high C-C coupling barrier. Here we present a bifunctional catalyst composed of reducible indium oxides (In2O3) and zeolites that yields a high selectivity to gasoline-range hydrocarbons (78.6%) with a very low methane selectivity (1%). The oxygen vacancies on the In2O3 surfaces activate CO2 and hydrogen to form methanol, and C-C coupling subsequently occurs inside zeolite pores to produce gasoline-range hydrocarbons with a high octane number. The proximity of these two components plays a crucial role in suppressing the undesired reverse water gas shift reaction and giving a high selectivity for gasoline-range hydrocarbons. Moreover, the pellet catalyst exhibits a much better performance during an industry-relevant test, which suggests promising prospects for industrial applications.",2
A reductive aminase from Aspergillus oryzae.,"Reductive amination is one of the most important methods for the synthesis of chiral amines. Here we report the discovery of an NADP(H)-dependent reductive aminase from Aspergillus oryzae (AspRedAm, Uniprot code Q2TW47) that can catalyse the reductive coupling of a broad set of carbonyl compounds with a variety of primary and secondary amines with up to >98% conversion and with up to >98% enantiomeric excess. In cases where both carbonyl and amine show high reactivity, it is possible to employ a 1:1 ratio of the substrates, forming amine products with up to 94% conversion. Steady-state kinetic studies establish that the enzyme is capable of catalysing imine formation as well as reduction. Crystal structures of AspRedAm in complex with NADP(H) and also with both NADP(H) and the pharmaceutical ingredient (R)-rasagiline are reported. We also demonstrate preparative scale reductive aminations with wild-type and Q240A variant biocatalysts displaying total turnover numbers of up to 32,000 and space time yields up to 3.73 g l(-1) d(-1).",2
Transition-metal-free chemo- and regioselective vinylation of azaallyls.,"Direct C(sp(3))-C(sp(2)) bond formation under transition-metal-free conditions offers an atom-economical, inexpensive and environmentally benign alternative to traditional transition-metal-catalysed cross-coupling reactions. A new chemo- and regioselective coupling protocol between 3-aryl-substituted-1,1-diphenyl-2-azaallyl derivatives and vinyl bromides has been developed. This is the first transition-metal-free cross-coupling of azaallyls with vinyl bromide electrophiles and delivers allylic amines in excellent yields (up to 99%). This relatively simple and mild protocol offers a direct and practical strategy for the synthesis of high-value allylic amine building blocks that does not require the use of transition metals, special initiators or photoredox catalysts. Radical clock experiments, electron paramagnetic resonance studies and density functional theory calculations point to an unprecedented substrate-dependent coupling mechanism. Furthermore, an electron paramagnetic resonance signal was observed when the N-benzyl benzophenone ketimine was subjected to silylamide base, supporting the formation of radical species upon deprotonation. The unique mechanisms outlined herein could pave the way for new approaches to transition-metal-free C-C bond formations.",2
A metallo-DNA nanowire with uninterrupted one-dimensional silver array.,"The double-helix structure of DNA, in which complementary strands reversibly hybridize to each other, not only explains how genetic information is stored and replicated, but also has proved very attractive for the development of nanomaterials. The discovery of metal-mediated base pairs has prompted the generation of short metal-DNA hybrid duplexes by a bottom-up approach. Here we describe a metallo-DNA nanowire-whose structure was solved by high-resolution X-ray crystallography-that consists of dodecamer duplexes held together by four different metal-mediated base pairs (the previously observed C-Ag-C, as well as G-Ag-G, G-Ag-C and T-Ag-T) and linked to each other through G overhangs involved in interduplex G-Ag-G. The resulting hybrid nanowires are 2 nm wide with a length of the order of micrometres to millimetres, and hold the silver ions in uninterrupted one-dimensional arrays along the DNA helical axis. The hybrid nanowires are further assembled into three-dimensional lattices by interactions between adenine residues, fully bulged out of the double helix.",2
Glucose-responsive insulin by molecular and physical design.,"The concept of a glucose-responsive insulin (GRI) has been a recent objective of diabetes technology. The idea behind the GRI is to create a therapeutic that modulates its potency, concentration or dosing relative to a patient's dynamic glucose concentration, thereby approximating aspects of a normally functioning pancreas. From the perspective of the medicinal chemist, the GRI is also important as a generalized model of a potentially new generation of therapeutics that adjust potency in response to a critical therapeutic marker. The aim of this Perspective is to highlight emerging concepts, including mathematical modelling and the molecular engineering of insulin itself and its potency, towards a viable GRI. We briefly outline some of the most important recent progress toward this goal and also provide a forward-looking viewpoint, which asks if there are new approaches that could spur innovation in this area as well as to encourage synthetic chemists and chemical engineers to address the challenges and promises offered by this therapeutic approach.",2
Gallium-rich Pd-Ga phases as supported liquid metal catalysts.,"A strategy to develop improved catalysts is to create systems that merge the advantages of heterogeneous and molecular catalysis. One such system involves supported liquid-phase catalysts, which feature a molecularly defined, catalytically active liquid film/droplet layer adsorbed on a porous solid support. In the past decade, this concept has also been extended to supported ionic liquid-phase catalysts. Here we develop this idea further and describe supported catalytically active liquid metal solutions (SCALMS). We report a liquid mixture of gallium and palladium deposited on porous glass that forms an active catalyst for alkane dehydrogenation that is resistant to coke formation and is thus highly stable. X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, supported by theoretical calculations, confirm the liquid state of the catalytic phase under the reaction conditions. Unlike traditional heterogeneous catalysts, the supported liquid metal reported here is highly dynamic and catalysis does not proceed at the surface of the metal nanoparticles, but presumably at homogeneously distributed metal atoms at the surface of a liquid metallic phase.",2
Tyrosine sulfation modulates activity of tick-derived thrombin inhibitors.,"Madanin-1 and chimadanin are two small cysteine-free thrombin inhibitors that facilitate blood feeding in the tick Haemaphysalis longicornis. Here, we report a post-translational modification-tyrosine sulfation-of these two proteins that is critical for potent anti-thrombotic and anticoagulant activity. Inhibitors produced in baculovirus-infected insect cells displayed heterogeneous sulfation of two tyrosine residues within each of the proteins. One-pot ligation-desulfurization chemistry enabled access to homogeneous samples of all possible sulfated variants of the proteins. Tyrosine sulfation of madanin-1 and chimadanin proved crucial for thrombin inhibitory activity, with the doubly sulfated variants three orders of magnitude more potent than the unmodified inhibitors. The three-dimensional structure of madanin-1 in complex with thrombin revealed a unique mode of inhibition, with the sulfated tyrosine residues binding to the basic exosite II of the protease. The importance of tyrosine sulfation within this family of thrombin inhibitors, together with their unique binding mode, paves the way for the development of anti-thrombotic drug leads based on these privileged scaffolds.",2
Chelation and stabilization of berkelium in oxidation state +IV.,"Berkelium (Bk) has been predicted to be the only transplutonium element able to exhibit both +III and +IV oxidation states in solution, but evidence of a stable oxidized Bk chelate has so far remained elusive. Here we describe the stabilization of the heaviest 4+ ion of the periodic table, under mild aqueous conditions, using a siderophore derivative. The resulting Bk(IV) complex exhibits luminescence via sensitization through an intramolecular antenna effect. This neutral Bk(IV) coordination compound is not sequestered by the protein siderocalin-a mammalian metal transporter-in contrast to the negatively charged species obtained with neighbouring trivalent actinides americium, curium and californium (Cf). The corresponding Cf(III)-ligand-protein ternary adduct was characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis. Combined with theoretical predictions, these data add significant insight to the field of transplutonium chemistry, and may lead to innovative Bk separation and purification processes.",2
Elucidating bonding preferences in tetrakis(imido)uranate(VI) dianions.,"Actinyl species, [AnO2](2+), are well-known derivatives of the f-block because of their natural occurrence and essential roles in the nuclear fuel cycle. Along with their nitrogen analogues, [An(NR)2](2+), actinyls are characterized by their two strong trans-An-element multiple bonds, a consequence of the inverse trans influence. We report that these robust bonds can be weakened significantly by increasing the number of multiple bonds to uranium, as demonstrated by a family of uranium(VI) dianions bearing four U-N multiple bonds, [M]2[U(NR)4] (M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs). Their geometry is dictated by cation coordination and sterics rather than by electronic factors. Multiple bond weakening by the addition of strong pi donors has the potential for applications in the processing of high-valent actinyls, commonly found in environmental pollutants and spent nuclear fuels.",2
The structure and binding mode of citrate in the stabilization of gold nanoparticles.,"Elucidating the binding mode of carboxylate-containing ligands to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) is crucial to understand their stabilizing role. A detailed picture of the three-dimensional structure and coordination modes of citrate, acetate, succinate and glutarate to AuNPs is obtained by (13)C and (23)Na solid-state NMR in combination with computational modelling and electron microscopy. The binding between the carboxylates and the AuNP surface is found to occur in three different modes. These three modes are simultaneously present at low citrate to gold ratios, while a monocarboxylate monodentate (1kappaO(1)) mode is favoured at high citrate:gold ratios. The surface AuNP atoms are found to be predominantly in the zero oxidation state after citrate coordination, although trace amounts of Au(delta)(+) are observed. (23)Na NMR experiments show that Na(+) ions are present near the gold surface, indicating that carboxylate binding occurs as a 2e(-) L-type interaction for each oxygen atom involved. This approach has broad potential to probe the binding of a variety of ligands to metal nanoparticles.",2
Stereochemical plasticity modulates cooperative binding in a Co(II)12L6 cuboctahedron.,"Biomolecular receptors are able to process information by responding differentially to combinations of chemical signals. Synthetic receptors that are likewise capable of multi-stimuli response can form the basis of programmable molecular systems, wherein specific input sequences create distinct outputs. Here we report a pseudo-cuboctahedral assembly capable of cooperatively binding anionic and neutral guest species. The binding of pairs of fullerene guests was observed to effect the all-or-nothing cooperative templation of an S6-symmetric host stereoisomer. This bis-fullerene adduct exhibits different cooperativity in binding pairs of anions from the fullerene-free parent: in one case, positive cooperativity is observed, while in another all binding affinities are enhanced by an order of magnitude, and in a third the binding events are only minimally perturbed. This intricate modulation of binding affinity, and thus cooperativity, renders our new cuboctahedral receptor attractive for incorporation into systems with complex, programmable responses to different sets of stimuli.",2
Iterative assembly line synthesis of polypropionates with full stereocontrol.,"The polypropionate motif is ubiquitous, being characteristic of the most important family of natural products for human health, the polyketides. Numerous strategies have been devised to construct these molecules with high stereocontrol, but certain stereoisomers remain challenging to prepare. We now describe the development of an iterative assembly line strategy for the construction of polypropionates. An assembly line strategy for the synthesis of deoxypolypropionates has already been described. However, the introduction of carbinol units required the development of new building blocks and new reaction conditions. This has been achieved by the use of enantioenriched lithiated alpha-chlorosilanes [1-((2'-lithiochloromethyldimethylsilyl)-methyl)-2-(methoxymethyl)-pyrrolidine], thus enabling the programmed synthesis of polypropionates in a fully stereocontrolled manner, including the stereochemically challenging anti-anti isomers. The versatility of the approach is exemplified in its extension to the synthesis of 1,3-related polyols. The methodology now allows access to a much wider family of polyketide natural products with stereochemistry being dialled in at will.",2
Incipient class II mixed valency in a plutonium solid-state compound.,"Electron transfer in mixed-valent transition-metal complexes, clusters and materials is ubiquitous in both natural and synthetic systems. The degree to which intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) occurs, dependent on the degree of delocalization, places these within class II or III of the Robin-Day system. In contrast to the d-block, compounds of f-block elements typically exhibit class I behaviour (no IVCT) because of localization of the valence electrons and poor spatial overlap between metal and ligand orbitals. Here, we report experimental and computational evidence for delocalization of 5f electrons in the mixed-valent Pu(III)/Pu(IV) solid-state compound, Pu3(DPA)5(H2O)2 (DPA = 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylate). The properties of this compound are benchmarked by the pure Pu(III) and Pu(IV) dipicolinate complexes, [Pu(III)(DPA)(H2O)4]Br and Pu(IV)(DPA)2(H2O)3.3H2O, as well as by a second mixed-valent compound, Pu(III)[Pu(IV)(DPA)3H0.5]2, that falls into class I instead. Metal-to-ligand charge transfer is involved in both the formation of Pu3(DPA)5(H2O)2 and in the IVCT.",2
Solvent-switchable continuous-breathing behaviour in a diamondoid metal-organic framework and its influence on CO2 versus CH4 selectivity.,"Understanding the behaviour of flexible metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-porous crystalline materials that undergo a structural change upon exposure to an external stimulus-underpins their design as responsive materials for specific applications, such as gas separation, molecular sensing, catalysis and drug delivery. Reversible transformations of a MOF between open- and closed-pore forms-a behaviour known as 'breathing'-typically occur through well-defined crystallographic transitions. By contrast, continuous breathing is rare, and detailed characterization has remained very limited. Here we report a continuous-breathing mechanism that was studied by single-crystal diffraction in a MOF with a diamondoid network, (Me2NH2)[In(ABDC)2] (ABDC, 2-aminobenzene-1,4-dicarboxylate). Desolvation of the MOF in two different solvents leads to two polymorphic activated forms with very different pore openings, markedly different gas-adsorption capacities and different CO2 versus CH4 selectivities. Partial desolvation introduces a gating pressure associated with CO2 adsorption, which shows that the framework can also undergo a combination of stepped and continuous breathing.",2
Quantifying ligand effects in high-oxidation-state metal catalysis.,"Catalysis by high-valent metals such as titanium(IV) impacts our lives daily through reactions like olefin polymerization. In any catalysis, optimization involves a careful choice of not just the metal but also the ancillary ligands. Because these choices dramatically impact the electronic structure of the system and, in turn, catalyst performance, new tools for catalyst development are needed. Understanding ancillary ligand effects is arguably one of the most critical aspects of catalyst optimization and, while parameters for phosphines have been used for decades with low-valent systems, a comparable system does not exist for high-valent metals. A new electronic parameter for ligand donation, derived from experiments on a high-valent chromium species, is now available. Here, we show that the new parameters enable quantitative determination of ancillary ligand effects on catalysis rate and, in some cases, even provide mechanistic information. Analysing reactions in this way can be used to design better catalyst architectures and paves the way for the use of such parameters in a host of high-valent processes.",2
Chlorodifluoromethane-triggered formation of difluoromethylated arenes catalysed by palladium.,"Difluoromethylated aromatic compounds are of increasing importance in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and materials. Chlorodifluoromethane (ClCF2H), an inexpensive, abundant and widely used industrial raw material, represents the ideal and most straightforward difluoromethylating reagent, but introduction of the difluoromethyl group (CF2H) from ClCF2H into aromatics has not been reported. Here, we describe a direct palladium-catalysed difluoromethylation method for coupling ClCF2H with arylboronic acids and esters to generate difluoromethylated arenes with high efficiency. The reaction exhibits a remarkably broad substrate scope, including heteroarylboronic acids, and was used for difluoromethylation of a range of pharmaceuticals and biologically active compounds. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that a palladium difluorocarbene intermediate is involved in the reaction. Although numerous metal-difluorocarbene complexes have been prepared, the catalytic synthesis of difluoromethylated or difluoromethylenated compounds involving metal-difluorocarbene complexes has not received much attention. This new reaction therefore also opens the door to understand metal-difluorocarbene complex catalysed reactions.",2
Visible-light excitation of iminium ions enables the enantioselective catalytic beta-alkylation of enals.,"Chiral iminium ions-generated upon condensation of alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes and amine catalysts-are used extensively by chemists to make chiral molecules in enantioenriched form. In contrast, their potential to absorb light and promote stereocontrolled photochemical processes remains unexplored. This is despite the fact that visible-light absorption by iminium ions is a naturally occurring event that triggers the mechanism of vision in higher organisms. Herein we demonstrate that the direct excitation of chiral iminium ions can unlock unconventional reaction pathways, enabling enantioselective catalytic photochemical beta-alkylations of enals that cannot be realized via thermal activation. The chemistry uses readily available alkyl silanes, which are recalcitrant to classical conjugate additions, and occurs under illumination by visible-light-emitting diodes. Crucial to success was the design of a chiral amine catalyst with well-tailored electronic properties that can generate a photo-active iminium ion while providing the source of stereochemical induction. This strategy is expected to offer new opportunities for reaction design in the field of enantioselective catalytic photochemistry.",2
A 31-residue peptide induces aggregation of tau's microtubule-binding region in cells.,"The self-propagation of misfolded conformations of tau underlies neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's. There is considerable interest in discovering the minimal sequence and active conformational nucleus that defines this self-propagating event. The microtubule-binding region, spanning residues 244-372, reproduces much of the aggregation behaviour of tau in cells and animal models. Further dissection of the amyloid-forming region to a hexapeptide from the third microtubule-binding repeat resulted in a peptide that rapidly forms fibrils in vitro. We show that this peptide lacks the ability to seed aggregation of tau244-372 in cells. However, as the hexapeptide is gradually extended to 31 residues, the peptides aggregate more slowly and gain potent activity to induce aggregation of tau244-372 in cells. X-ray fibre diffraction, hydrogen-deuterium exchange and solid-state NMR studies map the beta-forming region to a 25-residue sequence. Thus, the nucleus for self-propagating aggregation of tau244-372 in cells is packaged in a remarkably small peptide.",2
Cell-permeable nanobodies for targeted immunolabelling and antigen manipulation in living cells.,"Functional antibody delivery in living cells would enable the labelling and manipulation of intracellular antigens, which constitutes a long-thought goal in cell biology and medicine. Here we present a modular strategy to create functional cell-permeable nanobodies capable of targeted labelling and manipulation of intracellular antigens in living cells. The cell-permeable nanobodies are formed by the site-specific attachment of intracellularly stable (or cleavable) cyclic arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptides to camelid-derived single-chain VHH antibody fragments. We used this strategy for the non-endocytic delivery of two recombinant nanobodies into living cells, which enabled the relocalization of the polymerase clamp PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) and tumour suppressor p53 to the nucleolus, and thereby allowed the detection of protein-protein interactions that involve these two proteins in living cells. Furthermore, cell-permeable nanobodies permitted the co-transport of therapeutically relevant proteins, such as Mecp2, into the cells. This technology constitutes a major step in the labelling, delivery and targeted manipulation of intracellular antigens. Ultimately, this approach opens the door towards immunostaining in living cells and the expansion of immunotherapies to intracellular antigen targets.",2
Parameterization of phosphine ligands demonstrates enhancement of nickel catalysis via remote steric effects.,"The field of Ni-catalysed cross-coupling has seen rapid recent growth because of the low cost of Ni, its earth abundance, and its ability to promote unique cross-coupling reactions. Whereas advances in the related field of Pd-catalysed cross-coupling have been driven by ligand design, the development of ligands specifically for Ni has received minimal attention. Here, we disclose a class of phosphines that enable the Ni-catalysed Csp(3) Suzuki coupling of acetals with boronic acids to generate benzylic ethers, a reaction that failed with known ligands for Ni and designer phosphines for Pd. Using parameters to quantify phosphine steric and electronic properties together with regression statistical analysis, we identify a model for ligand success. The study suggests that effective phosphines feature remote steric hindrance, a concept that could guide future ligand design tailored to Ni. Our analysis also reveals that two classic descriptors for ligand steric environment-cone angle and % buried volume-are not equivalent, despite their treatment in the literature.",2

Single-molecule spectroscopy of LHCSR1 protein dynamics identifies two distinct states responsible for multi-timescale photosynthetic photoprotection.,"In oxygenic photosynthesis, light harvesting is regulated to safely dissipate excess energy and prevent the formation of harmful photoproducts. Regulation is known to be necessary for fitness, but the molecular mechanisms are not understood. One challenge has been that ensemble experiments average over active and dissipative behaviours, preventing identification of distinct states. Here, we use single-molecule spectroscopy to uncover the photoprotective states and dynamics of the light-harvesting complex stress-related 1 (LHCSR1) protein, which is responsible for dissipation in green algae and moss. We discover the existence of two dissipative states. We find that one of these states is activated by pH and the other by carotenoid composition, and that distinct protein dynamics regulate these states. Together, these two states enable the organism to respond to two types of intermittency in solar intensity-step changes (clouds and shadows) and ramp changes (sunrise), respectively. Our findings reveal key control mechanisms underlying photoprotective dissipation, with implications for increasing biomass yields and developing robust solar energy devices.",2
MoS2 monolayer catalyst doped with isolated Co atoms for the hydrodeoxygenation reaction.,"The conversion of oxygen-rich biomass into hydrocarbon fuels requires efficient hydrodeoxygenation catalysts during the upgrading process. However, traditionally prepared CoMoS2 catalysts, although efficient for hydrodesulfurization, are not appropriate due to their poor activity, sulfur loss and rapid deactivation at elevated temperature. Here, we report the synthesis of MoS2 monolayer sheets decorated with isolated Co atoms that bond covalently to sulfur vacancies on the basal planes that, when compared with conventionally prepared samples, exhibit superior activity, selectivity and stability for the hydrodeoxygenation of 4-methylphenol to toluene. This higher activity allows the reaction temperature to be reduced from the typically used 300 degrees C to 180 degrees C and thus allows the catalysis to proceed without sulfur loss and deactivation. Experimental analysis and density functional theory calculations reveal a large number of sites at the interface between the Co and Mo atoms on the MoS2 basal surface and we ascribe the higher activity to the presence of sulfur vacancies that are created local to the observed Co-S-Mo interfacial sites.",2
Cytosolic antibody delivery by lipid-sensitive endosomolytic peptide.,"One of the major obstacles in intracellular targeting using antibodies is their limited release from endosomes into the cytosol. Here we report an approach to deliver proteins, which include antibodies, into cells by using endosomolytic peptides derived from the cationic and membrane-lytic spider venom peptide M-lycotoxin. The delivery peptides were developed by introducing one or two glutamic acid residues into the hydrophobic face. One peptide with the substitution of leucine by glutamic acid (L17E) was shown to enable a marked cytosolic liberation of antibodies (immunoglobulins G (IgGs)) from endosomes. The predominant membrane-perturbation mechanism of this peptide is the preferential disruption of negatively charged membranes (endosomal membranes) over neutral membranes (plasma membranes), and the endosomolytic peptide promotes the uptake by inducing macropinocytosis. The fidelity of this approach was confirmed through the intracellular delivery of a ribosome-inactivation protein (saporin), Cre recombinase and IgG delivery, which resulted in a specific labelling of the cytosolic proteins and subsequent suppression of the glucocorticoid receptor-mediated transcription. We also demonstrate the L17E-mediated cytosolic delivery of exosome-encapsulated proteins.",2
Design of multi-phase dynamic chemical networks.,"Template-directed polymerization reactions enable the accurate storage and processing of nature's biopolymer information. This mutualistic relationship of nucleic acids and proteins, a network known as life's central dogma, is now marvellously complex, and the progressive steps necessary for creating the initial sequence and chain-length-specific polymer templates are lost to time. Here we design and construct dynamic polymerization networks that exploit metastable prion cross-beta phases. Mixed-phase environments have been used for constructing synthetic polymers, but these dynamic phases emerge naturally from the growing peptide oligomers and create environments suitable both to nucleate assembly and select for ordered templates. The resulting templates direct the amplification of a phase containing only chain-length-specific peptide-like oligomers. Such multi-phase biopolymer dynamics reveal pathways for the emergence, self-selection and amplification of chain-length- and possibly sequence-specific biopolymers.",2
Macromolecular metamorphosis via stimulus-induced transformations of polymer architecture.,"Macromolecular architecture plays a pivotal role in determining the properties of polymers. When designing polymers for specific applications, it is not only the size of a macromolecule that must be considered, but also its shape. In most cases, the topology of a polymer is a static feature that is inalterable once synthesized. Using reversible-covalent chemistry to prompt the disconnection of chemical bonds and the formation of new linkages in situ, we report polymers that undergo dramatic topological transformations via a process we term macromolecular metamorphosis. Utilizing this technique, a linear amphiphilic block copolymer or hyperbranched polymer undergoes 'metamorphosis' into comb, star and hydrophobic block copolymer architectures. This approach was extended to include a macroscopic gel which transitioned from a densely and covalently crosslinked network to one with larger distances between the covalent crosslinks when heated. These architectural transformations present an entirely new approach to 'smart' materials.",2
A device that operates within a self-assembled 3D DNA crystal.,"Structural DNA nanotechnology finds applications in numerous areas, but the construction of objects, 2D and 3D crystalline lattices and devices is prominent among them. Each of these components has been developed individually, and most of them have been combined in pairs. However, to date there are no reports of independent devices contained within 3D crystals. Here we report a three-state 3D device whereby we change the colour of the crystals by diffusing strands that contain dyes in or out of the crystals through the mother-liquor component of the system. Each colouring strand is designed to pair with an extended triangle strand by Watson-Crick base pairing. The arm that contains the dyes is quite flexible, but it is possible to establish the presence of the duplex proximal to the triangle by X-ray crystallography. We modelled the transition between the red and blue states through a simple kinetic model.",2
Catalytic diversity in self-propagating peptide assemblies.,"The protein-only infectious agents known as prions exist within cellular matrices as populations of assembled polypeptide phases ranging from particles to amyloid fibres. These phases appear to undergo Darwinian-like selection and propagation, yet remarkably little is known about their accessible chemical and biological functions. Here we construct simple peptides that assemble into well-defined amyloid phases and define paracrystalline surfaces able to catalyse specific enantioselective chemical reactions. Structural adjustments of individual amino acid residues predictably control both the assembled crystalline order and their accessible catalytic repertoire. Notably, the density and proximity of the extended arrays of enantioselective catalytic sites achieve template-directed polymerization of new polymers. These diverse amyloid templates can now be extended as dynamic self-propagating templates for the construction of even more complex functional materials.",2

Unified biomimetic assembly of voacalgine A and bipleiophylline via divergent oxidative couplings.,"Bipleiophylline is a highly complex monoterpene indole alkaloid composed of two pleiocarpamine units anchored on an aromatic spacer platform. The synthesis of bipleiophylline is considered as a mountain to climb by the organic chemistry community. Here, a unified oxidative coupling protocol between indole derivatives and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid, mediated by silver oxide, has been developed to produce the core of bipleiophylline. This method also allows the independent preparation of benzofuro[2,3-b]indolenine and isochromano[3,4-b]indolenine scaffolds, depending only on the nature of the aromatic platform used. The procedure has been applied to simple indole derivatives and to more challenging monoterpene indole alkaloids, thereby furnishing natural-product-like structures. The use of scarce pleiocarpamine as the starting indole allows the first syntheses of bipleiophylline and of its biosynthetic precursor, voacalgine A. The structure of the latter has been reassigned in the course of our investigations by 2D NMR and displays an isochromano[3,4-b]indolenine motif instead of a benzofuro[2,3-b]indolenine.",2
"Scalable and uniform 1D nanoparticles by synchronous polymerization, crystallization and self-assembly.","The preparation of well-defined nanoparticles based on soft matter, using solution-processing techniques on a commercially viable scale, is a major challenge of widespread importance. Self-assembly of block copolymers in solvents that selectively solvate one of the segments provides a promising route to core-corona nanoparticles (micelles) with a wide range of potential uses. Nevertheless, significant limitations to this approach also exist. For example, the solution processing of block copolymers generally follows a separate synthesis step and is normally performed at high dilution. Moreover, non-spherical micelles-which are promising for many applications-are generally difficult to access, samples are polydisperse and precise dimensional control is not possible. Here we demonstrate the formation of platelet and cylindrical micelles at concentrations up to 25% solids via a one-pot approach-starting from monomers-that combines polymerization-induced and crystallization-driven self-assembly. We also show that performing the procedure in the presence of small seed micelles allows the scalable formation of low dispersity samples of cylindrical micelles of controlled length up to three micrometres.",2
The versatility of boron in biological target engagement.,"Boron-containing molecules have been extensively used for the purposes of chemical sensing, biological probe development and drug discovery. Due to boron's empty p orbital, it can coordinate to heteroatoms such as oxygen and nitrogen. This reversible covalent mode of interaction has led to the use of boron as bait for nucleophilic residues in disease-associated proteins, culminating in the approval of new therapeutics that work by covalent mechanisms. Our analysis of a wide range of covalent inhibitors with electrophilic groups suggests that boron is a unique electrophile in its chameleonic ability to engage protein targets. Here we review boron's interactions with a range of protein side-chain residues and reveal that boron's properties are nuanced and arise from its uncommon coordination preferences. These mechanistic and structural insights should serve as a guide for the development of selective boron-based bioactive molecules.",2
Probing the early stages of photoreception in photoactive yellow protein with ultrafast time-domain Raman spectroscopy.,"Unveiling the nuclear motions of photoreceptor proteins in action is a crucial goal in protein science in order to understand their elaborate mechanisms and how they achieve optimal selectivity and efficiency. Previous studies have provided detailed information on the structures of intermediates that appear during the later stages (>ns) of such photoreception cycles, yet the initial events immediately after photoabsorption remain unclear because of experimental challenges in monitoring nuclear rearrangements on ultrafast timescales, including protein-specific low-frequency motions. Using time-domain Raman probing with sub-7-fs pulses, we obtain snapshot vibrational spectra of photoactive yellow protein and a mutant with high sensitivity, providing insights into the key responses that drive photoreception. Our data show a drastic intensity drop of the excited-state marker band at 135 cm(-1) within a few hundred femtoseconds, suggesting a rapid weakening of the hydrogen bond that anchors the chromophore. We also track formation of the first ground-state intermediate over the first few picoseconds and fully characterize its vibrational structure, revealing a substantially-twisted cis conformation.",2
One-thousand-fold enhancement of high field liquid nuclear magnetic resonance signals at room temperature.,"Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a fundamental spectroscopic technique for the study of biological systems and materials, molecular imaging and the analysis of small molecules. It detects interactions at very low energies and is thus non-invasive and applicable to a variety of targets, including animals and humans. However, one of its most severe limitations is its low sensitivity, which stems from the small interaction energies involved. Here, we report that dynamic nuclear polarization in liquid solution and at room temperature can enhance the NMR signal of (13)C nuclei by up to three orders of magnitude at magnetic fields of approximately 3 T. The experiment can be repeated within seconds for signal averaging, without interfering with the sample magnetic homogeneity. The method is therefore compatible with the conditions required for high-resolution NMR. Enhancement of (13)C signals on various organic compounds opens up new perspectives for dynamic nuclear polarization as a general tool to increase the sensitivity of liquid NMR.",2
Redox-controlled potassium intercalation into two polyaromatic hydrocarbon solids.,"Alkali metal intercalation into polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) has been studied intensely after reports of superconductivity in a number of potassium- and rubidium-intercalated materials. There are, however, no reported crystal structures to inform our understanding of the chemistry and physics because of the complex reactivity of PAHs with strong reducing agents at high temperature. Here we present the synthesis of crystalline K2Pentacene and K2Picene by a solid-solid insertion protocol that uses potassium hydride as a redox-controlled reducing agent to access the PAH dianions, and so enables the determination of their crystal structures. In both cases, the inserted cations expand the parent herringbone packings by reorienting the molecular anions to create multiple potassium sites within initially dense molecular layers, and thus interact with the PAH anion pi systems. The synthetic and crystal chemistry of alkali metal intercalation into PAHs differs from that into fullerenes and graphite, in which the cation sites are pre-defined by the host structure.",2
A polymer nanoparticle with engineered affinity for a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF165).,"Protein affinity reagents are widely used in basic research, diagnostics and separations and for clinical applications, the most common of which are antibodies. However, they often suffer from high cost, and difficulties in their development, production and storage. Here we show that a synthetic polymer nanoparticle (NP) can be engineered to have many of the functions of a protein affinity reagent. Polymer NPs with nM affinity to a key vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF165) inhibit binding of the signalling protein to its receptor VEGFR-2, preventing receptor phosphorylation and downstream VEGF165-dependent endothelial cell migration and invasion into the extracellular matrix. In addition, the NPs inhibit VEGF-mediated new blood vessel formation in Matrigel plugs in vivo. Importantly, the non-toxic NPs were not found to exhibit off-target activity. These results support the assertion that synthetic polymers offer a new paradigm in the search for abiotic protein affinity reagents by providing many of the functions of their protein counterparts.",2
"Enantioselective, intermolecular benzylic C-H amination catalysed by an engineered iron-haem enzyme.","C-H bonds are ubiquitous structural units of organic molecules. Although these bonds are generally considered to be chemically inert, the recent emergence of methods for C-H functionalization promises to transform the way synthetic chemistry is performed. The intermolecular amination of C-H bonds represents a particularly desirable and challenging transformation for which no efficient, highly selective, and renewable catalysts exist. Here we report the directed evolution of an iron-containing enzymatic catalyst-based on a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase-for the highly enantioselective intermolecular amination of benzylic C-H bonds. The biocatalyst is capable of up to 1,300 turnovers, exhibits excellent enantioselectivities, and provides access to valuable benzylic amines. Iron complexes are generally poor catalysts for C-H amination: in this catalyst, the enzyme's protein framework confers activity on an otherwise unreactive iron-haem cofactor.",2
Post-translational modification of ribosomally synthesized peptides by a radical SAM epimerase in Bacillus subtilis.,"Ribosomally synthesized peptides are built out of L-amino acids, whereas D-amino acids are generally the hallmark of non-ribosomal synthetic processes. Here we show that the model bacterium Bacillus subtilis is able to produce a novel type of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide that contains D-amino acids, and which we propose to call epipeptides. We demonstrate that a two [4Fe-4S]-cluster radical S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) enzyme converts L-amino acids into their D-counterparts by catalysing Calpha-hydrogen-atom abstraction and using a critical cysteine residue as the hydrogen-atom donor. Unexpectedly, these D-amino acid residues proved to be essential for the activity of a peptide that induces the expression of LiaRS, a major component of the bacterial cell envelope stress-response system. Present in B. subtilis and in several members of the human microbiome, these epipeptides and radical SAM epimerases broaden the landscape of peptidyl structures accessible to living organisms.",2
pi-electron S = (1/2) quantum spin-liquid state in an ionic polyaromatic hydrocarbon.,"Molecular solids with cooperative electronic properties based purely on pi electrons from carbon atoms offer a fertile ground in the search for exotic states of matter, including unconventional superconductivity and quantum magnetism. The field was ignited by reports of high-temperature superconductivity in materials obtained by the reaction of alkali metals with polyaromatic hydrocarbons, such as phenanthrene and picene, but the composition and structure of any compound in this family remained unknown. Here we isolate the binary caesium salts of phenanthrene, Cs(C14H10) and Cs2(C14H10), to show that they are multiorbital strongly correlated Mott insulators. Whereas Cs2(C14H10) is diamagnetic because of orbital polarization, Cs(C14H10) is a Heisenberg antiferromagnet with a gapped spin-liquid state that emerges from the coupled highly frustrated Delta-chain magnetic topology of the alternating-exchange spiral tubes of S = (1/2) (C14H10)(*-) radical anions. The absence of long-range magnetic order down to 1.8 K (T/J approximately 0.02; J is the dominant exchange constant) renders the compound an excellent candidate for a spin-(1/2) quantum-spin liquid (QSL) that arises purely from carbon pi electrons.",2
Placing and shaping liposomes with reconfigurable DNA nanocages.,"The diverse structure and regulated deformation of lipid bilayer membranes are among a cell's most fascinating features. Artificial membrane-bound vesicles, known as liposomes, are versatile tools for modelling biological membranes and delivering foreign objects to cells. To fully mimic the complexity of cell membranes and optimize the efficiency of delivery vesicles, controlling liposome shape (both statically and dynamically) is of utmost importance. Here we report the assembly, arrangement and remodelling of liposomes with designer geometry: all of which are exquisitely controlled by a set of modular, reconfigurable DNA nanocages. Tubular and toroid shapes, among others, are transcribed from DNA cages to liposomes with high fidelity, giving rise to membrane curvatures present in cells yet previously difficult to construct in vitro. Moreover, the conformational changes of DNA cages drive membrane fusion and bending with predictable outcomes, opening up opportunities for the systematic study of membrane mechanics.",2
Rapid heteroatom transfer to arylmetals utilizing multifunctional reagent scaffolds.,"Arylmetals are highly valuable carbon nucleophiles that are readily and inexpensively prepared from aryl halides or arenes and widely used on both laboratory and industrial scales to react directly with a wide range of electrophiles. Although C-C bond formation has been a staple of organic synthesis, the direct transfer of primary amino (-NH2) and hydroxyl (-OH) groups to arylmetals in a scalable and environmentally friendly fashion remains a formidable synthetic challenge because of the absence of suitable heteroatom-transfer reagents. Here, we demonstrate the use of bench-stable N-H and N-alkyl oxaziridines derived from readily available terpenoid scaffolds as efficient multifunctional reagents for the direct primary amination and hydroxylation of structurally diverse aryl- and heteroarylmetals. This practical and scalable method provides one-step synthetic access to primary anilines and phenols at low temperature and avoids the use of transition-metal catalysts, ligands and additives, nitrogen-protecting groups, excess reagents and harsh workup conditions.",2
Cooperative polymerization of alpha-helices induced by macromolecular architecture.,"Catalysis observed in enzymatic processes and protein polymerizations often relies on the use of supramolecular interactions and the organization of functional elements in order to gain control over the spatial and temporal elements of fundamental cellular processes. Harnessing these cooperative interactions to catalyse reactions in synthetic systems, however, remains challenging due to the difficulty in creating structurally controlled macromolecules. Here, we report a polypeptide-based macromolecule with spatially organized alpha-helices that can catalyse its own formation. The system consists of a linear polymeric scaffold containing a high density of initiating groups from which polypeptides are grown, forming a brush polymer. The folding of polypeptide side chains into alpha-helices dramatically enhances the polymerization rate due to cooperative interactions of macrodipoles between neighbouring alpha-helices. The parameters that affect the rate are elucidated by a two-stage kinetic model using principles from nucleation-controlled protein polymerizations; the key difference being the irreversible nature of this polymerization.",2
Observation of electron-transfer-mediated decay in aqueous solution.,"Photoionization is at the heart of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which gives access to important information on a sample's local chemical environment. Local and non-local electronic decay after photoionization-in which the refilling of core holes results in electron emission from either the initially ionized species or a neighbour, respectively-have been well studied. However, electron-transfer-mediated decay (ETMD), which involves the refilling of a core hole by an electron from a neighbouring species, has not yet been observed in condensed phase. Here we report the experimental observation of ETMD in an aqueous LiCl solution by detecting characteristic secondary low-energy electrons using liquid-microjet soft XPS. Experimental results are interpreted using molecular dynamics and high-level ab initio calculations. We show that both solvent molecules and counterions participate in the ETMD processes, and different ion associations have distinctive spectral fingerprints. Furthermore, ETMD spectra are sensitive to coordination numbers, ion-solvent distances and solvent arrangement.",2
Characterization of a selenocysteine-ligated P450 compound I reveals direct link between electron donation and reactivity.,"Strong electron-donation from the axial thiolate ligand of cytochrome P450 has been proposed to increase the reactivity of compound I with respect to C-H bond activation. However, it has proven difficult to test this hypothesis, and a direct link between reactivity and electron donation has yet to be established. To make this connection, we have prepared a selenolate-ligated cytochrome P450 compound I intermediate. This isoelectronic perturbation allows for direct comparisons with the wild-type enzyme. Selenium incorporation was achieved using a cysteine auxotrophic Escherichia coli strain. The intermediate was prepared with meta-chloroperbenzoic acid and characterized by UV-visible, Mossbauer and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies. Measurements revealed increased asymmetry around the ferryl moiety, consistent with increased electron donation from the axial selenolate ligand. In line with this observation, we find that the selenolate-ligated compound I cleaves C-H bonds more rapidly than the wild-type intermediate.",2
A synthetic ion transporter that disrupts autophagy and induces apoptosis by perturbing cellular chloride concentrations.,"Perturbations in cellular chloride concentrations can affect cellular pH and autophagy and lead to the onset of apoptosis. With this in mind, synthetic ion transporters have been used to disturb cellular ion homeostasis and thereby induce cell death; however, it is not clear whether synthetic ion transporters can also be used to disrupt autophagy. Here, we show that squaramide-based ion transporters enhance the transport of chloride anions in liposomal models and promote sodium chloride influx into the cytosol. Liposomal and cellular transport activity of the squaramides is shown to correlate with cell death activity, which is attributed to caspase-dependent apoptosis. One ion transporter was also shown to cause additional changes in lysosomal pH, which leads to impairment of lysosomal enzyme activity and disruption of autophagic processes. This disruption is independent of the initiation of apoptosis by the ion transporter. This study provides the first experimental evidence that synthetic ion transporters can disrupt both autophagy and induce apoptosis.",2
Hypersensitive dual-function luminescence switching of a silver-chalcogenolate cluster-based metal-organic framework.,"Silver(i) chalcogenide/chalcogenolate clusters are promising photofunctional materials for sensing, optoelectronics and solar energy harvesting applications. However, their instability and poor room-temperature luminescent quantum yields have hampered more extensive study. Here, we graft such clusters to adaptable bridging ligands, enabling their interconnection and the formation of rigid metal-organic frameworks. By controlling the spatial separation and orientation of the clusters, they then exhibit enhanced stability (over one year) and quantum yield (12.1%). Ultrafast dual-function fluorescence switching (<1 s) is also achieved, with turn-off triggered by O2 and multicoloured turn-on by volatile organic compounds. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction of the inclusion materials, obtained by single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation, enables precise determination of the position of the small molecules within the framework, elucidating the switching mechanism. The work enriches the cluster-based metal-organic framework portfolio, bridges the gap between silver chalcogenide/chalcogenolate clusters and metal-organic frameworks, and provides a foundation for further development of functional silver-cluster-based materials.",2
Monitoring interconversion between stereochemical states in single chirality-transfer complexes on a platinum surface.,"Elementary steps in enantioselective heterogeneous catalysis take place on the catalyst surface and the targeted synthesis of a desired enantiomer requires the implantation of chiral information at the surface, which can be achieved-for example-by adsorbing chiral molecules. Studies of the structures of complexes formed between adsorbed prochiral reagents and chiral molecules yield information on the forces exerting stereocontrol, but further insight could be gained by studying the dynamics of their interactions. Here, using time-lapsed scanning tunnelling microscopy and density functional theory, we observe coupling between multiple stereochemical states within individual non-covalently bonded chirality-transfer complexes on a metal surface. We identify two modes of transformation between stereochemical states and find that the prochiral reagent can sample several complexation geometries during the lifetime of a complex, switching between states of opposing prochirality in the process. These results provide insight on the contribution of individual stereochemical states to the overall enantioselectivity of reactions occurring on catalyst surfaces.",2
Catalytic enantioselective synthesis of atropisomeric biaryls by a cation-directed O-alkylation.,"Axially chiral biaryls, as exemplified by 1,1'-bi-2-naphthol (BINOL), are key components of catalysts, natural products and medicines. These materials are synthesized conventionally in enantioenriched form through metal-mediated cross coupling, de novo construction of an aromatic ring, point-to-axial chirality transfer or an atropselective transformation of an existing biaryl. Here, we report a highly enantioselective organocatalytic method for the synthesis of atropisomeric biaryls by a cation-directed O-alkylation. Treatment of racemic 1-aryl-2-tetralones with a chiral quinidine-derived ammonium salt under basic conditions in the presence of an alkylating agent leads to atropselective O-alkylation with e.r. up to 98:2. Oxidation with DDQ gives access to C2-symmetric and non-symmetric BINOL derivatives without compromising e.r. We propose that the chiral ammonium counterion differentiates between rapidly equilibrating atropisomeric enolates, leading to highly atropselective O-alkylation. This dynamic kinetic resolution process offers a general approach to the synthesis of enantioenriched atropisomeric materials.",2
Structural and functional synthetic model of mono-iron hydrogenase featuring an anthracene scaffold.,"Mono-iron hydrogenase was the third type of hydrogenase discovered. Its Lewis acidic iron(II) centre promotes the heterolytic cleavage of the H-H bond and this non-redox H2 activation distinguishes it from the well-studied dinuclear [FeFe] and [NiFe] hydrogenases. Cleavage of the H-H bond is followed by hydride transfer to the enzyme's organic substrate, H4MPT(+), which serves as a CO2 'carrier' in methanogenic pathways. Here we report a scaffold-based synthetic approach by which to model mono-iron hydrogenase using an anthracene framework, which supports a biomimetic fac-C,N,S coordination motif to an iron(II) centre. This arrangement includes the biomimetic and organometallic Fe-C sigma bond, which enables bidirectional activity reminiscent of the native enzyme: the complex activates H2 under mild conditions, and catalyses C-H hydride abstraction plus H2 generation from a model substrate. Notably, neither H2 activation nor C-H hydride abstraction was observed in the analogous complex with a pincer-type mer-C,N,S ligation, emphasizing the importance of the fac-C,N,S-iron(II) motif in promoting enzyme-like reactivity.",2
Coherent ultrafast lattice-directed reaction dynamics of triiodide anion photodissociation.,"Solid-state reactions are influenced by the spatial arrangement of the reactants and the electrostatic environment of the lattice, which may enable lattice-directed chemical dynamics. Unlike the caging imposed by an inert matrix, an active lattice participates in the reaction, however, little evidence of such lattice participation has been gathered on ultrafast timescales due to the irreversibility of solid-state chemical systems. Here, by lowering the temperature to 80 K, we have been able to study the dissociative photochemistry of the triiodide anion (I3(-)) in single-crystal tetra-n-butylammonium triiodide using broadband transient absorption spectroscopy. We identified the coherently formed tetraiodide radical anion (I4(*)(-)) as a reaction intermediate. Its delayed appearance after that of the primary photoproduct, diiodide radical I2(*)(-), indicates that I4(*)(-) was formed via a secondary reaction between a dissociated iodine radical (I(*)) and an adjacent I3(-). This chemistry occurs as a result of the intermolecular interaction determined by the crystalline arrangement and is in stark contrast with previous solution studies.",2
Unique physicochemical and catalytic properties dictated by the B3NO2 ring system.,"The expansion of molecular diversity beyond what nature can produce is a fundamental objective in chemical sciences. Despite the rich chemistry of boron-containing heterocycles, the 1,3-dioxa-5-aza-2,4,6-triborinane (DATB) ring system, which is characterized by a six-membered B3NO2 core, remains elusive. Here, we report the synthesis of m-terphenyl-templated DATB derivatives, displaying high stability and peculiar Lewis acidity arising from the three suitably arranged boron atoms. We identify a particular utility for DATB in the dehydrative amidation of carboxylic acids and amines, a reaction of high academic and industrial importance. The three boron sites are proposed to engage in substrate assembly, lowering the entropic cost of the transition state, in contrast with the operative mechanism of previously reported catalysts and amide coupling reagents. The distinct mechanistic pathway dictated by the DATB core will advance not only such amidations, but also other reactions driven by multisite activation.",2
Engineering live cell surfaces with functional polymers via cytocompatible controlled radical polymerization.,"The capability to graft synthetic polymers onto the surfaces of live cells offers the potential to manipulate and control their phenotype and underlying cellular processes. Conventional grafting-to strategies for conjugating preformed polymers to cell surfaces are limited by low polymer grafting efficiency. Here we report an alternative grafting-from strategy for directly engineering the surfaces of live yeast and mammalian cells through cell surface-initiated controlled radical polymerization. By developing cytocompatible PET-RAFT (photoinduced electron transfer-reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization), synthetic polymers with narrow polydispersity (Mw/Mn < 1.3) could be obtained at room temperature in 5 minutes. This polymerization strategy enables chain growth to be initiated directly from chain-transfer agents anchored on the surface of live cells using either covalent attachment or non-covalent insertion, while maintaining high cell viability. Compared with conventional grafting-to approaches, these methods significantly improve the efficiency of grafting polymer chains and enable the active manipulation of cellular phenotypes.",2
Switchable regioselectivity in amine-catalysed asymmetric cycloadditions.,"Building small-molecule libraries with structural and stereogenic diversity plays an important role in drug discovery. The development of switchable intermolecular cycloaddition reactions from identical substrates in different regioselective fashions would provide an attractive protocol. However, this also represents a challenge in organic chemistry, because it is difficult to control regioselectivity to afford the products exclusively and at the same time achieve high levels of stereoselectivity. Here, we report the diversified cycloadditions of alpha'-alkylidene-2-cyclopentenones catalysed by cinchona-derived primary amines. An asymmetric gamma,beta'-regioselective intermolecular [6+2] cycloaddition reaction with 3-olefinic (7-aza)oxindoles is realized through the in situ generation of formal 4-aminofulvenes, while a different beta,gamma-regioselective [2+2] cycloaddition reaction with maleimides to access fused cyclobutanes is disclosed. In contrast, an intriguing alpha,gamma-regioselective [4+2] cycloaddition reaction is uncovered with the same set of substrates, by employing an unprecedented dual small-molecule catalysis of amines and thiols. All of the cycloaddition reactions exhibit excellent regio- and stereoselectivity, producing a broad spectrum of chiral architectures with high structural diversity and molecular complexity.",2
Programming molecular self-assembly of intrinsically disordered proteins containing sequences of low complexity.,"Dynamic protein-rich intracellular structures that contain phase-separated intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) composed of sequences of low complexity (SLC) have been shown to serve a variety of important cellular functions, which include signalling, compartmentalization and stabilization. However, our understanding of these structures and our ability to synthesize models of them have been limited. We present design rules for IDPs possessing SLCs that phase separate into diverse assemblies within droplet microenvironments. Using theoretical analyses, we interpret the phase behaviour of archetypal IDP sequences and demonstrate the rational design of a vast library of multicomponent protein-rich structures that ranges from uniform nano-, meso- and microscale puncta (distinct protein droplets) to multilayered orthogonally phase-separated granular structures. The ability to predict and program IDP-rich assemblies in this fashion offers new insights into (1) genetic-to-molecular-to-macroscale relationships that encode hierarchical IDP assemblies, (2) design rules of such assemblies in cell biology and (3) molecular-level engineering of self-assembled recombinant IDP-rich materials.",2
A two-dimensional conjugated aromatic polymer via C-C coupling reaction.,"The fabrication of crystalline 2D conjugated polymers with well-defined repeating units and in-built porosity presents a significant challenge to synthetic chemists. Yet they present an appealing target because of their desirable physical and electronic properties. Here we report the preparation of a 2D conjugated aromatic polymer synthesized via C-C coupling reactions between tetrabromopolyaromatic monomers. Pre-arranged monomers in the bulk crystal undergo C-C coupling driven by endogenous solid-state polymerization to produce a crystalline polymer, which can be mechanically exfoliated into micrometre-sized lamellar sheets with a thickness of 1 nm. Isothermal gas-sorption measurements of the bulk material reveal a dominant pore size of ~0.6 nm, which indicates uniform open channels from the eclipsed stacking of the sheets. When employed as an organic anode in an ambient-temperature sodium cell, the material allows a fast charge/discharge of sodium ions, with impressive reversible capacity, rate capability and stability metrics.",2
Reactions of hexadehydro-Diels-Alder benzynes with structurally complex multifunctional natural products.,"An important question in organic chemistry concerns the extent to which benzynes-one of the classical reactive intermediates in organic chemistry-can react in discriminating fashion with trapping reagents. In particular, whether these species can react selectively with substrates containing multiple functional groups and possible sites of reactivity has remained unanswered. Natural products comprise a palette of multifunctional compounds with which to address this question. Here, we show that benzynes produced by the hexadehydro-Diels-Alder (HDDA) reaction react with many secondary metabolites with a preference for one among several pathways. Examples demonstrating such selectivity include reactions with: phenolics, through dearomatizing ortho-substitution; alkaloids, through Hofmann-type elimination; tropolone and furan, through cycloaddition; and alkaloids, through three-component fragmentation-coupling reactions. We also demonstrate that the cinchona alkaloids quinidine and quinine give rise to products (some in as few as three steps) that enable subsequent and rapid access to structurally diverse polyheterocyclic compounds. The results show that benzynes are quite discriminating in their reactivity-a trait perhaps not broadly enough appreciated.",2
Activation and discovery of earth-abundant metal catalysts using sodium tert-butoxide.,"First-row, earth-abundant metals offer an inexpensive and sustainable alternative to precious-metal catalysts. As such, iron and cobalt catalysts have garnered interest as replacements for alkene and alkyne hydrofunctionalization reactions. However, these have required the use of air- and moisture-sensitive catalysts and reagents, limiting both adoption by the non-expert as well as applicability, particularly in industrial settings. Here, we report a simple method for the use of earth-abundant metal catalysts by general activation with sodium tert-butoxide. Using only robust air- and moisture-stable reagents and pre-catalysts, both known and, significantly, novel catalytic activities have been successfully achieved, covering hydrosilylation, hydroboration, hydrovinylation, hydrogenation and [2pi+2pi] alkene cycloaddition. This activation method allows for the easy use of earth-abundant metals, including iron, cobalt, nickel and manganese, and represents a generic platform for the discovery and application of non-precious metal catalysis.",2
Actinide covalency measured by pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy.,"Our knowledge of actinide chemical bonds lags far behind our understanding of the bonding regimes of any other series of elements. This is a major issue given the technological as well as fundamental importance of f-block elements. Some key chemical differences between actinides and lanthanides-and between different actinides-can be ascribed to minor differences in covalency, that is, the degree to which electrons are shared between the f-block element and coordinated ligands. Yet there are almost no direct measures of such covalency for actinides. Here we report the first pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of actinide compounds. We apply the hyperfine sublevel correlation technique to quantify the electron-spin density at ligand nuclei (via the weak hyperfine interactions) in molecular thorium(III) and uranium(III) species and therefore the extent of covalency. Such information will be important in developing our understanding of the chemical bonding, and therefore the reactivity, of actinides.",2
Asymmetric silver-catalysed intermolecular bromotrifluoromethoxylation of alkenes with a new trifluoromethoxylation reagent.,"Fluorinated organic compounds are becoming increasingly important in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and materials science. The introduction of trifluoromethoxy groups into new drugs and agrochemicals has attracted much attention due to their strongly electron-withdrawing nature and high lipophilicity. However, synthesis of trifluoromethoxylated organic molecules is difficult owing to the decomposition of trifluoromethoxide anion and beta-fluoride elimination from transition-metal-trifluoromethoxide complexes, and no catalytic enantioselective trifluoromethoxylation reaction has been reported until now. Here, we present an example of an asymmetric silver-catalysed intermolecular bromotrifluoromethoxylation of alkenes with trifluoromethyl arylsulfonate (TFMS) as a new trifluoromethoxylation reagent. Compared to other trifluoromethoxylation reagents, TFMS is easily prepared and thermally stable with good reactivity. In addition, this reaction is operationally simple, scalable and proceeds under mild reaction conditions. Furthermore, broad scope and good functional group compatibility has been demonstrated by application of the method to the bromotrifluoromethoxylation of double bonds in natural products and natural product derivatives.",2
Atomically precise organomimetic cluster nanomolecules assembled via perfluoroaryl-thiol SNAr chemistry.,"The majority of biomolecules are intrinsically atomically precise, an important characteristic that enables rational engineering of their recognition and binding properties. However, imparting a similar precision to hybrid nanoparticles has been challenging because of the inherent limitations of existing chemical methods and building blocks. Here we report a new approach to form atomically precise and highly tunable hybrid nanomolecules with well-defined three-dimensionality. Perfunctionalization of atomically precise clusters with pentafluoroaryl-terminated linkers produces size-tunable rigid cluster nanomolecules. These species are amenable to facile modification with a variety of thiol-containing molecules and macromolecules. Assembly proceeds at room temperature within hours under mild conditions, and the resulting nanomolecules exhibit high stabilities because of their full covalency. We further demonstrate how these nanomolecules grafted with saccharides can exhibit dramatically improved binding affinity towards a protein. Ultimately, the developed strategy allows the rapid generation of precise molecular assemblies to investigate multivalent interactions.",2
Controlled membrane translocation provides a mechanism for signal transduction and amplification.,"Transmission and amplification of chemical signals across lipid bilayer membranes is of profound significance in many biological processes, from the development of multicellular organisms to information processing in the nervous system. In biology, membrane-spanning proteins are responsible for the transmission of chemical signals across membranes, and signal transduction is often associated with an amplified signalling cascade. The ability to reproduce such processes in artificial systems has potential applications in sensing, controlled drug delivery and communication between compartments in tissue-like constructs of synthetic vesicles. Here we describe a mechanism for transmitting a chemical signal across a membrane based on the controlled translocation of a synthetic molecular transducer from one side of a lipid bilayer membrane to the other. The controlled molecular motion has been coupled to the activation of a catalyst on the inside of a vesicle, which leads to a signal-amplification process analogous to the biological counterpart.",2
Photoredox activation of carbon dioxide for amino acid synthesis in continuous flow.,"Although carbon dioxide (CO2) is highly abundant, its low reactivity has limited its use in chemical synthesis. In particular, methods for carbon-carbon bond formation generally rely on two-electron mechanisms for CO2 activation and require highly activated reaction partners. Alternatively, radical pathways accessed via photoredox catalysis could provide new reactivity under milder conditions. Here we demonstrate the direct coupling of CO2 and amines via the single-electron reduction of CO2 for the photoredox-catalysed continuous flow synthesis of alpha-amino acids. By leveraging the advantages of utilizing gases and photochemistry in flow, a commercially available organic photoredox catalyst effects the selective alpha-carboxylation of amines that bear various functional groups and heterocycles. The preliminary mechanistic studies support CO2 activation and carbon-carbon bond formation via single-electron pathways, and we expect that this strategy will inspire new perspectives on using this feedstock chemical in organic synthesis.",2
Control over differentiation of a metastable supramolecular assembly in one and two dimensions.,"Molecular self-assembly under kinetic control is expected to yield nanostructures that are inaccessible through the spontaneous thermodynamic process. Moreover, time-dependent evolution, which is reminiscent of biomolecular systems, may occur under such out-of-equilibrium conditions, allowing the synthesis of supramolecular assemblies with enhanced complexities. Here we report on the capacity of a metastable porphyrin supramolecular assembly to differentiate into nanofibre and nanosheet structures. Mechanistic studies of the relationship between the molecular design and pathway complexity in the self-assembly unveiled the energy landscape that governs the unique kinetic behaviour. Based on this understanding, we could control the differentiation phenomena and achieve both one- and two-dimensional living supramolecular polymerization using an identical monomer. Furthermore, we found that the obtained nanostructures are electronically distinct, which illustrates the pathway-dependent material properties.",2
G-quadruplex organic frameworks.,"Two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks often pi stack into crystalline solids that allow precise spatial positioning of molecular building blocks. Inspired by the hydrogen-bonded G-quadruplexes found frequently in guanine-rich DNA, here we show that this structural motif can be exploited to guide the self-assembly of naphthalene diimide and perylene diimide electron acceptors end-capped with two guanine electron donors into crystalline G-quadruplex-based organic frameworks, wherein the electron donors and acceptors form ordered, segregated pi-stacked arrays. Time-resolved optical and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies show that photogenerated holes and electrons in the frameworks have long lifetimes and display recombination kinetics typical of dissociated charge carriers. Moreover, the reduced acceptors form polarons in which the electron is shared over several molecules. The G-quadruplex frameworks also demonstrate potential as cathode materials in Li-ion batteries because of the favourable electron- and Li-ion-transporting capacity provided by the ordered rylene diimide arrays and G-quadruplex structures, respectively.",2
Organocatalytic stereoselective [8+2] and [6+4] cycloadditions.,"Cycloadditions that involve more than six pi electrons are termed higher-order cycloadditions and are an excellent tool for solving complex synthetic challenges, as they provide direct access to polycyclic scaffolds that contain medium-sized rings. They have interesting synthetic potential for the discovery of new bioactive molecules and in natural product synthesis. It is peculiar that stereocontrolled [8+2] and [6+4] cycloadditions have been largely neglected for the past 50 years. Here we demonstrate a cross-dienamine activation of 2-cyclopentenone and the unprecedented endocyclic linear-dienamine activation of 2-cyclohexenones and 2-cycloheptenones. These dienamine intermediates undergo aminocatalytic stereoselective [8+2], [6+4] and formal [4+2] cycloadditions with various heptafulvenes. The periselectivities of the cycloadditions are controlled based on the ring size of the 2-cycloalkenones and the substitution patterns of the heptafulvenes. The chiral products obtained undergo various chemical and photochemical single-step transformations that give access to other classes of all-carbon polycyclic scaffolds.",2
A stable compound of helium and sodium at high pressure.,"Helium is generally understood to be chemically inert and this is due to its extremely stable closed-shell electronic configuration, zero electron affinity and an unsurpassed ionization potential. It is not known to form thermodynamically stable compounds, except a few inclusion compounds. Here, using the ab initio evolutionary algorithm USPEX and subsequent high-pressure synthesis in a diamond anvil cell, we report the discovery of a thermodynamically stable compound of helium and sodium, Na2He, which has a fluorite-type structure and is stable at pressures >113 GPa. We show that the presence of He atoms causes strong electron localization and makes this material insulating. This phase is an electride, with electron pairs localized in interstices, forming eight-centre two-electron bonds within empty Na8 cubes. We also predict the existence of Na2HeO with a similar structure at pressures above 15 GPa.",2
Engineering genetic circuit interactions within and between synthetic minimal cells.,"Genetic circuits and reaction cascades are of great importance for synthetic biology, biochemistry and bioengineering. An open question is how to maximize the modularity of their design to enable the integration of different reaction networks and to optimize their scalability and flexibility. One option is encapsulation within liposomes, which enables chemical reactions to proceed in well-isolated environments. Here we adapt liposome encapsulation to enable the modular, controlled compartmentalization of genetic circuits and cascades. We demonstrate that it is possible to engineer genetic circuit-containing synthetic minimal cells (synells) to contain multiple-part genetic cascades, and that these cascades can be controlled by external signals as well as inter-liposomal communication without crosstalk. We also show that liposomes that contain different cascades can be fused in a controlled way so that the products of incompatible reactions can be brought together. Synells thus enable a more modular creation of synthetic biology cascades, an essential step towards their ultimate programmability.",2
Self-propelled supramolecular nanomotors with temperature-responsive speed regulation.,"Self-propelled catalytic micro- and nanomotors have been the subject of intense study over the past few years, but it remains a continuing challenge to build in an effective speed-regulation mechanism. Movement of these motors is generally fully dependent on the concentration of accessible fuel, with propulsive movement only ceasing when the fuel consumption is complete. Here we report a demonstration of control over the movement of self-assembled stomatocyte nanomotors via a molecularly built, stimulus-responsive regulatory mechanism. A temperature-sensitive polymer brush is chemically grown onto the nanomotor, whereby the opening of the stomatocytes is enlarged or narrowed on temperature change, which thus controls the access of hydrogen peroxide fuel and, in turn, regulates movement. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first nanosized chemically driven motor for which motion can be reversibly controlled by a thermally responsive valve/brake. We envision that such artificial responsive nanosystems could have potential applications in controllable cargo transportation.",2
A monodisperse transmembrane alpha-helical peptide barrel.,"The fabrication of monodisperse transmembrane barrels formed from short synthetic peptides has not been demonstrated previously. This is in part because of the complexity of the interactions between peptides and lipids within the hydrophobic environment of a membrane. Here we report the formation of a transmembrane pore through the self-assembly of 35 amino acid alpha-helical peptides. The design of the peptides is based on the C-terminal D4 domain of the Escherichia coli polysaccharide transporter Wza. By using single-channel current recording, we define discrete assembly intermediates and show that the pore is most probably a helix barrel that contains eight D4 peptides arranged in parallel. We also show that the peptide pore is functional and capable of conducting ions and binding blockers. Such alpha-helix barrels engineered from peptides could find applications in nanopore technologies such as single-molecule sensing and nucleic-acid sequencing.",2
Activating lattice oxygen redox reactions in metal oxides to catalyse oxygen evolution.,"Understanding how materials that catalyse the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) function is essential for the development of efficient energy-storage technologies. The traditional understanding of the OER mechanism on metal oxides involves four concerted proton-electron transfer steps on metal-ion centres at their surface and product oxygen molecules derived from water. Here, using in situ (18)O isotope labelling mass spectrometry, we provide direct experimental evidence that the O2 generated during the OER on some highly active oxides can come from lattice oxygen. The oxides capable of lattice-oxygen oxidation also exhibit pH-dependent OER activity on the reversible hydrogen electrode scale, indicating non-concerted proton-electron transfers in the OER mechanism. Based on our experimental data and density functional theory calculations, we discuss mechanisms that are fundamentally different from the conventional scheme and show that increasing the covalency of metal-oxygen bonds is critical to trigger lattice-oxygen oxidation and enable non-concerted proton-electron transfers during OER.",2
Tuning underwater adhesion with cation-pi interactions.,"Cation-pi interactions drive the self-assembly and cohesion of many biological molecules, including the adhesion proteins of several marine organisms. Although the origin of cation-pi bonds in isolated pairs has been extensively studied, the energetics of cation-pi-driven self-assembly in molecular films remains uncharted. Here we use nanoscale force measurements in combination with solid-state NMR spectroscopy to show that the cohesive properties of simple aromatic- and lysine-rich peptides rival those of the strong reversible intermolecular cohesion exhibited by adhesion proteins of marine mussel. In particular, we show that peptides incorporating the amino acid phenylalanine, a functional group that is conspicuously sparing in the sequences of mussel proteins, exhibit reversible adhesion interactions significantly exceeding that of analogous mussel-mimetic peptides. More broadly, we demonstrate that interfacial confinement fundamentally alters the energetics of cation-pi-mediated assembly: an insight that should prove relevant for diverse areas, which range from rationalizing biological assembly to engineering peptide-based biomaterials.",2
Computational design of self-assembling cyclic protein homo-oligomers.,"Self-assembling cyclic protein homo-oligomers play important roles in biology, and the ability to generate custom homo-oligomeric structures could enable new approaches to probe biological function. Here we report a general approach to design cyclic homo-oligomers that employs a new residue-pair-transform method to assess the designability of a protein-protein interface. This method is sufficiently rapid to enable the systematic enumeration of cyclically docked arrangements of a monomer followed by sequence design of the newly formed interfaces. We use this method to design interfaces onto idealized repeat proteins that direct their assembly into complexes that possess cyclic symmetry. Of 96 designs that were characterized experimentally, 21 were found to form stable monodisperse homo-oligomers in solution, and 15 (four homodimers, six homotrimers, six homotetramers and one homopentamer) had solution small-angle X-ray scattering data consistent with the design models. X-ray crystal structures were obtained for five of the designs and each is very close to their corresponding computational model.",2
Surfactant-free single-layer graphene in water.,"Dispersing graphite in water to obtain true (single-layer) graphene in bulk quantity in a liquid has been an unreachable goal for materials scientists in the past decade. Similarly, a diagnostic tool to identify solubilized graphene in situ has been long awaited. Here we show that homogeneous stable dispersions of single-layer graphene (SLG) in water can be obtained by mixing graphenide (negatively charged graphene) solutions in tetrahydrofuran with degassed water and evaporating the organic solvent. In situ Raman spectroscopy of these aqueous dispersions shows all the expected characteristics of SLG. Transmission electron and atomic force microscopies on deposits confirm the single-layer character. The resulting additive-free stable water dispersions contain 400 m(2) l(-1) of developed graphene surface. Films prepared from these dispersions exhibit a conductivity of up to 32 kS m(-1).",2
A viscous solvent enables information transfer from gene-length nucleic acids in a model prebiotic replication cycle.,"Many hypotheses concerning the nature of early life assume that genetic information was once transferred through the template-directed synthesis of RNA, before the emergence of coded enzymes. However, attempts to demonstrate enzyme-free, template-directed synthesis of nucleic acids have been limited by 'strand inhibition', whereby transferring information from a template strand in the presence of its complementary strand is inhibited by the stability of the template duplex. Here, we use solvent viscosity to circumvent strand inhibition, demonstrating information transfer from a gene-length template (>300 nt) within a longer (545 bp or 3 kb) duplex. These results suggest that viscous environments on the prebiotic Earth, generated periodically by water evaporation, could have facilitated nucleic acid replication-particularly of long, structured sequences such as ribozymes. Our approach works with DNA and RNA, suggesting that viscosity-mediated replication is possible for a range of genetic polymers, perhaps even for informational polymers that may have preceded RNA.",2
A prebiotically plausible synthesis of pyrimidine beta-ribonucleosides and their phosphate derivatives involving photoanomerization.,"Previous research has identified ribose aminooxazoline as a potential intermediate in the prebiotic synthesis of the pyrimidine nucleotides with remarkable properties. It crystallizes spontaneously from reaction mixtures, with an enhanced enantiomeric excess if initially enantioenriched, which suggests that reservoirs of this compound might have accumulated on the early Earth in an optically pure form. Ribose aminooxazoline can be converted efficiently into alpha-ribocytidine by way of 2,2'-anhydroribocytidine, although anomerization to beta-ribocytidine by ultraviolet irradiation is extremely inefficient. Our previous work demonstrated the synthesis of pyrimidine beta-ribonucleotides, but at the cost of ignoring ribose aminooxazoline, using arabinose aminooxazoline instead. Here we describe a long-sought route through ribose aminooxazoline to the pyrimidine beta-ribonucleosides and their phosphate derivatives that involves an extraordinarily efficient photoanomerization of alpha-2-thioribocytidine. In addition to the canonical nucleosides, our synthesis accesses beta-2-thioribouridine, a modified nucleoside found in transfer RNA that enables both faster and more-accurate nucleic acid template-copying chemistry.",2
Remote C-H alkylation and C-C bond cleavage enabled by an in situ generated palladacycle.,"The direct and selective functionalization of C-H bonds of arenes is one of the most challenging yet valuable aims in organic synthesis. Despite notable recent achievements, a pre-installed directing group proved to be essential in most of the methodologies reported so far. In this context, the use of a transient directing group that can be generated in situ has attracted attention and demonstrated the great potential of this strategy. Here we report the use of an in situ generated palladacycle to accomplish remote-selective C-H alkylation reactions of arenes. Following the C-H functionalization event, the alkylated aryl ring undergoes a formal migration to provide diversely substituted benzofuran and indole scaffolds. Computational studies revealed that a palladium(IV) intermediate is not involved in the alkylation step. The aryl migration was found to proceed through a sequential C-C bond cleavage, insertion and beta-hydride-elimination process. The increasing steric bulk that builds up during the C-H functionalization step drives the unusual C-C bond cleavage in a non-strained system.",2
An iron-catalysed C-C bond-forming spirocyclization cascade providing sustainable access to new 3D heterocyclic frameworks.,"Heterocyclic architectures offer powerful creative possibilities to a range of chemistry end-users. This is particularly true of heterocycles containing a high proportion of sp(3)-carbon atoms, which confer precise spatial definition upon chemical probes, drug substances, chiral monomers and the like. Nonetheless, simple catalytic routes to new heterocyclic cores are infrequently reported, and methods making use of biomass-accessible starting materials are also rare. Here, we demonstrate a new method allowing rapid entry to spirocyclic bis-heterocycles, in which inexpensive iron(III) catalysts mediate a highly stereoselective C-C bond-forming cyclization cascade reaction using (2-halo)aryl ethers and amines constructed using feedstock chemicals readily available from plant sources. Fe(acac)3 mediates the deiodinative cyclization of (2-halo)aryloxy furfuranyl ethers, followed by capture of the intermediate metal species by Grignard reagents, to deliver spirocycles containing two asymmetric centres. The reactions offer potential entry to key structural motifs present in bioactive natural products.",2
Prebiotic synthesis of phosphoenol pyruvate by alpha-phosphorylation-controlled triose glycolysis.,"Phosphoenol pyruvate is the highest-energy phosphate found in living organisms and is one of the most versatile molecules in metabolism. Consequently, it is an essential intermediate in a wide variety of biochemical pathways, including carbon fixation, the shikimate pathway, substrate-level phosphorylation, gluconeogenesis and glycolysis. Triose glycolysis (generation of ATP from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate via phosphoenol pyruvate) is among the most central and highly conserved pathways in metabolism. Here, we demonstrate the efficient and robust synthesis of phosphoenol pyruvate from prebiotic nucleotide precursors, glycolaldehyde and glyceraldehyde. Furthermore, phosphoenol pyruvate is derived within an alpha-phosphorylation controlled reaction network that gives access to glyceric acid 2-phosphate, glyceric acid 3-phosphate, phosphoserine and pyruvate. Our results demonstrate that the key components of a core metabolic pathway central to energy transduction and amino acid, sugar, nucleotide and lipid biosyntheses can be reconstituted in high yield under mild, prebiotically plausible conditions.",2
Seven enzymes create extraordinary molecular complexity in an uncultivated bacterium.,"Uncultivated bacteria represent a massive resource of new enzymes and bioactive metabolites, but such bacteria remain functionally enigmatic. Polytheonamides are potent peptide cytotoxins produced by uncultivated bacteria that exist as symbionts in a marine sponge. Outside glycobiology, polytheonamides represent the most heavily post-translationally modified biomolecules that are derived from amino acids. The biosynthesis of polytheonamides involves up to 50 site-specific modifications to create a membrane-spanning beta-helical structure. Here, we provide functional evidence that only seven enzymes are necessary for this process. They iteratively catalyse epimerization, methylation and hydroxylation of diverse amino acids. To reconstitute C-methylation, we employed the rarely used heterologous host Rhizobium leguminosarum to invoke the activities of two cobalamin-dependent C-methyltransferases. We observed 44 of the modifications to systematically unravel the biosynthesis of one of the most densely modified and metabolically obscure ribosome-derived molecules found in nature.",2
Aldehydes as alkyl carbanion equivalents for additions to carbonyl compounds.,"Nucleophilic addition reactions of organometallic reagents to carbonyl compounds for carbon-carbon bond construction have played a pivotal role in modern chemistry. However, this reaction's reliance on petroleum-derived chemical feedstocks and a stoichiometric quantity of metal have prompted the development of many carbanion equivalents and catalytic metal alternatives. Here, we show that naturally occurring carbonyls can be used as latent alkyl carbanion equivalents for additions to carbonyl compounds, via reductive polarity reversal. Such 'umpolung' reactivity is facilitated by a ruthenium catalyst and diphosphine ligand under mild conditions, delivering synthetically valuable secondary and tertiary alcohols in up to 98% yield. The unique chemoselectivity exhibited by carbonyl-derived carbanion equivalents is demonstrated by their tolerance to protic reaction media and good functional group compatibility. Enantioenriched tertiary alcohols can also be accessed with the aid of chiral ligands, albeit with moderate stereocontrol. Such carbonyl-derived carbanion equivalents are anticipated to find broad utility in chemical bond formation.",2
Simple peptides derived from the ribosomal core potentiate RNA polymerase ribozyme function.,"The emergence of functional interactions between nucleic acids and polypeptides was a key transition in the origin of life and remains at the heart of all biology. However, how and why simple non-coded peptides could have become critical for RNA function is unclear. Here, we show that putative ancient peptide segments from the cores of both ribosomal subunits enhance RNA polymerase ribozyme (RPR) function, as do derived homopolymeric peptides comprising lysine or the non-proteinogenic lysine analogues ornithine or, to a lesser extent, diaminobutyric acid, irrespective of chirality or chiral purity. Lysine decapeptides enhance RPR function by promoting holoenzyme assembly through primer-template docking, accelerate RPR evolution, and allow RPR-catalysed RNA synthesis at near physiological (>/=1 mM) Mg(2+) concentrations, enabling templated RNA synthesis within membranous protocells. Our results outline how compositionally simple, mixed-chirality peptides may have augmented the functional potential of early RNAs and promoted the emergence of the first protocells.",2
Dynamics of the triplet-pair state reveals the likely coexistence of coherent and incoherent singlet fission in crystalline hexacene.,"The absorption of a photon usually creates a singlet exciton (S1) in molecular systems, but in some cases S1 may split into two triplets (2xT1) in a process called singlet fission. Singlet fission is believed to proceed through the correlated triplet-pair (1)(TT) state. Here, we probe the (1)(TT) state in crystalline hexacene using time-resolved photoemission and transient absorption spectroscopies. We find a distinctive (1)(TT) state, which decays to 2xT1 with a time constant of 270 fs. However, the decay of S1 and the formation of (1)(TT) occur on different timescales of 180 fs and <50 fs, respectively. Theoretical analysis suggests that, in addition to an incoherent S1-->(1)(TT) rate process responsible for the 180 fs timescale, S1 may couple coherently to a vibronically excited (1)(TT) on ultrafast timescales (<50 fs). The coexistence of coherent and incoherent singlet fission may also reconcile different experimental observations in other acenes.",2
Real-time molecular scale observation of crystal formation.,"How molecules in solution form crystal nuclei, which then grow into large crystals, is a poorly understood phenomenon. The classical mechanism of homogeneous crystal nucleation proceeds via the spontaneous random aggregation of species from liquid or solution. However, a non-classical mechanism suggests the formation of an amorphous dense phase that reorders to form stable crystal nuclei. So far it has remained an experimental challenge to observe the formation of crystal nuclei from five to thirty molecules. Here, using polyoxometallates, we show that the formation of small crystal nuclei is observable by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. We observe both classical and non-classical nucleation processes, depending on the identity of the cation present. The experiments verify theoretical studies that suggest non-classical nucleation is the lower of the two energy pathways. The arrangement in just a seven-molecule proto-crystal matches the order found by X-ray diffraction of a single bulk crystal, which demonstrates that the same structure was formed in each case.",2
Entomopathogenic bacteria use multiple mechanisms for bioactive peptide library design.,"The production of natural product compound libraries has been observed in nature for different organisms such as bacteria, fungi and plants; however, little is known about the mechanisms generating such chemically diverse libraries. Here we report mechanisms leading to the biosynthesis of the chemically diverse rhabdopeptide/xenortide peptides (RXPs). They are exclusively present in entomopathogenic bacteria of the genera Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus that live in symbiosis with nematodes delivering them to insect prey, which is killed and utilized for nutrition by both nematodes and bacteria. Chemical diversity of the biologically active RXPs results from a combination of iterative and flexible use of monomodular nonribosomal peptide synthetases including substrate promiscuity, enzyme cross-talk and enzyme stoichiometry as shown by in vivo and in vitro experiments. Together, this highlights several of nature's methods for diversification, or evolution, of natural products and sheds light on the biosynthesis of the bioactive RXPs.",2
Sequence-controlled methacrylic multiblock copolymers via sulfur-free RAFT emulsion polymerization.,"Translating the precise monomer sequence control achieved in nature over macromolecular structure (for example, DNA) to whole synthetic systems has been limited due to the lack of efficient synthetic methodologies. So far, chemists have only been able to synthesize monomer sequence-controlled macromolecules by means of complex, time-consuming and iterative chemical strategies such as solid-state Merrifield-type approaches or molecularly dissolved solution-phase systems. Here, we report a rapid and quantitative synthesis of sequence-controlled multiblock polymers in discrete stable nanoscale compartments via an emulsion polymerization approach in which a vinyl-terminated macromolecule is used as an efficient chain-transfer agent. This approach is environmentally friendly, fully translatable to industry and thus represents a significant advance in the development of complex macromolecule synthesis, where a high level of molecular precision or monomer sequence control confers potential for molecular targeting, recognition and biocatalysis, as well as molecular information storage.",2
Adsorbate-mediated strong metal-support interactions in oxide-supported Rh catalysts.,"The optimization of supported metal catalysts predominantly focuses on engineering the metal site, for which physical insights based on extensive theoretical and experimental contributions have enabled the rational design of active sites. Although it is well known that supports can influence the catalytic properties of metals, insights into how metal-support interactions can be exploited to optimize metal active-site properties are lacking. Here we utilize in situ spectroscopy and microscopy to identify and characterize a support effect in oxide-supported heterogeneous Rh catalysts. This effect is characterized by strongly bound adsorbates (HCOx) on reducible oxide supports (TiO2 and Nb2O5) that induce oxygen-vacancy formation in the support and cause HCOx-functionalized encapsulation of Rh nanoparticles by the support. The encapsulation layer is permeable to reactants, stable under the reaction conditions and strongly influences the catalytic properties of Rh, which enables rational and dynamic tuning of CO2-reduction selectivity.",2
A synthetic redox biofilm made from metalloprotein-prion domain chimera nanowires.,"Engineering bioelectronic components and set-ups that mimic natural systems is extremely challenging. Here we report the design of a protein-only redox film inspired by the architecture of bacterial electroactive biofilms. The nanowire scaffold is formed using a chimeric protein that results from the attachment of a prion domain to a rubredoxin (Rd) that acts as an electron carrier. The prion domain self-assembles into stable fibres and provides a suitable arrangement of redox metal centres in Rd to permit electron transport. This results in highly organized films, able to transport electrons over several micrometres through a network of bionanowires. We demonstrate that our bionanowires can be used as electron-transfer mediators to build a bioelectrode for the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction by laccase. This approach opens opportunities for the engineering of protein-only electron mediators (with tunable redox potentials and optimized interactions with enzymes) and applications in the field of protein-only bioelectrodes.",2
By-design enantioselective self-amplification based on non-covalent product-catalyst interactions.,"The synthesis of enantiomerically pure compounds is of great importance in pharmaceuticals, fragrances and biological applications, and functions as a key to many processes in nature. Asymmetric catalysis using enantiomerically pure catalysts represents an efficient synthetic method to achieve this goal. The enantiomeric excess of the reaction product correlates with the enantiomeric purity of the catalysts, except for nonlinear behaviour, therefore the use of stereochemically flexible catalysts seems to complicate the control of stereoselectivity. Self-amplifying catalytic reactions are attractive, but a general rational design is highly challenging. Here we show that product interaction with chiral recognition sites attached to structurally flexible phoshoramidite-type catalysts can sense the chirality and induce enantioselectivity in the catalyst. Structural flexibility along with sensing of the chirality of the product molecules results in a rapid increase of enantioselectivity of the dynamic catalysts (Deltae.e. of up to 76%) and a shift out of equilibrium. In contrast to stereodynamic catalysts controlled with cleavable chiral auxiliaries, the enantioselectivity does not decrease.",2
Ballbot-type motion of N-heterocyclic carbenes on gold surfaces.,"Recently, N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) were introduced as alternative anchors for surface modifications and so offered many attractive features, which might render them superior to thiol-based systems. However, little effort has been made to investigate the self-organization process of NHCs on surfaces, an important aspect for the formation of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), which requires molecular mobility. Based on investigations with scanning tunnelling microscopy and first-principles calculations, we provide an understanding of the microscopic mechanism behind the high mobility observed for NHCs. These NHCs extract a gold atom from the surface, which leads to the formation of an NHC-gold adatom complex that displays a high surface mobility by a ballbot-type motion. Together with their high desorption barrier this enables the formation of ordered and strongly bound SAMs. In addition, this mechanism allows a complementary surface-assisted synthesis of dimeric and hitherto unknown trimeric NHC gold complexes on the surface.",2
Hydrolytic cleavage of both CS2 carbon-sulfur bonds by multinuclear Pd(II) complexes at room temperature.,"Developing homogeneous catalysts that convert CS2 and COS pollutants into environmentally benign products is important for both fundamental catalytic research and applied environmental science. Here we report a series of air-stable dimeric Pd complexes that mediate the facile hydrolytic cleavage of both CS2 carbon-sulfur bonds at 25 degrees C to produce CO2 and trimeric Pd complexes. Oxidation of the trimeric complexes with HNO3 regenerates the dimeric starting complexes with the release of SO2 and NO2. Isotopic labelling confirms that the carbon and oxygen atoms of CO2 originate from CS2 and H2O, respectively, and reaction intermediates were observed by gas-phase and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, as well as by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. We also propose a plausible mechanistic scenario based on the experimentally observed intermediates. The mechanism involves intramolecular attack by a nucleophilic Pd-OH moiety on the carbon atom of coordinated micro-OCS2, which on deprotonation cleaves one C-S bond and simultaneously forms a C-O bond. Coupled C-S cleavage and CO2 release to yield [(bpy)3Pd3(micro3-S)2](NO3)2 (bpy, 2,2'-bipyridine) provides the thermodynamic driving force for the reaction.",2
Unexpected mechanochemical complexity in the mechanistic scenarios of disulfide bond reduction in alkaline solution.,"The reduction of disulfides has a broad importance in chemistry, biochemistry and materials science, particularly those methods that use mechanochemical activation. Here we show, using isotensional simulations, that strikingly different mechanisms govern disulfide cleavage depending on the external force. Desolvation and resolvation processes are found to be crucial, as they have a direct impact on activation free energies. The preferred pathway at moderate forces, a bimolecular SN2 attack of OH(-) at sulfur, competes with unimolecular C-S bond rupture at about 2 nN, and the latter even becomes barrierless at greater applied forces. Moreover, our study unveils a surprisingly rich reactivity scenario that also includes the transformation of concerted SN2 reactions into pure bond-breaking processes at specific forces. Given that these forces are easily reached in experiments, these insights will fundamentally change our understanding of mechanochemical activation in general, which is now expected to be considerably more intricate than previously thought.",2
Enantioselective amine alpha-functionalization via palladium-catalysed C-H arylation of thioamides.,"Saturated aza-heterocycles are highly privileged building blocks that are commonly encountered in bioactive compounds and approved therapeutic agents. These N-heterocycles are also incorporated as chiral auxiliaries and ligands in asymmetric synthesis. As such, the development of methods to functionalize the alpha-methylene C-H bonds of these systems enantioselectively is of great importance, especially in drug discovery. Currently, enantioselective lithiation with (-)-sparteine followed by Pd(0) catalysed cross-coupling to prepare alpha-arylated amines is largely limited to pyrrolidines. Here we report a Pd(II)-catalysed enantioselective alpha-C-H coupling of a wide range of amines, which include ethyl amines, azetidines, pyrrolidines, piperidines, azepanes, indolines and tetrahydroisoquinolines. Chiral phosphoric acids are demonstrated as effective anionic ligands for the enantioselective coupling of methylene C-H bonds with aryl boronic acids. This catalytic reaction not only affords high enantioselectivities, but also provides exclusive regioselectivity in the presence of two methylene groups in different steric environments.",2
Predatory behaviour in synthetic protocell communities.,"Recent progress in the chemical construction of colloidal objects comprising integrated biomimetic functions is paving the way towards rudimentary forms of artificial cell-like entities (protocells). Although several new types of protocells are currently available, the design of synthetic protocell communities and investigation of their collective behaviour has received little attention. Here we demonstrate an artificial form of predatory behaviour in a community of protease-containing coacervate microdroplets and protein-polymer microcapsules (proteinosomes) that interact via electrostatic binding. The coacervate microdroplets act as killer protocells for the obliteration of the target proteinosome population by protease-induced lysis of the protein-polymer membrane. As a consequence, the proteinosome payload (dextran, single-stranded DNA, platinum nanoparticles) is trafficked into the attached coacervate microdroplets, which are then released as functionally modified killer protocells capable of rekilling. Our results highlight opportunities for the development of interacting artificial protocell communities, and provide a strategy for inducing collective behaviour in soft matter microcompartmentalized systems and synthetic protocell consortia.",2
Photoswitching of glass transition temperatures of azobenzene-containing polymers induces reversible solid-to-liquid transitions.,"The development of polymers with switchable glass transition temperatures (Tg) can address scientific challenges such as the healing of cracks in high-Tg polymers and the processing of hard polymers at room temperature without using plasticizing solvents. Here, we demonstrate that light can switch the Tg of azobenzene-containing polymers (azopolymers) and induce reversible solid-to-liquid transitions of the polymers. The azobenzene groups in the polymers exhibit reversible cis-trans photoisomerization abilities. Trans azopolymers are solids with Tg above room temperature, whereas cis azopolymers are liquids with Tg below room temperature. Because of the photoinduced solid-to-liquid transitions of these polymers, light can reduce the surface roughness of azopolymer films by almost 600%, repeatedly heal cracks in azopolymers, and control the adhesion of azopolymers for transfer printing. The photoswitching of Tg provides a new strategy for designing healable polymers with high Tg and allows for control over the mechanical properties of polymers with high spatiotemporal resolution.",2
Dynamic control of chirality and self-assembly of double-stranded helicates with light.,"Helicity switching in biological and artificial systems is a fundamental process that allows for the dynamic control of structures and their functions. In contrast to chemical approaches to responsive behaviour in helicates, the use of light as an external stimulus offers unique opportunities to invert the chirality of helical structures in a non-invasive manner with high spatiotemporal precision. Here, we report that unidirectional rotary motors with connecting oligobipyridyl ligands, which can dynamically change their chirality upon irradiation, assemble into metal helicates that are responsive to light. The motor function controls the self-assembly process as well as the helical chirality, allowing switching between oligomers and double-stranded helicates with distinct handedness. The unidirectionality of the light-induced motion governs the sequence of programmable steps, enabling the highly regulated self-assembly of fully responsive helical structures. This discovery paves the way for the future development of new chirality-dependent photoresponsive systems including smart materials, enantioselective catalysts and light-driven molecular machines.",2
Why copper is preferred over iron for oxygen activation and reduction in haem-copper oxidases.,"Haem-copper oxidase (HCO) catalyses the natural reduction of oxygen to water using a haem-copper centre. Despite decades of research on HCOs, the role of non-haem metal and the reason for nature's choice of copper over other metals such as iron remains unclear. Here, we use a biosynthetic model of HCO in myoglobin that selectively binds different non-haem metals to demonstrate 30-fold and 11-fold enhancements in the oxidase activity of Cu- and Fe-bound HCO mimics, respectively, as compared with Zn-bound mimics. Detailed electrochemical, kinetic and vibrational spectroscopic studies, in tandem with theoretical density functional theory calculations, demonstrate that the non-haem metal not only donates electrons to oxygen but also activates it for efficient O-O bond cleavage. Furthermore, the higher redox potential of copper and the enhanced weakening of the O-O bond from the higher electron density in the d orbital of copper are central to its higher oxidase activity over iron. This work resolves a long-standing question in bioenergetics, and renders a chemical-biological basis for the design of future oxygen-reduction catalysts.",2
Ionic solutions of two-dimensional materials.,"Strategies for forming liquid dispersions of nanomaterials typically focus on retarding reaggregation, for example via surface modification, as opposed to promoting the thermodynamically driven dissolution common for molecule-sized species. Here we demonstrate the true dissolution of a wide range of important 2D nanomaterials by forming layered material salts that spontaneously dissolve in polar solvents yielding ionic solutions. The benign dissolution advantageously maintains the morphology of the starting material, is stable against reaggregation and can achieve solutions containing exclusively individualized monolayers. Importantly, the charge on the anionic nanosheet solutes is reversible, enables targeted deposition over large areas via electroplating and can initiate novel self-assembly upon drying. Our findings thus reveal a unique solution-like behaviour for 2D materials that enables their scalable production and controlled manipulation.",2
Direct assembly of multiply oxygenated carbon chains by decarbonylative radical-radical coupling reactions.,"Pentoses and hexoses contain more than three oxygen-bearing stereocentres and are ideal starting materials for the synthesis of multiply oxygenated natural products such as sagittamide D, maitotoxin and hikizimycin. Here we demonstrate new radical-radical homocoupling reactions of sugar derivatives with minimal perturbation of their chiral centres. The radical exchange procedure using Et3B/O2 converted sugar-derived alpha-alkoxyacyl tellurides into alpha-alkoxy radicals via decarbonylation and rapidly dimerized the monomeric radicals. The robustness of this process was demonstrated by a single-step preparation of 12 stereochemically diverse dimers with 6-10 secondary hydroxy groups, including the C5-C10 stereohexad of sagittamide D and the enantiomer of the C51-C60 stereodecad of maitotoxin. Furthermore, the optimally convergent radical-radical cross-coupling reaction achieved a one-step assembly of the protected C1-C11 oxygenated carbon chain of the anthelmintic hikizimycin. These exceptionally efficient homo- and heterocoupling methods together provide a powerful strategy for the expedited total synthesis of contiguously hydroxylated natural products.",2
Terahertz echoes reveal the inhomogeneity of aqueous salt solutions.,"The structural and dynamical properties of water are known to be affected by ion solvation. However, a consistent molecular picture that describes how and to what extent ions perturb the water structure is still missing. Here we apply 2D Raman-terahertz spectroscopy to investigate the impact of monatomic cations on the relaxation dynamics of the hydrogen-bond network in aqueous salt solutions. The inherent ability of multidimensional spectroscopy to deconvolute heterogeneous relaxation dynamics is used to reveal the correlation between the inhomogeneity of the collective intermolecular hydrogen-bond modes and the viscosity of a salt solution. Specifically, we demonstrate that the relaxation time along the echo direction t1 = t2 correlates with the capability of a given cation to 'structure' water. Moreover, we provide evidence that the echo originates from the water-water modes, and not the water-cation modes, which implies that cations can structure the hydrogen-bond network to a certain extent.",2
From helical to planar chirality by on-surface chemistry.,"The chirality of molecular structures is paramount in many phenomena, including enantioselective reactions, molecular self-assembly, biological processes and light or electron-spin polarization. Flat prochiral molecules, which are achiral in the gas phase or solution, can exhibit adsorption-induced chirality when deposited on surfaces. The whole array of such molecular adsorbates is naturally racemic as spontaneous global mirror-symmetry breaking is disfavoured. Here we demonstrate a chemical method of obtaining flat prochiral molecules adsorbed on the solid achiral surface in such a way that a specific adsorbate handedness globally dominates. An optically pure helical precursor is flattened in a cascade of on-surface reactions, which enables chirality transfer. The individual reaction products are identified by high-resolution scanning-probe microscopy. The ultimate formation of globally non-racemic assemblies of flat molecules through stereocontrolled on-surface synthesis allows for chirality to be expressed in as yet unexplored types of organic-inorganic chiral interfaces.",2
Dynamic undocking and the quasi-bound state as tools for drug discovery.,"There is a pressing need for new technologies that improve the efficacy and efficiency of drug discovery. Structure-based methods have contributed towards this goal but they focus on predicting the binding affinity of protein-ligand complexes, which is notoriously difficult. We adopt an alternative approach that evaluates structural, rather than thermodynamic, stability. As bioactive molecules present a static binding mode, we devised dynamic undocking (DUck), a fast computational method to calculate the work necessary to reach a quasi-bound state at which the ligand has just broken the most important native contact with the receptor. This non-equilibrium property is surprisingly effective in virtual screening because true ligands form more-resilient interactions than decoys. Notably, DUck is orthogonal to docking and other 'thermodynamic' methods. We demonstrate the potential of the docking-undocking combination in a fragment screening against the molecular chaperone and oncology target Hsp90, for which we obtain novel chemotypes and a hit rate that approaches 40%.",2
Imaging quantum stereodynamics through Fraunhofer scattering of NO radicals with rare-gas atoms.,"Stereodynamics describes how the vector properties of molecules, such as the directions in which they move and the axes about which they rotate, affect the probabilities (or cross-sections) of specific processes or transitions that occur on collision. The main aspects of stereodynamics in inelastic atom-molecule collisions can often be understood from classical considerations, in which the particles are represented by billiard-ball-like hard objects. In a quantum picture, however, the collision is described in terms of matter waves, which can also scatter into the region of the geometrical shadow of the object and reveal detailed information on the pure quantum-mechanical contribution to the stereodynamics. Here we present measurements of irregular diffraction patterns for NO radicals colliding with rare-gas atoms that can be explained by the analytical Fraunhofer model. They reveal a hitherto overlooked dependence on (or 'propensity rule' for) the magnetic quantum number m of the molecules, and a previously unrecognized type of quantum stereodynamics that has no classical analogue or interpretation.",2
Controlling quantum-beating signals in 2D electronic spectra by packing synthetic heterodimers on single-walled carbon nanotubes.,"In multidimensional spectroscopy, dynamics of coherences between excited states report on the interactions between electronic states and their environment. The prolonged coherence lifetimes revealed through beating signals in the spectra of some systems may result from vibronic coupling between nearly degenerate excited states, and recent observations confirm the existence of such coupling in both model systems and photosynthetic complexes. Understanding the origin of beating signals in the spectra of photosynthetic complexes has been given considerable attention; however, strategies to generate them in artificial systems that would allow us to test the hypotheses in detail are still lacking. Here we demonstrate control over the presence of quantum-beating signals by packing structurally flexible synthetic heterodimers on single-walled carbon nanotubes, and thereby restrict the motions of chromophores. Using two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy, we find that both limiting the relative rotation of chromophores and tuning the energy difference between the two electronic transitions in the dimer to match a vibrational mode of the lower-energy monomer are necessary to enhance the observed quantum-beating signals.",2
Self-assembly of nanoparticles into biomimetic capsid-like nanoshells.,"Nanoscale compartments are one of the foundational elements of living systems. Capsids, carboxysomes, exosomes, vacuoles and other nanoshells easily self-assemble from biomolecules such as lipids or proteins, but not from inorganic nanomaterials because of difficulties with the replication of spherical tiling. Here we show that stabilizer-free polydispersed inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) can spontaneously organize into porous nanoshells. The association of water-soluble CdS NPs into self-limited spherical capsules is the result of scale-modified electrostatic, dispersion and other colloidal forces. They cannot be accurately described by the Derjaguin-Landau-Vervey-Overbeek theory, whereas molecular-dynamics simulations with combined atomistic and coarse-grained description of NPs reveal the emergence of nanoshells and some of their stabilization mechanisms. Morphology of the simulated assemblies formed under different conditions matched nearly perfectly the transmission electron microscopy tomography data. This study bridges the gap between biological and inorganic self-assembling nanosystems and conceptualizes a new pathway to spontaneous compartmentalization for a wide range of inorganic NPs including those existing on prebiotic Earth.",2
Synthesis of ent-BE-43547A1 reveals a potent hypoxia-selective anticancer agent and uncovers the biosynthetic origin of the APD-CLD natural products.,"Tumour hypoxia is speculated to be a key driver of therapeutic resistance and metastatic dissemination. Consequently, the discovery of new potent agents that selectively target the hypoxic cell population may reveal new and untapped antitumour mechanisms. Here we demonstrate that the BE-43547 subclass of the APD-CLD (amidopentadienoate-containing cyclolipodepsipeptides) natural products possesses highly hypoxia-selective growth-inhibitory activity against pancreatic cancer cells. To enable this discovery, we have developed the first synthesis of the BE-43547-macrocyclic scaffold in 16 steps (longest linear sequence), which also allowed access to the full panel of relative stereoisomers and ultimately to the assignment of stereochemical configuration. Discrepancies between the spectroscopic signatures of the synthetic compounds with that originally reported for the BE-43547 members stimulated us to re-isolate the natural product from a BE-43547-producing microorganism during which we elucidated the biosynthetic gene clusters for the BE-43547 family as well as for all other known APD-CLDs. Our studies underline the exciting possibilities for the further development of the anticancer activities of these natural products.",2
Rational design of reversible fluorescent probes for live-cell imaging and quantification of fast glutathione dynamics.,"Alterations in glutathione (GSH) homeostasis are associated with a variety of diseases and cellular functions, and therefore, real-time live-cell imaging and quantification of GSH dynamics are important for understanding pathophysiological processes. However, existing fluorescent probes are unsuitable for these purposes due to their irreversible fluorogenic mechanisms or slow reaction rates. In this work, we have successfully overcome these problems by establishing a design strategy inspired by Mayr's work on nucleophilic reaction kinetics. The synthesized probes exhibit concentration-dependent, reversible and rapid absorption/fluorescence changes (t1/2 = 620 ms at [GSH] = 1 mM), as well as appropriate Kd values (1-10 mM: within the range of intracellular GSH concentrations). We also developed FRET-based ratiometric probes, and demonstrated that they are useful for quantifying GSH concentration in various cell types and also for real-time live-cell imaging of GSH dynamics with temporal resolution of seconds.",2
Chemoproteomic profiling and discovery of protein electrophiles in human cells.,"Activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) serves as a chemical proteomic platform to discover and characterize functional amino acids in proteins on the basis of their enhanced reactivity towards small-molecule probes. This approach, to date, has mainly targeted nucleophilic functional groups, such as the side chains of serine and cysteine, using electrophilic probes. Here we show that 'reverse-polarity' (RP)-ABPP using clickable, nucleophilic hydrazine probes can capture and identify protein-bound electrophiles in cells. Using this approach, we demonstrate that the pyruvoyl cofactor of S-adenosyl-L-methionine decarboxylase (AMD1) is dynamically controlled by intracellular methionine concentrations. We also identify a heretofore unknown modification-an N-terminally bound glyoxylyl group-in the poorly characterized protein secernin-3. RP-ABPP thus provides a versatile method to monitor the metabolic regulation of electrophilic cofactors and discover novel types of electrophilic modifications on proteins in human cells.",2
Mechanism of O2 diffusion and reduction in FeFe hydrogenases.,"FeFe hydrogenases are the most efficient H2-producing enzymes. However, inactivation by O2 remains an obstacle that prevents them being used in many biotechnological devices. Here, we combine electrochemistry, site-directed mutagenesis, molecular dynamics and quantum chemical calculations to uncover the molecular mechanism of O2 diffusion within the enzyme and its reactions at the active site. We propose that the partial reversibility of the reaction with O2 results from the four-electron reduction of O2 to water. The third electron/proton transfer step is the bottleneck for water production, competing with formation of a highly reactive OH radical and hydroxylated cysteine. The rapid delivery of electrons and protons to the active site is therefore crucial to prevent the accumulation of these aggressive species during prolonged O2 exposure. These findings should provide important clues for the design of hydrogenase mutants with increased resistance to oxidative damage.",2
Suppression of Kasha's rule as a mechanism for fluorescent molecular rotors and aggregation-induced emission.,"Although there are some proposed explanations for aggregation-induced emission, a phenomenon with applications that range from biosensors to organic light-emitting diodes, current understanding of the quantum-mechanical origin of this photophysical behaviour is limited. To address this issue, we assessed the emission properties of a series of BF2-hydrazone-based dyes as a function of solvent viscosity. These molecules turned out to be highly efficient fluorescent molecular rotors. This property, in addition to them being aggregation-induced emission luminogens, enabled us to probe deeper into their emission mechanism. Time-dependent density functional theory calculations and experimental results showed that the emission is not from the S1 state, as predicted from Kasha's rule, but from a higher energy (>S1) state. Furthermore, we found that suppression of internal conversion to the dark S1 state by restricting the rotor rotation enhances fluorescence, which leads to the proposal that suppression of Kasha's rule is the photophysical mechanism responsible for emission in both viscous solution and the solid state.",2
Fusing tetrapyrroles to graphene edges by surface-assisted covalent coupling.,"Surface-assisted covalent linking of precursor molecules enables the fabrication of low-dimensional nanostructures, which include graphene nanoribbons. One approach to building functional multicomponent systems involves the lateral anchoring of organic heteromolecules to graphene. Here we demonstrate the dehydrogenative coupling of single porphines to graphene edges on the same metal substrate as used for graphene synthesis. The covalent linkages are visualized by scanning probe techniques with submolecular resolution, which directly reveals bonding motifs and electronic features. Distinct configurations are identified that can be steered towards entities predominantly fused to graphene edges through two pyrrole rings by thermal annealing. Furthermore, we succeeded in the concomitant metallation of the macrocycle with substrate atoms and the axial ligation of adducts. Such processes combined with graphene-nanostructure synthesis has the potential to create complex materials systems with tunable functionalities.",2
Lack of evidence for phase-only control of retinal photoisomerization in the strict one-photon limit.,"The concept of shaping electric fields to steer light-induced processes coherently has fascinated scientists for decades. Despite early theoretical considerations that ruled out one-photon coherent control (CC), several experimental studies reported that molecular responses are sensitive to the shape of the excitation field in the weak-field limit. These observations were largely attributed to the presence of rapid-decay channels, but experimental verification is lacking. Here, we test this hypothesis by investigating the degree of achievable control over the photoisomerization of the retinal protonated Schiff-base in bacteriorhodopsin, isorhodopsin and rhodopsin, all of which exhibit similar chromophores but different isomerization yields and excited-state lifetimes. Irrespective of the system studied, we find no evidence for dissipation-dependent behaviour, nor for any CC in the strict one-photon limit. Our results question the extent to which a photochemical process at ambient conditions can be controlled at the amplitude level, and how the underlying molecular potential-energy surfaces and dynamics may influence this controllability.",2
Reticular synthesis of porous molecular 1D nanotubes and 3D networks.,"Synthetic control over pore size and pore connectivity is the crowning achievement for porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The same level of control has not been achieved for molecular crystals, which are not defined by strong, directional intermolecular coordination bonds. Hence, molecular crystallization is inherently less controllable than framework crystallization, and there are fewer examples of 'reticular synthesis', in which multiple building blocks can be assembled according to a common assembly motif. Here we apply a chiral recognition strategy to a new family of tubular covalent cages to create both 1D porous nanotubes and 3D diamondoid pillared porous networks. The diamondoid networks are analogous to MOFs prepared from tetrahedral metal nodes and linear ditopic organic linkers. The crystal structures can be rationalized by computational lattice-energy searches, which provide an in silico screening method to evaluate candidate molecular building blocks. These results are a blueprint for applying the 'node and strut' principles of reticular synthesis to molecular crystals.",2
"Interplay between defects, disorder and flexibility in metal-organic frameworks.","Metal-organic frameworks are a novel family of chemically diverse materials, which are of interest across engineering, physics, chemistry, biology and medicine-based disciplines. Since the development of the field in its current form more than two decades ago, priority has been placed on the synthesis of new structures. However, more recently, a clear trend has emerged in shifting the emphasis from material design to exploring the chemical and physical properties of structures already known. In particular, although such nanoporous materials were traditionally seen as rigid crystalline structures, there is growing evidence that large-scale flexibility, the presence of defects and long-range disorder are not the exception in metal-organic frameworks, but the rule. Here we offer some perspective into how these concepts are perhaps inescapably intertwined, highlight recent advances in our understanding and discuss how a consideration of the interfaces between them may lead to enhancements of the materials' functionalities.",2
Multistep nucleation of nanocrystals in aqueous solution.,"The nucleation and growth of solids from solutions impacts many natural processes and is fundamental to applications in materials engineering and medicine. For a crystalline solid, the nucleus is a nanoscale cluster of ordered atoms that forms through mechanisms still poorly understood. In particular, it is unclear whether a nucleus forms spontaneously from solution via a single- or multiple-step process. Here, using in situ electron microscopy, we show how gold and silver nanocrystals nucleate from supersaturated aqueous solutions in three distinct steps: spinodal decomposition into solute-rich and solute-poor liquid phases, nucleation of amorphous nanoclusters within the metal-rich liquid phase, followed by crystallization of these amorphous clusters. Our ab initio calculations on gold nucleation suggest that these steps might be associated with strong gold-gold atom coupling and water-mediated metastable gold complexes. The understanding of intermediate steps in nuclei formation has important implications for the formation and growth of both crystalline and amorphous materials.",2
Emergence of a catalytic tetrad during evolution of a highly active artificial aldolase.,"Designing catalysts that achieve the rates and selectivities of natural enzymes is a long-standing goal in protein chemistry. Here, we show that an ultrahigh-throughput droplet-based microfluidic screening platform can be used to improve a previously optimized artificial aldolase by an additional factor of 30 to give a >10(9) rate enhancement that rivals the efficiency of class I aldolases. The resulting enzyme catalyses a reversible aldol reaction with high stereoselectivity and tolerates a broad range of substrates. Biochemical and structural studies show that catalysis depends on a Lys-Tyr-Asn-Tyr tetrad that emerged adjacent to a computationally designed hydrophobic pocket during directed evolution. This constellation of residues is poised to activate the substrate by Schiff base formation, promote mechanistically important proton transfers and stabilize multiple transition states along a complex reaction coordinate. The emergence of such a sophisticated catalytic centre shows that there is nothing magical about the catalytic activities or mechanisms of naturally occurring enzymes, or the evolutionary process that gave rise to them.",2
An infrared spectroscopy approach to follow beta-sheet formation in peptide amyloid assemblies.,"Amyloidogenic peptides and proteins play a crucial role in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. These proteins undergo a spontaneous transition from a soluble, often partially folded form, into insoluble amyloid fibrils that are rich in beta-sheets. Increasing evidence suggests that highly dynamic, polydisperse folding intermediates, which occur during fibril formation, are the toxic species in the amyloid-related diseases. Traditional condensed-phase methods are of limited use for characterizing these states because they typically only provide ensemble averages rather than information about individual oligomers. Here we report the first direct secondary-structure analysis of individual amyloid intermediates using a combination of ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry and gas-phase infrared spectroscopy. Our data reveal that oligomers of the fibril-forming peptide segments VEALYL and YVEALL, which consist of 4-9 peptide strands, can contain a significant amount of beta-sheet. In addition, our data show that the more-extended variants of each oligomer generally exhibit increased beta-sheet content.",2
Breaking scaling relations to achieve low-temperature ammonia synthesis through LiH-mediated nitrogen transfer and hydrogenation.,"Ammonia synthesis under mild conditions is a goal that has been long sought after. Previous investigations have shown that adsorption and transition-state energies of intermediates in this process on transition metals (TMs) scale with each other. This prevents the independent optimization of these energies that would result in the ideal catalyst: one that activates reactants well, but binds intermediates relatively weakly. Here we demonstrate that these scaling relations can be broken by intervening in the TM-mediated catalysis with a second catalytic site, LiH. The negatively charged hydrogen atoms of LiH act as strong reducing agents, which remove activated nitrogen atoms from the TM or its nitride (TMN), and as an immediate source of hydrogen, which binds nitrogen atoms to form LiNH2. LiNH2 further splits H2 heterolytically to give off NH3 and regenerate LiH. This synergy between TM (or TMN) and LiH creates a favourable pathway that allows both early and late 3d TM-LiH composites to exhibit unprecedented lower-temperature catalytic activities.",2
Conformer-specific hydrogen atom tunnelling in trifluoromethylhydroxycarbene.,"Conformational control of organic reactions is at the heart of the biomolecular sciences. To achieve a particular reactivity, one of many conformers may be selected, for instance, by a (bio)catalyst, as the geometrically most suited and appropriately reactive species. The equilibration of energetically close-lying conformers is typically assumed to be facile and less energetically taxing than the reaction under consideration itself: this is termed the 'Curtin-Hammett principle'. Here, we show that the trans conformer of trifluoromethylhydroxycarbene preferentially rearranges through a facile quantum-mechanical hydrogen tunnelling pathway, while its cis conformer is entirely unreactive. Hence, this presents the first example of a conformer-specific hydrogen tunnelling reaction. The Curtin-Hammett principle is not applicable, due to the high barrier between the two conformers.",2
Homochiral polymerization-driven selective growth of graphene nanoribbons.,"The surface-assisted bottom-up fabrication of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), which consists of the radical polymerization of precursors followed by dehydrogenation, has attracted attention because of the method's ability to control the edges and widths of the resulting ribbon. Although these reactions on a metal surface are believed to be catalytic, the mechanism has remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate 'conformation-controlled surface catalysis': the two-zone chemical vapour deposition of a 'Z-bar-linkage' precursor, which represents two terphenyl units linked in a 'Z' shape, results in the efficient formation of acene-type GNRs with a width of 1.45 nm through optimized cascade reactions. These precursors exhibit flexibility that allows them to adopt chiral conformations with height asymmetry on a Au(111) surface, which enables the production of self-assembled homochiral polymers in a chain with a planar conformation, followed by dehydrogenation via a conformation-controlled mechanism. This is conceptually analogous to enzymatic catalysis and will be useful for the fabrication of new nanocarbon materials.",2
Enabling singlet fission by controlling intramolecular charge transfer in pi-stacked covalent terrylenediimide dimers.,"When an assembly of two or more molecules absorbs a photon to form a singlet exciton, and the energetics and intermolecular interactions are favourable, the singlet exciton can rapidly and spontaneously produce two triplet excitons by singlet fission. To understand this process is important because it may prove to be technologically significant for enhancing solar-cell performance. Theory strongly suggests that charge-transfer states are involved in singlet fission, but their role has remained an intriguing puzzle and, up until now, no molecular system has provided clear evidence for such a state. Here we describe a terrylenediimide dimer that forms a charge-transfer state in a few picoseconds in polar solvents, and undergoes equally rapid, high-yield singlet fission in nonpolar solvents. These results show that adjusting the charge-transfer-state energy relative to those of the exciton states can serve to either inhibit or promote singlet fission.",2
Mechanically controlled quantum interference in individual pi-stacked dimers.,"Recent observations of destructive quantum interference in single-molecule junctions confirm the role of quantum effects in the electronic conductance properties of molecular systems. These effects are central to a broad range of chemical and biological processes and may be beneficial for the design of single-molecule electronic components to exploit the intrinsic quantum effects that occur at the molecular scale. Here we show that destructive interference can be turned on or off within the same molecular system by mechanically controlling its conformation. Using a combination of ab initio calculations and single-molecule conductance measurements, we demonstrate the existence of a quasiperiodic destructive quantum-interference pattern along the breaking traces of pi-stacked molecular dimers. The results demonstrate that it is possible to control the molecular conductance over more than one order of magnitude and with a sub-angstrom resolution by exploiting the subtle structure-property relationship of pi-stacked dimers.",2
Mass spectrometry captures off-target drug binding and provides mechanistic insights into the human metalloprotease ZMPSTE24.,"Off-target binding of hydrophobic drugs can lead to unwanted side effects, either through specific or non-specific binding to unintended membrane protein targets. However, distinguishing the binding of drugs to membrane proteins from that of detergents, lipids and cofactors is challenging. Here, we use high-resolution mass spectrometry to study the effects of HIV protease inhibitors on the human zinc metalloprotease ZMPSTE24. This intramembrane protease plays a major role in converting prelamin A to mature lamin A. We monitored the proteolysis of farnesylated prelamin A peptide by ZMPSTE24 and unexpectedly found retention of the C-terminal peptide product with the enzyme. We also resolved binding of zinc, lipids and HIV protease inhibitors and showed that drug binding blocked prelamin A peptide cleavage and conferred stability to ZMPSTE24. Our results not only have relevance for the progeria-like side effects of certain HIV protease inhibitor drugs, but also highlight new approaches for documenting off-target drug binding.",2
Oriented electric fields as future smart reagents in chemistry.,"Oriented external electric fields (OEEFs) as 'smart reagents' are no longer a theoretical dream. Here, we discuss the wide-ranging potential of using OEEFs to catalyse and control a variety of non-redox reactions and impart selectivity at will. An OEEF along the direction of electron reorganization (the so-called reaction axis) will catalyse nonpolar reactions by orders of magnitude, control regioselectivity and induce spin-state selectivity. Simply flipping the direction of the OEEF or orienting it off of the reaction axis, will control at will the endo/exo ratio in Diels-Alder reactions and steps in enzymatic cycles. This Perspective highlights these outcomes using theoretical results for hydrogen abstraction reactions, epoxidation of double bonds, C-C bond forming reactions, proton transfers and the cycle of the enzyme cytochrome P450, as well as recent experimental data. We postulate that, as experimental techniques mature, chemical syntheses may become an exercise in zapping oriented molecules with OEEFs.",2
Oxadiazole grafts in peptide macrocycles.,"Synthetic methods that provide control over macrocycle conformation and, at the same time, mitigate the polarity of peptide bonds represent valuable tools for the discovery of new bioactive molecules. Here, we report a macrocyclization reaction between a linear peptide, an aldehyde and (N-isocyanimino)triphenylphosphorane. This process generates head-to-tail cyclic peptidomimetics in a single step. This method is tolerant to variation in the peptide and aldehyde components and has been applied for the synthesis of 15-, 18-, 21- and 24-membered rings. The resulting peptide macrocycles feature a 1,3,4-oxadiazole and a tertiary amine in their scaffolds. This non-canonical backbone region acts as an endocyclic control element that promotes and stabilizes a unique intramolecular hydrogen-bond network and can lead to macrocycles with conformationally rigid turn structures. Oxadiazole-containing macrocycles can also display a high passive membrane permeability, an important property for the development of bioavailable peptide-based therapeutics.",2
Direct observation of subpicosecond vibrational dynamics in photoexcited myoglobin.,"Determining the initial pathway for ultrafast energy redistribution within biomolecules is a challenge, and haem proteins, for which energy can be deposited locally in the haem moiety using short light pulses, are suitable model systems to address this issue. However, data acquired using existing experimental techniques that fail to combine sufficient structural sensitivity with adequate time resolution have resulted in alternative hypotheses concerning the interplay between energy flow among highly excited vibrational levels and potential concomitant electronic processes. By developing a femtosecond-stimulated Raman set-up, endowed with the necessary tunability to take advantage of different resonance conditions, here we visualize the temporal evolution of energy redistribution over different vibrational modes in myoglobin. We establish that the vibrational energy initially stored in the highly excited Franck-Condon manifold is transferred with different timescales into low- and high-frequency modes, prior to slow dissipation through the protein. These findings demonstrate that a newly proposed mechanism involving the population dynamics of specific vibrational modes settles the controversy on the existence of transient electronic intermediates.",2
New ligands for nickel catalysis from diverse pharmaceutical heterocycle libraries.,"Ligands are essential for controlling the reactivity and selectivity of reactions catalysed by transition metals. Access to large phosphine ligand libraries has become an essential tool for the application of metal-catalysed reactions industrially, but these existing libraries are not well suited to new catalytic methods based on non-precious metals (for example, Ni, Cu and Fe). The development of the requisite nitrogen- and oxygen-based ligand libraries lags far behind that of the phosphines and the development of new libraries is anticipated to be time consuming. Here we show that this process can be dramatically accelerated by mining for new ligands in a typical pharmaceutical compound library that is rich in heterocycles. Using this approach, we were able to screen a structurally diverse set of compounds with minimal synthetic effort and identify several new ligand classes for nickel-catalysed cross-electrophile coupling. These new ligands gave improved yields for challenging cross-couplings of pharmaceutically relevant substrates compared with those of those of previously published ligands.",2
A decarboxylative approach for regioselective hydroarylation of alkynes.,"Regioselective activation of aromatic C-H bonds is a long-standing challenge for arene functionalization reactions such as the hydroarylation of alkynes. One possible solution is to employ a removable directing group that activates one of several aromatic C-H bonds. Here we report a new catalytic method for regioselective alkyne hydroarylation with benzoic acid derivatives during which the carboxylate functionality directs the alkyne to the ortho-C-H bond with elimination in situ to form a vinylarene product. The decarboxylation stage of this tandem sequence is envisioned to proceed with the assistance of an ortho-alkenyl moiety, which is formed by the initial alkyne coupling. This ruthenium-catalysed decarboxylative alkyne hydroarylation eliminates the common need for pre-existing ortho-substitution on benzoic acids for substrate activation, proceeds under redox-neutral and relatively mild conditions, and tolerates a broad range of synthetically useful aromatic functionality. Thus, it significantly increases the synthetic utility of benzoic acids as easily accessible aromatic building blocks.",2
The scope and mechanism of palladium-catalysed Markovnikov alkoxycarbonylation of alkenes.,"Hydroesterification reactions represent a fundamental type of carbonylation reaction and constitute one of the most important industrial applications of homogeneous catalysis. Over the past 70 years, numerous catalyst systems have been developed that allow for highly linear-selective (anti-Markovnikov) reactions and are used in industry to produce linear carboxylates starting from olefins. In contrast, a general catalyst system for Markovnikov-selective alkoxycarbonylation of aliphatic olefins remains unknown. In this paper, we show that a specific palladium catalyst system consisting of PdX2/N-phenylpyrrole phosphine (X, halide) catalyses the alkoxycarbonylation of various alkenes to give the branched esters in high selectivity (branched selectivity up to 91%). The observed (and unexpected) selectivity has been rationalized by density functional theory computation that includes a dispersion correction.",2
Targeted drug delivery through the traceless release of tertiary and heteroaryl amines from antibody-drug conjugates.,"The reversible attachment of a small-molecule drug to a carrier for targeted delivery can improve pharmacokinetics and the therapeutic index. Previous studies have reported the delivery of molecules that contain primary and secondary amines via an amide or carbamate bond; however, the ability to employ tertiary-amine-containing bioactive molecules has been elusive. Here we describe a bioreversible linkage based on a quaternary ammonium that can be used to connect a broad array of tertiary and heteroaryl amines to a carrier protein. Using a concise, protecting-group-free synthesis we demonstrate the chemoselective modification of 12 complex molecules that contain a range of reactive functional groups. We also show the utility of this connection with both protease-cleavable and reductively cleavable antibody-drug conjugates that were effective and stable in vitro and in vivo. Studies with a tertiary-amine-containing antibiotic show that the resulting antibody-antibiotic conjugate provided appropriate stability and release characteristics and led to an unexpected improvement in activity over the conjugates previously connected via a carbamate.",2
Observation of trapped-hole diffusion on the surfaces of CdS nanorods.,"In CdS nanocrystals, photoexcited holes rapidly become trapped at the particle surface. The dynamics of these trapped holes have profound consequences for the photophysics and photochemistry of these materials. Using a combination of transient absorption spectroscopy and theoretical modelling, we demonstrate that trapped holes in CdS nanorods are mobile and execute a random walk at room temperature. In CdS nanorods of non-uniform width, we observe the recombination of spatially separated electrons and trapped holes, which exhibits a t(-1/2) power-law decay at long times. A one-dimensional diffusion-annihilation model describes the time-dependence of the recombination over four orders of magnitude in time, from one nanosecond to ten microseconds, with a single adjustable parameter. We propose that diffusive trapped-hole motion is a general phenomenon in CdS nanocrystals, but one that is normally obscured in structures in which the wavefunctions of the electron and trapped hole spatially overlap. This phenomenon has important implications for the oxidation photochemistry of CdS nanocrystals.",2
Total synthesis and structure-activity relationship studies of a series of selective G protein inhibitors.,"G proteins are key mediators of G protein-coupled receptor signalling, which facilitates a plethora of important physiological processes. The cyclic depsipeptides YM-254890 and FR900359 are the only known specific inhibitors of the Gq subfamily of G proteins; however, no synthetic route has been reported previously for these complex natural products and they are not easily isolated from natural sources. Here we report the first total synthesis of YM-254890 and FR900359, as well as of two known analogues, YM-385780 and YM-385781. The versatility of the synthetic approach also enabled the design and synthesis of ten analogues, which provided the first structure-activity relationship study for this class of compounds. Pharmacological characterization of all the compounds at Gq-, Gi- and Gs-mediated signalling provided succinct information on the structural requirements for inhibition, and demonstrated that both YM-254890 and FR900359 are highly potent inhibitors of Gq signalling, with FR900359 being the most potent. These natural products and their analogues represent unique tools for explorative studies of G protein inhibition.",2
A stable heavier group 14 analogue of vinylidene.,"Vinylidene (H2C=C) is a member of the family of compounds of composition CH (and isomeric with ethyne, HC identical withCH), but it has been observed only transiently-with a lifetime in the region of 0.1 ns. Indeed, no simple (non-base-stabilized) compounds of the type R2E=E have been characterized structurally for any of the group 14 elements. Here we show that by employing the bulky and strongly electron-donating boryl ligand (HCDippN)2B (Dipp, 2,6-(i)Pr2C6H3), a simple monomeric digermavinylidene compound, (boryl)2GeGe, can be synthesized and is stable at room temperature. Both its formation via the two-electron chemical oxidation of the symmetrical Ge(0) compound K2[(boryl)GeGe(boryl)] and its subsequent reaction chemistry (for example, with H2), are consistent with a high substituent lability and the accessibility of both 1,1- and 1,2-substitution patterns. Structural and computational studies of [(HCDippN)2B]2GeGe reveal a weak Ge-Ge double bond-the pi component of which contributes to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)-with a Ge-centred lone pair as the HOMO-1.",2
Identification of (S)-selective transaminases for the asymmetric synthesis of bulky chiral amines.,"The use of transaminases to access pharmaceutically relevant chiral amines is an attractive alternative to transition-metal-catalysed asymmetric chemical synthesis. However, one major challenge is their limited substrate scope. Here we report the creation of highly active and stereoselective transaminases starting from fold class I. The transaminases were developed by extensive protein engineering followed by optimization of the identified motif. The resulting enzymes exhibited up to 8,900-fold higher activity than the starting scaffold and are highly stereoselective (up to >99.9% enantiomeric excess) in the asymmetric synthesis of a set of chiral amines bearing bulky substituents. These enzymes should therefore be suitable for use in the synthesis of a wide array of potential intermediates for pharmaceuticals. We also show that the motif can be engineered into other protein scaffolds with sequence identities as low as 70%, and as such should have a broad impact in the field of biocatalytic synthesis and enzyme engineering.",2
Deep-hole transfer leads to ultrafast charge migration in DNA hairpins.,"Charge transport through the DNA double helix is of fundamental interest in chemistry and biochemistry, but also has potential technological applications such as for DNA-based nanoelectronics. For the latter, it is of considerable interest to explore ways to influence or enhance charge transfer. In this Article we demonstrate a new mechanism for DNA charge transport, namely 'deep-hole transfer', which involves long-range migration of a hole through low-lying electronic states of the nucleobases. Here, we demonstrate, in a combined experimental and theoretical study, that it is possible to achieve such transfer behaviour by changing the energetics of charge injection. This mechanism leads to an enhancement in transfer rates by up to two orders of magnitude and much weaker distance dependence. This transfer is faster than relaxation to the lowest-energy state, setting this mechanism apart from those previously described. This opens up a new direction to optimize charge transfer in DNA with unprecedented charge-transfer rates.",2
Peptide tessellation yields micrometre-scale collagen triple helices.,"Sticky-ended DNA duplexes can associate spontaneously into long double helices; however, such self-assembly is much less developed with proteins. Collagen is the most prevalent component of the extracellular matrix and a common clinical biomaterial. As for natural DNA, the ~10(3)-residue triple helices (~300 nm) of natural collagen are recalcitrant to chemical synthesis. Here we show how the self-assembly of short collagen-mimetic peptides (CMPs) can enable the fabrication of synthetic collagen triple helices that are nearly a micrometre in length. Inspired by the mathematics of tessellations, we derive rules for the design of single CMPs that self-assemble into long triple helices with perfect symmetry. Sticky ends thus created are uniform across the assembly and drive its growth. Enacting this design yields individual triple helices that, in length, match or exceed those in natural collagen and are remarkably thermostable, despite the absence of higher-order association. The symmetric assembly of CMPs provides an enabling platform for the development of advanced materials for medicine and nanotechnology.",2
Fast and selective ring-opening polymerizations by alkoxides and thioureas.,"Ring-opening polymerization of lactones is a versatile approach to generate well-defined functional polyesters. Typical ring-opening catalysts are subject to a trade-off between rate and selectivity. Here we describe an effective catalytic system combining alkoxides with thioureas that catalyses rapid and selective ring-opening polymerizations. Deprotonation of thioureas by sodium, potassium or imidazolium alkoxides generates a hydrogen-bonded alcohol adduct of the thiourea anion (thioimidate). The ring-opening polymerization of L-lactide mediated by these alcohol-bonded thioimidates yields highly isotactic polylactide with fast kinetics and living polymerization behaviour, as evidenced by narrow molecular weight distributions (Mw/Mn < 1.1), chain extension experiments and minimal transesterifications. Computational studies indicate a bifunctional catalytic mechanism whereby the thioimidate activates the carbonyl of the monomer and the alcohol initiator/chain end to effect the selective ring-opening of lactones and carbonates. The high selectivity of the catalyst towards monomer propagation over transesterification is attributed to a selective activation of monomer over polymer chains.",2
MIDA boronates are hydrolysed fast and slow by two different mechanisms.,"MIDA boronates (N-methylimidodiacetic boronic acid esters) serve as an increasingly general platform for small-molecule construction based on building blocks, largely because of the dramatic and general rate differences with which they are hydrolysed under various basic conditions. Yet the mechanistic underpinnings of these rate differences have remained unclear, which has hindered efforts to address the current limitations of this chemistry. Here we show that there are two distinct mechanisms for this hydrolysis: one is base mediated and the other neutral. The former can proceed more than three orders of magnitude faster than the latter, and involves a rate-limiting attack by a hydroxide at a MIDA carbonyl carbon. The alternative 'neutral' hydrolysis does not require an exogenous acid or base and involves rate-limiting B-N bond cleavage by a small water cluster, (H2O)n. The two mechanisms can operate in parallel, and their relative rates are readily quantified by (18)O incorporation. Whether hydrolysis is 'fast' or 'slow' is dictated by the pH, the water activity and the mass-transfer rates between phases. These findings stand to enable, in a rational way, an even more effective and widespread utilization of MIDA boronates in synthesis.",2
Nickel-centred proton reduction catalysis in a model of [NiFe] hydrogenase.,"Hydrogen production through water splitting is one of the most promising solutions for the storage of renewable energy. [NiFe] hydrogenases are organometallic enzymes containing nickel and iron centres that catalyse hydrogen evolution with performances that rival those of platinum. These enzymes provide inspiration for the design of new molecular catalysts that do not require precious metals. However, all heterodinuclear NiFe models reported so far do not reproduce the Ni-centred reactivity found at the active site of [NiFe] hydrogenases. Here, we report a structural and functional NiFe mimic that displays reactivity at the Ni site. This is shown by the detection of two catalytic intermediates that reproduce structural and electronic features of the Ni-L and Ni-R states of the enzyme during catalytic turnover. Under electrocatalytic conditions, this mimic displays high rates for H2 evolution (second-order rate constant of 2.5 x 10(4) M(-1) s(-1); turnover frequency of 250 s(-1) at 10 mM H(+) concentration) from mildly acidic solutions.",2
Materials and methods for delivery of biological drugs.,"Biological drugs generated via recombinant techniques are uniquely positioned due to their high potency and high selectivity of action. The major drawback of this class of therapeutics, however, is their poor stability upon oral administration and during subsequent circulation. As a result, biological drugs have very low bioavailability and short therapeutic half-lives. Fortunately, tools of chemistry and biotechnology have been developed into an elaborate arsenal, which can be applied to improve the pharmacokinetics of biological drugs. Depot-type release systems are available to achieve sustained release of drugs over time. Conjugation to synthetic or biological polymers affords long circulating formulations. Administration of biological drugs through non-parenteral routes shows excellent performance and the first products have reached the market. This Review presents the main accomplishments in this field and illustrates the materials and methods behind existing and upcoming successful formulations and delivery strategies for biological drugs.",2
Small-molecule control of protein function through Staudinger reduction.,"Using small molecules to control the function of proteins in live cells with complete specificity is highly desirable, but challenging. Here we report a small-molecule switch that can be used to control protein activity. The approach uses a phosphine-mediated Staudinger reduction to activate protein function. Genetic encoding of an ortho-azidobenzyloxycarbonyl amino acid using a pyrrolysyl transfer RNA synthetase/tRNACUA pair in mammalian cells enables the site-specific introduction of a small-molecule-removable protecting group into the protein of interest. Strategic placement of this group renders the protein inactive until deprotection through a bioorthogonal Staudinger reduction delivers the active wild-type protein. This developed methodology was applied to the conditional control of several cellular processes, including bioluminescence (luciferase), fluorescence (enhanced green fluorescent protein), protein translocation (nuclear localization sequence), DNA recombination (Cre) and gene editing (Cas9).",2
"Translational, rotational and vibrational relaxation dynamics of a solute molecule in a non-interacting solvent.","Spectroscopically observing the translational and rotational motion of solute molecules in liquid solutions is typically impeded by their interactions with the solvent, which conceal spectral detail through linewidth broadening. Here we show that unique insights into solute dynamics can be made with perfluorinated solvents, which interact weakly with solutes and provide a simplified liquid environment that helps to bridge the gap in our understanding of gas- and liquid-phase dynamics. Specifically, we show that in such solvents, the translational and rotational cooling of an energetic CN radical can be observed directly using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. We observe that translational-energy dissipation within these liquids can be modelled through a series of classic collisions, whereas classically simulated rotational-energy dissipation is shown to be distinctly faster than experimentally measured. We also observe the onset of rotational hindering from nearby solvent molecules, which arises as the average rotational energy of the solute falls below the effective barrier to rotation induced by the solvent.",2
Switchable photooxygenation catalysts that sense higher-order amyloid structures.,"Proteins can misfold into amyloid structures that are associated with diseases; however, the same proteins often have important biological roles. To degrade selectively the amyloid form without affecting the fraction of functional protein is, therefore, an attractive goal. Here we report target-state-dependent photooxygenation catalysts that are active only when bound to the cross-beta-sheet structure that is characteristic of pathogenic aggregated amyloid proteins. We show these catalysts can selectively oxygenate the amyloid form of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) 1-42 in the presence of non-amyloid off-target substrates. Furthermore, photooxygenation with a catalyst that bears an Abeta-binding peptide attenuated the Abeta pathogenicity in the presence of cells. We also show that selective photooxygenation is generally applicable to other amyloidogenic proteins (amylin, insulin, beta2-microglobulin, transthyretin and alpha-synuclein) and does not affect the physiologically functional non-aggregate states of these proteins. This is the first report of an artificial catalyst that can be selectively and reversibly turned on and off depending on the structure and aggregation state of the substrate protein.",2
Allosteric activation of membrane-bound glutamate receptors using coordination chemistry within living cells.,"The controlled activation of proteins in living cells is an important goal in protein-design research, but to introduce an artificial activation switch into membrane proteins through rational design is a significant challenge because of the structural and functional complexity of such proteins. Here we report the allosteric activation of two types of membrane-bound neurotransmitter receptors, the ion-channel type and the G-protein-coupled glutamate receptors, using coordination chemistry in living cells. The high programmability of coordination chemistry enabled two His mutations, which act as an artificial allosteric site, to be semirationally incorporated in the vicinity of the ligand-binding pockets. Binding of Pd(2,2'-bipyridine) at the allosteric site enabled the active conformations of the glutamate receptors to be stabilized. Using this approach, we were able to activate selectively a mutant glutamate receptor in live neurons, which initiated a subsequent signal-transduction pathway.",2
The dipolar endofullerene HF@C60.,"The cavity inside fullerenes provides a unique environment for the study of isolated atoms and molecules. We report the encapsulation of hydrogen fluoride inside C60 using molecular surgery to give the endohedral fullerene HF@C60. The key synthetic step is the closure of the open fullerene cage with the escape of HF minimized. The encapsulated HF molecule moves freely inside the cage and exhibits quantization of its translational and rotational degrees of freedom, as revealed by inelastic neutron scattering and infrared spectroscopy. The rotational and vibrational constants of the encapsulated HF molecules were found to be redshifted relative to free HF. The NMR spectra display a large (1)H-(19)F J coupling typical of an isolated species. The dipole moment of HF@C60 was estimated from the temperature dependence of the dielectric constant at cryogenic temperatures and showed that the cage shields around 75% of the HF dipole.",2
Directionally tunable and mechanically deformable ferroelectric crystals from rotating polar globular ionic molecules.,"Ferroelectrics are used in a wide range of applications, including memory elements, capacitors and sensors. Recently, molecular ferroelectric crystals have attracted interest as viable alternatives to conventional ceramic ferroelectrics because of their solution processability and lack of toxicity. Here we show that a class of molecular compounds-known as plastic crystals-can exhibit ferroelectricity if the constituents are judiciously chosen from polar ionic molecules. The intrinsic features of plastic crystals, for example, the rotational motion of molecules and phase transitions with lattice-symmetry changes, provide the crystals with unique ferroelectric properties relative to those of conventional molecular crystals. This allows a flexible alteration of the polarization axis direction in a grown crystal by applying an electric field. Owing to the tunable nature of the crystal orientation, together with mechanical deformability, this type of molecular crystal represents an attractive functional material that could find use in a diverse range of applications.",2
Engineering nanometre-scale coherence in soft matter.,"Electronic delocalization in redox-active polymers may be disrupted by the heterogeneity of the environment that surrounds each monomer. When the differences in monomer redox-potential induced by the environment are small (as compared with the monomer-monomer electronic interactions), delocalization persists. Here we show that guanine (G) runs in double-stranded DNA support delocalization over 4-5 guanine bases. The weak interaction between delocalized G blocks on opposite DNA strands is known to support partially coherent long-range charge transport. The molecular-resolution model developed here finds that the coherence among these G blocks follows an even-odd orbital-symmetry rule and predicts that weakening the interaction between G blocks exaggerates the resistance oscillations. These findings indicate how sequence can be exploited to change the balance between coherent and incoherent transport. The predictions are tested and confirmed using break-junction experiments. Thus, tailored orbital symmetry and structural fluctuations may be used to produce coherent transport with a length scale of multiple nanometres in soft-matter assemblies, a length scale comparable to that of small proteins.",2
Force-induced tautomerization in a single molecule.,"Heat transfer, electrical potential and light energy are common ways to activate chemical reactions. Applied force is another way, but dedicated studies for such a mechanical activation are limited, and this activation is poorly understood at the single-molecule level. Here, we report force-induced tautomerization in a single porphycene molecule on a Cu(110) surface at 5 K, which is studied by scanning probe microscopy and density functional theory calculations. Force spectroscopy quantifies the force needed to trigger tautomerization with submolecular spatial resolution. The calculations show how the reaction pathway and barrier of tautomerization are modified in the presence of a copper tip and reveal the atomistic origin of the process. Moreover, we demonstrate that a chemically inert tip whose apex is terminated by a xenon atom cannot induce the reaction because of a weak interaction with porphycene and a strong relaxation of xenon on the tip as contact to the molecule is formed.",2
In situ observation of self-assembled hydrocarbon Fischer-Tropsch products on a cobalt catalyst.,"Fischer-Tropsch synthesis is a heterogeneous catalytic reaction that creates approximately 2% of the world's fuel. It involves the synthesis of linear hydrocarbon molecules from a gaseous mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen at high pressures (from a few to tens of bars) and high temperatures (200-350 degrees C). To gain further insight into the fundamental mechanisms of this industrial process, we have used a purpose-built scanning tunnelling microscope to monitor a cobalt model catalyst under reaction conditions. We show that, after 30 minutes of reaction, the terraces of the cobalt catalyst are covered by parallel arrays of stripes. We propose that the stripes are formed by the self-assembly of linear hydrocarbon product molecules. Surprisingly, the width of the stripes corresponds to molecules that are 14 or 15 carbon atoms long. We introduce a simple model that explains the accumulation of such long molecules by describing their monomer-by-monomer synthesis and explicitly accounting for their thermal desorption.",2
Dearomative dihydroxylation with arenophiles.,"Aromatic hydrocarbons are some of the most elementary feedstock chemicals, produced annually on a million metric ton scale, and are used in the production of polymers, paints, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals. Dearomatization reactions convert simple, readily available arenes into more complex molecules with broader potential utility, however, despite substantial progress and achievements in this field, there are relatively few methods for the dearomatization of simple arenes that also selectively introduce functionality. Here we describe a new dearomatization process that involves visible-light activation of small heteroatom-containing organic molecules-arenophiles-that results in their para-cycloaddition with a variety of aromatic compounds. The approach uses N-N-arenophiles to enable dearomative dihydroxylation and diaminodihydroxylation of simple arenes. This strategy provides direct and selective access to highly functionalized cyclohexenes and cyclohexadienes and is orthogonal to existing chemical and biological dearomatization processes. Finally, we demonstrate the synthetic utility of this strategy with the concise synthesis of several biologically active compounds and natural products.",2
Oligoarginine peptides slow strand annealing and assist non-enzymatic RNA replication.,"The non-enzymatic replication of RNA is thought to have been a critical process required for the origin of life. One unsolved difficulty with non-enzymatic RNA replication is that template-directed copying of RNA results in a double-stranded product. After strand separation, rapid strand reannealing outcompetes slow non-enzymatic template copying, which renders multiple rounds of RNA replication impossible. Here we show that oligoarginine peptides slow the annealing of complementary oligoribonucleotides by up to several thousand-fold; however, short primers and activated monomers can still bind to template strands, and template-directed primer extension can still occur, all within a phase-separated condensed state, or coacervate. Furthermore, we show that within this phase, partial template copying occurs even in the presence of full-length complementary strands. This method to enable further rounds of replication suggests one mechanism by which short non-coded peptides could have enhanced early cellular fitness, and potentially explains how longer coded peptides, that is, proteins, came to prominence in modern biology.",2
Creating complex molecular topologies by configuring DNA four-way junctions.,"The realization of complex topologies at the molecular level represents a grand challenge in chemistry. This necessitates the manipulation of molecular interactions with high precision. Here we show that single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) knots and links can be created by utilizing the inherent topological properties that pertain to the DNA four-way junction, at which the two helical strands form a node and can be configured conveniently and connected for complex topological construction. Using this strategy, we produced series of ssDNA topoisomers with the same sequences. By finely designing the curvature and torsion, double-stranded DNA knots were accessed by hybridizing and ligating the complementary strands with the knotted ssDNA templates. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of a constructed ssDNA knot both to probe the topological conversion catalysed by DNA topoisomerase and to study the DNA replication under topological constraint.",2
Cell-sized asymmetric lipid vesicles facilitate the investigation of asymmetric membranes.,"Asymmetric lipid giant vesicles have been used to model the biochemical reactions in cell membranes. However, methods for producing asymmetric giant vesicles lead to the inclusion of an organic solvent layer that affects the mechanical and physical characteristics of the membrane. Here we describe the formation of asymmetric giant vesicles that include little organic solvent, and use them to investigate the dynamic responses of lipid molecules in the vesicle membrane. We formed the giant vesicles via the inhomogeneous break-up of a lipid microtube generated by applying a jet flow to an asymmetric planar lipid bilayer. The asymmetric giant vesicles showed a lipid flip-flop behaviour in the membrane, superficially similar to the lipid flip-flop activity observed in apoptotic cells. In vitro synthesis of membrane proteins into the asymmetric giant vesicles revealed that the lipid asymmetry in bilayer membranes improves the reconstitution ratio of membrane proteins. Our asymmetric giant vesicles will be useful in elucidating lipid-lipid and lipid-membrane protein interactions involved in the regulation of cellular functions.",2
Wide-dynamic-range kinetic investigations of deep proton tunnelling in proteins.,"Directional proton transport along 'wires' that feed biochemical reactions in proteins is poorly understood. Amino-acid residues with high pKa are seldom considered as active transport elements in such wires because of their large classical barrier for proton dissociation. Here, we use the light-triggered proton wire of the green fluorescent protein to study its ground-electronic-state proton-transport kinetics, revealing a large temperature-dependent kinetic isotope effect. We show that 'deep' proton tunnelling between hydrogen-bonded oxygen atoms with a typical donor-acceptor distance of 2.7-2.8 A fully accounts for the rates at all temperatures, including the unexpectedly large value (2.5 x 10(9) s(-1)) found at room temperature. The rate-limiting step in green fluorescent protein is assigned to tunnelling of the ionization-resistant serine hydroxyl proton. This suggests how high-pKa residues within a proton wire can act as a 'tunnel diode' to kinetically trap protons and control the direction of proton flow.",2
Self-organized architectures from assorted DNA-framed nanoparticles.,"The science of self-assembly has undergone a radical shift from asking questions about why individual components self-organize into ordered structures, to manipulating the resultant order. However, the quest for far-reaching nanomanufacturing requires addressing an even more challenging question: how to form nanoparticle (NP) structures with designed architectures without explicitly prescribing particle positions. Here we report an assembly concept in which building instructions are embedded into NPs via DNA frames. The integration of NPs and DNA origami frames enables the fabrication of NPs with designed anisotropic and selective interactions. Using a pre-defined set of different DNA-framed NPs, we show it is possible to design diverse planar architectures, which include periodic structures and shaped meso-objects that spontaneously emerge on mixing of the different topological types of NP. Even objects of non-trivial shapes, such as a nanoscale model of Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man, can be self-assembled successfully.",2
Kinetic pathway for interfacial electron transfer from a semiconductor to a molecule.,"Molecular approaches to solar-energy conversion require a kinetic optimization of light-induced electron-transfer reactions. At molecular-semiconductor interfaces, this optimization has previously been accomplished through control of the distance between the semiconductor donor and the molecular acceptor and/or the free energy that accompanies electron transfer. Here we show that a kinetic pathway for electron transfer from a semiconductor to a molecular acceptor also exists and provides an alternative method for the control of interfacial kinetics. The pathway was identified by the rational design of molecules in which the distance and the driving force were held near parity and only the geometric torsion about a xylyl- or phenylthiophene bridge was varied. Electronic coupling through the phenyl bridge was a factor of ten greater than that through the xylyl bridge. Comparative studies revealed a significant bridge dependence for electron transfer that could not be rationalized by a change in distance or driving force. Instead, the data indicate an interfacial electron-transfer pathway that utilizes the aromatic bridge orbitals.",2
Self-assembled molecular p/n junctions for applications in dye-sensitized solar energy conversion.,"The achievement of long-lived photoinduced redox separation lifetimes has long been a central goal of molecular-based solar energy conversion strategies. The longer the redox-separation lifetime, the more time available for useful work to be extracted from the absorbed photon energy. Here we describe a novel strategy for dye-sensitized solar energy applications in which redox-separated lifetimes on the order of milliseconds to seconds can be achieved based on a simple toolkit of molecular components. Specifically, molecular chromophores (C), electron acceptors (A) and electron donors (D) were self-assembled on the surfaces of mesoporous, transparent conducting indium tin oxide nanoparticle (nanoITO) electrodes to prepare both photoanode (nanoITO|-A-C-D) and photocathode (nanoITO|-D-C-A) assemblies. Nanosecond transient-absorption and steady-state photolysis measurements show that the electrodes function microscopically as molecular analogues of semiconductor p/n junctions. These results point to a new chemical strategy for dye-sensitized solar energy conversion based on molecular excited states and electron acceptors/donors on the surfaces of transparent conducting oxide nanoparticle electrodes.",2
Installing hydrolytic activity into a completely de novo protein framework.,"The design of enzyme-like catalysts tests our understanding of sequence-to-structure/function relationships in proteins. Here we install hydrolytic activity predictably into a completely de novo and thermostable alpha-helical barrel, which comprises seven helices arranged around an accessible channel. We show that the lumen of the barrel accepts 21 mutations to functional polar residues. The resulting variant, which has cysteine-histidine-glutamic acid triads on each helix, hydrolyses p-nitrophenyl acetate with catalytic efficiencies that match the most-efficient redesigned hydrolases based on natural protein scaffolds. This is the first report of a functional catalytic triad engineered into a de novo protein framework. The flexibility of our system also allows the facile incorporation of unnatural side chains to improve activity and probe the catalytic mechanism. Such a predictable and robust construction of truly de novo biocatalysts holds promise for applications in chemical and biochemical synthesis.",2
Accurate first-principles structures and energies of diversely bonded systems from an efficient density functional.,"One atom or molecule binds to another through various types of bond, the strengths of which range from several meV to several eV. Although some computational methods can provide accurate descriptions of all bond types, those methods are not efficient enough for many studies (for example, large systems, ab initio molecular dynamics and high-throughput searches for functional materials). Here, we show that the recently developed non-empirical strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) meta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA) within the density functional theory framework predicts accurate geometries and energies of diversely bonded molecules and materials (including covalent, metallic, ionic, hydrogen and van der Waals bonds). This represents a significant improvement at comparable efficiency over its predecessors, the GGAs that currently dominate materials computation. Often, SCAN matches or improves on the accuracy of a computationally expensive hybrid functional, at almost-GGA cost. SCAN is therefore expected to have a broad impact on chemistry and materials science.",2
Oligomeric ferrocene rings.,"Cyclic oligomers comprising strongly interacting redox-active monomer units represent an unknown, yet highly desirable class of nanoscale materials. Here we describe the synthesis and properties of the first family of molecules belonging to this compound category-differently sized rings comprising only 1,1'-disubstituted ferrocene units (cyclo[n], n = 5-7, 9). Due to the close proximity and connectivity of centres (covalent Cp-Cp linkages; Cp = cyclopentadienyl) solution voltammograms exhibit well-resolved, separated 1e(-) waves. Theoretical interrogations into correlations based on ring size and charge state are facilitated using values of the equilibrium potentials of these transitions, as well as their relative spacing. As the interaction free energies between the redox centres scale linearly with overall ring charge and in conjunction with fast intramolecular electron transfer ( approximately 10(7) s(-1)), these molecules can be considered as uniformly charged nanorings (diameter approximately 1-2 nm).",2
Charge-transfer-directed radical substitution enables para-selective C-H functionalization.,"Efficient C-H functionalization requires selectivity for specific C-H bonds. Progress has been made for directed aromatic substitution reactions to achieve ortho and meta selectivity, but a general strategy for para-selective C-H functionalization has remained elusive. Herein we introduce a previously unappreciated concept that enables nearly complete para selectivity. We propose that radicals with high electron affinity elicit arene-to-radical charge transfer in the transition state of radical addition, which is the factor primarily responsible for high positional selectivity. We demonstrate with a simple theoretical tool that the selectivity is predictable and show the utility of the concept through a direct synthesis of aryl piperazines. Our results contradict the notion, widely held by organic chemists, that radical aromatic substitution reactions are inherently unselective. The concept of radical substitution directed by charge transfer could serve as the basis for the development of new, highly selective C-H functionalization reactions.",2
Catalyst design for natural-gas upgrading through oxybromination chemistry.,"Natural gas contains large volumes of light alkanes, and its abundant reserves make it an appealing feedstock for value-added chemicals and fuels. However, selectively activating the C-H bonds in these useful hydrocarbons is one of the greatest challenges in catalysis. Here we report an attractive oxybromination method for the one-step functionalization of methane under mild conditions that integrates gas-phase alkane bromination with heterogeneously catalysed HBr oxidation, a step that is usually executed separately. Catalyst-design strategies to provide optimal synergy between these two processes are discussed. Among many investigated material families, vanadium phosphate (VPO) is identified as the best oxybromination catalyst, as it provides selectivity for CH3Br up to 95% and stable operation for over 100 hours on stream. The outstanding performance of VPO is rationalized by its high activity in HBr oxidation and low propensity for methane and bromomethane oxidation. Data on the oxybromination of ethane and propane over VPO suggest that the reaction network for higher alkanes is more complex.",2
Organometallic neptunium(III) complexes.,"Studies of transuranic organometallic complexes provide a particularly valuable insight into covalent contributions to the metal-ligand bonding, in which the subtle differences between the transuranium actinide ions and their lighter lanthanide counterparts are of fundamental importance for the effective remediation of nuclear waste. Unlike the organometallic chemistry of uranium, which has focused strongly on U(III) and has seen some spectacular advances, that of the transuranics is significantly technically more challenging and has remained dormant. In the case of neptunium, it is limited mainly to Np(IV). Here we report the synthesis of three new Np(III) organometallic compounds and the characterization of their molecular and electronic structures. These studies suggest that Np(III) complexes could act as single-molecule magnets, and that the lower oxidation state of Np(II) is chemically accessible. In comparison with lanthanide analogues, significant d- and f-electron contributions to key Np(III) orbitals are observed, which shows that fundamental neptunium organometallic chemistry can provide new insights into the behaviour of f-elements.",2
Cyclic polymers from alkynes.,"Cyclic polymers have dramatically different physical properties compared with those of their equivalent linear counterparts. However, the exploration of cyclic polymers is limited because of the inherent challenges associated with their synthesis. Conjugated linear polyacetylenes are important materials for electrical conductivity, paramagnetic susceptibility, optical nonlinearity, photoconductivity, gas permeability, liquid crystallinity and chain helicity. However, their cyclic analogues are unknown, and therefore the ability to examine how a cyclic topology influences their properties is currently not possible. We have solved this challenge and now report a tungsten catalyst supported by a tetraanionic pincer ligand that can rapidly polymerize alkynes to form conjugated macrocycles in high yield. The catalyst works by tethering the ends of the polymer to the metal centre to overcome the inherent entropic penalty of cyclization. Gel-permeation chromatography, dynamic and static light scattering, viscometry and chemical tests are all consistent with theoretical predictions and provide unambiguous confirmation of a cyclic topology. Access to a wide variety of new cyclic polymers is now possible by simply choosing the appropriate alkyne monomer.",2
Synthesis and stability of xenon oxides Xe2O5 and Xe3O2 under pressure.,"The noble gases are the most inert group of the periodic table, but their reactivity increases with pressure. Diamond-anvil-cell experiments and ab initio modelling have been used to investigate a possible direct reaction between xenon and oxygen at high pressures. We have now synthesized two oxides below 100 GPa (Xe2O5 under oxygen-rich conditions, and Xe3O2 under oxygen-poor conditions), which shows that xenon is more reactive under pressure than predicted previously. Xe2O5 was observed using X-ray diffraction methods, its structure identified through ab initio random structure searching and confirmed using X-ray absorption and Raman spectroscopies. The experiments confirm the recent prediction of Xe3O2 as a stable xenon oxide under high pressure. Xenon atoms adopt mixed oxidation states of 0 and +4 in Xe3O2 and +4 and +6 in Xe2O5. Xe3O2 and Xe2O5 form extended networks that incorporate oxygen-sharing XeO4 squares, and Xe2O5 additionally incorporates oxygen-sharing XeO5 pyramids. Other xenon oxides (XeO2, XeO3) are expected to form at higher pressures.",2
Determination of photoelectrochemical water oxidation intermediates on haematite electrode surfaces using operando infrared spectroscopy.,"Semiconductor electrodes capable of using solar photons to drive water-splitting reactions, such as haematite (alpha-Fe2O3), have been the subject of tremendous interest over recent decades. The surface has been found to play a significant role in determining the efficiency of water oxidation with haematite; however, previous works have only allowed hypotheses to be formulated regarding the identity of relevant surface species. Here we investigate the water-oxidation reaction on haematite using infrared spectroscopy under photoelectrochemical (PEC) water-oxidation conditions. A potential- and light-dependent absorption peak at 898 cm(-1) is assigned to a Fe(IV)=O group, which is an intermediate in the PEC water-oxidation reaction. These results provide direct evidence of high-valent iron-oxo intermediates as the product of the first hole-transfer reaction on the haematite surface and represent an important step in establishing the mechanism of PEC water oxidation on semiconductor electrodes.",2
Catalytic enantioselective addition of organoboron reagents to fluoroketones controlled by electrostatic interactions.,"Organofluorine compounds are central to modern chemistry, and broadly applicable transformations that generate them efficiently and enantioselectively are in much demand. Here we introduce efficient catalytic methods for the addition of allyl and allenyl organoboron reagents to fluorine-substituted ketones. These reactions are facilitated by readily and inexpensively available catalysts and deliver versatile and otherwise difficult-to-access tertiary homoallylic alcohols in up to 98% yield and >99:1 enantiomeric ratio. Utility is highlighted by a concise enantioselective approach to the synthesis of the antiparasitic drug fluralaner (Bravecto, presently sold as the racemate). Different forms of ammonium-organofluorine interactions play a key role in the control of enantioselectivity. The greater understanding of various non-bonding interactions afforded by these studies should facilitate the future development of transformations that involve fluoroorganic entities.",2
High-resolution mapping of bifurcations in nonlinear biochemical circuits.,"Analog molecular circuits can exploit the nonlinear nature of biochemical reaction networks to compute low-precision outputs with fewer resources than digital circuits. This analog computation is similar to that employed by gene-regulation networks. Although digital systems have a tractable link between structure and function, the nonlinear and continuous nature of analog circuits yields an intricate functional landscape, which makes their design counter-intuitive, their characterization laborious and their analysis delicate. Here, using droplet-based microfluidics, we map with high resolution and dimensionality the bifurcation diagrams of two synthetic, out-of-equilibrium and nonlinear programs: a bistable DNA switch and a predator-prey DNA oscillator. The diagrams delineate where function is optimal, dynamics bifurcates and models fail. Inverse problem solving on these large-scale data sets indicates interference from enzymatic coupling. Additionally, data mining exposes the presence of rare, stochastically bursting oscillators near deterministic bifurcations.",2
Diindeno-fusion of an anthracene as a design strategy for stable organic biradicals.,"The consequence of unpaired electrons in organic molecules has fascinated and confounded chemists for over a century. The study of open-shell molecules has been rekindled in recent years as new synthetic methods, improved spectroscopic techniques and powerful computational tools have been brought to bear on this field. Nonetheless, it is the intrinsic instability of the biradical species that limits the practicality of this research. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of a molecule based on the diindeno[b,i]anthracene framework that exhibits pronounced open-shell character yet possesses remarkable stability. The synthetic route is rapid, efficient and possible on the gram scale. The molecular structure was confirmed through single-crystal X-ray diffraction. From variable-temperature Raman spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility measurements a thermally accessible triplet excited state was found. Organic field-effect transistor device data show an ambipolar performance with balanced electron and hole mobilities. Our results demonstrate the rational design and synthesis of an air- and temperature-stable biradical compound.",2
In situ real-time imaging of self-sorted supramolecular nanofibres.,"Self-sorted supramolecular nanofibres-a multicomponent system that consists of several types of fibre, each composed of distinct building units-play a crucial role in complex, well-organized systems with sophisticated functions, such as living cells. Designing and controlling self-sorting events in synthetic materials and understanding their structures and dynamics in detail are important elements in developing functional artificial systems. Here, we describe the in situ real-time imaging of self-sorted supramolecular nanofibre hydrogels consisting of a peptide gelator and an amphiphilic phosphate. The use of appropriate fluorescent probes enabled the visualization of self-sorted fibres entangled in two and three dimensions through confocal laser scanning microscopy and super-resolution imaging, with 80 nm resolution. In situ time-lapse imaging showed that the two types of fibre have different formation rates and that their respective physicochemical properties remain intact in the gel. Moreover, we directly visualized stochastic non-synchronous fibre formation and observed a cooperative mechanism.",2
Neutral zero-valent s-block complexes with strong multiple bonding.,"The metals of the s block of the periodic table are well known to be exceptional electron donors, and the vast majority of their molecular complexes therefore contain these metals in their fully oxidized form. Low-valent main-group compounds have recently become desirable synthetic targets owing to their interesting reactivities, sometimes on a par with those of transition-metal complexes. In this work, we used stabilizing cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene ligands to isolate and characterize the first neutral compounds that contain a zero-valent s-block metal, beryllium. These brightly coloured complexes display very short beryllium-carbon bond lengths and linear beryllium coordination geometries, indicative of strong multiple Be-C bonding. Structural, spectroscopic and theoretical results show that the complexes adopt a closed-shell singlet configuration with a Be(0) metal centre. The surprising stability of the molecule can be ascribed to an unusually strong three-centre two-electron pi bond across the C-Be-C unit.",2
Dissipative self-assembly of vesicular nanoreactors.,"Dissipative self-assembly is exploited by nature to control important biological functions, such as cell division, motility and signal transduction. The ability to construct synthetic supramolecular assemblies that require the continuous consumption of energy to remain in the functional state is an essential premise for the design of synthetic systems with lifelike properties. Here, we show a new strategy for the dissipative self-assembly of functional supramolecular structures with high structural complexity. It relies on the transient stabilization of vesicles through noncovalent interactions between the surfactants and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which acts as the chemical fuel. It is shown that the lifetime of the vesicles can be regulated by controlling the hydrolysis rate of ATP. The vesicles sustain a chemical reaction but only as long as chemical fuel is present to keep the system in the out-of-equilibrium state. The lifetime of the vesicles determines the amount of reaction product produced by the system.",2
Fabrication of carbon nanorods and graphene nanoribbons from a metal-organic framework.,"One- and two-dimensional carbon nanomaterials are attracting considerable attention because of their extraordinary electrical, mechanical and thermal properties, which could lead to a range of important potential applications. Synthetic processes associated with making these materials can be quite complex and also consume large amounts of energy, so a major challenge is to develop simple and efficient methods to produce them. Here, we present a self-templated, catalyst-free strategy for the synthesis of one-dimensional carbon nanorods by morphology-preserved thermal transformation of rod-shaped metal-organic frameworks. The as-synthesized non-hollow (solid) carbon nanorods can be transformed into two- to six-layered graphene nanoribbons through sonochemical treatment followed by chemical activation. The performance of these metal-organic framework-derived carbon nanorods and graphene nanoribbons in supercapacitor electrodes demonstrates that this synthetic approach can produce functionally useful materials. Moreover, this approach is readily scalable and could be used to produce carbon nanorods and graphene nanoribbons on industrial levels.",2
Dynamic control over supramolecular handedness by selecting chiral induction pathways at the solution-solid interface.,"A dominant theme within the research on two-dimensional chirality is the sergeant-soldiers principle, wherein a small fraction of chiral molecules (sergeants) is used to skew the handedness of achiral molecules (soldiers) to generate a homochiral surface. Here, we have combined the sergeant-soldiers principle with temperature-dependent molecular self-assembly to unravel a peculiar chiral amplification mechanism at the solution-solid interface in which, depending on the concentration of a sergeant-soldiers solution, the majority handedness of the system can either be amplified or entirely reversed after an annealing step, furnishing a homochiral surface. Two discrete pathways that affect different stages of two-dimensional crystal growth are invoked for rationalizing this phenomenon and we present a set of experiments where the access to each pathway can be precisely controlled. These results demonstrate that a detailed understanding of subtle intermolecular and interfacial interactions can be used to induce drastic changes in the handedness of a supramolecular network.",2
In situ mapping of the energy flow through the entire photosynthetic apparatus.,"Absorption of sunlight is the first step in photosynthesis, which provides energy for the vast majority of organisms on Earth. The primary processes of photosynthesis have been studied extensively in isolated light-harvesting complexes and reaction centres, however, to understand fully the way in which organisms capture light it is crucial to also reveal the functional relationships between the individual complexes. Here we report the use of two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy to track directly the excitation-energy flow through the entire photosynthetic system of green sulfur bacteria. We unravel the functional organization of individual complexes in the photosynthetic unit and show that, whereas energy is transferred within subunits on a timescale of subpicoseconds to a few picoseconds, across the complexes the energy flows at a timescale of tens of picoseconds. Thus, we demonstrate that the bottleneck of energy transfer is between the constituents.",2
A synthetic molecular system capable of mirror-image genetic replication and transcription.,"The overwhelmingly homochiral nature of life has left a puzzle as to whether mirror-image biological systems based on a chirally inverted version of molecular machinery could also have existed. Here we report that two key steps in the central dogma of molecular biology, the template-directed polymerization of DNA and transcription into RNA, can be catalysed by a chemically synthesized D-amino acid polymerase on an L-DNA template. We also show that two chirally mirrored versions of the 174-residue African swine fever virus polymerase X could operate in a racemic mixture without significant enantiomeric cross-inhibition to the activity of each other. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a functionally active L-DNAzyme could be enzymatically produced using the D-amino acid polymerase. The establishment of such molecular systems with an opposite handedness highlights the potential to exploit enzymatically produced mirror-image biomolecules as research and therapeutic tools.",2
The structural and chemical origin of the oxygen redox activity in layered and cation-disordered Li-excess cathode materials.,"Lithium-ion batteries are now reaching the energy density limits set by their electrode materials, requiring new paradigms for Li(+) and electron hosting in solid-state electrodes. Reversible oxygen redox in the solid state in particular has the potential to enable high energy density as it can deliver excess capacity beyond the theoretical transition-metal redox-capacity at a high voltage. Nevertheless, the structural and chemical origin of the process is not understood, preventing the rational design of better cathode materials. Here, we demonstrate how very specific local Li-excess environments around oxygen atoms necessarily lead to labile oxygen electrons that can be more easily extracted and participate in the practical capacity of cathodes. The identification of the local structural components that create oxygen redox sets a new direction for the design of high-energy-density cathode materials.",2
Charge-compensation in 3d-transition-metal-oxide intercalation cathodes through the generation of localized electron holes on oxygen.,"During the charging and discharging of lithium-ion-battery cathodes through the de- and reintercalation of lithium ions, electroneutrality is maintained by transition-metal redox chemistry, which limits the charge that can be stored. However, for some transition-metal oxides this limit can be broken and oxygen loss and/or oxygen redox reactions have been proposed to explain the phenomenon. We present operando mass spectrometry of (18)O-labelled Li1.2[Ni0.13(2+)Co0.13(3+)Mn0.54(4+)]O2, which demonstrates that oxygen is extracted from the lattice on charging a Li1.2[Ni0.13(2+)Co0.13(3+)Mn0.54(4+)]O2 cathode, although we detected no O2 evolution. Combined soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy, resonant inelastic X-ray scattering spectroscopy, X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy demonstrates that, in addition to oxygen loss, Li(+) removal is charge compensated by the formation of localized electron holes on O atoms coordinated by Mn(4+) and Li(+) ions, which serve to promote the localization, and not the formation, of true O2(2-) (peroxide, O-O ~1.45 A) species. The quantity of charge compensated by oxygen removal and by the formation of electron holes on the O atoms is estimated, and for the case described here the latter dominates.",2
Imaging single-molecule reaction intermediates stabilized by surface dissipation and entropy.,"Chemical transformations at the interface between solid/liquid or solid/gaseous phases of matter lie at the heart of key industrial-scale manufacturing processes. A comprehensive study of the molecular energetics and conformational dynamics that underlie these transformations is often limited to ensemble-averaging analytical techniques. Here we report the detailed investigation of a surface-catalysed cross-coupling and sequential cyclization cascade of 1,2-bis(2-ethynyl phenyl)ethyne on Ag(100). Using non-contact atomic force microscopy, we imaged the single-bond-resolved chemical structure of transient metastable intermediates. Theoretical simulations indicate that the kinetic stabilization of experimentally observable intermediates is determined not only by the potential-energy landscape, but also by selective energy dissipation to the substrate and entropic changes associated with key transformations along the reaction pathway. The microscopic insights gained here pave the way for the rational design and control of complex organic reactions at the surface of heterogeneous catalysts.",2
Reversible S-nitrosylation in an engineered azurin.,"S-Nitrosothiols are known as reagents for NO storage and transportation and as regulators in many physiological processes. Although the S-nitrosylation catalysed by haem proteins is well known, no direct evidence of S-nitrosylation in copper proteins has been reported. Here, we report reversible insertion of NO into a copper-thiolate bond in an engineered copper centre in Pseudomonas aeruginosa azurin by rational design of the primary coordination sphere and tuning its reduction potential by deleting a hydrogen bond in the secondary coordination sphere. The results not only provide the first direct evidence of S-nitrosylation of Cu(II)-bound cysteine in metalloproteins, but also shed light on the reaction mechanism and structural features responsible for stabilizing the elusive Cu(I)-S(Cys)NO species. The fast, efficient and reversible S-nitrosylation reaction is used to demonstrate its ability to prevent NO inhibition of cytochrome bo3 oxidase activity by competing for NO binding with the native enzyme under physiologically relevant conditions.",2
A motif for reversible nitric oxide interactions in metalloenzymes.,"Nitric oxide (NO) participates in numerous biological processes, such as signalling in the respiratory system and vasodilation in the cardiovascular system. Many metal-mediated processes involve direct reaction of NO to form a metal-nitrosyl (M-NO), as occurs at the Fe(2+) centres of soluble guanylate cyclase or cytochrome c oxidase. However, some copper electron-transfer proteins that bear a type 1 Cu site (His2Cu-Cys) reversibly bind NO by an unknown motif. Here, we use model complexes of type 1 Cu sites based on tris(pyrazolyl)borate copper thiolates [Cu(II)]-SR to unravel the factors involved in NO reactivity. Addition of NO provides the fully characterized S-nitrosothiol adduct [Cu(I)](kappa(1)-N(O)SR), which reversibly loses NO on purging with an inert gas. Computational analysis outlines a low-barrier pathway for the capture and release of NO. These findings suggest a new motif for reversible binding of NO at bioinorganic metal centres that can interconvert NO and RSNO molecular signals at copper sites.",2
Quasicrystallinity expressed in two-dimensional coordination networks.,"The recognition of quasicrystals, which exhibit long-range order but lack translational symmetry, represented both the introduction of a new class of materials and a transformative breakthrough in crystallography. Concomitant with the exploration of quasicrystallinity, metal-organic architectures emerged as promising and versatile systems with significant application potential. Their building principles have been studied extensively and become manifest in a multitude of intricate amorphous and crystalline phases. To date, however, indications for quasicrystalline order have been elusive in metal-organic coordination networks (MOCNs). Here we employ rare-earth-directed assembly to construct a two-dimensional tiling with quasicrystalline characteristics at a well-defined gold substrate. By careful stoichiometry control over europium centres and functional linkers, we produced a porous network, including the simultaneous expression of four-fold, five-fold and six-fold vertices. The pertaining features were directly inspected by scanning tunnelling microscopy, and the molecule-europium reticulation was recognized as square-triangle tessellation with dodecagonal symmetry. Our findings introduce quasicrystallinity in surface-confined MOCNs with a nanoporous structure and anticipate functionalities that arise from quasicrystalline ordering of the coordinative spheres.",2
Dynamic molecular crystals with switchable physical properties.,"The development of molecular materials whose physical properties can be controlled by external stimuli - such as light, electric field, temperature, and pressure - has recently attracted much attention owing to their potential applications in molecular devices. There are a number of ways to alter the physical properties of crystalline materials. These include the modulation of the spin and redox states of the crystal's components, or the incorporation within the crystalline lattice of tunable molecules that exhibit stimuli-induced changes in their molecular structure. A switching behaviour can also be induced by changing the molecular orientation of the crystal's components, even in cases where the overall molecular structure is not affected. Controlling intermolecular interactions within a molecular material is also an effective tool to modulate its physical properties. This Review discusses recent advances in the development of such stimuli-responsive, switchable crystalline compounds - referred to here as dynamic molecular crystals - and suggests how different approaches can serve to prepare functional materials.",2
Fast response dry-type artificial molecular muscles with [c2]daisy chains.,"Hierarchically organized myosin and actin filaments found in biological systems exhibit contraction and expansion behaviours that produce work and force by consuming chemical energy. Inspired by these naturally occurring examples, we have developed photoresponsive wet- and dry-type molecular actuators built from rotaxane-based compounds known as [c2]daisy chains (specifically, [c2]AzoCD2 hydrogel and [c2]AzoCD2 xerogel). These actuators were prepared via polycondensation between four-armed poly(ethylene glycol) and a [c2]daisy chain based on alpha-cyclodextrin as the host component and azobenzene as a photoresponsive guest component. The light-induced actuation arises from the sliding motion of the [c2]daisy chain unit. Ultraviolet irradiation caused the gels to bend towards the light source. The response of the [c2]AzoCD2 xerogel, even under dry conditions, is very fast (7 degrees every second), which is 10,800 times faster than the [c2]AzoCD2 hydrogel (7 degrees every 3 h). In addition, the [c2]AzoCD2 xerogel was used as a crane arm to lift an object using ultraviolet irradiation to produce mechanical work.",2
A highly stretchable autonomous self-healing elastomer.,"It is a challenge to synthesize materials that possess the properties of biological muscles-strong, elastic and capable of self-healing. Herein we report a network of poly(dimethylsiloxane) polymer chains crosslinked by coordination complexes that combines high stretchability, high dielectric strength, autonomous self-healing and mechanical actuation. The healing process can take place at a temperature as low as -20 degrees C and is not significantly affected by surface ageing and moisture. The crosslinking complexes used consist of 2,6-pyridinedicarboxamide ligands that coordinate to Fe(III) centres through three different interactions: a strong pyridyl-iron one, and two weaker carboxamido-iron ones through both the nitrogen and oxygen atoms of the carboxamide groups. As a result, the iron-ligand bonds can readily break and re-form while the iron centres still remain attached to the ligands through the stronger interaction with the pyridyl ring, which enables reversible unfolding and refolding of the chains. We hypothesize that this behaviour supports the high stretchability and self-healing capability of the material.",2
Parameterization of phosphine ligands reveals mechanistic pathways and predicts reaction outcomes.,"The mechanistic foundation behind the identity of a phosphine ligand that best promotes a desired reaction outcome is often non-intuitive, and thus has been addressed in numerous experimental and theoretical studies. In this work, multivariate correlations of reaction outcomes using 38 different phosphine ligands were combined with classic potentiometric analyses to study a Suzuki reaction, for which the site selectivity of oxidative addition is highly dependent on the nature of the phosphine. These studies shed light on the generality of hypotheses regarding the structural influence of different classes of phosphine ligands on the reaction mechanism(s), and deliver a methodology that should prove useful in future studies of phosphine ligands.",2
Tuning the driving force for exciton dissociation in single-walled carbon nanotube heterojunctions.,"Understanding the kinetics and energetics of interfacial electron transfer in molecular systems is crucial for the development of a broad array of technologies, including photovoltaics, solar fuel systems and energy storage. The Marcus formulation for electron transfer relates the thermodynamic driving force and reorganization energy for charge transfer between a given donor/acceptor pair to the kinetics and yield of electron transfer. Here we investigated the influence of the thermodynamic driving force for photoinduced electron transfer (PET) between single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and fullerene derivatives by employing time-resolved microwave conductivity as a sensitive probe of interfacial exciton dissociation. For the first time, we observed the Marcus inverted region (in which driving force exceeds reorganization energy) and quantified the reorganization energy for PET for a model SWCNT/acceptor system. The small reorganization energies (about 130 meV, most of which probably arises from the fullerene acceptors) are beneficial in minimizing energy loss in photoconversion schemes.",2
Covalent functionalization and passivation of exfoliated black phosphorus via aryl diazonium chemistry.,"Functionalization of atomically thin nanomaterials enables the tailoring of their chemical, optical and electronic properties. Exfoliated black phosphorus (BP)-a layered two-dimensional semiconductor-exhibits favourable charge-carrier mobility, tunable bandgap and highly anisotropic properties, but it is chemically reactive and degrades rapidly in ambient conditions. Here we show that covalent aryl diazonium functionalization suppresses the chemical degradation of exfoliated BP even after three weeks of ambient exposure. This chemical modification scheme spontaneously forms phosphorus-carbon bonds, has a reaction rate sensitive to the aryl diazonium substituent and alters the electronic properties of exfoliated BP, ultimately yielding a strong, tunable p-type doping that simultaneously improves the field-effect transistor mobility and on/off current ratio. This chemical functionalization pathway controllably modifies the properties of exfoliated BP, and thus improves its prospects for nanoelectronic applications.",2
Sequence-defined bioactive macrocycles via an acid-catalysed cascade reaction.,"Synthetic macrocycles derived from sequence-defined oligomers are a unique structural class whose ring size, sequence and structure can be tuned via precise organization of the primary sequence. Similar to peptides and other peptidomimetics, these well-defined synthetic macromolecules become pharmacologically relevant when bioactive side chains are incorporated into their primary sequence. In this article, we report the synthesis of oligothioetheramide (oligoTEA) macrocycles via a one-pot acid-catalysed cascade reaction. The versatility of the cyclization chemistry and modularity of the assembly process was demonstrated via the synthesis of >20 diverse oligoTEA macrocycles. Structural characterization via NMR spectroscopy revealed the presence of conformational isomers, which enabled the determination of local chain dynamics within the macromolecular structure. Finally, we demonstrate the biological activity of oligoTEA macrocycles designed to mimic facially amphiphilic antimicrobial peptides. The preliminary results indicate that macrocyclic oligoTEAs with just two-to-three cationic charge centres can elicit potent antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.",2
Controlling activity and selectivity using water in the Au-catalysed preferential oxidation of CO in H2.,"Industrial hydrogen production through methane steam reforming exceeds 50 million tons annually and accounts for 2-5% of global energy consumption. The hydrogen product, even after processing by the water-gas shift, still typically contains approximately 1% CO, which must be removed for many applications. Methanation (CO + 3H2 --> CH4 + H2O) is an effective solution to this problem, but consumes 5-15% of the generated hydrogen. The preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO with O2 in hydrogen represents a more-efficient solution. Supported gold nanoparticles, with their high CO-oxidation activity and notoriously low hydrogenation activity, have long been examined as PROX catalysts, but have shown disappointingly low activity and selectivity. Here we show that, under the proper conditions, a commercial Au/Al2O3 catalyst can remove CO to below 10 ppm and still maintain an O2-to-CO2 selectivity of 80-90%. The key to maximizing the catalyst activity and selectivity is to carefully control the feed-flow rate and maintain one to two monolayers of water (a key CO-oxidation co-catalyst) on the catalyst surface.",2
A supramolecular ruthenium macrocycle with high catalytic activity for water oxidation that mechanistically mimics photosystem II.,"Mimicking the ingenuity of nature and exploiting the billions of years over which natural selection has developed numerous effective biochemical conversions is one of the most successful strategies in a chemist's toolbox. However, an inability to replicate the elegance and efficiency of the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II (OEC-PSII) in its oxidation of water into O2 is a significant bottleneck in the development of a closed-loop sustainable energy cycle. Here, we present an artificial metallosupramolecular macrocycle that gathers three Ru(bda) centres (bda = 2,2'-bipyridine-6,6'-dicarboxylic acid) that catalyses water oxidation. The macrocyclic architecture accelerates the rate of water oxidation via a water nucleophilic attack mechanism, similar to the mechanism exhibited by OEC-PSII, and reaches remarkable catalytic turnover frequencies >100 s(-1). Photo-driven water oxidation yields outstanding activity, even in the nM concentration regime, with a turnover number of >1,255 and turnover frequency of >13.1 s(-1).",2
Membraneless organelles can melt nucleic acid duplexes and act as biomolecular filters.,"Membraneless organelles are cellular compartments made from drops of liquid protein inside a cell. These compartments assemble via the phase separation of disordered regions of proteins in response to changes in the cellular environment and the cell cycle. Here we demonstrate that the solvent environment within the interior of these cellular bodies behaves more like an organic solvent than like water. One of the most-stable biological structures known, the DNA double helix, can be melted once inside the liquid droplet, and simultaneously structures formed from regulatory single-stranded nucleic acids are stabilized. Moreover, proteins are shown to have a wide range of absorption or exclusion from these bodies, and can act as importers for otherwise-excluded nucleic acids, which suggests the existence of a protein-mediated trafficking system. A common strategy in organic chemistry is to utilize different solvents to influence the behaviour of molecules and reactions. These results reveal that cells have also evolved this capability by exploiting the interiors of membraneless organelles.",2
Experimental realization of two-dimensional boron sheets.,"A variety of two-dimensional materials have been reported in recent years, yet single-element systems such as graphene and black phosphorus have remained rare. Boron analogues have been predicted, as boron atoms possess a short covalent radius and the flexibility to adopt sp(2) hybridization, features that favour the formation of two-dimensional allotropes, and one example of such a borophene material has been reported recently. Here, we present a parallel experimental work showing that two-dimensional boron sheets can be grown epitaxially on a Ag(111) substrate. Two types of boron sheet, a beta12 sheet and a chi3 sheet, both exhibiting a triangular lattice but with different arrangements of periodic holes, are observed by scanning tunnelling microscopy. Density functional theory simulations agree well with experiments, and indicate that both sheets are planar without obvious vertical undulations. The boron sheets are quite inert to oxidization and interact only weakly with their substrate. We envisage that such boron sheets may find applications in electronic devices in the future.",2
Evolution of thermophilic DNA polymerases for the recognition and amplification of C2'-modified DNA.,"The PCR amplification of oligonucleotides enables the evolution of sequences called aptamers that bind specific targets with antibody-like affinity. However, in many applications the use of these aptamers is limited by nuclease-mediated degradation. In contrast, oligonucleotides that are modified at their sugar C2' positions with methoxy or fluorine substituents are stable to nucleases, but they cannot be synthesized by natural polymerases. Here we report the development of a polymerase-evolution system and its use to evolve thermostable polymerases that efficiently interconvert C2'-OMe-modified oligonucleotides and their DNA counterparts via 'transcription' and 'reverse transcription' or, more importantly, that PCR-amplify partially C2'-OMe- or C2'-F-modified oligonucleotides. A mechanistic analysis demonstrates that the ability to amplify the modified oligonucleotides evolved by optimizing interdomain interactions that stabilize the catalytically competent closed conformation of the polymerase. The evolved polymerases should find practical applications and the developed evolution system should be a powerful tool for tailoring polymerases to have other types of novel function.",2
Detecting the oxyl radical of photocatalytic water oxidation at an n-SrTiO3/aqueous interface through its subsurface vibration.,"Although the water oxidation cycle involves the critical step of O-O bond formation, the transition metal oxide radical thought to be the catalytic intermediate for this step has eluded direct observation. The radical represents the transformation of charge into a nascent catalytic intermediate, which lacks a newly formed bond and is therefore inherently difficult to detect. Here, using theoretical calculations and ultrafast in situ infrared spectroscopy of photocatalysis at an n-SrTiO3/aqueous interface, we reveal a subsurface vibration of the oxygen directly below, and uniquely generated by, the oxyl radical (Ti-O(*)). Intriguingly, this interfacial Ti-O stretch vibration, once decoupled from the lattice, couples to reactant dynamics (water librations). These experiments demonstrate subsurface vibrations and their coupling to solvent and electron dynamics to detect nascent catalytic intermediates at the solid-liquid interface at the molecular level. One can envision using the subsurface vibrations and their coupling across the interface to track and control catalysis dynamically.",2
An autonomous molecular assembler for programmable chemical synthesis.,"Molecular machines that assemble polymers in a programmed sequence are fundamental to life. They are also an achievable goal of nanotechnology. Here, we report synthetic molecular machinery made from DNA that controls and records the formation of covalent bonds. We show that an autonomous cascade of DNA hybridization reactions can create oligomers, from building blocks linked by olefin or peptide bonds, with a sequence defined by a reconfigurable molecular program. The system can also be programmed to achieve combinatorial assembly. The sequence of assembly reactions and thus the structure of each oligomer synthesized is recorded in a DNA molecule, which enables this information to be recovered by PCR amplification followed by DNA sequencing.",2
Counting on natural products for drug design.,"Natural products and their molecular frameworks have a long tradition as valuable starting points for medicinal chemistry and drug discovery. Recently, there has been a revitalization of interest in the inclusion of these chemotypes in compound collections for screening and achieving selective target modulation. Here we discuss natural-product-inspired drug discovery with a focus on recent advances in the design of synthetically tractable small molecules that mimic nature's chemistry. We highlight the potential of innovative computational tools in processing structurally complex natural products to predict their macromolecular targets and attempt to forecast the role that natural-product-derived fragments and fragment-like natural products will play in next-generation drug discovery.",2
Synthesis of a distinct water dimer inside fullerene C70.,"The water dimer is an ideal chemical species with which to study hydrogen bonds. Owing to the equilibrium between the monomer and oligomer structure, however, selective generation and separation of a genuine water dimer has not yet been achieved. Here, we report a synthetic strategy that leads to the successful encapsulation of one or two water molecules inside fullerene C70. These endohedral C70 compounds offer the opportunity to study the intrinsic properties of a single water molecule without any hydrogen bonding, as well as an isolated water dimer with a single hydrogen bond between the two molecules. The unambiguously determined off-centre position of water in (H2O)2@C70 by X-ray diffraction provides insights into the formation of (H2O)2@C70. Subsequently, the (1)H NMR spectroscopic measurements for (H2O)2@C70 confirmed the formation of a single hydrogen bond rapidly interchanging between the encapsulated water dimer. Our theoretical calculations revealed a peculiar cis-linear conformation of the dimer resulting from confinement effects inside C70.",2
Unimolecular dissociation dynamics of vibrationally activated CH3CHOO Criegee intermediates to OH radical products.,"The hydroxyl radical is an important atmospheric oxidant, and a significant source of its production occurs through alkene ozonolysis. This takes place via a cycloaddition reaction and subsequent fragmentation to form an energized carbonyl oxide (for example, CH3CHOO), known as a Criegee intermediate, which can then either react with another atmospheric species or decay and, in doing so, produce the hydroxyl radical. Here, we examine the dissociation dynamics of a prototypical Criegee intermediate by characterizing the translational and internal energy distributions of the OH radical products, which reflect critical configurations along the reaction pathway. Experimentally, the kinetic energy release to OH products is ascertained through velocity map imaging. Theoretically, quasi-classical trajectories are performed on a new full-dimensional, ab initio potential energy surface. Both experiment and theory show that most of the available energy flows into internal excitation of the vinoxy products. The isotropic angular distribution of OH fragments indicates that dissociation occurs in >/=2 ps, in agreement with theory.",2
Charge-ordering transition in iron oxide Fe4O5 involving competing dimer and trimer formation.,"Phase transitions that occur in materials, driven, for instance, by changes in temperature or pressure, can dramatically change the materials' properties. Discovering new types of transitions and understanding their mechanisms is important not only from a fundamental perspective, but also for practical applications. Here we investigate a recently discovered Fe4O5 that adopts an orthorhombic CaFe3O5-type crystal structure that features linear chains of Fe ions. On cooling below approximately 150 K, Fe4O5 undergoes an unusual charge-ordering transition that involves competing dimeric and trimeric ordering within the chains of Fe ions. This transition is concurrent with a significant increase in electrical resistivity. Magnetic-susceptibility measurements and neutron diffraction establish the formation of a collinear antiferromagnetic order above room temperature and a spin canting at 85 K that gives rise to spontaneous magnetization. We discuss possible mechanisms of this transition and compare it with the trimeronic charge ordering observed in magnetite below the Verwey transition temperature.",2
Carbon-sulfur bond-forming reaction catalysed by the radical SAM enzyme HydE.,"Carbon-sulfur bond formation at aliphatic positions is a challenging reaction that is performed efficiently by radical S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) enzymes. Here we report that 1,3-thiazolidines can act as ligands and substrates for the radical SAM enzyme HydE, which is involved in the assembly of the active site of [FeFe]-hydrogenase. Using X-ray crystallography, in vitro assays and NMR spectroscopy we identified a radical-based reaction mechanism that is best described as the formation of a C-centred radical that concomitantly attacks the sulfur atom of a thioether. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a radical SAM enzyme that reacts directly on a sulfur atom instead of abstracting a hydrogen atom. Using theoretical calculations based on our high-resolution structures we followed the evolution of the electronic structure from SAM through to the formation of S-adenosyl-L-cysteine. Our results suggest that, at least in this case, the widely proposed and highly reactive 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical species that triggers the reaction in radical SAM enzymes is not an isolable intermediate.",2
Molecular rectifier composed of DNA with high rectification ratio enabled by intercalation.,"The predictability, diversity and programmability of DNA make it a leading candidate for the design of functional electronic devices that use single molecules, yet its electron transport properties have not been fully elucidated. This is primarily because of a poor understanding of how the structure of DNA determines its electron transport. Here, we demonstrate a DNA-based molecular rectifier constructed by site-specific intercalation of small molecules (coralyne) into a custom-designed 11-base-pair DNA duplex. Measured current-voltage curves of the DNA-coralyne molecular junction show unexpectedly large rectification with a rectification ratio of about 15 at 1.1 V, a counter-intuitive finding considering the seemingly symmetrical molecular structure of the junction. A non-equilibrium Green's function-based model-parameterized by density functional theory calculations-revealed that the coralyne-induced spatial asymmetry in the electron state distribution caused the observed rectification. This inherent asymmetry leads to changes in the coupling of the molecular HOMO-1 level to the electrodes when an external voltage is applied, resulting in an asymmetric change in transmission.",2
Self-assembly of size-controlled liposomes on DNA nanotemplates.,"Artificial lipid-bilayer membranes are valuable tools for the study of membrane structure and dynamics. For applications such as the study of vesicular transport and drug delivery, there is a pressing need for artificial vesicles with controlled size. However, controlling vesicle size and shape with nanometre precision is challenging, and approaches to achieve this can be heavily affected by lipid composition. Here, we present a bio-inspired templating method to generate highly monodispersed sub-100-nm unilamellar vesicles, where liposome self-assembly was nucleated and confined inside rigid DNA nanotemplates. Using this method, we produce homogeneous liposomes with four distinct predefined sizes. We also show that the method can be used with a variety of lipid compositions and probe the mechanism of templated liposome formation by capturing key intermediates during membrane self-assembly. The DNA nanotemplating strategy represents a conceptually novel way to guide lipid bilayer formation and could be generalized to engineer complex membrane/protein structures with nanoscale precision.",2
Controlled growth of high-density CdS and CdSe nanorod arrays on selective facets of two-dimensional semiconductor nanoplates.,"The rational synthesis of hierarchical three-dimensional nanostructures with specific compositions, morphologies and functionalities is important for applications in a variety of fields ranging from energy conversion and electronics to biotechnology. Here, we report a seeded growth approach for the controlled epitaxial growth of three types of hierarchical one-dimensional (1D)/two-dimensional (2D) nanostructures, where nanorod arrays of II-VI semiconductor CdS or CdSe are grown on the selective facets of hexagonal-shaped nanoplates, either on the two basal facets of the nanoplate, or on one basal facet, or on the two basal facets and six side facets. The seed engineering of 2D hexagonal-shaped nanoplates is the key factor for growth of the three resulting types of 1D/2D nanostructures. The wurtzite- and zinc-blende-type polymorphs of semiconductors are used to determine the facet-selective epitaxial growth of 1D nanorod arrays, resulting in the formation of different hierarchical three-dimensional (3D) nanostructures.",2
Chemical polyglycosylation and nanolitre detection enables single-molecule recapitulation of bacterial sugar export.,"The outermost protective layer of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria is composed of bacterial capsular polysaccharides. Insights into the interactions between the capsular polysaccharide and its transporter and the mechanism of sugar export would not only increase our understanding of this key process, but would also help in the design of novel therapeutics to block capsular polysaccharide export. Here, we report a nanolitre detection system that makes use of the bilayer interface between two droplets, and we use this system to study single-molecule recapitulation of sugar export. A synthetic strategy of polyglycosylation based on tetrasaccharide monomers enables ready synthetic access to extended fragments of K30 oligosaccharides and polysaccharides. Examination of the interactions between the Escherichia coli sugar transporter Wza and very small amounts of fragments of the K30 capsular polysaccharide substrate reveal the translocation of smaller but not larger fragments. We also observe capture events that occur only on the intracellular side of Wza, which would complement coordinated feeding by adjunct biosynthetic machinery.",2
Carbon dioxide transport in molten calcium carbonate occurs through an oxo-Grotthuss mechanism via a pyrocarbonate anion.,"The reactivity, speciation and solvation structure of CO2 in carbonate melts are relevant for both the fate of carbon in deep geological formations and for its electroreduction to CO (to be used as fuel) when solvated in a molten carbonate electrolyte. In particular, the high solubility of CO2 in carbonate melts has been tentatively attributed to the formation of the pyrocarbonate anion, C2O5(2-). Here we study, by first-principles molecular dynamics simulations, the behaviour of CO2 in molten calcium carbonate. We find that pyrocarbonate forms spontaneously and the identity of the CO2 molecule is quickly lost through O(2-) exchange. The transport of CO2 in this molten carbonate thus occurs in a fashion similar to the Grotthuss mechanism in water, and is three times faster than molecular diffusion. This shows that Grotthuss-like transport is more general than previously thought.",2
A simple physical mechanism enables homeostasis in primitive cells.,"The emergence of homeostatic mechanisms that enable maintenance of an intracellular steady state during growth was critical to the advent of cellular life. Here, we show that concentration-dependent reversible binding of short oligonucleotides, of both specific and random sequence, can modulate ribozyme activity. In both cases, catalysis is inhibited at high concentrations, and dilution activates the ribozyme via inhibitor dissociation, thus maintaining near-constant ribozyme specific activity throughout protocell growth. To mimic the result of RNA synthesis within non-growing protocells, we co-encapsulated high concentrations of ribozyme and oligonucleotides within fatty acid vesicles, and ribozyme activity was inhibited. Following vesicle growth, the resulting internal dilution produced ribozyme activation. This simple physical system enables a primitive homeostatic behaviour: the maintenance of constant ribozyme activity per unit volume during protocell volume changes. We suggest that such systems, wherein short oligonucleotides reversibly inhibit functional RNAs, could have preceded sophisticated modern RNA regulatory mechanisms, such as those involving miRNAs.",2
Encoding complexity within supramolecular analogues of frustrated magnets.,"The solid phases of gold(I) and/or silver(I) cyanides are supramolecular assemblies of inorganic polymer chains in which the key structural degrees of freedom-namely, the relative vertical shifts of neighbouring chains-are mathematically equivalent to the phase angles of rotating planar ('XY') spins. Here, we show how the supramolecular interactions between chains can be tuned to mimic different magnetic interactions. In this way, the structures of gold(I) and/or silver(I) cyanides reflect the phase behaviour of triangular XY magnets. Complex magnetic states predicted for this family of magnets-including collective spin-vortices of relevance to data storage applications-are realized in the structural chemistry of these cyanide polymers. Our results demonstrate how chemically simple inorganic materials can behave as structural analogues of otherwise inaccessible 'toy' spin models and also how the theoretical understanding of those models allows control over collective ('emergent') phenomena in supramolecular systems.",2
Dynamic formation of a solid-liquid electrolyte interphase and its consequences for hybrid-battery concepts.,"The discharging and charging of batteries require ion transfer across phase boundaries. In conventional lithium-ion batteries, Li(+) ions have to cross the liquid electrolyte and only need to pass the electrode interfaces. Future high-energy batteries may need to work as hybrids, and so serially combine a liquid electrolyte and a solid electrolyte to suppress unwanted redox shuttles. This adds new interfaces that might significantly decrease the cycling-rate capability. Here we show that the interface between a typical fast-ion-conducting solid electrolyte and a conventional liquid electrolyte is chemically unstable and forms a resistive solid-liquid electrolyte interphase (SLEI). Insights into the kinetics of this new type of interphase are obtained by impedance studies of a two-chamber cell. The chemistry of the SLEI, its growth with time and the influence of water impurities are examined by state-of-the-art surface analysis and depth profiling.",2
Discovery of a regioselectivity switch in nitrating P450s guided by molecular dynamics simulations and Markov models.,"The dynamic motions of protein structural elements, particularly flexible loops, are intimately linked with diverse aspects of enzyme catalysis. Engineering of these loop regions can alter protein stability, substrate binding and even dramatically impact enzyme function. When these flexible regions are unresolvable structurally, computational reconstruction in combination with large-scale molecular dynamics simulations can be used to guide the engineering strategy. Here we present a collaborative approach that consists of both experiment and computation and led to the discovery of a single mutation in the F/G loop of the nitrating cytochrome P450 TxtE that simultaneously controls loop dynamics and completely shifts the enzyme's regioselectivity from the C4 to the C5 position of L-tryptophan. Furthermore, we find that this loop mutation is naturally present in a subset of homologous nitrating P450s and confirm that these uncharacterized enzymes exclusively produce 5-nitro-L-tryptophan, a previously unknown biosynthetic intermediate.",2
Expanding the chemical toolbox for the synthesis of large and uniquely modified proteins.,"Methods to prepare proteins that include a specific modification at a desired position are essential for understanding their cellular functions and physical properties in living systems. Chemical protein synthesis, which relies on the chemoselective ligation of unprotected peptides, enables the preparation of modified proteins that are not easily fabricated by other methods. In contrast to recombinant approaches, chemical synthesis can be used to prepare protein analogues such as D-proteins, which are useful in protein structure determination and the discovery of novel therapeutics. Post-translationally modifying proteins is another example where chemical protein synthesis proved itself as a powerful approach for preparing samples with high homogeneity and in workable quantities. In this Review, we discuss the basic principles of the field, focusing on novel chemoselective peptide ligation approaches such as native chemical ligation and the recent advances based on this method with a proven record of success in the synthesis of highly important protein targets.",2
Synthesis of giant globular multivalent glycofullerenes as potent inhibitors in a model of Ebola virus infection.,"The use of multivalent carbohydrate compounds to block cell-surface lectin receptors is a promising strategy to inhibit the entry of pathogens into cells and could lead to the discovery of novel antiviral agents. One of the main problems with this approach, however, is that it is difficult to make compounds of an adequate size and multivalency to mimic natural systems such as viruses. Hexakis adducts of [60]fullerene are useful building blocks in this regard because they maintain a globular shape at the same time as allowing control over the size and multivalency. Here we report water-soluble tridecafullerenes decorated with 120 peripheral carbohydrate subunits, so-called 'superballs', that can be synthesized efficiently from hexakis adducts of [60]fullerene in one step by using copper-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition click chemistry. Infection assays show that these superballs are potent inhibitors of cell infection by an artificial Ebola virus with half-maximum inhibitory concentrations in the subnanomolar range.",2
Chemical amplification of magnetic field effects relevant to avian magnetoreception.,"Magnetic fields as weak as the Earth's can change the yields of radical pair reactions even though the energies involved are orders of magnitude smaller than the thermal energy, kBT, at room temperature. Proposed as the source of the light-dependent magnetic compass in migratory birds, the radical pair mechanism is thought to operate in cryptochrome flavoproteins in the retina. Here we demonstrate that the primary magnetic field effect on flavin photoreactions can be amplified chemically by slow radical termination reactions under conditions of continuous photoexcitation. The nature and origin of the amplification are revealed by studies of the intermolecular flavin-tryptophan and flavin-ascorbic acid photocycles and the closely related intramolecular flavin-tryptophan radical pair in cryptochrome. Amplification factors of up to 5.6 were observed for magnetic fields weaker than 1 mT. Substantial chemical amplification could have a significant impact on the viability of a cryptochrome-based magnetic compass sensor.",2
Crystalline coordination framework endowed with dynamic gate-opening behaviour by being downsized to a thin film.,"The fabrication of porous coordination frameworks in thin-film forms has been investigated intensively with a view to using their structural response to external stimuli and guests for potential nanotechnological applications, for example as membranes for gas separation. Here we report a coordination framework that exhibits a dynamic guest-sorption behaviour in a nanometre-sized thin-film form (16 nm thick), yet shows no guest uptake in the bulk. Highly oriented crystalline thin films of this coordination framework--which consists of interdigitated two-dimensional layers of {Fe(py)2[Pt(CN)4]} (py, pyridine)--were fabricated through liquid-phase layer-by-layer synthesis. The resulting thin film exhibited a clear guest uptake with a structural transformation of the gate-opening type as characterized by in situ X-ray diffraction. Increasing the film's thickness markedly suppressed this behaviour. We envisage that such a crystal-downsizing effect may be observed with other coordination frameworks, and may be of use to develop functional materials, for example, for switching or sensing devices.",2
Reprogramming the assembly of unmodified DNA with a small molecule.,"The ability of DNA to store and encode information arises from base pairing of the four-letter nucleobase code to form a double helix. Expanding this DNA 'alphabet' by synthetic incorporation of new bases can introduce new functionalities and enable the formation of novel nucleic acid structures. However, reprogramming the self-assembly of existing nucleobases presents an alternative route to expand the structural space and functionality of nucleic acids. Here we report the discovery that a small molecule, cyanuric acid, with three thymine-like faces, reprogrammes the assembly of unmodified poly(adenine) (poly(A)) into stable, long and abundant fibres with a unique internal structure. Poly(A) DNA, RNA and peptide nucleic acid (PNA) all form these assemblies. Our studies are consistent with the association of adenine and cyanuric acid units into a hexameric rosette, which brings together poly(A) triplexes with a subsequent cooperative polymerization. Fundamentally, this study shows that small hydrogen-bonding molecules can be used to induce the assembly of nucleic acids in water, which leads to new structures from inexpensive and readily available materials.",2
Iterative reactions of transient boronic acids enable sequential C-C bond formation.,"The ability to form multiple carbon-carbon bonds in a controlled sequence and thus rapidly build molecular complexity in an iterative fashion is an important goal in modern chemical synthesis. In recent times, transition-metal-catalysed coupling reactions have dominated in the development of C-C bond forming processes. A desire to reduce the reliance on precious metals and a need to obtain products with very low levels of metal impurities has brought a renewed focus on metal-free coupling processes. Here, we report the in situ preparation of reactive allylic and benzylic boronic acids, obtained by reacting flow-generated diazo compounds with boronic acids, and their application in controlled iterative C-C bond forming reactions is described. Thus far we have shown the formation of up to three C-C bonds in a sequence including the final trapping of a reactive boronic acid species with an aldehyde to generate a range of new chemical structures.",2
Designed metalloprotein stabilizes a semiquinone radical.,"Enzymes use binding energy to stabilize their substrates in high-energy states that are otherwise inaccessible at ambient temperature. Here we show that a de novo designed Zn(II) metalloprotein stabilizes a chemically reactive organic radical that is otherwise unstable in aqueous media. The protein binds tightly to and stabilizes the radical semiquinone form of 3,5-di-tert-butylcatechol. Solution NMR spectroscopy in conjunction with molecular dynamics simulations show that the substrate binds in the active site pocket where it is stabilized by metal-ligand interactions as well as by burial of its hydrophobic groups. Spectrochemical redox titrations show that the protein stabilized the semiquinone by reducing the electrochemical midpoint potential for its formation via the one-electron oxidation of the catechol by approximately 400 mV (9 kcal mol(-1)). Therefore, the inherent chemical properties of the radical were changed drastically by harnessing its binding energy to the metalloprotein. This model sets the basis for designed enzymes with radical cofactors to tackle challenging chemistry.",2
Interface control by chemical and dimensional matching in an oxide heterostructure.,"Interfaces between different materials underpin both new scientific phenomena, such as the emergent behaviour at oxide interfaces, and key technologies, such as that of the transistor. Control of the interfaces between materials with the same crystal structures but different chemical compositions is possible in many materials classes, but less progress has been made for oxide materials with different crystal structures. We show that dynamical self-organization during growth can create a coherent interface between the perovskite and fluorite oxide structures, which are based on different structural motifs, if an appropriate choice of cations is made to enable this restructuring. The integration of calculation with experimental observation reveals that the interface differs from both the bulk components and identifies the chemical bonding requirements to connect distinct oxide structures.",2
Modular synthesis of N-glycans and arrays for the hetero-ligand binding analysis of HIV antibodies.,"A new class of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) from HIV donors has been reported to target the glycans on gp120--a glycoprotein found on the surface of the virus envelope--thus renewing hope of developing carbohydrate-based HIV vaccines. However, the version of gp120 used in previous studies was not from human T cells and so the glycosylation pattern could be somewhat different to that found in the native system. Moreover, some antibodies recognized two different glycans simultaneously and this cannot be detected with the commonly used glycan microarrays on glass slides. Here, we have developed a glycan microarray on an aluminium-oxide-coated glass slide containing a diverse set of glycans, including homo- and mixed N-glycans (high-mannose, hybrid and complex types) that were prepared by modular chemo-enzymatic methods to detect the presence of hetero-glycan binding behaviours. This new approach allows rapid screening and identification of optimal glycans recognized by neutralizing antibodies, and could speed up the development of HIV-1 vaccines targeting cell surface glycans.",2
Effects of correlated parameters and uncertainty in electronic-structure-based chemical kinetic modelling.,"Kinetic models based on first principles are becoming common place in heterogeneous catalysis because of their ability to interpret experimental data, identify the rate-controlling step, guide experiments and predict novel materials. To overcome the tremendous computational cost of estimating parameters of complex networks on metal catalysts, approximate quantum mechanical calculations are employed that render models potentially inaccurate. Here, by introducing correlative global sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification, we show that neglecting correlations in the energies of species and reactions can lead to an incorrect identification of influential parameters and key reaction intermediates and reactions. We rationalize why models often underpredict reaction rates and show that, despite the uncertainty being large, the method can, in conjunction with experimental data, identify influential missing reaction pathways and provide insights into the catalyst active site and the kinetic reliability of a model. The method is demonstrated in ethanol steam reforming for hydrogen production for fuel cells.",2
Microscopic origin of chiral shape induction in achiral crystals.,"In biomineralization, inorganic materials are formed with remarkable control of the shape and morphology. Chirality, as present in the biomolecular world, is therefore also common for biominerals. Biomacromolecules, like proteins and polysaccharides, are in direct contact with the mineral phase and act as modifiers during nucleation and crystal growth. Owing to their homochirality--they exist only as one of two possible mirror-symmetric isomers--their handedness is often transferred into the macroscopic shape of the biomineral crystals, but the way in which handedness is transmitted into achiral materials is not yet understood at the atomic level. By using the submolecular resolution capability of scanning tunnelling microscopy, supported by photoelectron diffraction and density functional theory, we show how the chiral 'buckybowl' hemibuckminsterfullerene arranges copper surface atoms in its vicinity into a chiral morphology. We anticipate that such new insight will find its way into materials synthesis techniques.",2
Expanding the amino acid repertoire of ribosomal polypeptide synthesis via the artificial division of codon boxes.,"In ribosomal polypeptide synthesis the library of amino acid building blocks is limited by the manner in which codons are used. Of the proteinogenic amino acids, 18 are coded for by multiple codons and therefore many of the 61 sense codons can be considered redundant. Here we report a method to reduce the redundancy of codons by artificially dividing codon boxes to create vacant codons that can then be reassigned to non-proteinogenic amino acids and thereby expand the library of genetically encoded amino acids. To achieve this, we reconstituted a cell-free translation system with 32 in vitro transcripts of transfer RNASNN (tRNASNN) (S = G or C), assigning the initiator and 20 elongator amino acids. Reassignment of three redundant codons was achieved by replacing redundant tRNASNNs with tRNASNNs pre-charged with non-proteinogenic amino acids. As a demonstration, we expressed a 32-mer linear peptide that consists of 20 proteinogenic and three non-proteinogenic amino acids, and a 14-mer macrocyclic peptide that contains more than four non-proteinogenic amino acids.",2
Substrate channelling as an approach to cascade reactions.,"Millions of years of evolution have produced biological systems capable of efficient one-pot multi-step catalysis. The underlying mechanisms that facilitate these reaction processes are increasingly providing inspiration in synthetic chemistry. Substrate channelling, where intermediates between enzymatic steps are not in equilibrium with the bulk solution, enables increased efficiencies and yields in reaction and diffusion processes. Here, we review different mechanisms of substrate channelling found in nature and provide an overview of the analytical methods used to quantify these effects. The incorporation of substrate channelling into synthetic cascades is a rapidly developing concept, and recent examples of the fabrication of cascades with controlled diffusion and flux of intermediates are presented.",2
Enantioselective aldol reactions with masked fluoroacetates.,"Despite the growing importance of organofluorines as pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, the stereoselective introduction of fluorine into many prominent classes of natural products and chemotherapeutic agents is difficult. One long-standing unsolved challenge is the enantioselective aldol reaction of fluoroacetate to enable access to fluorinated analogues of medicinally relevant acetate-derived compounds, such as polyketides and statins. Herein we present fluoromalonic acid halfthioesters as biomimetic surrogates of fluoroacetate and demonstrate their use in highly stereoselective aldol reactions that proceed under mild organocatalytic conditions. We also show that the methodology can be extended to formal aldol reactions with fluoroacetaldehyde and consecutive aldol reactions. The synthetic utility of the fluorinated aldol products is illustrated by the synthesis of a fluorinated derivative of the top-selling drug atorvastatin. The results show the prospects of the method for the enantioselective introduction of fluoroacetate to access a wide variety of highly functionalized fluorinated compounds.",2
Extreme compressibility in LnFe(CN)6 coordination framework materials via molecular gears and torsion springs.,"The mechanical flexibility of coordination frameworks can lead to a range of highly anomalous structural behaviours. Here, we demonstrate the extreme compressibility of the LnFe(CN)6 frameworks (Ln = Ho, Lu or Y), which reversibly compress by 20% in volume under the relatively low pressure of 1 GPa, one of the largest known pressure responses for any crystalline material. We delineate in detail the mechanism for this high compressibility, where the LnN6 units act like torsion springs synchronized by rigid Fe(CN)6 units performing the role of gears. The materials also show significant negative linear compressibility via a cam-like effect. The torsional mechanism is fundamentally distinct from the deformation mechanisms prevalent in other flexible solids and relies on competition between locally unstable metal coordination geometries and the constraints of the framework connectivity, a discovery that has implications for the strategic design of new materials with exceptional mechanical properties.",2
Diversification of self-replicating molecules.,"How new species emerge in nature is still incompletely understood and difficult to study directly. Self-replicating molecules provide a simple model that allows us to capture the fundamental processes that occur in species formation. We have been able to monitor in real time and at a molecular level the diversification of self-replicating molecules into two distinct sets that compete for two different building blocks ('food') and so capture an important aspect of the process by which species may arise. The results show that the second replicator set is a descendant of the first and that both sets are kinetic products that oppose the thermodynamic preference of the system. The sets occupy related but complementary food niches. As diversification into sets takes place on the timescale of weeks and can be investigated at the molecular level, this work opens up new opportunities for experimentally investigating the process through which species arise both in real time and with enhanced detail.",2
Dissociative electron attachment to CO2 produces molecular oxygen.,"Until recently, it was widely regarded that only one reaction pathway led to the production of molecular oxygen in Earth's prebiotic primitive atmosphere: a three-body recombination reaction of two oxygen atoms and a third body that removes excess energy. However, an additional pathway has recently been observed that involves the photodissociation of CO2 on exposure to ultraviolet light. Here we demonstrate a further pathway to O2 production, again from CO2, but via dissociative electron attachment (DEA). Using anion-velocity image mapping, we provide experimental evidence for a channel of DEA to CO2 that produces O2(X(3)Sigma(-)g) + C(-). This observed channel coexists in the same energy range as the competitive three-body dissociation of CO2 to give O + O + C(-). The abundance of low-energy electrons in interstellar space and the upper atmosphere of Earth suggests that the contributions of these pathways are significant and should be incorporated into atmospheric chemistry models.",2
Controlled partial interpenetration in metal-organic frameworks.,"Interpenetration, the entwining of multiple lattices, is a common phenomenon in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Typically, in interpenetrated MOFs the sub-lattices are fully occupied. Here we report a family of MOFs in which one sub-lattice is fully occupied and the occupancy level of the other can be controlled during synthesis to produce frameworks with variable levels of partial interpenetration. We also report an 'autocatenation' process, a transformation of non-interpenetrated lattices into doubly interpenetrated frameworks via progressively higher degrees of interpenetration that involves no external reagents. Autocatenation maintains crystallinity and can be triggered either thermally or by shear forces. The ligand used to construct these MOFs is chiral, and both racemic and enantiopure partially interpenetrated frameworks can be accessed. X-ray diffraction, nonlinear optical microscopy and theoretical calculations offer insights into the structures and dynamic behaviour of these materials and the growth mechanisms of interpenetrated MOFs.",2
An antibacterial vaccination strategy based on a glycoconjugate containing the core lipopolysaccharide tetrasaccharide Hep2Kdo2.,"Certain non-mammalian cell wall sugars are conserved across a variety of pathogenic bacteria. This conservation of structure, combined with their structural differences when compared with mammalian sugars, make them potentially powerful epitopes for immunization. Here, we report the synthesis of a glycoconjugate that displays the so-called 'inner core' sugars of Gram-negative bacterial cell walls. We also describe an antibacterial vaccination strategy based on immunization with the glycoconjugate and the subsequent administration of an inhibitor that uncovers the corresponding epitope in pathogenic bacteria. The core tetrasaccharide, Hep2Kdo2, a common motif in bacterial lipopolysaccharides, was synthesized and attached via a chain linker to a diphtheria toxin mutant carrier protein. This glycoconjugate generated titres of antibodies towards the inner core tetrasaccharide of the lipopolysaccharide, which were capable of binding the cell-surface sugars of bacterial pathogenic strains including Neisseria meningitidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Exposure of bacterial lipopolysaccharide in in vitro experiments, using an inhibitor of capsular polysaccharide transport, enabled potent bacterial killing with antiserum.",2
The role of metal ions in X-ray-induced photochemistry.,"Metal centres in biomolecules are recognized as being particularly sensitive to radiation damage by X-ray photons. This results in such molecules being both susceptible to an effective X-ray-induced loss of function and problematic to study using X-ray diffraction methods, with reliable structures of the metal centres difficult to obtain. Despite the abundance of experimental evidence, the mechanistic details of radiation damage at metal centres are unclear. Here, using ab initio calculations, we show that the absorption of X-rays by microsolvated Mg(2+) results in a complicated chain of ultrafast electronic relaxation steps that comprise both intra- and intermolecular processes and last for a few hundred femtoseconds. At the end of this cascade the metal reverts to its original charge state, the immediate environment becomes multiply ionized and large concentrations of radicals and slow electrons build up in the metal's vicinity. We conclude that such cascades involving metal ions are essential to our understanding of radiation chemistry and radiation damage in biological environments.",2
Highly efficient catalysis of the Kemp elimination in the cavity of a cubic coordination cage.,"The hollow cavities of coordination cages can provide an environment for enzyme-like catalytic reactions of small-molecule guests. Here, we report a new example (catalysis of the Kemp elimination reaction of benzisoxazole with hydroxide to form 2-cyanophenolate) in the cavity of a water-soluble M8L12 coordination cage, with two features of particular interest. First, the rate enhancement is among the largest observed to date: at pD 8.5, the value of kcat/kuncat is 2 x 10(5), due to the accumulation of a high concentration of partially desolvated hydroxide ions around the bound guest arising from ion-pairing with the 16+ cage. Second, the catalysis is based on two orthogonal interactions: (1) hydrophobic binding of benzisoxazole in the cavity and (2) polar binding of hydroxide ions to sites on the cage surface, both of which were established by competition experiments.",2
Self-assembled nanospheres with multiple endohedral binding sites pre-organize catalysts and substrates for highly efficient reactions.,"Tuning reagent and catalyst concentrations is crucial in the development of efficient catalytic transformations. In enzyme-catalysed reactions the substrate is bound-often by multiple non-covalent interactions-in a well-defined pocket close to the active site of the enzyme; this pre-organization facilitates highly efficient transformations. Here we report an artificial system that co-encapsulates multiple catalysts and substrates within the confined space defined by an M12L24 nanosphere that contains 24 endohedral guanidinium-binding sites. Cooperative binding means that sulfonate guests are bound much more strongly than carboxylates. This difference has been used to fix gold-based catalysts firmly, with the remaining binding sites left to pre-organize substrates. This strategy was applied to a Au(I)-catalysed cyclization of acetylenic acid to enol lactone in which the pre-organization resulted in much higher reaction rates. We also found that the encapsulated sulfonate-containing Au(I) catalysts did not convert neutral (acid) substrates, and so could have potential in the development of substrate-selective catalysis and base-triggered on/off switching of catalysis.",2
Reversible Bergman cyclization by atomic manipulation.,"The Bergman cyclization is one of the most fascinating rearrangements in chemistry, with important implications in organic synthesis and pharmacology. Here we demonstrate a reversible Bergman cyclization for the first time. We induced the on-surface transformation of an individual aromatic diradical into a highly strained ten-membered diyne using atomic manipulation and verified the products by non-contact atomic force microscopy with atomic resolution. The diyne and diradical were stabilized by using an ultrathin NaCl film as the substrate, and the diyne could be transformed back into the diradical. Importantly, the diradical and the diyne exhibit different reactivity, electronic, magnetic and optical properties associated with the changes in the bond topology, and spin multiplicity. With this reversible, triggered Bergman cyclization we demonstrated switching on demand between the two reactive intermediates by means of selective C-C bond formation or cleavage, which opens up the field of radical chemistry for on-surface reactions by atomic manipulation.",2
Remote functionalization through alkene isomerization.,"Exploiting the reactivity of one functional group within a molecule to generate a reaction at a different position is an ongoing challenge in organic synthesis. Effective remote functionalization protocols have the potential to provide access to almost any derivatives but are difficult to achieve. The difficulty is more pronounced for acyclic systems where flexible alkyl chains are present between the initiating functional group and the desired reactive centres. In this Review, we discuss the concept of remote functionalization of alkenes using metal complexes, leading to a selective reaction at a position distal to the initial double bond. We aim to show the vast opportunity provided by this growing field through selected and representative examples. Our aim is to demonstrate that using a double bond as a chemical handle, metal-assisted long-distance activation could be used as a powerful synthetic strategy.",2
Catching elusive glycosyl cations in a condensed phase with HF/SbF(5) superacid.,"Glycosyl cations are universally accepted key ionic intermediates in the mechanism of glycosylation, the reaction that covalently links carbohydrates to other molecules. These ions have remained hypothetical species so far because of their extremely short life in organic media as a consequence of their very high reactivity. Here, we report the use of liquid hydrofluoric acid-antimony pentafluoride (HF/SbF5) superacid to generate and stabilize the glycosyl cations derived from peracetylated 2-deoxy and 2-bromoglucopyranose in a condensed phase. Their persistence in this superacid medium allows their three-dimensional structure to be studied by NMR, aided by complementary computations. Their deuteration further confirms the impact of the structure of the glycosyl cation on the stereochemical outcome of its trapping.",2
Self-assembling biomolecular catalysts for hydrogen production.,"The chemistry of highly evolved protein-based compartments has inspired the design of new catalytically active materials that self-assemble from biological components. A frontier of this biodesign is the potential to contribute new catalytic systems for the production of sustainable fuels, such as hydrogen. Here, we show the encapsulation and protection of an active hydrogen-producing and oxygen-tolerant [NiFe]-hydrogenase, sequestered within the capsid of the bacteriophage P22 through directed self-assembly. We co-opted Escherichia coli for biomolecular synthesis and assembly of this nanomaterial by expressing and maturing the EcHyd-1 hydrogenase prior to expression of the P22 coat protein, which subsequently self assembles. By probing the infrared spectroscopic signatures and catalytic activity of the engineered material, we demonstrate that the capsid provides stability and protection to the hydrogenase cargo. These results illustrate how combining biological function with directed supramolecular self-assembly can be used to create new materials for sustainable catalysis.",2
Incorporation of well-dispersed sub-5-nm graphitic pencil nanodots into ordered mesoporous frameworks.,"Over the past few decades the direct assembly of optical nanomaterials into ordered mesoporous frameworks has proved to be a considerable challenge. Here we propose the incorporation of ultrasmall (sub-5-nm) graphitic pencil nanodots into ordered mesoporous frameworks for the fabrication of optoelectronic materials. The nanodots, which were prepared from typical commercial graphite pencils by an electrochemical tailoring process, combine properties such as uniform size ( approximately 3 nm), excellent dispersibility and high photoconversion efficiency ( approximately 27%). These nanodots were incorporated into a variety of ordered mesoporous frameworks (TiO2, silica, carbon and silica-carbon materials) by co-assembly, driven by hydrogen bonding, with the frameworks' precursors. The resulting materials showed a high degree of ordering, and a sharp increase in their optical performance (for example, photocurrent density). We envisage that the large-scale synthesis of ultrasmall carbon nanodots and their incorporation into ordered mesoporous frameworks may facilitate the preparation of materials with a variety of optical properties.",2
Transfer of molecular recognition information from DNA nanostructures to gold nanoparticles.,"DNA nanotechnology offers unparalleled precision and programmability for the bottom-up organization of materials. This approach relies on pre-assembling a DNA scaffold, typically containing hundreds of different strands, and using it to position functional components. A particularly attractive strategy is to employ DNA nanostructures not as permanent scaffolds, but as transient, reusable templates to transfer essential information to other materials. To our knowledge, this approach, akin to top-down lithography, has not been examined. Here we report a molecular printing strategy that chemically transfers a discrete pattern of DNA strands from a three-dimensional DNA structure to a gold nanoparticle. We show that the particles inherit the DNA sequence configuration encoded in the parent template with high fidelity. This provides control over the number of DNA strands and their relative placement, directionality and sequence asymmetry. Importantly, the nanoparticles produced exhibit the site-specific addressability of DNA nanostructures, and are promising components for energy, information and biomedical applications.",2
Conversion of alkanes to linear alkylsilanes using an iridium-iron-catalysed tandem dehydrogenation-isomerization-hydrosilylation.,"The conversion of inexpensive, saturated hydrocarbon feedstocks into value-added speciality chemicals using regiospecific, catalytic functionalization of alkanes is a major goal of organometallic chemistry. Linear alkylsilanes represent one such speciality chemical-they have a wide range of applications, including release coatings, silicone rubbers and moulding products. Direct, selective, functionalization of alkanes at primary C-H bonds is difficult and, to date, methods for catalytically converting alkanes into linear alkylsilanes are unknown. Here, we report a well-defined, dual-catalyst system for one-pot, two-step alkane silylations. The system comprises a pincer-ligated Ir catalyst for alkane dehydrogenation and an Fe catalyst that effects a subsequent tandem olefin isomerization-hydrosilylation. This method exhibits exclusive regioselectivity for the production of terminally functionalized alkylsilanes. This dual-catalyst strategy has also been applied to regioselective alkane borylations to form linear alkylboronate esters.",2
Influence of the leaving group on the dynamics of a gas-phase SN2 reaction.,"In addition to the nucleophile and solvent, the leaving group has a significant influence on SN2 nucleophilic substitution reactions. Its role is frequently discussed with respect to reactivity, but its influence on the reaction dynamics remains unclear. Here, we uncover the influence of the leaving group on the gas-phase dynamics of SN2 reactions in a combined approach of crossed-beam imaging and dynamics simulations. We have studied the reaction F(-) + CH3Cl and compared it to F(-) + CH3I. For the two leaving groups, Cl and I, we find very similar structures and energetics, but the dynamics show qualitatively different features. Simple scaling of the leaving group mass does not explain these differences. Instead, the relevant impact parameters for the reaction mechanisms are found to be crucial and the differences are attributed to the relative orientation of the approaching reactants. This effect occurs on short timescales and may also prevail in solution-phase conditions.",2
A direct approach to amines with remote stereocentres by enantioselective CuH-catalysed reductive relay hydroamination.,"Amines with remote stereocentres (stereocentres that are three or more bonds away from the C-N bond) are important structural elements in many pharmaceutical agents and natural products. However, previously reported methods to prepare these compounds in an enantioselective manner are indirect and require multistep synthesis. Here, we report a copper-hydride-catalysed, enantioselective synthesis of gamma- or delta-chiral amines from readily available allylic alcohols, esters and ethers using a reductive relay hydroamination strategy (a net reductive process in which an amino group is installed at a site remote from the original carbon-carbon double bond). The protocol was suitable for substrates containing a wide range of functional groups and provided remote chiral amine products with high levels of regio- and enantioselectivity. Sequential amination of substrates containing several carbon-carbon double bonds could be achieved, demonstrating the high chemoselectivity of this process.",2
"Pick-up, transport and release of a molecular cargo using a small-molecule robotic arm.","Modern-day factory assembly lines often feature robots that pick up, reposition and connect components in a programmed manner. The idea of manipulating molecular fragments in a similar way has to date only been explored using biological building blocks (specifically DNA). Here, we report on a wholly artificial small-molecule robotic arm capable of selectively transporting a molecular cargo in either direction between two spatially distinct, chemically similar, sites on a molecular platform. The arm picks up/releases a 3-mercaptopropanehydrazide cargo by formation/breakage of a disulfide bond, while dynamic hydrazone chemistry controls the cargo binding to the platform. Transport is controlled by selectively inducing conformational and configurational changes within an embedded hydrazone rotary switch that steers the robotic arm. In a three-stage operation, 79-85% of 3-mercaptopropanehydrazide molecules are transported in either (chosen) direction between the two platform sites, without the cargo at any time fully dissociating from the machine nor exchanging with other molecules in the bulk.",2
Phosphorylation-mediated RNA/peptide complex coacervation as a model for intracellular liquid organelles.,"Biological cells are highly organized, with numerous subcellular compartments. Phosphorylation has been hypothesized as a means to control the assembly/disassembly of liquid-like RNA- and protein-rich intracellular bodies, or liquid organelles, that lack delimiting membranes. Here, we demonstrate that charge-mediated phase separation, or complex coacervation, of RNAs with cationic peptides can generate simple model liquid organelles capable of reversibly compartmentalizing biomolecules. Formation and dissolution of these liquid bodies was controlled by changes in peptide phosphorylation state using a kinase/phosphatase enzyme pair. The droplet-generating phase transition responded to modification of even a single serine residue. Electrostatic interactions between the short cationic peptides and the much longer polyanionic RNAs drove phase separation. Coacervates were also formed on silica beads, a primitive model for localization at specific intracellular sites. This work supports phosphoregulation of complex coacervation as a viable mechanism for dynamic intracellular compartmentalization in membraneless organelles.",2
Pi-Clamp-mediated cysteine conjugation.,"Site-selective functionalization of complex molecules is one of the most significant challenges in chemistry. Typically, protecting groups or catalysts must be used to enable the selective modification of one site among many that are similarly reactive, and general strategies that selectively tune the local chemical environment around a target site are rare. Here, we show a four-amino-acid sequence (Phe-Cys-Pro-Phe), which we call the 'pi-clamp', that tunes the reactivity of its cysteine thiol for site-selective conjugation with perfluoroaromatic reagents. We use the pi-clamp to selectively modify one cysteine site in proteins containing multiple endogenous cysteine residues. These examples include antibodies and cysteine-based enzymes that would be difficult to modify selectively using standard cysteine-based methods. Antibodies modified using the pi-clamp retained binding affinity to their targets, enabling the synthesis of site-specific antibody-drug conjugates for selective killing of HER2-positive breast cancer cells. The pi-clamp is an unexpected approach to mediate site-selective chemistry and provides new avenues to modify biomolecules for research and therapeutics.",2
Recent advances in the construction of antibody-drug conjugates.,"Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) comprise antibodies covalently attached to highly potent drugs using a variety of conjugation technologies. As therapeutics, they combine the exquisite specificity of antibodies, enabling discrimination between healthy and diseased tissue, with the cell-killing ability of cytotoxic drugs. This powerful and exciting class of targeted therapy has shown considerable promise in the treatment of various cancers with two US Food and Drug Administration approved ADCs currently on the market (Adcetris and Kadcyla) and approximately 40 currently undergoing clinical evaluation. However, most of these ADCs exist as heterogeneous mixtures, which can result in a narrow therapeutic window and have major pharmacokinetic implications. In order for ADCs to deliver their full potential, sophisticated site-specific conjugation technologies to connect the drug to the antibody are vital. This Perspective discusses the strategies currently used for the site-specific construction of ADCs and appraises their merits and disadvantages.",2
Site-selective protein-modification chemistry for basic biology and drug development.,"Nature has produced intricate machinery to covalently diversify the structure of proteins after their synthesis in the ribosome. In an attempt to mimic nature, chemists have developed a large set of reactions that enable post-expression modification of proteins at pre-determined sites. These reactions are now used to selectively install particular modifications on proteins for many biological and therapeutic applications. For example, they provide an opportunity to install post-translational modifications on proteins to determine their exact biological roles. Labelling of proteins in live cells with fluorescent dyes allows protein uptake and intracellular trafficking to be tracked and also enables physiological parameters to be measured optically. Through the conjugation of potent cytotoxicants to antibodies, novel anti-cancer drugs with improved efficacy and reduced side effects may be obtained. In this Perspective, we highlight the most exciting current and future applications of chemical site-selective protein modification and consider which hurdles still need to be overcome for more widespread use.",2
A supramolecular helix that disregards chirality.,"The functions of complex crystalline systems derived from supramolecular biological and non-biological assemblies typically emerge from homochiral programmed primary structures via first principles involving secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures. In contrast, heterochiral and racemic compounds yield disordered crystals, amorphous solids or liquids. Here, we report the self-assembly of perylene bisimide derivatives in a supramolecular helix that in turn self-organizes in columnar hexagonal crystalline domains regardless of the enantiomeric purity of the perylene bisimide. We show that both homochiral and racemic perylene bisimide compounds, including a mixture of 21 diastereomers that cannot be deracemized at the molecular level, self-organize to form single-handed helical assemblies with identical single-crystal-like order. We propose that this high crystalline order is generated via a cogwheel mechanism that disregards the chirality of the self-assembling building blocks. We anticipate that this mechanism will facilitate access to previously inaccessible complex crystalline systems from racemic and homochiral building blocks.",2
Nickel-catalysed Suzuki-Miyaura coupling of amides.,"The Suzuki-Miyaura coupling has become one of the most important and prevalent methods for the construction of C-C bonds. Although palladium catalysis has historically dominated the field, the use of nickel catalysis has become increasingly widespread because of its unique ability to cleave carbon-heteroatom bonds that are unreactive towards other transition metals. We report the first nickel-catalysed Suzuki-Miyaura coupling of amides, which proceeds by an uncommon cleavage of the amide C-N bond after N-tert-butoxycarbonyl activation. The methodology is mild, functional-group tolerant and can be strategically employed in sequential transition-metal-catalysed cross-coupling sequences to unite heterocyclic fragments. These studies demonstrate that amides, despite classically considered inert substrates, can be harnessed as synthons for use in reactions that form C-C bonds through cleavage of the C-N bond using non-precious metal catalysis.",2
A threading receptor for polysaccharides.,"Cellulose, chitin and related polysaccharides are key renewable sources of organic molecules and materials. However, poor solubility tends to hamper their exploitation. Synthetic receptors could aid dissolution provided they are capable of cooperative action, for example by multiple threading on a single polysaccharide molecule. Here we report a synthetic receptor designed to form threaded complexes (polypseudorotaxanes) with these natural polymers. The receptor binds fragments of the polysaccharides in aqueous solution with high affinities (K(a) up to 19,000 M(-1)), and is shown--by nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy--to adopt the threading geometry. Evidence from induced circular dichroism and atomic force microscopy implies that the receptor also forms polypseudorotaxanes with cellulose and its polycationic analogue chitosan. The results hold promise for polysaccharide solubilization under mild conditions, as well as for new approaches to the design of biologically active molecules.",2
Catalytic formal [2+2+1] synthesis of pyrroles from alkynes and diazenes via Ti(II)/Ti(IV) redox catalysis.,"Pyrroles are structurally important heterocycles. However, the synthesis of polysubstituted pyrroles is often challenging. Here, we report a multicomponent, Ti-catalysed formal [2+2+1] reaction of alkynes and diazenes for the oxidative synthesis of penta- and trisubstituted pyrroles: a nitrenoid analogue to classical Pauson-Khand-type syntheses of cyclopentenones. Given the scarcity of early transition-metal redox catalysis, preliminary mechanistic studies are presented. Initial stoichiometric and kinetic studies indicate that the mechanism of this reaction proceeds through a formally Ti(II)/Ti(IV) redox catalytic cycle, in which an azatitanacyclobutene intermediate, resulting from [2+2] alkyne + Ti imido coupling, undergoes a second alkyne insertion followed by reductive elimination to yield pyrrole and a Ti(II) species. The key component for catalytic turnover is the reoxidation of the Ti(II) species to a Ti(IV) imido via the disproportionation of an eta(2)-diazene-Ti(II) complex.",2
Synthesis of 'unfeasible' zeolites.,"Zeolites are porous aluminosilicate materials that have found applications in many different technologies. However, although simulations suggest that there are millions of possible zeolite topologies, only a little over 200 zeolite frameworks of all compositions are currently known, of which about 50 are pure silica materials. This is known as the zeolite conundrum--why have so few of all the possible structures been made? Several criteria have been formulated to explain why most zeolites are unfeasible synthesis targets. Here we demonstrate the synthesis of two such 'unfeasible' zeolites, IPC-9 and IPC-10, through the assembly-disassembly-organization-reassembly mechanism. These new high-silica zeolites have rare characteristics, such as windows that comprise odd-membered rings. Their synthesis opens up the possibility of preparing other zeolites that have not been accessible by traditional solvothermal synthetic methods. We envisage that these findings may lead to a step change in the number and types of zeolites available for future applications.",2
Completely recyclable biopolymers with linear and cyclic topologies via ring-opening polymerization of gamma-butyrolactone.,"Ring-opening polymerization (ROP) is a powerful synthetic methodology for the chemical synthesis of technologically important biodegradable aliphatic polyesters from cyclic esters or lactones. However, the bioderived five-membered gamma-butyrolactone (gamma-BL) is commonly referred as 'non-polymerizable' because of its low strain energy. The chemical synthesis of poly(gamma-butyrolactone) (PgammaBL) through the ROP process has been realized only under ultrahigh pressure (20,000 atm, 160 degrees C) and only produces oligomers. Here we report that the ROP of gamma-BL can, with a suitable catalyst, proceed smoothly to high conversions (90%) under ambient pressure to produce PgammaBL materials with a number-average molecular weight up to 30 kg mol(-1) and with controlled linear and/or cyclic topologies. Remarkably, both linear and cyclic PgammaBLs can be recycled back into the monomer in quantitative yield by simply heating the bulk materials at 220 degrees C (linear polymer) or 300 degrees C (cyclic polymer) for one hour, which thereby demonstrates the complete recyclability of PgammaBL.",2
Highly branched and loop-rich gels via formation of metal-organic cages linked by polymers.,"Gels formed via metal-ligand coordination typically have very low branch functionality, f, as they consist of approximately 2-3 polymer chains linked to single metal ions that serve as junctions. Thus, these materials are very soft and unable to withstand network defects such as dangling ends and loops. We report here a new class of gels assembled from polymeric ligands and metal-organic cages (MOCs) as junctions. The resulting 'polyMOC' gels are precisely tunable and may feature increased branch functionality. We show two examples of such polyMOCs: a gel with a low f based on a M2L4 paddlewheel cluster junction and a compositionally isomeric one of higher f based on a M12L24 cage. The latter features large shear moduli, but also a very large number of elastically inactive loop defects that we subsequently exchanged for functional ligands, with no impact on the gel's shear modulus. Such a ligand substitution is not possible in gels of low f, including the M2L4-based polyMOC.",2
"Efficient, non-toxic anion transport by synthetic carriers in cells and epithelia.","Transmembrane anion transporters (anionophores) have potential for new modes of biological activity, including therapeutic applications. In particular they might replace the activity of defective anion channels in conditions such as cystic fibrosis. However, data on the biological effects of anionophores are scarce, and it remains uncertain whether such molecules are fundamentally toxic. Here, we report a biological study of an extensive series of powerful anion carriers. Fifteen anionophores were assayed in single cells by monitoring anion transport in real time through fluorescence emission from halide-sensitive yellow fluorescent protein. A bis-(p-nitrophenyl)ureidodecalin shows especially promising activity, including deliverability, potency and persistence. Electrophysiological tests show strong effects in epithelia, close to those of natural anion channels. Toxicity assays yield negative results in three cell lines, suggesting that promotion of anion transport may not be deleterious to cells. We therefore conclude that synthetic anion carriers are realistic candidates for further investigation as treatments for cystic fibrosis.",2
Real-time observation of multiexcitonic states in ultrafast singlet fission using coherent 2D electronic spectroscopy.,"Singlet fission is the spin-allowed conversion of a spin-singlet exciton into a pair of spin-triplet excitons residing on neighbouring molecules. To rationalize this phenomenon, a multiexcitonic spin-zero triplet-pair state has been hypothesized as an intermediate in singlet fission. However, the nature of the intermediate states and the underlying mechanism of ultrafast fission have not been elucidated experimentally. Here, we study a series of pentacene derivatives using ultrafast two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy and unravel the origin of the states involved in fission. Our data reveal the crucial role of vibrational degrees of freedom coupled to electronic excitations that facilitate the mixing of multiexcitonic states with singlet excitons. The resulting manifold of vibronic states drives sub-100 fs fission with unity efficiency. Our results provide a framework for understanding singlet fission and show how the formation of vibronic manifolds with a high density of states facilitates fast and efficient electronic processes in molecular systems.",2
Controlling and imaging biomimetic self-assembly.,"The self-assembly of chemical entities represents a very attractive way to create a large variety of ordered functional structures and complex matter. Although much effort has been devoted to the preparation of supramolecular nanostructures based on different chemical building blocks, an understanding of the mechanisms at play and the ability to monitor assembly processes and, in turn, control them are often elusive, which precludes a deep and comprehensive control of the final structures. Here the complex supramolecular landscape of a platinum(II) compound is characterized fully and controlled successfully through a combination of supramolecular and photochemical approaches. The supramolecular assemblies comprise two kinetic assemblies and their thermodynamic counterpart. The monitoring of the different emission properties of the aggregates, used as a fingerprint for each species, allows the real-time visualization of the evolving self-assemblies. The control of multiple supramolecular pathways will help the design of complex systems in and out of their thermodynamic equilibrium.",2
Efficient green methanol synthesis from glycerol.,"The production of biodiesel from the transesterification of plant-derived triglycerides with methanol has been commercialized extensively. Impure glycerol is obtained as a by-product at roughly one-tenth the mass of the biodiesel. Utilization of this crude glycerol is important in improving the viability of the overall process. Here we show that crude glycerol can be reacted with water over very simple basic or redox oxide catalysts to produce methanol in high yields, together with other useful chemicals, in a one-step low-pressure process. Our discovery opens up the possibility of recycling the crude glycerol produced during biodiesel manufacture. Furthermore, we show that molecules containing at least two hydroxyl groups can be converted into methanol, which demonstrates some aspects of the generality of this new chemistry.",2
Diastereoselective addition of Grignard reagents to alpha-epoxy N-sulfonyl hydrazones.,"The alpha-alkylation of ketones and their derivatives by the addition of their corresponding enolates to alkyl halides is a fundamental synthetic transformation, but its utility is limited because the key bond-forming step proceeds in a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution fashion. Here we describe how an umpolung strategy that involves the addition of Grignard reagents to alpha-epoxy N-sulfonyl hydrazones-directed by the alkoxide of the 1-azo-3-alkoxy propenes formed in situ via base-induced ring opening of the epoxide-leads to the syn-selective production of alpha-alkyl-beta-hydroxy N-sulfonyl hydrazones with alpha-quaternary centres. This transformation is remarkable in its ability to incorporate an unprecedented range of carbon-based substituents, which include primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl, as well as alkenyl, aryl, allenyl and alkynyl groups. Subsequent hydrolysis of the beta-hydroxy N-sulfonyl hydrazone products produces the corresponding beta-hydroxy ketones. In addition to hydrolysis, the hydrazone products are poised to undergo numerous different known synthetic transformations via well-established chemistry, which would provide access to a wide array of useful structures.",2
A labile hydride strategy for the synthesis of heavily nitridized BaTiO3.,"Oxynitrides have been explored extensively in the past decade because of their interesting properties, such as visible-light absorption, photocatalytic activity and high dielectric permittivity. Their synthesis typically requires high-temperature NH3 treatment (800-1,300 degrees C) of precursors, such as oxides, but the highly reducing conditions and the low mobility of N(3-) species in the lattice place significant constraints on the composition and structure-and hence the properties-of the resulting oxynitrides. Here we show a topochemical route that enables the preparation of an oxynitride at low temperatures (<500 degrees C), using a perovskite oxyhydride as a host. The lability of H(-) in BaTiO3-xHx (x </= 0.6) allows H(-)/N(3-) exchange to occur, and yields a room-temperature ferroelectric BaTiO3-xN2x/3. This anion exchange is accompanied by a metal-to-insulator crossover via mixed O-H-N intermediates. These findings suggest that this 'labile hydride' strategy can be used to explore various oxynitrides, and perhaps other mixed anionic compounds.",2
A steric tethering approach enables palladium-catalysed C-H activation of primary amino alcohols.,"Aliphatic primary amines are a class of chemical feedstock essential to the synthesis of higher-order nitrogen-containing molecules, commonly found in biologically active compounds and pharmaceutical agents. New methods for the construction of complex amines remain a continuous challenge to synthetic chemists. Here, we outline a general palladium-catalysed strategy for the functionalization of aliphatic C-H bonds within amino alcohols, an important class of small molecule. Central to this strategy is the temporary conversion of catalytically incompatible primary amino alcohols into hindered secondary amines that are capable of undergoing a sterically promoted palladium-catalysed C-H activation. Furthermore, a hydrogen bond between amine and catalyst intensifies interactions around the palladium and orients the aliphatic amine substituents in an ideal geometry for C-H activation. This catalytic method directly transforms simple, easily accessible amines into highly substituted, functionally concentrated and structurally diverse products, and can streamline the synthesis of biologically important amine-containing molecules.",2
Quantitative self-assembly of a purely organic three-dimensional catenane in water.,"Self-assembly by means of coordinative bond formation has opened up opportunities for the high-yield synthesis of molecules with complex topologies. However, the preparation of purely covalent molecular architectures in aqueous media has remained a challenging task. Here, we present the preparation of a three-dimensional catenane through a self-assembly process that relies on the formation of dynamic hydrazone linkages in an acidic aqueous medium. The quantitative synthesis process and the mechanically interlocked structure of the resulting catenane were established by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, X-ray crystallography and HPLC studies. In addition, the labile hydrazone linkages of the individual [2]catenane components may be 'locked' by increasing the pH of the solution, yielding a relatively kinetically stable molecule. The present study thus details a simple approach to the creation and control of complex molecular architectures under reaction conditions that mimic biological milieux.",2
Reconstitution of [Fe]-hydrogenase using model complexes.,"[Fe]-Hydrogenase catalyses the reversible hydrogenation of a methenyltetrahydromethanopterin substrate, which is an intermediate step during the methanogenesis from CO2 and H2. The active site contains an iron-guanylylpyridinol cofactor, in which Fe(2+) is coordinated by two CO ligands, as well as an acyl carbon atom and a pyridinyl nitrogen atom from a 3,4,5,6-substituted 2-pyridinol ligand. However, the mechanism of H2 activation by [Fe]-hydrogenase is unclear. Here we report the reconstitution of [Fe]-hydrogenase from an apoenzyme using two FeGP cofactor mimics to create semisynthetic enzymes. The small-molecule mimics reproduce the ligand environment of the active site, but are inactive towards H2 binding and activation on their own. We show that reconstituting the enzyme using a mimic that contains a 2-hydroxypyridine group restores activity, whereas an analogous enzyme with a 2-methoxypyridine complex was essentially inactive. These findings, together with density functional theory computations, support a mechanism in which the 2-hydroxy group is deprotonated before it serves as an internal base for heterolytic H2 cleavage.",2
A manganese catalyst for highly reactive yet chemoselective intramolecular C(sp(3))-H amination.,"C-H bond oxidation reactions underscore the existing paradigm wherein high reactivity and high selectivity are inversely correlated. The development of catalysts capable of oxidizing strong aliphatic C(sp(3))-H bonds while displaying chemoselectivity (that is, tolerance of more oxidizable functionality) remains an unsolved problem. Here, we describe a catalyst, manganese tert-butylphthalocyanine [Mn((t)BuPc)], that is an outlier to the reactivity-selectivity paradigm. It is unique in its capacity to functionalize all types of C(sp(3))-H bond intramolecularly, while displaying excellent chemoselectivity in the presence of pi functionality. Mechanistic studies indicate that [Mn((t)BuPc)] transfers bound nitrenes to C(sp(3))-H bonds via a pathway that lies between concerted C-H insertion, observed with reactive noble metals such as rhodium, and stepwise radical C-H abstraction/rebound, as observed with chemoselective base metals such as iron. Rather than achieving a blending of effects, [Mn((t)BuPc)] aminates even 1 degrees aliphatic and propargylic C-H bonds, demonstrating reactivity and selectivity unusual for previously known catalysts.",2
Local vibrational coherences drive the primary photochemistry of vision.,"The role of vibrational coherence-concerted vibrational motion on the excited-state potential energy surface-in the isomerization of retinal in the protein rhodopsin remains elusive, despite considerable experimental and theoretical efforts. We revisited this problem with resonant ultrafast heterodyne-detected transient-grating spectroscopy. The enhanced sensitivity that this technique provides allows us to probe directly the primary photochemical reaction of vision with sufficient temporal and spectral resolution to resolve all the relevant nuclear dynamics of the retinal chromophore during isomerization. We observed coherent photoproduct formation on a sub-50 fs timescale, and recovered a host of vibrational modes of the retinal chromophore that modulate the transient-grating signal during the isomerization reaction. Through Fourier filtering and subsequent time-domain analysis of the transient vibrational dynamics, the excited-state nuclear motions that drive the isomerization reaction were identified, and comprise stretching, torsional and out-of-plane wagging motions about the local C11=C12 isomerization coordinate.",2
Inhibition of human copper trafficking by a small molecule significantly attenuates cancer cell proliferation.,"Copper is a transition metal that plays critical roles in many life processes. Controlling the cellular concentration and trafficking of copper offers a route to disrupt these processes. Here we report small molecules that inhibit the human copper-trafficking proteins Atox1 and CCS, and so provide a selective approach to disrupt cellular copper transport. The knockdown of Atox1 and CCS or their inhibition leads to a significantly reduced proliferation of cancer cells, but not of normal cells, as well as to attenuated tumour growth in mouse models. We show that blocking copper trafficking induces cellular oxidative stress and reduces levels of cellular ATP. The reduced level of ATP results in activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase that leads to reduced lipogenesis. Both effects contribute to the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation. Our results establish copper chaperones as new targets for future developments in anticancer therapies.",2
Monitoring one-electron photo-oxidation of guanine in DNA crystals using ultrafast infrared spectroscopy.,"To understand the molecular origins of diseases caused by ultraviolet and visible light, and also to develop photodynamic therapy, it is important to resolve the mechanism of photoinduced DNA damage. Damage to DNA bound to a photosensitizer molecule frequently proceeds by one-electron photo-oxidation of guanine, but the precise dynamics of this process are sensitive to the location and the orientation of the photosensitizer, which are very difficult to define in solution. To overcome this, ultrafast time-resolved infrared (TRIR) spectroscopy was performed on photoexcited ruthenium polypyridyl-DNA crystals, the atomic structure of which was determined by X-ray crystallography. By combining the X-ray and TRIR data we are able to define both the geometry of the reaction site and the rates of individual steps in a reversible photoinduced electron-transfer process. This allows us to propose an individual guanine as the reaction site and, intriguingly, reveals that the dynamics in the crystal state are quite similar to those observed in the solvent medium.",2
Recent advances in the molecular design of synthetic vaccines.,"Vaccines have typically been prepared using whole organisms. These are normally either attenuated bacteria or viruses that are live but have been altered to reduce their virulence, or pathogens that have been inactivated and effectively killed through exposure to heat or formaldehyde. However, using whole organisms to elicit an immune response introduces the potential for infections arising from a reversion to a virulent form in live pathogens, unproductive reactions to vaccine components or batch-to-batch variability. Synthetic vaccines, in which a molecular antigen is conjugated to a carrier protein, offer the opportunity to circumvent these problems. This Perspective will highlight the progress that has been achieved in developing synthetic vaccines using a variety of molecular antigens. In particular, the different approaches used to develop conjugate vaccines using peptide/proteins, carbohydrates and other small molecule haptens as antigens are compared.",2
Rhodium-catalysed asymmetric allylic arylation of racemic halides with arylboronic acids.,"Csp(2)-Csp(2) cross-coupling reactions between arylboronic acid and aryl halides are widely used in both academia and industry and are strategically important in the development of new agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals. Csp(2)-Csp(3) cross-coupling reactions have been developed, but enantioselective variations are rare and simply retaining the stereochemistry is a problem. Here we report a highly enantioselective Csp(2)-Csp(3) bond-forming method that couples arylboronic acids to racemic allyl chlorides. Both enantiomers of a cyclic chloride are converted into a single enantiomer of product via a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation. This Rh-catalysed method uses readily available and inexpensive building blocks and is mild and broadly applicable. For electron-deficient, electron-rich or ortho-substituted boronic acids better results are obtained with racemic allyl bromides. Oxygen substitution in the allyl halide is tolerated and the products can be functionalized to provide diverse building blocks. The approach fills a significant gap in the methods for catalytic asymmetric synthesis.",2
Cage connectivity and frontier pi orbitals govern the relative stability of charged fullerene isomers.,"Fullerene anions and cations have unique structural, electronic, magnetic and chemical properties that make them substantially different from neutral fullerenes. Although much theoretical effort has been devoted to characterizing and predicting their properties, this has been limited to a fraction of isomeric forms, mostly for fullerene anions, and has practically ignored fullerene cations. Here we show that the concepts of cage connectivity and frontier pi orbitals allow one to understand the relative stability of charged fullerene isomers without performing elaborate quantum chemistry calculations. The latter is not a trivial matter, as the number of possible isomers for a medium-sized fullerene is many more than 100,000. The model correctly predicts the structures observed experimentally and explains why the isolated pentagon rule is often violated for fullerene anions, but the opposite is found for fullerene cations. These predictions are relevant in fields as diverse as astrophysics, electrochemistry and supramolecular chemistry.",2
Molecular hydrogen interacts more strongly when rotationally excited at low temperatures leading to faster reactions.,"The role of internal molecular degrees of freedom, such as rotation, has scarcely been explored experimentally in low-energy collisions despite their significance to cold and ultracold chemistry. Particularly important to astrochemistry is the case of the most abundant molecule in interstellar space, hydrogen, for which two spin isomers have been detected, one of which exists in its rotational ground state whereas the other is rotationally excited. Here we demonstrate that quantization of molecular rotation plays a key role in cold reaction dynamics, where rotationally excited ortho-hydrogen reacts faster due to a stronger long-range attraction. We observe rotational state-dependent non-Arrhenius universal scaling laws in chemi-ionization reactions of para-H2 and ortho-H2 by He(2(3)P2), spanning three orders of magnitude in temperature. Different scaling laws serve as a sensitive gauge that enables us to directly determine the exact nature of the long-range intermolecular interactions. Our results show that the quantum state of the molecular rotor determines whether or not anisotropic long-range interactions dominate cold collisions.",2
O-GlcNAc modification blocks the aggregation and toxicity of the protein alpha-synuclein associated with Parkinson's disease.,"Several aggregation-prone proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases can be modified by O-linked N-acetyl-glucosamine (O-GlcNAc) in vivo. One of these proteins, alpha-synuclein, is a toxic aggregating protein associated with synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease. However, the effect of O-GlcNAcylation on alpha-synuclein is not clear. Here, we use synthetic protein chemistry to generate both unmodified alpha-synuclein and alpha-synuclein bearing a site-specific O-GlcNAc modification at the physiologically relevant threonine residue 72. We show that this single modification has a notable and substoichiometric inhibitory effect on alpha-synuclein aggregation, while not affecting the membrane binding or bending properties of alpha-synuclein. O-GlcNAcylation is also shown to affect the phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein in vitro and block the toxicity of alpha-synuclein that was exogenously added to cells in culture. These results suggest that increasing O-GlcNAcylation may slow the progression of synucleinopathies and further support a general function for O-GlcNAc in preventing protein aggregation.",2
"Stable, crystalline, porous, covalent organic frameworks as a platform for chiral organocatalysts.","The periodic layers and ordered nanochannels of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) make these materials viable open catalytic nanoreactors, but their low stability has precluded their practical implementation. Here we report the synthesis of a crystalline porous COF that is stable against water, strong acids and strong bases, and we demonstrate its utility as a material platform for structural design and functional development. We endowed a crystalline and porous imine-based COF with stability by incorporating methoxy groups into its pore walls to reinforce interlayer interactions. We subsequently converted the resulting achiral material into two distinct chiral organocatalysts, with the high crystallinity and porosity retained, by appending chiral centres and catalytically active sites on its channel walls. The COFs thus prepared combine catalytic activity, enantioselectivity and recyclability, which are attractive in heterogeneous organocatalysis, and were shown to promote asymmetric C-C bond formation in water under ambient conditions.",2
"Co-assembly, spatiotemporal control and morphogenesis of a hybrid protein-peptide system.","Controlling molecular interactions between bioinspired molecules can enable the development of new materials with higher complexity and innovative properties. Here we report on a dynamic system that emerges from the conformational modification of an elastin-like protein by peptide amphiphiles and with the capacity to access, and be maintained in, non-equilibrium for substantial periods of time. The system enables the formation of a robust membrane that displays controlled assembly and disassembly capabilities, adhesion and sealing to surfaces, self-healing and the capability to undergo morphogenesis into tubular structures with high spatiotemporal control. We use advanced microscopy along with turbidity and spectroscopic measurements to investigate the mechanism of assembly and its relation to the distinctive membrane architecture and the resulting dynamic properties. Using cell-culture experiments with endothelial and adipose-derived stem cells, we demonstrate the potential of this system to generate complex bioactive scaffolds for applications such as tissue engineering.",2
Unidirectional rotary motion in achiral molecular motors.,"Control of the direction of motion is an essential feature of biological rotary motors and results from the intrinsic chirality of the amino acids from which the motors are made. In synthetic autonomous light-driven rotary motors, point chirality is transferred to helical chirality, and this governs their unidirectional rotation. However, achieving directional rotary motion in an achiral molecular system in an autonomous fashion remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we report an achiral molecular motor in which the presence of a pseudo-asymmetric carbon atom proved to be sufficient for exclusive autonomous disrotary motion of two appended rotor moieties. Isomerization around the two double bonds enables both rotors to move in the same direction with respect to their surroundings--like wheels on an axle--demonstrating that autonomous unidirectional rotary motion can be achieved in a symmetric system.",2
Iron sensitizer converts light to electrons with 92% yield.,"Solar energy conversion in photovoltaics or photocatalysis involves light harvesting, or sensitization, of a semiconductor or catalyst as a first step. Rare elements are frequently used for this purpose, but they are obviously not ideal for large-scale implementation. Great efforts have been made to replace the widely used ruthenium with more abundant analogues like iron, but without much success due to the very short-lived excited states of the resulting iron complexes. Here, we describe the development of an iron-nitrogen-heterocyclic-carbene sensitizer with an excited-state lifetime that is nearly a thousand-fold longer than that of traditional iron polypyridyl complexes. By the use of electron paramagnetic resonance, transient absorption spectroscopy, transient terahertz spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations, we show that the iron complex generates photoelectrons in the conduction band of titanium dioxide with a quantum yield of 92% from the (3)MLCT (metal-to-ligand charge transfer) state. These results open up possibilities to develop solar energy-converting materials based on abundant elements.",2
An eight-step synthesis of epicolactone reveals its biosynthetic origin.,"Epicolactone is a recently isolated fungal metabolite that is highly complex for its size, and yet racemic. With its array of quaternary stereocentres, high degree of functionalization and intricate polycyclic structure, it poses a considerable challenge to synthesis, a challenge that can be met by understanding its biosynthetic origin. If drawn in a certain way, epicolactone reveals a pattern that resembles purpurogallin, the archetype of ubiquitous natural colourants formed via oxidative dimerization. Based on this insight, we designed a biomimetic synthesis of epicolactone that proceeds in only eight steps from vanillyl alcohol. We have isolated a key intermediate that supports our biosynthetic hypothesis and anticipate that an isomer of epicolactone stemming from our synthetic efforts could also be found as a natural product.",2
Shaping quaternary assemblies of water-soluble non-peptide helical foldamers by sequence manipulation.,"The design and construction of biomimetic self-assembling systems is a challenging yet potentially highly rewarding endeavour that contributes to the development of new biomaterials, catalysts, drug-delivery systems and tools for the manipulation of biological processes. Significant progress has been achieved by engineering self-assembling DNA-, protein- and peptide-based building units. However, the design of entirely new, completely non-natural folded architectures that resemble biopolymers ('foldamers') and have the ability to self-assemble into atomically precise nanostructures in aqueous conditions has proved exceptionally challenging. Here we report the modular design, formation and structural elucidation at the atomic level of a series of diverse quaternary arrangements formed by the self-assembly of short amphiphilic alpha-helicomimetic foldamers that bear proteinaceous side chains. We show that the final quaternary assembly can be controlled at the sequence level, which permits the programmed formation of either discrete helical bundles that contain isolated cavities or pH-responsive water-filled channels with controllable pore diameters.",2
Palladium-catalysed norbornene-mediated C-H functionalization of arenes.,"The Catellani reaction--a palladium-catalysed C-H functionalization reaction mediated by norbornene--was first reported in 1997. The capacity to functionalize both the ortho and ipso positions of aryl halides in a single transformation held great appeal. We reported an annulative Catellani reaction in 2000. Since then, our two groups have explored the synthetic utility of this reaction and dramatic progress has been made by a number of groups in the past five years. Whereas the original Catellani reaction uses Pd(0) catalysts, recent studies have shown that Pd(II) catalysts can be used in combination with norbornene to effect (1) direct 2-alkylation of indoles and pyrroles and (2) selective meta-C-H functionalization of arenes bearing commonly used ortho-directing groups, thereby opening new avenues for future research. We describe the most recent developments concerning the Pd-catalysed norbornene-mediated C-H functionalization of arenes, including applications in natural products synthesis. We outline challenges and future opportunities.",2
Spatially resolved multicomponent gels.,"Multicomponent supramolecular systems could be used to prepare exciting new functional materials, but it is often challenging to control the assembly across multiple length scales. Here we report a simple approach to forming patterned, spatially resolved multicomponent supramolecular hydrogels. A multicomponent gel is first formed from two low-molecular-weight gelators and consists of two types of fibre, each formed by only one gelator. One type of fibre in this 'self-sorted network' is then removed selectively by a light-triggered gel-to-sol transition. We show that the remaining network has the same mechanical properties as it would have done if it initially formed alone. The selective irradiation of sections of the gel through a mask leads to the formation of patterned multicomponent networks, in which either one or two networks can be present at a particular position with a high degree of spatial control.",2
Switchable selectivity in an NHC-catalysed dearomatizing annulation reaction.,"The development of general catalytic methods for the regio- and stereoselective construction of chiral N-heterocycles in a diversity-oriented fashion remains a formidable challenge in organic synthesis. N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis has been shown to produce a variety of outcomes, but control of the reactivity has rarely been demonstrated. Here we report a switchable catalytic activation of enals with aromatic azomethine imines that provides high selectivity using NHC organocatalysts. The original selectivity corresponds to the acidity of the base used in the reaction. The catalytically generated chiral homoenolate or enol intermediate undergoes enantioselective annulation with electrophiles such as N-iminoquinolinium ylides, N-iminoisoquinolinium ylides and beta-N-iminocarboline ylides. The good-to-high overall yields, high regioselectivities and excellent enantioselectivities observed are controlled by the catalyst and reaction conditions.",2
A cascade reaction network mimicking the basic functional steps of adaptive immune response.,"Biological systems use complex 'information-processing cores' composed of molecular networks to coordinate their external environment and internal states. An example of this is the acquired, or adaptive, immune system (AIS), which is composed of both humoral and cell-mediated components. Here we report the step-by-step construction of a prototype mimic of the AIS that we call an adaptive immune response simulator (AIRS). DNA and enzymes are used as simple artificial analogues of the components of the AIS to create a system that responds to specific molecular stimuli in vitro. We show that this network of reactions can function in a manner that is superficially similar to the most basic responses of the vertebrate AIS, including reaction sequences that mimic both humoral and cellular responses. As such, AIRS provides guidelines for the design and engineering of artificial reaction networks and molecular devices.",2
Diverse sp(3) C-H functionalization through alcohol beta-sulfonyloxylation.,"Site-selective C-H functionalization has emerged as an attractive tool for derivatizing complex synthetic intermediates, but its use for late-stage diversification is limited by the functional groups that can be introduced, especially at unactivated sp(3)-hybridized positions. To overcome this, we introduce a strategy that directly installs a sulfonyloxy group at a beta-C-H bond of a masked alcohol and subsequently employs nucleophilic substitution reactions to prepare various derivatives. Hydroxyl groups are widely found in bioactive molecules and are thus readily available as synthetic handles. A directing group is easily added (and subsequently removed) from the alcohols such that a formal site-selective beta-C-H sulfonyloxylation of these alcohols is achieved. Substitution reactions with carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and other nucleophiles then lead to diverse functionalizations that may help to streamline the synthesis of complex analogues for drug discovery.",2
Structure of a PEGylated protein reveals a highly porous double-helical assembly.,"PEGylated proteins are a mainstay of the biopharmaceutical industry. Although the use of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) to increase particle size, stability and solubility is well-established, questions remain as to the structure of PEG-protein conjugates. Here we report the structural characterization of a model beta-sheet protein (plastocyanin, 11.5 kDa) modified with a single PEG 5,000. An NMR spectroscopy study of the PEGylated conjugate indicated that the protein and PEG behaved as independent domains. A crystal structure revealed an extraordinary double-helical assembly of the conjugate, with the helices arranged orthogonally to yield a highly porous architecture. Electron density was not observed for the PEG chain, which indicates that it was disordered. The volume available per PEG chain in the crystal was within 10% of the calculated random coil volume. Together, these data support a minimal interaction between the protein and the synthetic polymer. Our work provides new possibilities for understanding this important class of protein-polymer hybrids and suggests a novel approach to engineering protein assemblies.",2
Formal SiH4 chemistry using stable and easy-to-handle surrogates.,"Monosilane (SiH4) is far less well behaved than its carbon analogue methane (CH4). It is a colourless gas that is industrially relevant as a source of elemental silicon, but its pyrophoric and explosive nature makes its handling and use challenging. Consequently, synthetic applications of SiH4 in academic laboratories are extremely rare and methodologies based on SiH4 are underdeveloped. Safe and controlled alternatives to the substituent redistribution approaches of hydrosilanes are desirable and cyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-ylsilanes where the cyclohexa-1,4-diene units serve as placeholders for the hydrogen atoms have been identified as potent surrogates of SiH4. We disclose here that the commercially available Lewis acid tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane, B(C6F5)3, is able to promote the release of the Si-H bond catalytically while subsequently enabling the hydrosilylation of C-C multiple bonds in the same pot. The net reactions are transition-metal-free transfer hydrosilylations with SiH4 as a building block for the preparation of various hydrosilanes.",2
Iterative exponential growth of stereo- and sequence-controlled polymers.,"Chemists have long sought sequence-controlled synthetic polymers that mimic nature's biopolymers, but a practical synthetic route that enables absolute control over polymer sequence and structure remains a key challenge. Here, we report an iterative exponential growth plus side-chain functionalization (IEG+) strategy that begins with enantiopure epoxides and facilitates the efficient synthesis of a family of uniform >3 kDa macromolecules of varying sequence and stereoconfiguration that are coupled to produce unimolecular polymers (>6 kDa) with sequences and structures that cannot be obtained using traditional polymerization techniques. Selective side-chain deprotection of three hexadecamers is also demonstrated, which imbues each compound with the ability to dissolve in water. We anticipate that these new macromolecules and the general IEG+ strategy will find broad application as a versatile platform for the scalable synthesis of sequence-controlled polymers.",2
Latent analysis of unmodified biomolecules and their complexes in solution with attomole detection sensitivity.,"The study of biomolecular interactions is central to an understanding of function, malfunction and therapeutic modulation of biological systems, yet often involves a compromise between sensitivity and accuracy. Many conventional analytical steps and the procedures required to facilitate sensitive detection, such as the incorporation of chemical labels, are prone to perturb the complexes under observation. Here we present a 'latent' analysis approach that uses chemical and microfluidic tools to reveal, through highly sensitive detection of a labelled system, the behaviour of the physiologically relevant unlabelled system. We implement this strategy in a native microfluidic diffusional sizing platform, allowing us to achieve detection sensitivity at the attomole level, determine the hydrodynamic radii of biomolecules that vary by over three orders of magnitude in molecular weight, and study heterogeneous mixtures. We illustrate these key advantages by characterizing a complex of an antibody domain in the solution phase and under physiologically relevant conditions.",2
How do metal ions direct ribozyme folding?,"Ribozymes, which carry out phosphoryl-transfer reactions, often require Mg(2+) ions for catalytic activity. The correct folding of the active site and ribozyme tertiary structure is also regulated by metal ions in a manner that is not fully understood. Here we employ coarse-grained molecular simulations to show that individual structural elements of the group I ribozyme from the bacterium Azoarcus form spontaneously in the unfolded ribozyme even at very low Mg(2+) concentrations, and are transiently stabilized by the coordination of Mg(2+) ions to specific nucleotides. However, competition for scarce Mg(2+) and topological constraints that arise from chain connectivity prevent the complete folding of the ribozyme. A much higher Mg(2+) concentration is required for complete folding of the ribozyme and stabilization of the active site. When Mg(2+) is replaced by Ca(2+) the ribozyme folds, but the active site remains unstable. Our results suggest that group I ribozymes utilize the same interactions with specific metal ligands for both structural stability and chemical activity.",2
Cooperative singlet and triplet exciton transport in tetracene crystals visualized by ultrafast microscopy.,"Singlet fission presents an attractive solution to overcome the Shockley-Queisser limit by generating two triplet excitons from one singlet exciton. However, although triplet excitons are long-lived, their transport occurs through a Dexter transfer, making them slower than singlet excitons, which travel by means of a Forster mechanism. A thorough understanding of the interplay between singlet fission and exciton transport is therefore necessary to assess the potential and challenges of singlet-fission utilization. Here, we report a direct visualization of exciton transport in single tetracene crystals using transient absorption microscopy with 200 fs time resolution and 50 nm spatial precision. These measurements reveal a new singlet-mediated transport mechanism for triplets, which leads to an enhancement in effective triplet exciton diffusion of more than one order of magnitude on picosecond to nanosecond timescales. These results establish that there are optimal energetics of singlet and triplet excitons that benefit both singlet fission and exciton diffusion.",2
Degradable vinyl polymers for biomedical applications.,"Vinyl polymers have been the focus of intensive research over the past few decades and are attractive materials owing to their ease of synthesis and their broad diversity of architectures, compositions and functionalities. Their carbon-carbon backbones are extremely resistant to degradation, however, and this property limits their uses. Degradable polymers are an important field of research in polymer science and have been used in a wide range of applications spanning from (nano)medicine to microelectronics and environmental protection. The development of synthetic strategies to enable complete or partial degradation of vinyl polymers is, therefore, of great importance because it will offer new opportunities for the application of these materials. This Review captures the most recent and promising approaches to the design of degradable vinyl polymers and discusses the potential of these materials for biomedical applications.",2
Organocatalytic removal of formaldehyde adducts from RNA and DNA bases.,"Formaldehyde is universally used to fix tissue specimens, where it forms hemiaminal and aminal adducts with biomolecules, hindering the ability to retrieve molecular information. Common methods for removing these adducts involve extended heating, which can cause extensive degradation of nucleic acids, particularly RNA. Here, we show that water-soluble bifunctional catalysts (anthranilates and phosphanilates) speed the reversal of formaldehyde adducts of mononucleotides over standard buffers. Studies with formaldehyde-treated RNA oligonucleotides show that the catalysts enhance adduct removal, restoring unmodified RNA at 37 degrees C even when extensively modified, while avoiding the high temperatures that promote RNA degradation. Experiments with formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cell samples show that the catalysis is compatible with common RNA extraction protocols, with detectable RNA yields increased by 1.5-2.4-fold using a catalyst under optimized conditions and by 7-25-fold compared with a commercial kit. Such catalytic strategies show promise for general use in reversing formaldehyde adducts in clinical specimens.",2
Synthesis of marmycin A and investigation into its cellular activity.,"Anthracyclines such as doxorubicin are used extensively in the treatment of cancers. Anthraquinone-related angucyclines also exhibit antiproliferative properties and have been proposed to operate via similar mechanisms, including direct genome targeting. Here, we report the chemical synthesis of marmycin A and the study of its cellular activity. The aromatic core was constructed by means of a one-pot multistep reaction comprising a regioselective Diels-Alder cycloaddition, and the complex sugar backbone was introduced through a copper-catalysed Ullmann cross-coupling, followed by a challenging Friedel-Crafts cyclization. Remarkably, fluorescence microscopy revealed that marmycin A does not target the nucleus but instead accumulates in lysosomes, thereby promoting cell death independently of genome targeting. Furthermore, a synthetic dimer of marmycin A and the lysosome-targeting agent artesunate exhibited a synergistic activity against the invasive MDA-MB-231 cancer cell line. These findings shed light on the elusive pathways through which anthraquinone derivatives act in cells, pointing towards unanticipated biological and therapeutic applications.",2
Use of a biosynthetic intermediate to explore the chemical diversity of pseudo-natural fungal polyketides.,"The structural complexity and diversity of natural products make them attractive sources for potential drug discovery, with their characteristics being derived from the multi-step combination of enzymatic and non-enzymatic conversions of intermediates in each biosynthetic pathway. Intermediates that exhibit multipotent behaviour have great potential for use as starting points in diversity-oriented synthesis. Inspired by the biosynthetic pathways that form complex metabolites from simple intermediates, we developed a semi-synthetic process that combines heterologous biosynthesis and artificial diversification. The heterologous biosynthesis of fungal polyketide intermediates led to the isolation of novel oligomers and provided evidence for ortho-quinonemethide equivalency in their isochromene form. The intrinsic reactivity of the isochromene polyketide enabled us to access various new chemical entities by modifying and remodelling the polyketide core and through coupling with indole molecules. We thus succeeded in generating exceptionally diverse pseudo-natural polyketides through this process and demonstrated an advanced method of using biosynthetic intermediates.",2
Ultrahigh-throughput exfoliation of graphite into pristine 'single-layer' graphene using microwaves and molecularly engineered ionic liquids.,"Graphene has shown much promise as an organic electronic material but, despite recent achievements in the production of few-layer graphene, the quantitative exfoliation of graphite into pristine single-layer graphene has remained one of the main challenges in developing practical devices. Recently, reduced graphene oxide has been recognized as a non-feasible alternative to graphene owing to variable defect types and levels, and attention is turning towards reliable methods for the high-throughput exfoliation of graphite. Here we report that microwave irradiation of graphite suspended in molecularly engineered oligomeric ionic liquids allows for ultrahigh-efficiency exfoliation (93% yield) with a high selectivity (95%) towards 'single-layer' graphene (that is, with thicknesses <1 nm) in a short processing time (30 minutes). The isolated graphene sheets show negligible structural deterioration. They are also readily redispersible in oligomeric ionic liquids up to ~100 mg ml(-1), and form physical gels in which an anisotropic orientation of graphene sheets, once induced by a magnetic field, is maintained.",2
Asymmetric assembly of aldose carbohydrates from formaldehyde and glycolaldehyde by tandem biocatalytic aldol reactions.,"The preparation of multifunctional chiral molecules can be greatly simplified by adopting a route via the sequential catalytic assembly of achiral building blocks. The catalytic aldol assembly of prebiotic compounds into stereodefined pentoses and hexoses is an as yet unmet challenge. Such a process would be of remarkable synthetic utility and highly significant with regard to the origin of life. Pursuing an expedient enzymatic approach, here we use engineered D-fructose-6-phosphate aldolase from Escherichia coli to prepare a series of three- to six-carbon aldoses by sequential one-pot additions of glycolaldehyde. Notably, the pertinent selection of the aldolase variant provides control of the sugar size. The stereochemical outcome of the addition was also altered to allow the synthesis of L-glucose and related derivatives. Such engineered biocatalysts may offer new routes for the straightforward synthesis of natural molecules and their analogues that circumvent the intricate enzymatic pathways forged by evolution.",2
Catalytic living ring-opening metathesis polymerization.,"In living ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), a transition-metal-carbene complex polymerizes ring-strained olefins with very good control of the molecular weight of the resulting polymers. Because one molecule of the initiator is required for each polymer chain, however, this type of polymerization is expensive for widespread use. We have now designed a chain-transfer agent (CTA) capable of reducing the required amount of metal complex while still maintaining full control over the living polymerization process. This new method introduces a degenerative transfer process to ROMP. We demonstrate that substituted cyclohexene rings are good CTAs, and thereby preserve the 'living' character of the polymerization using catalytic quantities of the metal complex. The resulting polymers show characteristics of a living polymerization, namely narrow molecular-weight distribution, controlled molecular weights and block copolymer formation. This new technique provides access to well-defined polymers for industrial, biomedical and academic use at a fraction of the current costs and significantly reduced levels of residual ruthenium catalyst.",2
A meta-selective C-H borylation directed by a secondary interaction between ligand and substrate.,"Regioselective C-H bond transformations are potentially the most efficient method for the synthesis of organic molecules. However, the presence of many C-H bonds in organic molecules and the high activation barrier for these reactions make these transformations difficult. Directing groups in the reaction substrate are often used to control regioselectivity, which has been especially successful for the ortho-selective functionalization of aromatic substrates. Here, we describe an iridium-catalysed meta-selective C-H borylation of aromatic compounds using a newly designed catalytic system. The bipyridine-derived ligand that binds iridium contains a pendant urea moiety. A secondary interaction between this urea and a hydrogen-bond acceptor in the substrate places the iridium in close proximity to the meta-C-H bond and thus controls the regioselectivity. (1)H NMR studies and control experiments support the participation of hydrogen bonds in inducing regioselectivity. Reversible direction of the catalyst through hydrogen bonds is a versatile concept for regioselective C-H transformations.",2
Improved performance and stability of perovskite solar cells by crystal crosslinking with alkylphosphonic acid omega-ammonium chlorides.,"In the past few years, organic-inorganic halide perovskites have rapidly emerged as promising materials for photovoltaic applications, but simultaneously achieving high performance and long-term stability has proved challenging. Here, we show a one-step solution-processing strategy using phosphonic acid ammonium additives that results in efficient perovskite solar cells with enhanced stability. We modify the surface of methylammonium lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3) perovskite by spin-coating its precursor solution in the presence of butylphosphonic acid 4-ammonium chloride. Morphological, structural and elemental analyses show that the phosphonic acid ammonium additive acts as a crosslink between neighbouring grains in the perovskite structure, through strong hydrogen bonding of the -PO(OH)2 and -NH3(+) terminal groups to the perovskite surface. The additives facilitate the incorporation of the perovskite within a mesoporous TiO2 scaffold, as well as the growth of a uniform perovskite layer at the surface, enhancing the material's photovoltaic performance from 8.8 to 16.7% as well as its resistance to moisture.",2
Significantly shorter Fe-S bond in cytochrome P450-I is consistent with greater reactivity relative to chloroperoxidase.,"Cytochrome P450 (P450) and chloroperoxidase (CPO) are thiolate-ligated haem proteins that catalyse the activation of carbon hydrogen bonds. The principal intermediate in these reactions is a ferryl radical species called compound I. P450 compound I (P450-I) is significantly more reactive than CPO-I, which only cleaves activated C-H bonds. To provide insight into the differing reactivities of these intermediates, we examined CPO-I and P450-I using variable-temperature Mossbauer and X-ray absorption spectroscopies. These measurements indicate that the Fe-S bond is significantly shorter in P450-I than in CPO-I. This difference in Fe-S bond lengths can be understood in terms of variations in the hydrogen-bonding patterns within the 'cys-pocket' (a portion of the proximal helix that encircles the thiolate ligand). Weaker hydrogen bonding in P450-I results in a shorter Fe-S bond, which enables greater electron donation from the axial thiolate ligand. This observation may in part explain P450's greater propensity for C-H bond activation.",2
On the mechanism of vibrational control of light-induced charge transfer in donor-bridge-acceptor assemblies.,"Nuclear-electronic (vibronic) coupling is increasingly recognized as a mechanism of major importance in controlling the light-induced function of molecular systems. It was recently shown that infrared light excitation of intramolecular vibrations can radically change the efficiency of electron transfer, a fundamental chemical process. We now extend and generalize the understanding of this phenomenon by probing and perturbing vibronic coupling in several molecules in solution. In the experiments an ultrafast electronic-vibrational pulse sequence is applied to a range of donor-bridge-acceptor Pt(II) trans-acetylide assemblies, for which infrared excitation of selected bridge vibrations during ultraviolet-initiated charge separation alters the yields of light-induced product states. The experiments, augmented by quantum chemical calculations, reveal a complex combination of vibronic mechanisms responsible for the observed changes in electron transfer rates and pathways. The study raises new fundamental questions about the function of vibrational processes immediately following charge transfer photoexcitation, and highlights the molecular features necessary for external vibronic control of excited-state processes.",2
Optimization of a whole-cell biocatalyst by employing genetically encoded product sensors inside nanolitre reactors.,"Microcompartmentalization offers a high-throughput method for screening large numbers of biocatalysts generated from genetic libraries. Here we present a microcompartmentalization protocol for benchmarking the performance of whole-cell biocatalysts. Gel capsules served as nanolitre reactors (nLRs) for the cultivation and analysis of a library of Bacillus subtilis biocatalysts. The B. subtilis cells, which were co-confined with E. coli sensor cells inside the nLRs, converted the starting material cellobiose into the industrial product vitamin B2. Product formation triggered a sequence of reactions in the sensor cells: (1) conversion of B2 into flavin mononucleotide (FMN), (2) binding of FMN by a RNA riboswitch and (3) self-cleavage of RNA, which resulted in (4) the synthesis of a green fluorescent protein (GFP). The intensity of GFP fluorescence was then used to isolate B. subtilis variants that convert cellobiose into vitamin B2 with elevated efficiency. The underlying design principles of the assay are general and enable the development of similar protocols, which ultimately will speed up the optimization of whole-cell biocatalysts.",2
"An oxazetidine amino acid for chemical protein synthesis by rapid, serine-forming ligations.","Amide-forming ligation reactions allow the chemical synthesis of proteins by the union of unprotected peptide segments, and enable the preparation of protein derivatives not accessible by expression or bioengineering approaches. The native chemical ligation (NCL) of thioesters and N-terminal cysteines is unquestionably the most successful approach, but is not ideal for all synthetic targets. Here we describe the synthesis of an Fmoc-protected oxazetidine amino acid for use in the alpha-ketoacid-hydroxylamine (KAHA) amide ligation. When incorporated at the N-terminus of a peptide segment, this four-membered cyclic hydroxylamine can be used for rapid serine-forming ligations with peptide alpha-ketoacids. This ligation operates at low concentration (100 muM-5 mM) and mild temperatures (20-25 degrees C). The utility of the reaction was demonstrated by the synthesis of S100A4, a 12 kDa calcium-binding protein not easily accessible by NCL or other amide-forming reactions due to its primary sequence and properties.",2
Quantum interference between H + D2 quasiclassical reaction mechanisms.,"Interferences are genuine quantum phenomena that appear whenever two seemingly distinct classical trajectories lead to the same outcome. They are common in elastic scattering but are seldom observable in chemical reactions. Here we report experimental measurements of the state-to-state angular distribution for the H + D2 reaction using the 'photoloc' technique. For products in low rotational and vibrational states, a characteristic oscillation pattern governs backward scattering. The comparison between the experiments, rigorous quantum calculations and classical trajectories on an accurate potential energy surface allows us to trace the origin of that structure to the quantum interference between different quasiclassical mechanisms, a phenomenon analogous to that observed in the double-slit experiment.",2
Enzymatic hydroxylation of an unactivated methylene C-H bond guided by molecular dynamics simulations.,"The hallmark of enzymes from secondary metabolic pathways is the pairing of powerful reactivity with exquisite site selectivity. The application of these biocatalytic tools in organic synthesis, however, remains under-utilized due to limitations in substrate scope and scalability. Here, we report how the reactivity of a monooxygenase (PikC) from the pikromycin pathway is modified through computationally guided protein and substrate engineering, and applied to the oxidation of unactivated methylene C-H bonds. Molecular dynamics and quantum mechanical calculations were used to develop a predictive model for substrate scope, site selectivity and stereoselectivity of PikC-mediated C-H oxidation. A suite of menthol derivatives was screened computationally and evaluated through in vitro reactions, where each substrate adhered to the predicted models for selectivity and conversion to product. This platform was also expanded beyond menthol-based substrates to the selective hydroxylation of a variety of substrate cores ranging from cyclic to fused bicyclic and bridged bicyclic compounds.",2
Light-controlled self-assembly of non-photoresponsive nanoparticles.,"The ability to guide the assembly of nanosized objects reversibly with external stimuli, in particular light, is of fundamental importance, and it contributes to the development of applications as diverse as nanofabrication and controlled drug delivery. However, all the systems described to date are based on nanoparticles (NPs) that are inherently photoresponsive, which makes their preparation cumbersome and can markedly hamper their performance. Here we describe a conceptually new methodology to assemble NPs reversibly using light that does not require the particles to be functionalized with light-responsive ligands. Our strategy is based on the use of a photoswitchable medium that responds to light in such a way that it modulates the interparticle interactions. NP assembly proceeds quantitatively and without apparent fatigue, both in solution and in gels. Exposing the gels to light in a spatially controlled manner allowed us to draw images that spontaneously disappeared after a specific period of time.",2
"Diels-Alderase-free, bis-pericyclic, [4+2] dimerization in the biosynthesis of (+/-)-paracaseolide A.","The natural product paracaseolide A is a tetracyclic dilactone containing six adjacent stereocentres. Its skeleton occupies a unique structural space among the >200,000 characterized secondary metabolites. Six different research groups have reported a chemical synthesis of this compound, five of which used a thermal, net Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition and dehydration at 110 degrees C to access the target by dimerization of a simple butenolide precursor. Here, we report that this dimerization proceeds under much milder conditions and with a different stereochemical outcome than previously recognized. This can be rationalized by invoking a bis-pericyclic transition state. Furthermore, we find that spontaneous epimerization, necessary to correct the configuration at one key stereocentre, is viable and that natural paracaseolide A is racemic. Together, these facts point to the absence of enzymatic catalysis (that is, Diels-Alderase activity) in the cycloaddition and strongly suggest that a non-enzyme-mediated dimerization is the actual event by which paracaseolide A is produced in nature.",2
Photoinduced reversible switching of porosity in molecular crystals based on star-shaped azobenzene tetramers.,"The development of solid materials that can be reversibly interconverted by light between forms with different physico-chemical properties is of great interest for separation, catalysis, optoelectronics, holography, mechanical actuation and solar energy conversion. Here, we describe a series of shape-persistent azobenzene tetramers that form porous molecular crystals in their E-configuration, the porosity of which can be tuned by changing the peripheral substituents on the molecule. Efficient E-->Z photoisomerization of the azobenzene units takes place in the solid state and converts the crystals into a non-porous amorphous melt phase. Crystallinity and porosity are restored upon Z-->E isomerization promoted by visible light irradiation or heating. We demonstrate that the photoisomerization enables reversible on/off switching of optical properties such as birefringence as well as the capture of CO2 from the gas phase. The linear design, structural versatility and synthetic accessibility make this new family of materials potentially interesting for technological applications.",2
Sub-50-fs photoinduced spin crossover in [Fe(bpy)(3)](2)(+).,"It is known that excitation by visible light of the singlet metal-to-ligand charge-transfer ((1)MLCT) states of Fe(II) complexes leads to population of the lowest-lying high-spin quintet state ((5)T) with unity quantum yield. Here we investigate this so-called spin crossover (SCO) transition in aqueous iron(II)tris(bipyridine). We use pump-probe transient absorption spectroscopy with a high time resolution of <60 fs in the ultraviolet probe range, in which the (5)T state absorbs, and of <40 fs in the visible probe range, in which both the hot MLCT state and the (5)T state absorb. Our results show that the (5)T state is impulsively populated in less than 50 fs, which is the time we measured for the depopulation of the MCLT manifold. We propose that non-totally-symmetric modes mediate the process, possibly high-frequency modes of the bipyridine (bpy) ligand. These results show that even though the SCO process in Fe(II) complexes represents a strongly spin-forbidden (DeltaS = 2) two-electron transition, spin flipping occurs at near subvibrational times and is intertwined with the electron and structural dynamics of the system.",2
On-surface generation and imaging of arynes by atomic force microscopy.,"Reactive intermediates are involved in many chemical transformations. However, their characterization is a great challenge because of their short lifetimes and high reactivities. Arynes, formally derived from arenes by the removal of two hydrogen atoms from adjacent carbon atoms, are prominent reactive intermediates that have been hypothesized for more than a century. Their rich chemistry enables a widespread use in synthetic chemistry, as they are advantageous building blocks for the construction of polycyclic compounds that contain aromatic rings. Here, we demonstrate the generation and characterization of individual polycyclic aryne molecules on an ultrathin insulating film by means of low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Bond-order analysis suggests that a cumulene resonance structure is the dominant one, and the aryne reactivity is preserved at cryogenic temperatures. Our results provide important insights into the chemistry of these elusive intermediates and their potential application in the field of on-surface synthesis.",2
An eight-step gram-scale synthesis of (-)-jiadifenolide.,"Development of a biologically active secondary metabolite into a useful medicine requires continuous access to meaningful quantities of material. Although any chemical synthesis is broadly useful for its versatility, identification of a synthesis route that can be economically scaled represents a greater challenge. Here we report a concise synthesis of the neurotrophic trace metabolite (-)-jiadifenolide and its production on a gram-scale. The brevity of the route and the structural similarity of a key intermediate to many potent Illicium terpenes make chemical synthesis the unquestionable method for accessing and modifying these potential therapeutics.",2
Supramolecular regulation of bioorthogonal catalysis in cells using nanoparticle-embedded transition metal catalysts.,"Bioorthogonal catalysis broadens the functional possibilities of intracellular chemistry. Effective delivery and regulation of synthetic catalytic systems in cells are challenging due to the complex intracellular environment and catalyst instability. Here, we report the fabrication of protein-sized bioorthogonal nanozymes through the encapsulation of hydrophobic transition metal catalysts into the monolayer of water-soluble gold nanoparticles. The activity of these catalysts can be reversibly controlled by binding a supramolecular cucurbit[7]uril 'gate-keeper' onto the monolayer surface, providing a biomimetic control mechanism that mimics the allosteric regulation of enzymes. The potential of this gated nanozyme for use in imaging and therapeutic applications was demonstrated through triggered cleavage of allylcarbamates for pro-fluorophore activation and propargyl groups for prodrug activation inside living cells.",2
Through-space transfer of chiral information mediated by a plasmonic nanomaterial.,"The ability to detect chirality gives stereochemically attuned nanosensors the potential to revolutionize the study of biomolecular processes. Such devices may structurally characterize the mechanisms of protein-ligand binding, the intermediates of amyloidogenic diseases and the effects of phosphorylation and glycosylation. We demonstrate that single nanoparticle plasmonic reporters, or nanotags, can enable a stereochemical response to be transmitted from a chiral analyte to an achiral benzotriazole dye molecule in the vicinity of a plasmon resonance from an achiral metallic nanostructure. The transfer of chirality was verified by the measurement of mirror image surface enhanced resonance Raman optical activity spectra for the two enantiomers of both ribose and tryptophan. Computational modelling confirms these observations and reveals the novel chirality transfer mechanism responsible. This is the first report of colloidal metal nanoparticles in the form of single plasmonic substrates displaying an intrinsic chiral sensitivity once attached to a chiral molecule.",2
"Triamidoamine uranium(IV)-arsenic complexes containing one-, two- and threefold U-As bonding interactions.","To further our fundamental understanding of the nature and extent of covalency in uranium-ligand bonding, and the benefits that this may have for the design of new ligands for nuclear waste separation, there is burgeoning interest in the nature of uranium complexes with soft- and multiple-bond-donor ligands. Despite this, there have so far been no examples of structurally authenticated molecular uranium-arsenic bonds under ambient conditions. Here, we report molecular uranium(IV)-arsenic complexes featuring formal single, double and triple U-As bonding interactions. Compound formulations are supported by a range of characterization techniques, and theoretical calculations suggest the presence of polarized covalent one-, two- and threefold bonding interactions between uranium and arsenic in parent arsenide [U-AsH2], terminal arsinidene [U=AsH] and arsenido [U identical withAsK2] complexes, respectively. These studies inform our understanding of the bonding of actinides with soft donor ligands and may be of use in future ligand design in this area.",2
Chemoselective conversion of biologically sourced polyols into chiral synthons.,"Crude oil currently provides much of the world's energy, but it is also the source of many feedstock chemicals. Methodology for the conversion of biomass into useful chemicals has often focused on either complete deoxygenation or the production of high-volume platform chemicals. Here, we describe the chemoselective partial reduction of silyl-protected C6O6-derived polyols to produce a diverse set of oxygen-functionalized chiral synthons. The combination of B(C6F5)3 and a tertiary silane efficiently generates a reactive equivalent of an electrophilic silylium ion (R3Si(+)) and a hydride (H(-)) reducing agent. The mechanism of oxygen loss does not involve a dehydrative elimination and thus avoids ablation of stereochemistry. Neighbouring group participation and the formation of cyclic intermediates is key to achieving selectivity in these reactions and, where both primary and secondary C-O bonds are present, the mechanism allows further control. The method provides--in one or two synthetic steps--highly improved syntheses of many C6On synthons as well as several previously undescribed products.",2
"An electrochemical clamp assay for direct, rapid analysis of circulating nucleic acids in serum.","The analysis of cell-free nucleic acids (cfNAs), which are present at significant levels in the blood of cancer patients, can reveal the mutational spectrum of a tumour without the need for invasive sampling of the tissue. However, this requires differentiation between the nucleic acids that originate from healthy cells and the mutated sequences shed by tumour cells. Here we report an electrochemical clamp assay that directly detects mutated sequences in patient serum. This is the first successful detection of cfNAs without the need for enzymatic amplification, a step that normally requires extensive sample processing and is prone to interference. The new chip-based assay reads out the presence of mutations within 15 minutes using a collection of oligonucleotides that sequester closely related sequences in solution, and thus allow only the mutated sequence to bind to a chip-based sensor. We demonstrate excellent levels of sensitivity and specificity and show that the clamp assay accurately detects mutated sequences in a collection of samples taken from lung cancer and melanoma patients.",2
Roaming-mediated ultrafast isomerization of geminal tri-bromides in the gas and liquid phases.,"'Roaming' is a new and unusual class of reaction mechanism that has recently been discovered in unimolecular dissociation reactions of isolated molecules in the gas phase. It is characterized by frustrated bond cleavage, after which the two incipient fragments 'roam' on a flat region of the potential energy surface before reacting with one another. Here, we provide evidence that supports roaming in the liquid phase. We are now able to explain previous solution-phase experiments by comparing them with new ultrafast transient absorption data showing the photoisomerization of gas-phase CHBr3. We see that, upon S0-S1 excitation, gas-phase CHBr3 isomerizes within 100 fs into the BrHCBr-Br species, which is identical to what has been observed in solution. Similar sub-100 fs isomerization is now also observed for BBr3 and PBr3 in solution upon S1 excitation. Quantum chemical simulations of XBr3 (X = B, P or CH) suggest that photochemical reactivity in all three cases studied is governed by S1/S0 conical intersections and can best be described as occurring through roaming-mediated pathways.",2
"Selective, rapid and optically switchable regulation of protein function in live mammalian cells.","The rapid and selective regulation of a target protein within living cells that contain closely related family members is an outstanding challenge. Here we introduce genetically directed bioorthogonal ligand tethering (BOLT) and demonstrate selective inhibition (iBOLT) of protein function. In iBOLT, inhibitor-conjugate/target protein pairs are created where the target protein contains a genetically encoded unnatural amino acid with bioorthogonal reactivity and the inhibitor conjugate contains a complementary bioorthogonal group. iBOLT enables the first rapid and specific inhibition of MEK isozymes, and introducing photoisomerizable linkers in the inhibitor conjugate enables reversible, optical regulation of protein activity (photo-BOLT) in live mammalian cells. We demonstrate that a pan kinase inhibitor conjugate allows selective and rapid inhibition of the lymphocyte specific kinase, indicating the modularity and scalability of BOLT. We anticipate that BOLT will enable the rapid and selective regulation of diverse proteins for which no selective small-molecule ligands exist.",2
Simulation-guided DNA probe design for consistently ultraspecific hybridization.,"Hybridization of complementary sequences is one of the central tenets of nucleic acid chemistry; however, the unintended binding of closely related sequences limits the accuracy of hybridization-based approaches to analysing nucleic acids. Thermodynamics-guided probe design and empirical optimization of the reaction conditions have been used to enable the discrimination of single-nucleotide variants, but typically these approaches provide only an approximately 25-fold difference in binding affinity. Here we show that simulations of the binding kinetics are both necessary and sufficient to design nucleic acid probe systems with consistently high specificity as they enable the discovery of an optimal combination of thermodynamic parameters. Simulation-guided probe systems designed against 44 sequences of different target single-nucleotide variants showed between a 200- and 3,000-fold (median 890) higher binding affinity than their corresponding wild-type sequences. As a demonstration of the usefulness of this simulation-guided design approach, we developed probes that, in combination with PCR amplification, detect low concentrations of variant alleles (1%) in human genomic DNA.",2
An infinite chainmail of M6L6 metallacycles featuring multiple Borromean links.,"Borromean rings or links are topologically complex assemblies of three entangled rings where no two rings are interlinked in a chain-like catenane, yet the three rings cannot be separated. We report here a metallacycle complex whose crystalline network forms the first example of a new class of entanglement. The complex is formed from the self-assembly of CuBr2 with the cyclotriveratrylene-scaffold ligand (+/-)-tris(iso-nicotinoyl)cyclotriguaiacylene. Individual metallacycles are interwoven into a two-dimensional chainmail network where each metallacycle exhibits multiple Borromean-ring-like associations with its neighbours. This only occurs in the solid state, and also represents the first example of a crystalline infinite chainmail two-dimensional network. Crystals of the complex were twinned and have an unusual hollow tubular morphology that is likely to result from a localized dissolution-recrystallization process.",2
Adsorption-induced auto-amplification of enantiomeric excess on an achiral surface.,"The homochirality of biomolecules is a signature of life on Earth and has significant implications in, for example, the production of pharmaceutical compounds. It has been suggested that biomolecular homochirality may have arisen from the amplification of a spontaneously formed small enantiomeric excess (e.e.). Many minerals exhibit naturally chiral surfaces and so adsorption has been proposed as one possible mechanism for such an amplification of e.e. Here we show that when gas-phase mixtures of D- and L-aspartic acid are exposed to an achiral Cu(111) surface, a small e.e. in the gas phase, e.e.g, leads to an amplification of the e.e. on the surface, e.e.s, under equilibrium conditions. Adsorption-induced amplification of e.e. does not require a chiral surface. The dependence of e.e.s on e.e.g has been modelled successfully using a Langmuir-like adsorption isotherm that incorporates the formation of homochiral adsorbate clusters on the surface.",2
A molecular shuttle that operates inside a metal-organic framework.,"A 'molecular shuttle' is an interlocked molecular assembly in which a macrocyclic ring is able to move back and forth between two recognition sites. This large-amplitude translational motion was first characterized in solution in 1991. Since that report, many mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) have been designed, synthesized and shown to mimic the complex functions of macroscopic switches and machines. Here, we show that this fundamental concept-the translational motion of a molecular shuttle-can be organized, initiated and made to operate inside a crystalline, solid-state material. A metal-organic framework (MOF) designated UWDM-4 was prepared that contains a rigid linker that is a molecular shuttle. It was demonstrated by variable-temperature (1)H-(13)C cross-polarization/magic-angle spinning (CP/MAS) and (13)C 2D exchange correlation spectroscopy (EXSY) solid-state NMR at 21.1 T on a (13)C-enriched sample that the macrocyclic ring undergoes rapid shuttling along the rigid axle built between struts of the framework.",2
Stabilization of elusive silicon oxides.,"Molecular SiO2 and other simple silicon oxides have remained elusive despite the indispensable use of silicon dioxide materials in advanced electronic devices. Owing to the great reactivity of silicon-oxygen double bonds, as well as the low oxidation state of silicon atoms, the chemistry of simple silicon oxides is essentially unknown. We now report that the soluble disilicon compound, L:Si=Si:L (where L: = :C{N(2,6-(i)Pr2C6H3)CH}2), can be directly oxidized by N2O and O2 to give the carbene-stabilized Si2O3 and Si2O4 moieties, respectively. The nature of the silicon oxide units in these compounds is probed by spectroscopic methods, complementary computations and single-crystal X-ray diffraction.",2
Freeze-thaw cycles as drivers of complex ribozyme assembly.,"The emergence of an RNA catalyst capable of self-replication is considered a key transition in the origin of life. However, how such replicase ribozymes emerged from the pools of short RNA oligomers arising from prebiotic chemistry and non-enzymatic replication is unclear. Here we show that RNA polymerase ribozymes can assemble from simple catalytic networks of RNA oligomers no longer than 30 nucleotides. The entropically disfavoured assembly reaction is driven by iterative freeze-thaw cycles, even in the absence of external activation chemistry. The steep temperature and concentration gradients of such cycles result in an RNA chaperone effect that enhances the otherwise only partially realized catalytic potential of the RNA oligomer pool by an order of magnitude. Our work outlines how cyclic physicochemical processes could have driven an expansion of RNA compositional and phenotypic complexity from simple oligomer pools.",2
The critical role of phase-transfer catalysis in aprotic sodium oxygen batteries.,"In the search for improved energy storage, rechargeable metal-oxygen batteries are very attractive owing to their reliance on molecular oxygen, which forms oxides on discharge that decompose reversibly on charge. Much focus has been directed at aprotic Li-O2 cells, but the aprotic Na-O2 system is of equal interest because of its better reversibility. We report here on the critical role and mechanism of phase-transfer catalysis in Na-O2 batteries. We find that it is solely responsible for the growth and dissolution of micrometre-sized cubic NaO2 crystals and for the reversible cell capacity. In the absence of phase-transfer catalysis, quasi-amorphous NaO2 films are formed and cells exhibit negligible capacity. Electrochemical investigations provide a measure of the transportation of superoxide from the carbon electrode to the electrolyte phase by the phase transfer catalyst. This leads to a new understanding of the mechanism of Na-O2 batteries that, significantly, extends to Li-O2 cells and explains their different behaviour.",2
Applying green chemistry to the photochemical route to artemisinin.,"Artemisinin is an important antimalarial drug, but, at present, the environmental and economic costs of its semi-synthetic production are relatively high. Most of these costs lie in the final chemical steps, which follow a complex acid- and photo-catalysed route with oxygenation by both singlet and triplet oxygen. We demonstrate that applying the principles of green chemistry can lead to innovative strategies that avoid many of the problems in current photochemical processes. The first strategy combines the use of liquid CO2 as solvent and a dual-function solid acid/photocatalyst. The second strategy is an ambient-temperature reaction in aqueous mixtures of organic solvents, where the only inputs are dihydroartemisinic acid, O2 and light, and the output is pure, crystalline artemisinin. Everything else-solvents, photocatalyst and aqueous acid-can be recycled. Some aspects developed here through green chemistry are likely to have wider application in photochemistry and other reactions.",2
"All-cis 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexafluorocyclohexane is a facially polarized cyclohexane.","The highest-energy stereoisomer of 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexafluorocyclohexane, in which all of the fluorines are 'up', is prepared in a 12-step protocol. The molecule adopts a classic chair conformation with alternate C-F bonds aligned triaxially, clustering three highly electronegative fluorine atoms in close proximity. This generates a cyclohexane with a high molecular dipole (mu = 6.2 D), unusual in an otherwise aliphatic compound. X-ray analysis indicates that the intramolecular Fax...Fax distances ( approximately 2.77 A) are longer than the vicinal Fax...Feq- distances ( approximately 2.73 A) suggesting a tension stabilizing the chair conformation. In the solid state the molecules pack in an orientation consistent with electrostatic ordering. Our synthesis of this highest-energy isomer demonstrates the properties that accompany the placement of axial fluorines on a cyclohexane and the unusual property of a facially polarized ring in organic chemistry. Derivatives have potential as new motifs for the design of functional organic molecules or for applications in supramolecular chemistry design.",2
Orthogonal tandem catalysis.,"Tandem catalysis is a growing field that is beginning to yield important scientific and technological advances toward new and more efficient catalytic processes. 'One-pot' tandem reactions, where multiple catalysts and reagents, combined in a single reaction vessel undergo a sequence of precisely staged catalytic steps, are highly attractive from the standpoint of reducing both waste and time. Orthogonal tandem catalysis is a subset of one-pot reactions in which more than one catalyst is used to promote two or more mechanistically distinct reaction steps. This Perspective summarizes and analyses some of the recent developments and successes in orthogonal tandem catalysis, with particular focus on recent strategies to address catalyst incompatibility. We also highlight the concept of thermodynamic leveraging by coupling multiple catalyst cycles to effect challenging transformations not observed in single-step processes, and to encourage application of this technique to energetically unfavourable or demanding reactions.",2
Supramolecular nesting of cyclic polymers.,"Advances in template-directed synthesis make it possible to create artificial molecules with protein-like dimensions, directly from simple components. These synthetic macromolecules have a proclivity for self-organization that is reminiscent of biopolymers. Here, we report the synthesis of monodisperse cyclic porphyrin polymers, with diameters of up to 21 nm (750 C-C bonds). The ratio of the intrinsic viscosities for cyclic and linear topologies is 0.72, indicating that these polymers behave as almost ideal flexible chains in solution. When deposited on gold surfaces, the cyclic polymers display a new mode of two-dimensional supramolecular organization, combining encapsulation and nesting; one nanoring adopts a near-circular conformation, thus allowing a second nanoring to be captured within its perimeter, in a tightly folded conformation. Scanning tunnelling microscopy reveals that nesting occurs in combination with stacking when nanorings are deposited under vacuum, whereas when they are deposited directly from solution under ambient conditions there is stacking or nesting, but not a combination of both.",2
A protein-targeting strategy used to develop a selective inhibitor of the E17K point mutation in the PH domain of Akt1.,"Ligands that can bind selectively to proteins with single amino-acid point mutations offer the potential to detect or treat an abnormal protein in the presence of the wild type (WT). However, it is difficult to develop a selective ligand if the point mutation is not associated with an addressable location, such as a binding pocket. Here we report an all-chemical synthetic epitope-targeting strategy that we used to discover a 5-mer peptide with selectivity for the E17K-transforming point mutation in the pleckstrin homology domain of the Akt1 oncoprotein. A fragment of Akt1 that contained the E17K mutation and an I19[propargylglycine] substitution was synthesized to form an addressable synthetic epitope. Azide-presenting peptides that clicked covalently onto this alkyne-presenting epitope were selected from a library using in situ screening. One peptide exhibits a 10:1 in vitro selectivity for the oncoprotein relative to the WT, with a similar selectivity in cells. This 5-mer peptide was expanded into a larger ligand that selectively blocks the E17K Akt1 interaction with its PIP3 (phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate) substrate.",2
An aptamer-functionalized chemomechanically modulated biomolecule catch-and-release system.,"The efficient extraction of (bio)molecules from fluid mixtures is vital for applications ranging from target characterization in (bio)chemistry to environmental analysis and biomedical diagnostics. Inspired by biological processes that seamlessly synchronize the capture, transport and release of biomolecules, we designed a robust chemomechanical sorting system capable of the concerted catch and release of target biomolecules from a solution mixture. The hybrid system is composed of target-specific, reversible binding sites attached to microscopic fins embedded in a responsive hydrogel that moves the cargo between two chemically distinct environments. To demonstrate the utility of the system, we focus on the effective separation of thrombin by synchronizing the pH-dependent binding strength of a thrombin-specific aptamer with volume changes of the pH-responsive hydrogel in a biphasic microfluidic regime, and show a non-destructive separation that has a quantitative sorting efficiency, as well as the system's stability and amenability to multiple solution recycling.",2
Functionalization of cobalt porphyrin-phospholipid bilayers with his-tagged ligands and antigens.,"Methods to attach polypeptides to lipid bilayers are often indirect and ineffective, and can represent a substantial bottleneck in the formation of functionalized lipid-based materials. Although the polyhistidine tag (his-tag) has been transformative in its simplicity and efficacy in binding to immobilized metals, the successful application of this approach has been challenging in physiological settings. Here we show that lipid bilayers containing porphyrin-phospholipid conjugates that are chelated with cobalt, but not with other metals, can effectively capture his-tagged proteins and peptides. The binding follows a Co(II) to Co(III) transition and occurs within the sheltered hydrophobic bilayer, resulting in an essentially irreversible attachment in serum or in a million fold excess of competing imidazole. Using this approach we anchored homing peptides into the bilayer of preformed and cargo-loaded liposomes to enable tumour targeting without disrupting the bilayer integrity. As a further demonstration, a synthetic protein fragment derived from the human immunodeficiency virus was bound to immunogenic liposomes for potent antibody generation for an otherwise non-antigenic peptide.",2
Structure and biosynthesis of a macrocyclic peptide containing an unprecedented lysine-to-tryptophan crosslink.,"Streptococcal bacteria use peptide signals as a means of intraspecies communication. These peptides can contain unusual post-translational modifications, providing opportunities for expanding our understanding of nature's chemical and biosynthetic repertoires. Here, we have combined tools from natural products discovery and mechanistic enzymology to elucidate the structure and biosynthesis of streptide, a streptococcal macrocyclic peptide. We show that streptide bears an unprecedented post-translational modification involving a covalent linkage between two unactivated carbons within the side chains of lysine and tryptophan. The biosynthesis of streptide was addressed by genetic and biochemical studies. The former implicated a new SPASM-domain-containing radical SAM enzyme StrB, while the latter revealed that StrB contains two [4Fe-4S] clusters and installs the unusual lysine-to-tryptophan crosslink in a single step. By intramolecularly stitching together the side chains of lysine and tryptophan, StrB provides a new route for biosynthesizing macrocyclic peptides.",2
A protonation-coupled feedback mechanism controls the signalling process in bathy phytochromes.,"Phytochromes are bimodal photoswitches composed of a photosensor and an output module. Photoactivation of the sensor is initiated by a double bond isomerization of the tetrapyrrole chromophore and eventually leads to protein conformational changes. Recently determined structural models of phytochromes identify differences between the inactive and the signalling state but do not reveal the mechanism of photosensor activation or deactivation. Here, we report a vibrational spectroscopic study on bathy phytochromes that demonstrates that the formation of the photoactivated state and thus (de)activation of the output module is based on proton translocations in the chromophore pocket coupling chromophore and protein structural changes. These proton transfer steps, involving the tetrapyrrole and a nearby histidine, also enable thermal back-isomerization of the chromophore via keto-enol tautomerization to afford the initial dark state. Thus, the same proton re-arrangements inducing the (de)activation of the output module simultaneously initiate the reversal of this process, corresponding to a negative feedback mechanism.",2
Reversal of Huckel (anti)aromaticity in the lowest triplet states of hexaphyrins and spectroscopic evidence for Baird's rule.,"The reversal of (anti)aromaticity in a molecule's triplet excited state compared with its closed-shell singlet ground state is known as Baird's rule and has attracted the interest of synthetic, physical organic chemists and theorists because of the potential to modulate the fundamental properties of highly conjugated molecules. Here we show that two closely related bis-rhodium hexaphyrins (R26H and R28H) containing [26] and [28] pi-electron peripheries, respectively, exhibit properties consistent with Baird's rule. In the ground state, R26H exhibits a sharp Soret-like band and distinct Q-like bands characteristic of an aromatic porphyrinoid, whereas R28H exhibits a broad absorption spectrum without Q-like bands, which is typical of an antiaromatic porphyrinoid. In contrast, the T-T absorption of R26H is broad, weak and featureless, whereas that of R28H displays an intense and sharp Soret-like band. These spectral signatures, in combination with quantum chemical calculations, are in line with qualitative expectations based on Baird's rule.",2
The colibactin warhead crosslinks DNA.,"Members of the human microbiota are increasingly being correlated to human health and disease states, but the majority of the underlying microbial metabolites that regulate host-microbe interactions remain largely unexplored. Select strains of Escherichia coli present in the human colon have been linked to the initiation of inflammation-induced colorectal cancer through an unknown small-molecule-mediated process. The responsible non-ribosomal peptide-polyketide hybrid pathway encodes 'colibactin', which belongs to a largely uncharacterized family of small molecules. Genotoxic small molecules from this pathway that are capable of initiating cancer formation have remained elusive due to their high instability. Guided by metabolomic analyses, here we employ a combination of NMR spectroscopy and bioinformatics-guided isotopic labelling studies to characterize the colibactin warhead, an unprecedented substituted spirobicyclic structure. The warhead crosslinks duplex DNA in vitro, providing direct experimental evidence for colibactin's DNA-damaging activity. The data support unexpected models for both colibactin biosynthesis and its mode of action.",2
Introducing structural sensitivity into adsorption-energy scaling relations by means of coordination numbers.,"The search for improved heterogeneous catalysts is an important but difficult task. Scaling relations between the adsorption energies of reaction intermediates greatly facilitate the computational design of catalysts. However, this methodology does not currently incorporate structure sensitivity and hence cannot describe adequately the overall activity of realistic catalyst particles and extended surfaces with several facets, edges and apices. Here, we generalize scaling relations by examining twelve different low-index, stepped and kinked surfaces of nine transition metals. This allows us to quantify the effect of the adsorption-site geometry on these relations, ensures a full prediction of their parameters, and helps in identifying intrinsic thermodynamic restrictions to the performance of catalysts. The resulting fully predictable, structure-sensitive scaling relations are a step towards the long-sought rational design of multifaceted catalytic particles. Such a design can now target not only the chemical nature of active materials but also the actual geometry of their active sites.",2
Chemical tagging and customizing of cellular chromatin states using ultrafast trans-splicing inteins.,"Post-translational modification of the histone proteins in chromatin plays a central role in the epigenetic control of DNA-templated processes in eukaryotic cells. Developing methods that enable the structure of histones to be manipulated is, therefore, essential to understand the biochemical mechanisms that underlie genomic regulation. Here we present a synthetic biology method to engineer histones that bear site-specific modifications on cellular chromatin using protein trans-splicing (PTS). We genetically fused the N-terminal fragment of ultrafast split intein to the C terminus of histone H2B, which, on reaction with a complementary synthetic C intein, generated labelled histone. Using this approach, we incorporated various non-native chemical modifications into chromatin in vivo with temporal control. Furthermore, the time and concentration dependence of PTS performed in nucleo enabled us to examine differences in the accessibility of the euchromatin and heterochromatin regions of the epigenome. Finally, we used PTS to semisynthesize a native histone modification, H2BK120 ubiquitination, in isolated nuclei and showed that this can trigger downstream epigenetic crosstalk of H3K79 methylation.",2
Assembling molecular Sierpinski triangle fractals.,"Fractals, being ""exactly the same at every scale or nearly the same at different scales"" as defined by Benoit B. Mandelbrot, are complicated yet fascinating patterns that are important in aesthetics, mathematics, science and engineering. Extended molecular fractals formed by the self-assembly of small-molecule components have long been pursued but, to the best of our knowledge, not achieved. To tackle this challenge we designed and made two aromatic bromo compounds (4,4''-dibromo-1,1':3',1''-terphenyl and 4,4'''-dibromo-1,1':3',1'':4'',1'''-quaterphenyl) to serve as building blocks. The formation of synergistic halogen and hydrogen bonds between these molecules is the driving force to assemble successfully a whole series of defect-free molecular fractals, specifically Sierpinski triangles, on a Ag(111) surface below 80 K. Several critical points that govern the preparation of the molecular Sierpinski triangles were scrutinized experimentally and revealed explicitly. This new strategy may be applied to prepare and explore various planar molecular fractals at surfaces.",2
Exploiting chemically selective weakness in solids as a route to new porous materials.,"Weakness in a material, especially when challenged by chemical, mechanical or physical stimuli, is often viewed as something extremely negative. There are countless examples in which interesting-looking materials have been dismissed as being too unstable for an application. But instability with respect to a stimulus is not always a negative point. In this Perspective we highlight situations where weakness in a material can be used as a synthetic tool to prepare materials that, at present, are difficult or even impossible to prepare using traditional synthetic approaches. To emphasize the concept, we will draw upon examples in the field of nanoporous materials, concentrating on metal-organic frameworks and zeolites, but the general concepts are likely to be applicable across a wide range of materials chemistry. In zeolite chemistry, there is a particular problem with accessing hypothetical structures that this approach may solve.",2
Two-stage directed self-assembly of a cyclic [3]catenane.,"Interlocked molecules possess properties and functions that depend upon their intricate connectivity. In addition to the topologically trivial rotaxanes, whose structures may be captured by a planar graph, the topologically non-trivial knots and catenanes represent some of chemistry's most challenging synthetic targets because of the three-dimensional assembly necessary for their construction. Here we report the synthesis of a cyclic [3]catenane, which consists of three mutually interpenetrating rings, via an unusual synthetic route. Five distinct building blocks self-assemble into a heteroleptic triangular framework composed of two joined Fe(II)3L3 circular helicates. Subcomponent exchange then enables specific points in the framework to be linked together to generate the cyclic [3]catenane product. Our method represents an advance both in the intricacy of the metal-templated self-assembly procedure and in the use of selective imine exchange to generate a topologically complex product.",2
Quantum dynamical resonances in low-energy CO(j = 0) + He inelastic collisions.,"In molecular collisions, long-lived complexes may be formed that correspond to quasi-bound states in the van der Waals potential and give rise to peaks in the collision energy-dependent cross-sections. They are known as 'resonances' and their experimental detection remains difficult because their signatures are extremely challenging to resolve. Here, we show a complete characterization of quantum-dynamical resonances occurring in CO-He inelastic collisions with rotational CO(j = 0->1) excitation. Crossed-beam scattering experiments were performed at collision energies as low as 4 cm(-1), equivalent to a temperature of 4 K. Resonance structures in the measured cross-sections were identified by comparison with quantum-mechanical calculations. The excellent agreement found confirms that the potential energy surfaces describing the CO-He van der Waals interaction are perfectly suitable for calculating state-to-state (de)excitation rate coefficients at the very low temperatures needed in chemical modelling of the interstellar medium. We also computed these rate coefficients.",2
Highly emissive platinum(II) metallacages.,"Light-emitting materials, especially those with tunable wavelengths, attract considerable attention for applications in optoelectronic devices, fluorescent probes, sensors and so on. Many species evaluated for these purposes either emit as a dilute solution or on aggregation, with the former often self-quenching at high concentrations, and the latter falling dark when aggregation is disrupted. Here we preserve emissive behaviour at both low- and high-concentration regimes for two discrete supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs). These tetragonal prismatic SCCs are self-assembled on mixing a metal acceptor, Pt(PEt3)2(OSO2CF3)2, with two organic donors, a pyridyl-decorated tetraphenylethylene and one of two benzene dicarboxylate species. The rigid organization of these fluorescence-active ligands imparts an emissive behaviour to dilute solutions of the resulting assemblies. Furthermore, on aggregation the prisms exhibit variable-wavelength visible-light emission, including rare white-light emission in tetrahydrofuran. The favourable photophysical properties and solvent-dependent aggregation behaviour provide a means to tune emission wavelengths.",2
Iterative design of a helically folded aromatic oligoamide sequence for the selective encapsulation of fructose.,"The ab initio design of synthetic molecular receptors for a specific biomolecular guest remains an elusive objective, particularly for targets such as monosaccharides, which have very close structural analogues. Here we report a powerful approach to produce receptors with very high selectivity for specific monosaccharides and, as a demonstration, we develop a foldamer that selectively encapsulates fructose. The approach uses an iterative design process that exploits the modular structure of folded synthetic oligomer sequences in conjunction with molecular modelling and structural characterization to inform subsequent refinements. Starting from a first-principles design taking size, shape and hydrogen-bonding ability into account and using the high predictability of aromatic oligoamide foldamer conformations and their propensity to crystallize, a sequence that binds to beta-D-fructopyranose in organic solvents with atomic-scale complementarity was obtained in just a few iterative modifications. This scheme, which mimics the adaptable construction of biopolymers from a limited number of monomer units, provides a general protocol for the development of selective receptors.",2
Combined biomass valorization and hydrogen production in a photoelectrochemical cell.,"In a typical hydrogen-producing photoelectrochemical cell (PEC), water reduction at the cathode (producing hydrogen) is accompanied by water oxidation at the anode (producing oxygen). This anode reaction is, however, not kinetically favourable. Here we investigate the possibility of utilizing solar energy for biomass conversion by performing the oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) at the anode of a PEC. HMF is a key intermediate in biomass conversion, and FDCA is an important monomer for the production of numerous polymers. Using 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl as a mediator, we obtained a near-quantitative yield and 100% Faradaic efficiency at ambient conditions without the use of precious-metal catalysts. This reaction is also thermodynamically and kinetically more favourable than water oxidation. Our results suggest that solar-driven biomass conversion can be a viable anode reaction that has the potential to increase both the efficiency and the utility of PECs constructed for solar-fuel production.",2
Inducing and quantifying forbidden reactivity with single-molecule polymer mechanochemistry.,"Forbidden reactions, such as those that violate orbital symmetry effects as captured in the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, remain an ongoing challenge for experimental characterization, because when the competing allowed pathway is available the reactions are intrinsically difficult to trigger. Recent developments in covalent mechanochemistry have opened the door to activating otherwise inaccessible reactions. Here we report single-molecule force spectroscopy studies of three mechanically induced reactions along both their symmetry-allowed and symmetry-forbidden pathways, which enables us to quantify just how 'forbidden' each reaction is. To induce reactions on the ~0.1 s timescale of the experiments, the forbidden ring-opening reactions of benzocyclobutene, gem-difluorocyclopropane and gem-dichlorocyclopropane require approximately 130 pN less, 560 pN more and 1,000 pN more force, respectively, than their corresponding allowed analogues. The results provide the first experimental benchmarks for mechanically induced forbidden reactions, and in some cases suggest revisions to prior computational predictions.",2
Prediction and accelerated laboratory discovery of previously unknown 18-electron ABX compounds.,"Chemists and material scientists have often focused on the properties of previously reported compounds, but neglect numerous unreported but chemically plausible compounds that could have interesting properties. For example, the 18-valence electron ABX family of compounds features examples of topological insulators, thermoelectrics and piezoelectrics, but only 83 out of 483 of these possible compounds have been made. Using first-principles thermodynamics we examined the theoretical stability of the 400 unreported members and predict that 54 should be stable. Of those previously unreported 'missing' materials now predicted to be stable, 15 were grown in this study; X-ray studies agreed with the predicted crystal structure in all 15 cases. Among the predicted and characterized properties of the missing compounds are potential transparent conductors, thermoelectric materials and topological semimetals. This integrated process-prediction of functionality in unreported compounds followed by laboratory synthesis and characterization-could be a route to the systematic discovery of hitherto missing, realizable functional materials.",2
"Common origins of RNA, protein and lipid precursors in a cyanosulfidic protometabolism.","A minimal cell can be thought of as comprising informational, compartment-forming and metabolic subsystems. To imagine the abiotic assembly of such an overall system, however, places great demands on hypothetical prebiotic chemistry. The perceived differences and incompatibilities between these subsystems have led to the widely held assumption that one or other subsystem must have preceded the others. Here we experimentally investigate the validity of this assumption by examining the assembly of various biomolecular building blocks from prebiotically plausible intermediates and one-carbon feedstock molecules. We show that precursors of ribonucleotides, amino acids and lipids can all be derived by the reductive homologation of hydrogen cyanide and some of its derivatives, and thus that all the cellular subsystems could have arisen simultaneously through common chemistry. The key reaction steps are driven by ultraviolet light, use hydrogen sulfide as the reductant and can be accelerated by Cu(I)-Cu(II) photoredox cycling.",2
Stepwise growth of surface-grafted DNA nanotubes visualized at the single-molecule level.,"DNA nanotubes offer a high aspect ratio and rigidity, attractive attributes for the controlled assembly of hierarchically complex linear arrays. It is highly desirable to control the positioning of rungs along the backbone of the nanotubes, minimize the polydispersity in their manufacture and reduce the building costs. We report here a solid-phase synthesis methodology in which, through a cyclic scheme starting from a 'foundation rung' specifically bound to the surface, distinct rungs can be incorporated in a predetermined manner. Each rung is orthogonally addressable. Using fluorescently tagged rungs, single-molecule fluorescence studies demonstrated the robustness and structural fidelity of the constructs and confirmed the incorporation of the rungs in quantitative yield (>95%) at each step of the cycle. Prototype structures that consisted of up to 20 repeat units, about 450 nm in contour length, were constructed. Combined, the solid-phase synthesis strategy described and its visualization through single-molecule spectroscopy show good promise for the production of custom-made DNA nanotubes.",2
Supramolecular ferroelectrics.,"Supramolecular chemistry uses non-covalent interactions to coax molecules into forming ordered assemblies. The construction of ordered materials with these reversible bonds has led to dramatic innovations in organic electronics, polymer science and biomaterials. Here, we review how supramolecular strategies can advance the burgeoning field of organic ferroelectricity. Ferroelectrics - materials with a spontaneous and electrically reversible polarization - are touted for use in non-volatile computer memories, sensors and optics. Historically, this physical phenomenon has been studied in inorganic materials, although some organic examples are known and strong interest exists to extend the search for ferroelectric molecular systems. Other undiscovered applications outside this regime could also emerge. We describe the key features necessary for molecular and supramolecular dipoles in organic ferroelectrics and their incorporation into ordered systems, such as porous frameworks and liquid crystals. The goal of this Review is to motivate the development of innovative supramolecular ferroelectrics that exceed the performance and usefulness of known systems.",2
A subset of annular lipids is linked to the flippase activity of an ABC transporter.,"Lipids are critical components of membranes that could affect the properties of membrane proteins, yet the precise compositions of lipids surrounding membrane-embedded protein complexes is often difficult to discern. Here we report that, for the heterodimeric ABC transporter TmrAB, the extent of delipidation can be controlled by timed exposure to detergent. We subsequently characterize the cohort of endogenous lipids that are extracted in contact with the membrane protein complex, and show that with prolonged delipidation the number of neutral lipids is reduced in favour of their negatively charged counterparts. We show that lipid A is retained by the transporter and that the extent of its binding decreases during the catalytic cycle, implying that lipid A release is linked to adenosine tri-phosphate hydrolysis. Together, these results enable us to propose that a subset of annular lipids is invariant in composition, with negatively charged lipids binding tightly to TmrAB, and imply a role for this exporter in glycolipid translocation.",2
Coulomb explosion during the early stages of the reaction of alkali metals with water.,"Alkali metals can react explosively with water and it is textbook knowledge that this vigorous behaviour results from heat release, steam formation and ignition of the hydrogen gas that is produced. Here we suggest that the initial process enabling the alkali metal explosion in water is, however, of a completely different nature. High-speed camera imaging of liquid drops of a sodium/potassium alloy in water reveals submillisecond formation of metal spikes that protrude from the surface of the drop. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that on immersion in water there is an almost immediate release of electrons from the metal surface. The system thus quickly reaches the Rayleigh instability limit, which leads to a 'coulomb explosion' of the alkali metal drop. Consequently, a new metal surface in contact with water is formed, which explains why the reaction does not become self-quenched by its products, but can rather lead to explosive behaviour.",2
Dual-display of small molecules enables the discovery of ligand pairs and facilitates affinity maturation.,"In contrast to standard fragment-based drug discovery approaches, dual-display DNA-encoded chemical libraries have the potential to identify fragment pairs that bind simultaneously and benefit from the chelate effect. However, the technology has been limited by the difficulty in unambiguously decoding the ligand pairs from large combinatorial libraries. Here we report a strategy that overcomes this limitation and enables the efficient identification of ligand pairs that bind to a target protein. Small organic molecules were conjugated to the 5' and 3' ends of complementary DNA strands that contain a unique identifying code. DNA hybridization followed by an inter-strand code-transfer created a stable dual-display DNA-encoded chemical library of 111,100 members. Using this approach we report the discovery of a low micromolar binder to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein and the affinity maturation of a ligand to carbonic anhydrase IX, an established marker of renal cell carcinoma. The newly discovered subnanomolar carbonic anhydrase IX binder dramatically improved tumour targeting performance in vivo.",2
Atropselective syntheses of (-) and (+) rugulotrosin A utilizing point-to-axial chirality transfer.,"Chiral, dimeric natural products containing complex structures and interesting biological properties have inspired chemists and biologists for decades. A seven-step total synthesis of the axially chiral, dimeric tetrahydroxanthone natural product rugulotrosin A is described. The synthesis employs a one-pot Suzuki coupling/dimerization to generate the requisite 2,2'-biaryl linkage. Highly selective point-to-axial chirality transfer was achieved using palladium catalysis with achiral phosphine ligands. Single X-ray crystal diffraction data were obtained to confirm both the atropisomeric configuration and absolute stereochemistry of rugulotrosin A. Computational studies are described to rationalize the atropselectivity observed in the key dimerization step. Comparison of the crude fungal extract with synthetic rugulotrosin A and its atropisomer verified that nature generates a single atropisomer of the natural product.",2
Synthesis and characterization of hexaarylbenzenes with five or six different substituents enabled by programmed synthesis.,"Since its discovery in 1825, benzene has served as one of the most used and indispensable building blocks of chemical compounds, ranging from pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals to plastics and those used in organic electronic devices. Benzene has six hydrogen atoms that can each be replaced by different substituents, which means that the structural diversity of benzene derivatives is intrinsically extraordinary. The number of possible substituted benzenes from n different substituents is (2n + 2n(2) + 4n(3) + 3n(4) + n(6))/12. However, owing to a lack of general synthetic methods for making multisubstituted benzenes, this potentially huge structural diversity has not been fully exploited. Here, we describe a programmed synthesis of hexaarylbenzenes using C-H activation, cross-coupling and [4+2] cycloaddition reactions. The present method allows for the isolation and structure-property characterization of hexaarylbenzenes with distinctive aryl substituents at all positions for the first time. Moreover, the established protocol can be applied to the synthesis of tetraarylnaphthalenes and pentaarylpyridines.",2
Intermediate tunnelling-hopping regime in DNA charge transport.,"Charge transport in molecular systems, including DNA, is involved in many basic chemical and biological processes, and its understanding is critical if they are to be used in electronic devices. This important phenomenon is often described as either coherent tunnelling over a short distance or incoherent hopping over a long distance. Here, we show evidence of an intermediate regime where coherent and incoherent processes coexist in double-stranded DNA. We measure charge transport in single DNA molecules bridged to two electrodes as a function of DNA sequence and length. In general, the resistance of DNA increases linearly with length, as expected for incoherent hopping. However, for DNA sequences with stacked guanine-cytosine (GC) base pairs, a periodic oscillation is superimposed on the linear length dependence, indicating partial coherent transport. This result is supported by the finding of strong delocalization of the highest occupied molecular orbitals of GC by theoretical simulation and by modelling based on the Buttiker theory of partial coherent charge transport.",2
Stereoelectronic switching in single-molecule junctions.,"A new intersection between reaction chemistry and electronic circuitry is emerging from the ultraminiaturization of electronic devices. Over decades chemists have developed a nuanced understanding of stereoelectronics to establish how the electronic properties of molecules relate to their conformation; the recent advent of single-molecule break-junction techniques provides the means to alter this conformation with a level of control previously unimagined. Here we unite these ideas by demonstrating the first single-molecule switch that operates through a stereoelectronic effect. We demonstrate this behaviour in permethyloligosilanes with methylthiomethyl electrode linkers. The strong sigma conjugation in the oligosilane backbone couples the stereoelectronic properties of the sulfur-methylene sigma bonds that terminate the molecule. Theoretical calculations support the existence of three distinct dihedral conformations that differ drastically in their electronic character. We can shift between these three species by simply lengthening or compressing the molecular junction, and, in doing so, we can switch conductance digitally between two states.",2
Molecular length dictates the nature of charge carriers in single-molecule junctions of oxidized oligothiophenes.,"To develop advanced materials for electronic devices, it is of utmost importance to design organic building blocks with tunable functionality and to study their properties at the molecular level. For organic electronic and photovoltaic applications, the ability to vary the nature of charge carriers and so create either electron donors or acceptors is critical. Here we demonstrate that charge carriers in single-molecule junctions can be tuned within a family of molecules that contain electron-deficient thiophene-1,1-dioxide (TDO) building blocks. Oligomers of TDO were designed to increase electron affinity and maintain delocalized frontier orbitals while significantly decreasing the transport gap. Through thermopower measurements we show that the dominant charge carriers change from holes to electrons as the number of TDO units is increased. This results in a unique system in which the charge carrier depends on the backbone length, and provides a new means to tune p- and n-type transport in organic materials.",2
Heat flux across an open pore enables the continuous replication and selection of oligonucleotides towards increasing length.,"The replication of nucleic acids is central to the origin of life. On the early Earth, suitable non-equilibrium boundary conditions would have been required to surmount the effects of thermodynamic equilibrium such as the dilution and degradation of oligonucleotides. One particularly intractable experimental finding is that short genetic polymers replicate faster and outcompete longer ones, which leads to ever shorter sequences and the loss of genetic information. Here we show that a heat flux across an open pore in submerged rock concentrates replicating oligonucleotides from a constant feeding flow and selects for longer strands. Our experiments utilize the interplay of molecular thermophoresis and laminar convection, the latter driving strand separation and exponential replication. Strands of 75 nucleotides survive whereas strands half as long die out, which inverts the above dilemma of the survival of the shortest. The combined feeding, thermal cycling and positive length selection opens the door for a stable molecular evolution in the long-term microhabitat of heated porous rock.",2
Terpene cyclization catalysed inside a self-assembled cavity.,"In nature, complex terpene natural products are formed by the so-called tail-to-head terpene (THT) cyclization. The cationic reaction cascade is promoted efficiently in complex enzyme pockets, in which cationic intermediates and transition states are stabilized. In solution, the reaction is hard to control and man-made catalysts able to perform selective THT cyclizations are lacking. We herein report the first example of a successful THT cyclization inside a supramolecular structure. The basic mode of operation in cyclase enzymes was mimicked successfully and a catalytic non-stop THT was achieved with geranyl acetate as the substrate. The results presented have implications for the postulated reaction mechanism in cyclase enzymes. Evidence indicates that the direct isomerization of a geranyl cation to the cisoid isomer, which so far was considered unlikely, is feasible.",2
Catalytic enantioselective synthesis of indanes by a cation-directed 5-endo-trig cyclization.,"5-Endo-trig cyclizations are generally considered to be kinetically unfavourable, as described by Baldwin's rules. Consequently, observation of this mode of reaction under kinetic control is rare. This is usually ascribed to challenges in achieving appropriate approach trajectories for orbital overlap in the transition state. Here, we describe a highly enantio- and diastereoselective route to complex indanes bearing all-carbon quaternary stereogenic centres via a 5-endo-trig cyclization catalysed by a chiral ammonium salt. Through computation, the preference for the formally disfavoured 5-endo-trig Michael reaction over the formally favoured 5-exo-trig Dieckmann reaction is shown to result from thermodynamic contributions to the innate selectivity of the nucleophilic group, which outweigh the importance of the approach trajectory as embodied by Baldwin's rules. Our experimental and theoretical findings demonstrate that geometric and stereoelectronic constraints may not be decisive in the observed outcome of irreversible ring-closing reactions.",2
On the origin of the stability of graphene oxide membranes in water.,"Graphene oxide (GO) films are known to be highly stable in water and this property has made their use in membrane applications in solution possible. However, this state of affairs is somewhat counterintuitive because GO sheets become negatively charged on hydration and the membrane should disintegrate owing to electrostatic repulsion. We have now discovered a long-overlooked reason behind this apparent contradiction. Our findings show that neat GO membranes do, indeed, readily disintegrate in water, but the films become stable if they are crosslinked by multivalent cationic metal contaminants. Such metal contaminants can be introduced unintentionally during the synthesis and processing of GO, most notably on filtration with anodized aluminium oxide filter discs that corrode to release significant amounts of aluminium ions. This finding has wide implications in interpreting the processing-structure-property relationships of GO and other lamellar membranes. We also discuss strategies to avoid and mitigate metal contamination and demonstrate that this effect can be exploited to synthesize new membrane materials.",2
Rational design of functional and tunable oscillating enzymatic networks.,"Life is sustained by complex systems operating far from equilibrium and consisting of a multitude of enzymatic reaction networks. The operating principles of biology's regulatory networks are known, but the in vitro assembly of out-of-equilibrium enzymatic reaction networks has proved challenging, limiting the development of synthetic systems showing autonomous behaviour. Here, we present a strategy for the rational design of programmable functional reaction networks that exhibit dynamic behaviour. We demonstrate that a network built around autoactivation and delayed negative feedback of the enzyme trypsin is capable of producing sustained oscillating concentrations of active trypsin for over 65 h. Other functions, such as amplification, analog-to-digital conversion and periodic control over equilibrium systems, are obtained by linking multiple network modules in microfluidic flow reactors. The methodology developed here provides a general framework to construct dissipative, tunable and robust (bio)chemical reaction networks.",2
Trapping virtual pores by crystal retro-engineering.,"Stable guest-free porous molecular crystals are uncommon. By contrast, organic molecular crystals with guest-occupied cavities are frequently observed, but these cavities tend to be unstable and collapse on removal of the guests-this feature has been referred to as 'virtual porosity'. Here, we show how we have trapped the virtual porosity in an unstable low-density organic molecular crystal by introducing a second molecule that matches the size and shape of the unstable voids. We call this strategy 'retro-engineering' because it parallels organic retrosynthetic analysis, and it allows the metastable two-dimensional hexagonal pore structure in an organic solvate to be trapped in a binary cocrystal. Unlike the crystal with virtual porosity, the cocrystal material remains single crystalline and porous after removal of guests by heating.",2
"Catalytic, stereospecific syn-dichlorination of alkenes.","As some of the oldest organic chemical reactions known, the ionic additions of elemental halogens such as bromine and chlorine to alkenes are prototypical examples of stereospecific reactions, typically delivering vicinal dihalides resulting from anti-addition. Although the invention of enantioselective variants is an ongoing challenge, the ability to overturn the intrinsic anti-diastereospecificity of these transformations is also a largely unsolved problem. Here, we describe the first catalytic, syn-stereospecific dichlorination of alkenes, employing a group transfer catalyst based on a redox-active main group element (selenium). With diphenyl diselenide (PhSeSePh) (5 mol%) as the pre-catalyst, benzyltriethylammonium chloride (BnEt3NCl) as the chloride source and an N-fluoropyridinium salt as the oxidant, a wide variety of functionalized cyclic and acyclic 1,2-disubstituted alkenes, including simple allylic alcohols, deliver syn-dichlorides with exquisite stereocontrol. This methodology is expected to find applications in streamlining the synthesis of polychlorinated natural products such as the chlorosulfolipids.",2
Concerted proton-coupled electron transfer from a metal-hydride complex.,"Metal hydrides are key intermediates in the catalytic reduction of protons and CO2 as well as in the oxidation of H2. In these reactions, electrons and protons are transferred to or from separate acceptors or donors in bidirectional protoncoupled electron transfer (PCET) steps. The mechanistic interpretation of PCET reactions of metal hydrides has focused on the stepwise transfer of electrons and protons. A concerted transfer may, however, occur with a lower reaction barrier and therefore proceed at higher catalytic rates. Here we investigate the feasibility of such a reaction by studying the oxidation-deprotonation reactions of a tungsten hydride complex. The rate dependence on the driving force for both electron transfer and proton transfer-employing different combinations of oxidants and bases-was used to establish experimentally the concerted, bidirectional PCET of a metal-hydride species. Consideration of the findings presented here in future catalyst designs may lead to more-efficient catalysts.",2
Quantitative mapping of zinc fluxes in the mammalian egg reveals the origin of fertilization-induced zinc sparks.,"Fertilization of a mammalian egg initiates a series of 'zinc sparks' that are necessary to induce the egg-to-embryo transition. Despite the importance of these zinc-efflux events little is known about their origin. To understand the molecular mechanism of the zinc spark we combined four physical approaches that resolve zinc distributions in single cells: a chemical probe for dynamic live-cell fluorescence imaging and a combination of scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence microscopy and three-dimensional elemental tomography for high-resolution elemental mapping. We show that the zinc spark arises from a system of thousands of zinc-loaded vesicles, each of which contains, on average, 10(6) zinc atoms. These vesicles undergo dynamic movement during oocyte maturation and exocytosis at the time of fertilization. The discovery of these vesicles and the demonstration that zinc sparks originate from them provides a quantitative framework for understanding how zinc fluxes regulate cellular processes.",2
Supramolecular binding and separation of hydrocarbons within a functionalized porous metal-organic framework.,"Supramolecular interactions are fundamental to host-guest binding in many chemical and biological processes. Direct visualization of such supramolecular interactions within host-guest systems is extremely challenging, but crucial to understanding their function. We report a comprehensive study that combines neutron scattering, synchrotron X-ray and neutron diffraction, and computational modelling to define the detailed binding at a molecular level of acetylene, ethylene and ethane within the porous host NOTT-300. This study reveals simultaneous and cooperative hydrogen-bonding, pi...pi stacking interactions and intermolecular dipole interactions in the binding of acetylene and ethylene to give up to 12 individual weak supramolecular interactions aligned within the host to form an optimal geometry for the selective binding of hydrocarbons. We also report the cooperative binding of a mixture of acetylene and ethylene within the porous host, together with the corresponding breakthrough experiments and analysis of adsorption isotherms of gas mixtures.",2
Porphyrins at interfaces.,"Porphyrins and other tetrapyrrole macrocycles possess an impressive variety of functional properties that have been exploited in natural and artificial systems. Different metal centres incorporated within the tetradentate ligand are key for achieving and regulating vital processes, including reversible axial ligation of adducts, electron transfer, light-harvesting and catalytic transformations. Tailored substituents optimize their performance, dictating their arrangement in specific environments and mediating the assembly of molecular nanoarchitectures. Here we review the current understanding of these species at well-defined interfaces, disclosing exquisite insights into their structural and chemical properties, and also discussing methods by which to manipulate their intramolecular and organizational features. The distinct characteristics arising from the interfacial confinement offer intriguing prospects for molecular science and advanced materials. We assess the role of surface interactions with respect to electronic and physicochemical characteristics, and describe in situ metallation pathways, molecular magnetism, rotation and switching. The engineering of nanostructures, organized layers, interfacial hybrid and bio-inspired systems is also addressed.",2
Pseudopterosin synthesis from a chiral cross-conjugated hydrocarbon through a series of cycloadditions.,"The pseudopterosins are a family of diterpene marine natural products, which, by virtue of their interesting anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, have attracted the attentions of many synthetic chemists. The most efficient syntheses reported to date are 14 and 20 steps in the longest linear sequence for chiral pool and enantioselective approaches, respectively, and all start with precursors that are easily mapped onto the natural product structure. Here, we describe an unconventional approach in which a chiral cross-conjugated hydrocarbon is used as the starting material for a series of three cycloadditions. Our approach has led to a significant reduction in the step count required to access these interesting natural products (10 steps chiral pool and 11 steps enantioselective). Furthermore it demonstrates that cross-conjugated hydrocarbons, erroneously considered by many to be too unstable and difficult to handle, are viable precursors for natural product synthesis.",2
Screening and classifying small-molecule inhibitors of amyloid formation using ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry.,"The search for therapeutic agents that bind specifically to precursor protein conformations and inhibit amyloid assembly is an important challenge. Identifying such inhibitors is difficult because many protein precursors of aggregation are partially folded or intrinsically disordered, which rules out structure-based design. Furthermore, inhibitors can act by a variety of mechanisms, including specific or nonspecific binding, as well as colloidal inhibition. Here we report a high-throughput method based on ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (IMS-MS) that is capable of rapidly detecting small molecules that bind to amyloid precursors, identifying the interacting protein species and defining the mode of inhibition. Using this method we have classified a variety of small molecules that are potential inhibitors of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) aggregation or amyloid-beta 1-40 aggregation as specific, nonspecific, colloidal or non-interacting. We also demonstrate the ability of IMS-MS to screen for inhibitory small molecules in a 96-well plate format and use this to discover a new inhibitor of hIAPP amyloid assembly.",2
Spatially resolved analysis of short-range structure perturbations in a plastically bent molecular crystal.,"The exceptional mechanical flexibility observed with certain organic crystals defies the common perception of single crystals as brittle objects. Here, we describe the morphostructural consequences of plastic deformation in crystals of hexachlorobenzene that can be bent mechanically at multiple locations to 360 degrees with retention of macroscopic integrity. This extraordinary plasticity proceeds by segregation of the bent section into flexible layers that slide on top of each other, thereby generating domains with slightly different lattice orientations. Microscopic, spectroscopic and diffraction analyses of the bent crystal showed that the preservation of crystal integrity when stress is applied on the (001) face requires sliding of layers by breaking and re-formation of halogen-halogen interactions. Application of stress on the (100) face, in the direction where pi...pi interactions dominate the packing, leads to immediate crystal disintegration. Within a broader perspective, this study highlights the yet unrecognized extraordinary malleability of molecular crystals with strongly anisotropic supramolecular interactions.",2
Substrate control in stereoselective lanthionine biosynthesis.,Enzymes are typically highly stereoselective catalysts that enforce a reactive conformation on their native substrates. We report here a rare example in which the substrate controls the stereoselectivity of an enzyme-catalysed Michael-type addition during the biosynthesis of lanthipeptides. These natural products contain thioether crosslinks formed by a cysteine attack on dehydrated Ser and Thr residues. We demonstrate that several lanthionine synthetases catalyse highly selective anti-additions in which the substrate (and not the enzyme) determines whether the addition occurs from the re or si face. A single point mutation in the peptide substrate completely inverted the stereochemical outcome of the enzymatic modification. Quantum mechanical calculations reproduced the experimentally observed selectivity and suggest that conformational restraints imposed by the amino-acid sequence on the transition states determine the face selectivity of the Michael-type cyclization.,2
Solvating additives drive solution-mediated electrochemistry and enhance toroid growth in non-aqueous Li-O(2) batteries.,"Given their high theoretical specific energy, lithium-oxygen batteries have received enormous attention as possible alternatives to current state-of-the-art rechargeable Li-ion batteries. However, the maximum discharge capacity in non-aqueous lithium-oxygen batteries is limited to a small fraction of its theoretical value due to the build-up of insulating lithium peroxide (Li(2)O(2)), the battery's primary discharge product. The discharge capacity can be increased if Li(2)O(2) forms as large toroidal particles rather than as a thin conformal layer. Here, we show that trace amounts of electrolyte additives, such as H(2)O, enhance the formation of Li(2)O(2) toroids and result in significant improvements in capacity. Our experimental observations and a growth model show that the solvating properties of the additives prompt a solution-based mechanism that is responsible for the growth of Li(2)O(2) toroids. We present a general formalism describing an additive's tendency to trigger the solution process, providing a rational design route for electrolytes that afford larger lithium-oxygen battery capacities.",2
Covalent functionalization of monolayered transition metal dichalcogenides by phase engineering.,"Chemical functionalization of low-dimensional materials such as nanotubes, nanowires and graphene leads to profound changes in their properties and is essential for solubilizing them in common solvents. Covalent attachment of functional groups is generally achieved at defect sites, which facilitate electron transfer. Here, we describe a simple and general method for covalent functionalization of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide nanosheets (MoS(2), WS(2) and MoSe(2)), which does not rely on defect engineering. The functionalization reaction is instead facilitated by electron transfer between the electron-rich metallic 1T phase and an organohalide reactant, resulting in functional groups that are covalently attached to the chalcogen atoms of the transition metal dichalcogenide. The attachment of functional groups leads to dramatic changes in the optoelectronic properties of the material. For example, we show that it renders the metallic 1T phase semiconducting, and gives it strong and tunable photoluminescence and gate modulation in field-effect transistors.",2
Copper-catalysed selective hydroamination reactions of alkynes.,"The development of selective reactions that utilize easily available and abundant precursors for the efficient synthesis of amines is a long-standing goal of chemical research. Despite the centrality of amines in a number of important research areas, including medicinal chemistry, total synthesis and materials science, a general, selective and step-efficient synthesis of amines is still needed. Here, we describe a set of mild catalytic conditions utilizing a single copper-based catalyst that enables the direct preparation of three distinct and important amine classes (enamines, alpha-chiral branched alkylamines and linear alkylamines) from readily available alkyne starting materials with high levels of chemo-, regio- and stereoselectivity. This methodology was applied to the asymmetric synthesis of rivastigmine and the formal synthesis of several other pharmaceutical agents, including duloxetine, atomoxetine, fluoxetine and tolterodine.",2
Exploring the sequence space for (tri-)peptide self-assembly to design and discover new hydrogels.,"Peptides that self-assemble into nanostructures are of tremendous interest for biological, medical, photonic and nanotechnological applications. The enormous sequence space that is available from 20 amino acids probably harbours many interesting candidates, but it is currently not possible to predict supramolecular behaviour from sequence alone. Here, we demonstrate computational tools to screen for the aqueous self-assembly propensity in all of the 8,000 possible tripeptides and evaluate these by comparison with known examples. We applied filters to select for candidates that simultaneously optimize the apparently contradicting requirements of aggregation propensity and hydrophilicity, which resulted in a set of design rules for self-assembling sequences. A number of peptides were subsequently synthesized and characterized, including the first reported tripeptides that are able to form a hydrogel at neutral pH. These tools, which enable the peptide sequence space to be searched for supramolecular properties, enable minimalistic peptide nanotechnology to deliver on its promise.",2
Towards greener and more sustainable batteries for electrical energy storage.,"Ever-growing energy needs and depleting fossil-fuel resources demand the pursuit of sustainable energy alternatives, including both renewable energy sources and sustainable storage technologies. It is therefore essential to incorporate material abundance, eco-efficient synthetic processes and life-cycle analysis into the design of new electrochemical storage systems. At present, a few existing technologies address these issues, but in each case, fundamental and technological hurdles remain to be overcome. Here we provide an overview of the current state of energy storage from a sustainability perspective. We introduce the notion of sustainability through discussion of the energy and environmental costs of state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries, considering elemental abundance, toxicity, synthetic methods and scalability. With the same themes in mind, we also highlight current and future electrochemical storage systems beyond lithium-ion batteries. The complexity and importance of recycling battery materials is also discussed.",2
"Atom-efficient regioselective 1,2-dearomatization of functionalized pyridines by an earth-abundant organolanthanide catalyst.","Developing earth-abundant, non-platinum metal catalysts for high-value chemical transformations is a critical challenge to contemporary chemical synthesis. Dearomatization of pyridine derivatives is an important transformation to access a wide range of valuable nitrogenous natural products, pharmaceuticals and materials. Here, we report an efficient 1,2-regioselective organolanthanide-catalysed pyridine dearomatization process using pinacolborane, which is compatible with a broad range of pyridines and functional groups and employs equimolar reagent stoichiometry. Regarding the mechanism, derivation of the rate law from NMR spectroscopic and kinetic measurements suggests first order in catalyst concentration, fractional order in pyridine concentration and inverse first order in pinacolborane concentration, with C=N insertion into the La-H bond as turnover-determining. An energetic span analysis affords a more detailed understanding of experimental activity trends and the unusual kinetic behaviour, and proposes the catalyst 'resting' state and potential deactivation pathways.",2
The role of LiO2 solubility in O2 reduction in aprotic solvents and its consequences for Li-O2 batteries.,"When lithium-oxygen batteries discharge, O2 is reduced at the cathode to form solid Li2O2. Understanding the fundamental mechanism of O2 reduction in aprotic solvents is therefore essential to realizing their technological potential. Two different models have been proposed for Li2O2 formation, involving either solution or electrode surface routes. Here, we describe a single unified mechanism, which, unlike previous models, can explain O2 reduction across the whole range of solvents and for which the two previous models are limiting cases. We observe that the solvent influences O2 reduction through its effect on the solubility of LiO2, or, more precisely, the free energy of the reaction LiO2(*) right harpoon over left harpoon Li(sol)(+) + O2(-)(sol) + ion pairs + higher aggregates (clusters). The unified mechanism shows that low-donor-number solvents are likely to lead to premature cell death, and that the future direction of research for lithium-oxygen batteries should focus on the search for new, stable, high-donor-number electrolytes, because they can support higher capacities and can better sustain discharge.",2
Rhodanine hydrolysis leads to potent thioenolate mediated metallo-beta-lactamase inhibition.,"The use of beta-lactam antibiotics is compromised by resistance, which is provided by beta-lactamases belonging to both metallo (MBL)- and serine (SBL)-beta-lactamase subfamilies. The rhodanines are one of very few compound classes that inhibit penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), SBLs and, as recently reported, MBLs. Here, we describe crystallographic analyses of the mechanism of inhibition of the clinically relevant VIM-2 MBL by a rhodanine, which reveal that the rhodanine ring undergoes hydrolysis to give a thioenolate. The thioenolate is found to bind via di-zinc chelation, mimicking the binding of intermediates in beta-lactam hydrolysis. Crystallization of VIM-2 in the presence of the intact rhodanine led to observation of a ternary complex of MBL, a thioenolate fragment and rhodanine. The crystallographic observations are supported by kinetic and biophysical studies, including (19)F NMR analyses, which reveal the rhodanine-derived thioenolate to be a potent broad-spectrum MBL inhibitor and a lead structure for the development of new types of clinically useful MBL inhibitors.",2
Molecular motor-driven abrupt anisotropic shape change in a single crystal of a Ni complex.,"Many molecular machines with controllable molecular-scale motors have been developed. However, transmitting molecular movement to the macroscopic scale remains a formidable challenge. Here we report a single crystal of a Ni complex whose shape changes abruptly and reversibly in response to thermal changes at around room temperature. Variable-temperature single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies show that the crystalline shape change is induced by an unusual 90 degrees rotation of uniaxially aligned oxalate molecules. The oxalate dianions behave as molecular-scale rotors, with their movement propagated through the entire crystalline material via intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Consequently, the subnanometre-scale changes in the oxalate molecules are instantly amplified to a micrometre-scale contraction or expansion of the crystal, accompanied by a thermal hysteresis loop. The shape change in the crystal was clearly detected under an optical microscope. The large directional deformation and prompt response suggest a role for this material in microscale or nanoscale thermal actuators.",2
Revealing the macromolecular targets of complex natural products.,"Natural products have long been a source of useful biological activity for the development of new drugs. Their macromolecular targets are, however, largely unknown, which hampers rational drug design and optimization. Here we present the development and experimental validation of a computational method for the discovery of such targets. The technique does not require three-dimensional target models and may be applied to structurally complex natural products. The algorithm dissects the natural products into fragments and infers potential pharmacological targets by comparing the fragments to synthetic reference drugs with known targets. We demonstrate that this approach results in confident predictions. In a prospective validation, we show that fragments of the potent antitumour agent archazolid A, a macrolide from the myxobacterium Archangium gephyra, contain relevant information regarding its polypharmacology. Biochemical and biophysical evaluation confirmed the predictions. The results obtained corroborate the practical applicability of the computational approach to natural product 'de-orphaning'.",2
Structure of a designed protein cage that self-assembles into a highly porous cube.,"Natural proteins can be versatile building blocks for multimeric, self-assembling structures. Yet, creating protein-based assemblies with specific geometries and chemical properties remains challenging. Highly porous materials represent particularly interesting targets for designed assembly. Here, we utilize a strategy of fusing two natural protein oligomers using a continuous alpha-helical linker to design a novel protein that self assembles into a 750 kDa, 225 A diameter, cube-shaped cage with large openings into a 130 A diameter inner cavity. A crystal structure of the cage showed atomic-level agreement with the designed model, while electron microscopy, native mass spectrometry and small angle X-ray scattering revealed alternative assembly forms in solution. These studies show that accurate design of large porous assemblies with specific shapes is feasible, while further specificity improvements will probably require limiting flexibility to select against alternative forms. These results provide a foundation for the design of advanced materials with applications in bionanotechnology, nanomedicine and material sciences.",2
"Mechanistic, crystallographic, and computational studies on the catalytic, enantioselective sulfenofunctionalization of alkenes.","The stereocontrolled introduction of vicinal heteroatomic substituents into organic molecules is one of the most powerful ways of adding value and function. Although many methods exist for the introduction of oxygen- and nitrogen-containing substituents, the number of stereocontrolled methods for the introduction of sulfur-containing substituents pales by comparison. Previous reports from our laboratories have described sulfenofunctionalizations of alkenes that construct carbon-sulfur bonds vicinal to carbon-oxygen, carbon-nitrogen or carbon-carbon bonds with high levels of diastereospecificity and enantioselectivity. This process is enabled by the concept of Lewis-base activation of Lewis acids, which provides activation of Group 16 electrophiles. To provide a foundation for the expansion of substrate scope and improved selectivities, we have undertaken a comprehensive study of the catalytically active species. Insights gleaned from kinetic, crystallographic and computational methods have led to the introduction of a new family of sulfenylating agents that provide significantly enhanced selectivities.",2
5-Hydroxymethylcytosine is a predominantly stable DNA modification.,"5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC) is an oxidation product of 5-methylcytosine which is present in the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of most mammalian cells. Reduction of hmC levels in DNA is a hallmark of cancers. Elucidating the dynamics of this oxidation reaction and the lifetime of hmC in DNA is fundamental to understanding hmC function. Using stable isotope labelling of cytosine derivatives in the DNA of mammalian cells and ultrasensitive tandem liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry, we show that the majority of hmC is a stable modification, as opposed to a transient intermediate. In contrast with DNA methylation, which occurs immediately during replication, hmC forms slowly during the first 30 hours following DNA synthesis. Isotopic labelling of DNA in mouse tissues confirmed the stability of hmC in vivo and demonstrated a relationship between global levels of hmC and cell proliferation. These insights have important implications for understanding the states of chemically modified DNA bases in health and disease.",2
Discovering chemistry with an ab initio nanoreactor.,"Chemical understanding is driven by the experimental discovery of new compounds and reactivity, and is supported by theory and computation that provide detailed physical insight. Although theoretical and computational studies have generally focused on specific processes or mechanistic hypotheses, recent methodological and computational advances harken the advent of their principal role in discovery. Here we report the development and application of the ab initio nanoreactor--a highly accelerated first-principles molecular dynamics simulation of chemical reactions that discovers new molecules and mechanisms without preordained reaction coordinates or elementary steps. Using the nanoreactor, we show new pathways for glycine synthesis from primitive compounds proposed to exist on the early Earth, which provide new insight into the classic Urey-Miller experiment. These results highlight the emergence of theoretical and computational chemistry as a tool for discovery, in addition to its traditional role of interpreting experimental findings.",2
Halogen bonding in water results in enhanced anion recognition in acyclic and rotaxane hosts.,"Halogen bonding (XB), the attractive interaction between an electron-deficient halogen atom and a Lewis base, has undergone a dramatic development as an intermolecular force analogous to hydrogen bonding (HB). However, its utilization in the solution phase remains underdeveloped. Furthermore, the design of receptors capable of strong and selective recognition of anions in water remains a significant challenge. Here we demonstrate the superiority of halogen bonding over hydrogen bonding for strong anion binding in water, to the extent that halide recognition by a simple acyclic mono-charged receptor is achievable. Quantification of iodide binding by rotaxane hosts reveals the strong binding by the XB-rotaxane is driven exclusively by favourable enthalpic contributions arising from the halogen-bonding interactions, whereas weaker association with the HB-rotaxanes is entropically driven. These observations demonstrate the unique nature of halogen bonding in water as a strong alternative interaction to the ubiquitous hydrogen bonding in molecular recognition and assembly.",2
Dynamic covalent chemistry of bisimines at the solid/liquid interface monitored by scanning tunnelling microscopy.,"Dynamic covalent chemistry relies on the formation of reversible covalent bonds under thermodynamic control to generate dynamic combinatorial libraries. It provides access to numerous types of complex functional architectures, and thereby targets several technologically relevant applications, such as in drug discovery, (bio)sensing and dynamic materials. In liquid media it was proved that by taking advantage of the reversible nature of the bond formation it is possible to combine the error-correction capacity of supramolecular chemistry with the robustness of covalent bonding to generate adaptive systems. Here we show that double imine formation between 4-(hexadecyloxy)benzaldehyde and different alpha,omega-diamines as well as reversible bistransimination reactions can be achieved at the solid/liquid interface, as monitored on the submolecular scale by in situ scanning tunnelling microscopy imaging. Our modular approach enables the structurally controlled reversible incorporation of various molecular components to form sophisticated covalent architectures, which opens up perspectives towards responsive multicomponent two-dimensional materials and devices.",2
Dithiol amino acids can structurally shape and enhance the ligand-binding properties of polypeptides.,"The disulfide bonds that form between two cysteine residues are important in defining and rigidifying the structures of proteins and peptides. In polypeptides containing multiple cysteine residues, disulfide isomerization can lead to multiple products with different biological activities. Here, we describe the development of a dithiol amino acid (Dtaa) that can form two disulfide bridges at a single amino acid site. Application of Dtaas to a serine protease inhibitor and a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor inhibitor that contain disulfide constraints enhanced their inhibitory activities 40- and 7.6-fold, respectively. X-ray crystallographic and NMR structure analysis show that the peptide ligands containing Dtaas have retained their native tertiary structures. We furthermore show that replacement of two cysteines by Dtaas can avoid the formation of disulfide bond isomers. With these properties, Dtaas are likely to have broad application in the rational design or directed evolution of peptides and proteins with high activity and stability.",2
Recognition and sensing of low-epitope targets via ternary complexes with oligonucleotides and synthetic receptors.,"Oligonucleotide-based receptors or aptamers can interact with small molecules, but the ability to achieve high-affinity and specificity of these interactions depends strongly on functional groups or epitopes displayed by the binding targets. Some classes of targets are particularly challenging: for example, monosaccharides have scarce functionalities and no aptamers have been reported to recognize, let alone distinguish from each other, glucose and other hexoses. Here we report aptamers that differentiate low-epitope targets such as glucose, fructose or galactose by forming ternary complexes with high-epitope organic receptors for monosaccharides. In a follow-up example, we expand this method to isolate high-affinity oligonucleotides against aromatic amino acids complexed in situ with a nonspecific organometallic receptor. The method is general and enables broad clinical use of aptamers for the detection of small molecules in mix-and-measure assays, as demonstrated by monitoring postprandial waves of phenylalanine in human subjects.",2
DNA brick crystals with prescribed depths.,"The ability to assemble functional materials with precise spatial arrangements is important for applications ranging from protein crystallography to photovoltaics. Here, we describe a general framework for constructing two-dimensional crystals with prescribed depths and sophisticated three-dimensional features. The crystals are self-assembled from single-stranded DNA components called DNA bricks. We demonstrate the experimental construction of DNA brick crystals that can grow to micrometre size in their lateral dimensions with precisely controlled depths up to 80 nm. They can be designed to pack DNA helices at angles parallel or perpendicular to the plane of the crystal and to display user-specified sophisticated three-dimensional nanoscale features, such as continuous or discontinuous cavities and channels.",2
Switching on the fluorescence of 2-aminopurine by site-selective microhydration.,"2-Aminopurine (2 AP) is a fluorescent isomer of adenine and has a fluorescence lifetime of ~11 ns in water. It is widely used in biochemical settings as a site-specific fluorescent probe of DNA and RNA structure and base-flipping and -folding. These assays assume that 2 AP is intrinsically strongly fluorescent. Here, we show this not to be the case, observing that gas-phase, jet-cooled 2-aminopurine and 9-methyl-2-aminopurine have very short fluorescence lifetimes (156 ps and 210 ps, respectively); they are, to all intents and purposes, non-fluorescent. We find that the lifetime of 2-aminopurine increases dramatically when it is part of a hydrate cluster, 2 AP . (H2O)n, where n = 1-3. Not only does it depend on the presence of water molecules, it also depends on the specific hydrogen-bonding site to which they attach and on the number of H2O molecules at that site. We selectively microhydrate 2-aminopurine at its sugar-edge, cis-amino or trans-amino sites and see that its fluorescence lifetime increases by 4, 50 and 95 times (to 14.5 ns), respectively.",2
Direct observation of a borane-silane complex involved in frustrated Lewis-pair-mediated hydrosilylations.,"Perfluorarylborane Lewis acids catalyse the addition of silicon-hydrogen bonds across C=C, C=N and C=O double bonds. This 'metal-free' hydrosilylation has been proposed to occur via borane activation of the silane Si-H bond, rather than through classical Lewis acid/base adducts with the substrate. However, the key borane/silane adduct had not been observed experimentally. Here it is shown that the strongly Lewis acidic, antiaromatic 1,2,3-tris(pentafluorophenyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrafluoro-1-boraindene forms an observable, isolable adduct with triethylsilane. The equilibrium for adduct formation was studied quantitatively through variable-temperature NMR spectroscopic investigations. The interaction of the silane with the borane occurs through the Si-H bond, as evidenced by trends in the Si-H coupling constant and the infrared stretching frequency of the Si-H bond, as well as by X-ray crystallography and theoretical calculations. The adduct's reactivity with nucleophiles demonstrates conclusively the role of this species in metal-free 'frustrated-Lewis-pair' hydrosilylation reactions.",2
A Star of David catenane.,"We describe the synthesis of a [2]catenane that consists of two triply entwined 114-membered rings, a molecular link. The woven scaffold is a hexameric circular helicate generated by the assembly of six tris(bipyridine) ligands with six iron(II) cations, with the size of the helicate promoted by the use of sulfate counterions. The structure of the ligand extension directs subsequent covalent capture of the catenane by ring-closing olefin metathesis. Confirmation of the Star of David topology (two rings, six crossings) is provided by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and X-ray crystallography. Extraction of the iron(II) ions with tetrasodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate affords the wholly organic molecular link. The self-assembly of interwoven circular frameworks of controlled size, and their subsequent closure by multiple directed covalent bond-forming reactions, provides a powerful strategy for the synthesis of molecular topologies of ever-increasing complexity.",2
Chiral self-sorting and amplification in isotropic liquids of achiral molecules.,"According to our present knowledge, the spontaneous resolution of racemic mixtures of chiral molecules or chiral conformers of achiral molecules into macroscopic chiral superstructures requires the confinement of these molecules in a crystal lattice, on surfaces or in other well-ordered assemblies. Herein we provide the first experimental evidence that mirror-symmetry breaking can also take place at a liquid-liquid phase transition in isotropic liquids of achiral molecules, even at relatively high temperatures around 200 degrees C. It is proposed that cooperative segregation of enantiomorphic molecular conformations gives rise to a conglomerate of two chiral and immiscible liquids. In these liquid conglomerates a strong chiral amplification was observed, which led to degeneracy from a stochastic distribution and eventually provided uniform chirality. We anticipate that this work will contribute to the understanding of symmetry breaking in soft matter and provide a new tool for the identification of chirality traces, and possibly affect the discussion of the emergence of chirality in prebiotic systems.",2
Self-assembling hydrogel scaffolds for photocatalytic hydrogen production.,"Integration into a soft material of all the molecular components necessary to generate storable fuels is an interesting target in supramolecular chemistry. The concept is inspired by the internal structure of photosynthetic organelles, such as plant chloroplasts, which colocalize molecules involved in light absorption, charge transport and catalysis to create chemical bonds using light energy. We report here on the light-driven production of hydrogen inside a hydrogel scaffold built by the supramolecular self-assembly of a perylene monoimide amphiphile. The charged ribbons formed can electrostatically attract a nickel-based catalyst, and electrolyte screening promotes gelation. We found the emergent phenomenon that screening by the catalyst or the electrolytes led to two-dimensional crystallization of the chromophore assemblies and enhanced the electronic coupling among the molecules. Photocatalytic production of hydrogen is observed in the three-dimensional environment of the hydrogel scaffold and the material is easily placed on surfaces or in the pores of solid supports.",2
Non-oxidative intercalation and exfoliation of graphite by Bronsted acids.,"Graphite intercalation compounds are formed by inserting guest molecules or ions between sp(2)-bonded carbon layers. These compounds are interesting as synthetic metals and as precursors to graphene. For many decades it has been thought that graphite intercalation must involve host-guest charge transfer, resulting in partial oxidation, reduction or covalent modification of the graphene sheets. Here, we revisit this concept and show that graphite can be reversibly intercalated by non-oxidizing Bronsted acids (phosphoric, sulfuric, dichloroacetic and alkylsulfonic acids). The products are mixtures of graphite and first-stage intercalation compounds. X-ray photoelectron and vibrational spectra indicate that the graphene layers are not oxidized or reduced in the intercalation process. These observations are supported by density functional theory calculations, which indicate a dipolar interaction between the guest molecules and the polarizable graphene sheets. The intercalated graphites readily exfoliate in dimethylformamide to give suspensions of crystalline single- and few-layer graphene sheets.",2
Redox-inactive metal ions modulate the reactivity and oxygen release of mononuclear non-haem iron(III)-peroxo complexes.,"Redox-inactive metal ions that function as Lewis acids play pivotal roles in modulating the reactivity of oxygen-containing metal complexes and metalloenzymes, such as the oxygen-evolving complex in photosystem II and its small-molecule mimics. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of non-haem iron(III)-peroxo complexes that bind redox-inactive metal ions, (TMC)Fe(III)-(mu,eta(2):eta(2)-O2)-M(n+) (M(n+) = Sr(2+), Ca(2+), Zn(2+), Lu(3+), Y(3+) and Sc(3+); TMC, 1,4,8,11-tetramethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane). We demonstrate that the Ca(2+) and Sr(2+) complexes showed similar electrochemical properties and reactivities in one-electron oxidation or reduction reactions. However, the properties and reactivities of complexes formed with stronger Lewis acidities were found to be markedly different. Complexes that contain Ca(2+) or Sr(2+) ions were oxidized by an electron acceptor to release O2, whereas the release of O2 did not occur for complexes that bind stronger Lewis acids. We discuss these results in the light of the functional role of the Ca(2+) ion in the oxidation of water to dioxygen by the oxygen-evolving complex.",2
Low-energy spectrum of iron-sulfur clusters directly from many-particle quantum mechanics.,"Iron-sulfur clusters are a universal biological motif. They carry out electron transfer, redox chemistry and even oxygen sensing, in diverse processes including nitrogen fixation, respiration and photosynthesis. Their low-lying electronic states are key to their remarkable reactivity, but they cannot be directly observed. Here, we present the first ever quantum calculation of the electronic levels of [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters free from any model assumptions. Our results highlight the limitations of long-standing models of their electronic structure. In particular, we demonstrate that the widely used Heisenberg double exchange model underestimates the number of states by one to two orders of magnitude, which can conclusively be traced to the absence of Fe dd excitations, thought to be important in these clusters. Furthermore, the electronic energy levels of even the same spin are dense on the scale of vibrational fluctuations and this provides a natural explanation for the ubiquity of these clusters in catalysis in nature.",2
Harnessing redox activity for the formation of uranium tris(imido) compounds.,"Classically, late transition-metal organometallic compounds promote multielectron processes solely through the change in oxidation state of the metal centre. In contrast, uranium typically undergoes single-electron chemistry. However, using redox-active ligands can engage multielectron reactivity at this metal in analogy to transition metals. Here we show that a redox-flexible pyridine(diimine) ligand can stabilize a series of highly reduced uranium coordination complexes by storing one, two or three electrons in the ligand. These species reduce organoazides easily to form uranium-nitrogen multiple bonds with the release of dinitrogen. The extent of ligand reduction dictates the formation of uranium mono-, bis- and tris(imido) products. Spectroscopic and structural characterization of these compounds supports the idea that electrons are stored in the ligand framework and used in subsequent reactivity. Computational analyses of the uranium imido products probed their molecular and electronic structures, which facilitated a comparison between the bonding in the tris(imido) structure and its tris(oxo) analogue.",2
In situ X-ray snapshot analysis of transient molecular adsorption in a crystalline channel.,"Molecular adsorption is a fundamental phenomenon in porous materials and is usually characterized by the efficiency and selectivity of molecular separations and reactions. However, for functional porous materials, analysis of the dynamic behaviour of molecular adsorbents is a major challenge. Here, we use in situ single-crystal X-ray diffraction to analyse multi-step molecular adsorption in a crystalline nanochannel of a metal-macrocycle framework. The pore surface of the metal-macrocycle framework crystal contains five different enantiomerically paired binding pockets, to which the adsorption of a (1R)-1-(3-chlorophenyl)ethanol solution was monitored with time. The resulting X-ray snapshot analyses suggest that the guest adsorption process takes a two-step pathway before equilibrium, in which the guest molecule is temporarily trapped by a neighbouring binding site. This demonstrates the potential for using X-ray analyses to visualize a transient state during a non-covalent self-assembly process.",2
Capturing snapshots of post-synthetic metallation chemistry in metal-organic frameworks.,"Post-synthetic metallation is employed strategically to imbue metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with enhanced performance characteristics. However, obtaining precise structural information for metal-centred reactions that take place within the pores of these materials has remained an elusive goal, because of issues with high symmetry in certain MOFs, lower initial crystallinity for some chemically robust MOFs, and the reduction in crystallinity that can result from carrying out post-synthetic reactions on parent crystals. Here, we report a new three-dimensional MOF possessing pore cavities that are lined with vacant di-pyrazole groups poised for post-synthetic metallation. These metallations occur quantitatively without appreciable loss of crystallinity, thereby enabling examination of the products by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. To illustrate the potential of this platform to garner fundamental insight into metal-catalysed reactions in porous solids we use single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies to structurally elucidate the reaction products of consecutive oxidative addition and methyl migration steps that occur within the pores of the Rh-metallated MOF, 1.[Rh(CO)2][Rh(CO)2Cl2].",2
Electron transfer through rigid organic molecular wires enhanced by electronic and electron-vibration coupling.,"Electron transfer (ET) is a fundamental process in a wide range of biological systems, photovoltaics and molecular electronics. Therefore to understand the relationship between molecular structure and ET properties is of prime importance. For this purpose, photoinduced ET has been studied extensively using donor-bridge-acceptor molecules, in which pi-conjugated molecular wires are employed as bridges. Here, we demonstrate that carbon-bridged oligo-p-phenylenevinylene (COPV), which is both rigid and flat, shows an 840-fold increase in the ET rate compared with the equivalent flexible molecular bridges. A 120-fold rate enhancement is explained in terms of enhanced electronic coupling between the electron donor and the electron acceptor because of effective conjugation through the COPVs. The remainder of the rate enhancement is explained by inelastic electron tunnelling through COPV caused by electron-vibration coupling, unprecedented for organic molecular wires in solution at room temperature. This type of nonlinear effect demonstrates the versatility and potential practical utility of COPVs in molecular device applications.",2
Tailored hierarchical micelle architectures using living crystallization-driven self-assembly in two dimensions.,"Recent advances in the self-assembly of block copolymers have enabled the precise fabrication of hierarchical nanostructures using low-cost solution-phase protocols. However, the preparation of well-defined and complex planar nanostructures in which the size is controlled in two dimensions (2D) has remained a challenge. Using a series of platelet-forming block copolymers, we have demonstrated through quantitative experiments that the living crystallization-driven self-assembly (CDSA) approach can be extended to growth in 2D. We used 2D CDSA to prepare uniform lenticular platelet micelles of controlled size and to construct precisely concentric lenticular micelles composed of spatially distinct functional regions, as well as complex structures analogous to nanoscale single- and double-headed arrows and spears. These methods represent a route to hierarchical nanostructures that can be tailored in 2D, with potential applications as diverse as liquid crystals, diagnostic technology and composite reinforcement.",2
Synthetic ion transporters can induce apoptosis by facilitating chloride anion transport into cells.,"Anion transporters based on small molecules have received attention as therapeutic agents because of their potential to disrupt cellular ion homeostasis. However, a direct correlation between a change in cellular chloride anion concentration and cytotoxicity has not been established for synthetic ion carriers. Here we show that two pyridine diamide-strapped calix[4]pyrroles induce coupled chloride anion and sodium cation transport in both liposomal models and cells, and promote cell death by increasing intracellular chloride and sodium ion concentrations. Removing either ion from the extracellular media or blocking natural sodium channels with amiloride prevents this effect. Cell experiments show that the ion transporters induce the sodium chloride influx, which leads to an increased concentration of reactive oxygen species, release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and apoptosis via caspase activation. However, they do not activate the caspase-independent apoptotic pathway associated with the apoptosis-inducing factor. Ion transporters, therefore, represent an attractive approach for regulating cellular processes that are normally controlled tightly by homeostasis.",2
"Synthetic fermentation of bioactive non-ribosomal peptides without organisms, enzymes or reagents.","Microbial fermentation can rapidly provide potent compounds that can be easily screened for biological activity, and the active components can be isolated. Its success in drug discovery has inspired extensive efforts to modulate and control the products. In this Article, we document a 'synthetic fermentation' of bioactive, unnatural peptides 'grown' from small building blocks in water using amide-forming ligations. No organisms, enzymes or reagents are needed. The sequences, structures and compositions of the products can be modulated by adjusting the building blocks and conditions. No specialized knowledge of organic chemistry or handling of toxic material is required to produce complex organic molecules. The 'fermentations' can be conducted in arrays and screened for biological activity without isolation or workup. As a proof-of-concept, about 6,000 unnatural peptides were produced from just 23 building blocks, from which a hepatitis C virus NS3/4A protease inhibitor with a half-maximum inhibitory concentration of 1.0 muM was identified and characterized.",2
Efficient discovery of bioactive scaffolds by activity-directed synthesis.,"The structures and biological activities of natural products have often provided inspiration in drug discovery. The functional benefits of natural products to the host organism steers the evolution of their biosynthetic pathways. Here, we describe a discovery approach--which we term activity-directed synthesis--in which reactions with alternative outcomes are steered towards functional products. Arrays of catalysed reactions of alpha-diazo amides, whose outcome was critically dependent on the specific conditions used, were performed. The products were assayed at increasingly low concentration, with the results informing the design of a subsequent reaction array. Finally, promising reactions were scaled up and, after purification, submicromolar ligands based on two scaffolds with no previous annotated activity against the androgen receptor were discovered. The approach enables the discovery, in tandem, of both bioactive small molecules and associated synthetic routes, analogous to the evolution of biosynthetic pathways to yield natural products.",2
Contemporary screening approaches to reaction discovery and development.,"New organic reactivity has often been discovered by happenstance. Several recent research efforts have attempted to leverage this to discover new reactions. In this Review, we attempt to unify reported approaches to reaction discovery on the basis of the practical and strategic principles applied. We concentrate on approaches to reaction discovery as opposed to reaction development, though conceptually groundbreaking approaches to identifying efficient catalyst systems are also considered. Finally, we provide a critical overview of the utility and application of the reported methods from the perspective of a synthetic chemist, and consider the future of high-throughput screening in reaction discovery.",2
Irreversible xenon insertion into a small-pore zeolite at moderate pressures and temperatures.,"Pressure drastically alters the chemical and physical properties of materials and allows structural phase transitions and chemical reactions to occur that defy much of our understanding gained under ambient conditions. Particularly exciting is the high-pressure chemistry of xenon, which is known to react with hydrogen and ice at high pressures and form stable compounds. Here, we show that Ag16Al16Si24O8.16H2O (Ag-natrolite) irreversibly inserts xenon into its micropores at 1.7 GPa and 250 degrees C, while Ag(+) is reduced to metallic Ag and possibly oxidized to Ag(2+). In contrast to krypton, xenon is retained within the pores of this zeolite after pressure release and requires heat to desorb. This irreversible insertion and trapping of xenon in Ag-natrolite under moderate conditions sheds new light on chemical reactions that could account for the xenon deficiency relative to argon observed in terrestrial and Martian atmospheres.",2
High-performance Ag-Co alloy catalysts for electrochemical oxygen reduction.,"The electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction is the limiting half-reaction for low-temperature hydrogen fuel cells, and currently costly Pt-based electrocatalysts are used to generate adequate rates. Although most other metals are not stable in typical acid-mediated cells, alkaline environments permit the use of less costly electrodes, such as silver. Unfortunately, monometallic silver is not sufficiently active for economical fuel cells. Herein we demonstrate the design of low-cost Ag-Co surface alloy nanoparticle electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction. Their performance relative to that of Pt is potential dependent, but reaches over half the area-specific activity of Pt nanoparticle catalysts and is more than a fivefold improvement over pure silver nanoparticles at typical operating potentials. The Ag-Co electrocatalyst was initially identified with quantum chemical calculations and then synthesized using a novel technique that generates a surface alloy, despite bulk immiscibility of the constituent materials. Characterization studies support the hypothesis that the activity improvement comes from a ligand effect, in which cobalt atoms perturb surface silver sites.",2
A redox hydrogel protects hydrogenase from high-potential deactivation and oxygen damage.,"Hydrogenases are nature's efficient catalysts for both the generation of energy via oxidation of molecular hydrogen and the production of hydrogen via the reduction of protons. However, their O2 sensitivity and deactivation at high potential limit their applications in practical devices, such as fuel cells. Here, we show that the integration of an O2-sensitive hydrogenase into a specifically designed viologen-based redox polymer protects the enzyme from O2 damage and high-potential deactivation. Electron transfer between the polymer-bound viologen moieties controls the potential applied to the active site of the hydrogenase and thus insulates the enzyme from excessive oxidative stress. Under catalytic turnover, electrons provided from the hydrogen oxidation reaction induce viologen-catalysed O2 reduction at the polymer surface, thus providing self-activated protection from O2. The advantages of this tandem protection are demonstrated using a single-compartment biofuel cell based on an O2-sensitive hydrogenase and H2/O2 mixed feed under anode-limiting conditions.",2
Triazolinediones enable ultrafast and reversible click chemistry for the design of dynamic polymer systems.,"With its focus on synthetic reactions that are highly specific and reliable, 'click' chemistry has become a valuable tool for many scientific research areas and applications. Combining the modular, covalently bonded nature of click-chemistry linkages with an ability to reverse these linkages and reuse the constituent reactants in another click reaction, however, is a feature that is not found in most click reactions. Here we show that triazolinedione compounds can be used in click-chemistry applications. We present examples of simple and ultrafast macromolecular functionalization, polymer-polymer linking and polymer crosslinking under ambient conditions without the need for a catalyst. Moreover, when triazolinediones are combined with indole reaction partners, the reverse reaction can also be induced at elevated temperatures, and the triazolinedione reacted with a different reaction partner, reversibly or irreversibly dependent on its exact nature. We have used this 'transclick' reaction to introduce thermoreversible links into polyurethane and polymethacrylate materials, which allows dynamic polymer-network healing, reshaping and recycling.",2
Synthesis of hydroxyphthioceranic acid using a traceless lithiation-borylation-protodeboronation strategy.,"In planning organic syntheses, disconnections are most often made adjacent to functional groups, which assist in C-C bond formation. For molecules devoid of obvious functional groups this approach presents a problem, and so functionalities must be installed temporarily and then removed. Here we present a traceless strategy for organic synthesis that uses a boronic ester as such a group in a one-pot lithiation-borylation-protodeboronation sequence. To realize this strategy, we developed a methodology for the protodeboronation of alkyl pinacol boronic esters that involves the formation of a boronate complex with a nucleophile followed by oxidation with Mn(OAc)3 in the presence of the hydrogen-atom donor 4-tert-butylcatechol. Iterative lithiation-borylation-protodeboronation allows the coupling of smaller fragments to build-up long alkyl chains. We employed this strategy in the synthesis of hydroxyphthioceranic acid, a key component of the cell-wall lipid of the virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis, in just 14 steps (longest linear sequence) with full stereocontrol.",2
"Template-directed covalent conjugation of DNA to native antibodies, transferrin and other metal-binding proteins.","DNA-protein conjugates are important in bioanalytical chemistry, molecular diagnostics and bionanotechnology, as the DNA provides a unique handle to identify, functionalize or otherwise manipulate proteins. To maintain protein activity, conjugation of a single DNA handle to a specific location on the protein is often needed. However, preparing such high-quality site-specific conjugates often requires genetically engineered proteins, which is a laborious and technically challenging approach. Here we demonstrate a simpler method to create site-selective DNA-protein conjugates. Using a guiding DNA strand modified with a metal-binding functionality, we directed a second DNA strand to the vicinity of a metal-binding site of His6-tagged or wild-type metal-binding proteins, such as serotransferrin, where it subsequently reacted with lysine residues at that site. This method, DNA-templated protein conjugation, facilitates the production of site-selective protein conjugates, and also conjugation to IgG1 antibodies via a histidine cluster in the constant domain.",2
Asymmetric triplex metallohelices with high and selective activity against cancer cells.,"Small cationic amphiphilic alpha-helical peptides are emerging as agents for the treatment of cancer and infection, but they are costly and display unfavourable pharmacokinetics. Helical coordination complexes may offer a three-dimensional scaffold for the synthesis of mimetic architectures. However, the high symmetry and modest functionality of current systems offer little scope to tailor the structure to interact with specific biomolecular targets, or to create libraries for phenotypic screens. Here, we report the highly stereoselective asymmetric self-assembly of very stable, functionalized metallohelices. Their anti-parallel head-to-head-to-tail 'triplex' strand arrangement creates an amphipathic functional topology akin to that of the active sub-units of, for example, host-defence peptides and p53. The metallohelices display high, structure-dependent toxicity to the human colon carcinoma cell-line HCT116 p53(++), causing dramatic changes in the cell cycle without DNA damage. They have lower toxicity to human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MDA-MB-468) and, most remarkably, they show no significant toxicity to the bacteria methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli.",2
Evolution of enzyme catalysts caged in biomimetic gel-shell beads.,"Natural evolution relies on the improvement of biological entities by rounds of diversification and selection. In the laboratory, directed evolution has emerged as a powerful tool for the development of new and improved biomolecules, but it is limited by the enormous workload and cost of screening sufficiently large combinatorial libraries. Here we describe the production of gel-shell beads (GSBs) with the help of a microfluidic device. These hydrogel beads are surrounded with a polyelectrolyte shell that encloses an enzyme, its encoding DNA and the fluorescent reaction product. Active clones in these man-made compartments can be identified readily by fluorescence-activated sorting at rates >10(7) GSBs per hour. We use this system to perform the directed evolution of a phosphotriesterase (a bioremediation catalyst) caged in GSBs and isolate a 20-fold faster mutant in less than one hour. We thus establish a practically undemanding method for ultrahigh-throughput screening that results in functional hybrid composites endowed with evolvable protein components.",2
Control of ultrafast molecular photodissociation by laser-field-induced potentials.,"Experiments aimed at understanding ultrafast molecular processes are now routine, and the notion that external laser fields can constitute an additional reagent is also well established. The possibility of externally controlling a reaction with radiation increases immensely when its intensity is sufficiently high to distort the potential energy surfaces at which chemists conceptualize reactions take place. Here we explore the transition from the weak- to the strong-field regimes of laser control for the dissociation of a polyatomic molecule, methyl iodide. The control over the yield of the photodissociation reaction proceeds through the creation of a light-induced conical intersection. The control of the velocity of the product fragments requires external fields with both high intensities and short durations. This is because the mechanism by which control is exerted involves modulating the potentials around the light-induced conical intersection, that is, creating light-induced potentials.",2
Gram-scale synthesis of two-dimensional polymer crystals and their structure analysis by X-ray diffraction.,"The rise of graphene, a natural two-dimensional polymer (2DP) with topologically planar repeat units, has challenged synthetic chemistry, and has highlighted that accessing equivalent covalently bonded sheet-like macromolecules has, until recently, not been achieved. Here we show that non-centrosymmetric, enantiomorphic single crystals of a simple-to-make monomer can be photochemically converted into chiral 2DP crystals and cleanly reversed back to the monomer. X-ray diffraction established unequivocal structural proof for this synthetic 2DP, which has an all-carbon scaffold and can be synthesized on the gram scale. The monomer crystals are highly robust, can be easily grown to sizes greater than 1 mm and the resulting 2DP crystals exfoliated into nanometre-thin sheets. This unique combination of features suggests that these 2DPs could find use in membranes and nonlinear optics.",2
A nanoporous two-dimensional polymer by single-crystal-to-single-crystal photopolymerization.,"In contrast to the wide number and variety of available synthetic routes to conventional linear polymers, the synthesis of two-dimensional polymers and unambiguous proof of their structure remains a challenge. Two-dimensional polymers-single-layered polymers that form a tiling network in exactly two dimensions-have potential for use in nanoporous membranes and other applications. Here, we report the preparation of a fluorinated hydrocarbon two-dimensional polymer that can be exfoliated into single sheets, and its characterization by high-resolution single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The procedure involves three steps: preorganization in a lamellar crystal of a rigid monomer bearing three photoreactive arms, photopolymerization of the crystalline monomers by [4 + 4] cycloaddition, and isolation of individual two-dimensional polymer sheets. This polymer is a molecularly thin (~1 nm) material that combines precisely defined monodisperse pores of ~9 A with a high pore density of 3.3 x 10(13) pores cm(-2). Atomic-resolution single-crystal X-ray structures of the monomer, an intermediate dimer and the final crystalline two-dimensional polymer were obtained and prove the single-crystal-to-single-crystal nature and molecular precision of the two-dimensional photopolymerization.",2
The electron is a catalyst.,"The electron is an efficient catalyst for conducting various types of radical cascade reaction that proceed by way of radical and radical ion intermediates. But because electrons are omnipresent, catalysis by electrons often passes unnoticed. In this Review, a simple analogy between acid/base catalysis and redox catalysis is presented. Conceptually, the electron is a catalyst in much the same way that a proton is a catalyst. The 'electron is a catalyst' paradigm unifies mechanistically an assortment of synthetic transformations that otherwise have little or no apparent relationship. Diverse radical cascades, including unimolecular radical substitution reactions (SRN1-type chemistry), base-promoted homolytic aromatic substitutions (BHAS), radical Heck-type reactions, radical cross-dehydrogenative couplings (CDC), direct arene trifluoromethylations and radical alkoxycarbonylations, can all be viewed as electron-catalysed reactions.",2
Cooperative activation of cyclobutanones and olefins leads to bridged ring systems by a catalytic [4 + 2] coupling.,"Bridged ring systems are widely found in natural products, and successful syntheses of them frequently feature intramolecular Diels-Alder reactions. These reactions are subclassified as either type I or type II depending on how the diene motif is tethered to the rest of the substrate (type I are tethered at the 1-position of the diene and type II at the 2-position). Although the type I reaction has been used with great success, the molecular scaffolds accessible by the type II reactions are limited by the strain inherent in the formation of an sp(2) carbon at a bridgehead position. Here, we describe a complementary approach that provides access to these structures through the C-C activation of cyclobutanones and their coupling with olefins. Various alkenes have been coupled with cyclobutanones to provide a range of bridged skeletons. The ketone group of the products serves as a convenient handle for downstream functionalization.",2
Mass-selected nanoparticles of PtxY as model catalysts for oxygen electroreduction.,"Low-temperature fuel cells are limited by the oxygen reduction reaction, and their widespread implementation in automotive vehicles is hindered by the cost of platinum, currently the best-known catalyst for reducing oxygen in terms of both activity and stability. One solution is to decrease the amount of platinum required, for example by alloying, but without detrimentally affecting its properties. The alloy PtxY is known to be active and stable, but its synthesis in nanoparticulate form has proved challenging, which limits its further study. Herein we demonstrate the synthesis, characterization and catalyst testing of model PtxY nanoparticles prepared through the gas-aggregation technique. The catalysts reported here are highly active, with a mass activity of up to 3.05 A mgPt(-1) at 0.9 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode. Using a variety of characterization techniques, we show that the enhanced activity of PtxY over elemental platinum results exclusively from a compressive strain exerted on the platinum surface atoms by the alloy core.",2
Observation of an all-boron fullerene.,"After the discovery of fullerene-C60, it took almost two decades for the possibility of boron-based fullerene structures to be considered. So far, there has been no experimental evidence for these nanostructures, in spite of the progress made in theoretical investigations of their structure and bonding. Here we report the observation, by photoelectron spectroscopy, of an all-boron fullerene-like cage cluster at B40(-) with an extremely low electron-binding energy. Theoretical calculations show that this arises from a cage structure with a large energy gap, but that a quasi-planar isomer of B40(-) with two adjacent hexagonal holes is slightly more stable than the fullerene structure. In contrast, for neutral B40 the fullerene-like cage is calculated to be the most stable structure. The surface of the all-boron fullerene, bonded uniformly via delocalized sigma and pi bonds, is not perfectly smooth and exhibits unusual heptagonal faces, in contrast to C60 fullerene.",2
The direct anti-Markovnikov addition of mineral acids to styrenes.,"The direct anti-Markovnikov addition of strong Bronsted acids to alkenes remains an unsolved problem in synthetic chemistry. Here, we report an efficient organic photoredox catalyst system for the addition of HCl, HF and also phosphoric and sulfonic acids to alkenes, with complete regioselectivity. These transformations were developed using a photoredox catalyst in conjunction with a redox-active hydrogen atom donor. The nucleophile counterion plays a critical role by ensuring high reactivity, with 2,6-lutidinium salts typically furnishing the best results. The nature of the redox-active hydrogen atom donor is also consequential, with 4-methoxythiophenol providing the best reactivity when 2,6-lutidinium salts are used. A novel acridinium sensitizer provides enhanced reactivity within several of the more challenging reaction manifolds. This Article demonstrates how nucleophilic addition reactions mediated by photoredox catalysis can change the way electrophilic and homofugal precursors are constructed.",2
Controlling epithelial sodium channels with light using photoswitchable amilorides.,"Amiloride is a widely used diuretic that blocks epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs). These heterotrimeric transmembrane proteins, assembled from beta, gamma and alpha or delta subunits, effectively control water transport across epithelia and sodium influx into non-epithelial cells. The functional role of deltabetagammaENaC in various organs, including the human brain, is still poorly understood and no pharmacological tools are available for the functional differentiation between alpha- and delta-containing ENaCs. Here we report several photoswitchable versions of amiloride. One compound, termed PA1, enables the optical control of ENaC channels, in particular the deltabetagamma isoform, by switching between blue and green light, or by turning on and off blue light. PA1 was used to modify functionally deltabetagammaENaC in amphibian and mammalian cells. We also show that PA1 can be used to differentiate between deltabetagammaENaC and alphabetagammaENaC in a model for the human lung epithelium.",2
Vibronic coherence in oxygenic photosynthesis.,"Photosynthesis powers life on our planet. The basic photosynthetic architecture consists of antenna complexes that harvest solar energy and reaction centres that convert the energy into stable separated charge. In oxygenic photosynthesis, the initial charge separation occurs in the photosystem II reaction centre, the only known natural enzyme that uses solar energy to split water. Both energy transfer and charge separation in photosynthesis are rapid events with high quantum efficiencies. In recent nonlinear spectroscopic experiments, long-lived coherences have been observed in photosynthetic antenna complexes, and theoretical work suggests that they reflect underlying electronic-vibrational resonances, which may play a functional role in enhancing energy transfer. Here, we report the observation of coherent dynamics persisting on a picosecond timescale at 77 K in the photosystem II reaction centre using two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy. Supporting simulations suggest that the coherences are of a mixed electronic-vibrational (vibronic) nature and may enhance the rate of charge separation in oxygenic photosynthesis.",2
An organic thiyl radical catalyst for enantioselective cyclization.,"A diverse array of chiral organocatalysts have been developed that rely on acid-base interactions to promote enantioselective ionic reactions via the movement of electron pairs. The stereocontrol of radical reactions using organocatalysts is an alternative approach, and several studies have shown that synthetically useful reactivity can result by controlling the movement of single electrons. However, in these studies, it is still an acid-based organocatalyst which forms a closed-shell intermediate with substrate prior to the radical reaction and imparts chiral information, and use of a chiral organic radical directly as catalyst has only rarely been explored. Here, we report the design of an organic thiyl radical catalyst with a carefully designed chiral pocket constructed around a chiral thiol precatalyst. The resulting catalyst was used to effect highly diastereo- and enantioselective C-C bond-forming radical cyclizations.",2
Direct observation of the collapse of the delocalized excess electron in water.,"It is generally assumed that the hydrated electron occupies a quasi-spherical cavity surrounded by only a few water molecules in its equilibrated state. However, in the very moment of its generation, before water has had time to respond to the extra charge, it is expected to be significantly larger in size. According to a particle-in-a-box picture, the frequency of its absorption spectrum is a sensitive measure of the initial size of the electronic wavefunction. Here, using transient terahertz spectroscopy, we show that the excess electron initially absorbs in the far-infrared at a frequency for which accompanying ab initio molecular dynamics simulations estimate an initial delocalization length of approximately 40 A. The electron subsequently shrinks due to solvation and thereby leaves the terahertz observation window very quickly, within approximately 200 fs.",2
Directed assembly of optoelectronically active alkyl-pi-conjugated molecules by adding n-alkanes or pi-conjugated species.,"Supramolecular assembly can yield ordered structures by taking advantage of the cumulative effect of multiple non-covalent interactions between adjacent molecules. The thermodynamic origin of many self-assembled structures in water is the balance between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments of the molecule. Here, we show that this approach can be generalized to use solvophobic and solvophilic segments of fully hydrophobic alkylated fullerene molecules. Addition of n-alkanes results in their assembly--due to the antipathy of C60 towards n-alkanes--into micelles and hexagonally packed gel-fibres containing insulated C60 nanowires. The addition of pristine C60 instead directs the assembly into lamellar mesophases by increasing the proportion of pi-conjugated material in the mixture. The assembled structures contain a large fraction of optoelectronically active material and exhibit comparably high photoconductivities. This method is shown to be applicable to several alkyl-pi-conjugated molecules, and can be used to construct organized functional materials with pi-conjugated sections.",2
A spontaneously blinking fluorophore based on intramolecular spirocyclization for live-cell super-resolution imaging.,"Single-molecule localization microscopy is used to construct super-resolution images, but generally requires prior intense laser irradiation and in some cases additives, such as thiols, to induce on-off switching of fluorophores. These requirements limit the potential applications of this methodology. Here, we report a first-in-class spontaneously blinking fluorophore based on an intramolecular spirocyclization reaction. Optimization of the intramolecular nucleophile and rhodamine-based fluorophore (electrophile) provide a suitable lifetime for the fluorescent open form, and equilibrium between the open form and the non-fluorescent closed form. We show that this spontaneously blinking fluorophore is suitable for single-molecule localization microscopy imaging deep inside cells and for tracking the motion of structures in living cells. We further demonstrate the advantages of this fluorophore over existing methodologies by applying it to nuclear pore structures located far above the coverslip with a spinning-disk confocal microscope and for repetitive time-lapse super-resolution imaging of microtubules in live cells for up to 1 h.",2
"Discovery and introduction of a (3,18)-connected net as an ideal blueprint for the design of metal-organic frameworks.","Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a promising class of porous materials because it is possible to mutually control their porous structure, composition and functionality. However, it is still a challenge to predict the network topology of such framework materials prior to their synthesis. Here we use a new rare earth (RE) nonanuclear carboxylate-based cluster as an 18-connected molecular building block to form a gea-MOF (gea-MOF-1) based on a (3,18)-connected net. We then utilized this gea net as a blueprint to design and assemble another MOF (gea-MOF-2). In gea-MOF-2, the 18-connected RE clusters are replaced by metal-organic polyhedra, peripherally functionalized so as to have the same connectivity as the RE clusters. These metal-organic polyhedra act as supermolecular building blocks when they form gea-MOF-2. The discovery of a (3,18)-connected MOF followed by deliberate transposition of its topology to a predesigned second MOF with a different chemical system validates the prospective rational design of MOFs.",2
Mimicking nature with synthetic macromolecules capable of recognition.,"Nature has, through billions of years of evolution, assembled a multitude of polymeric macromolecules capable of exquisite molecular recognition. This functionality arises from the precise control exerted over their biosynthesis that results in key residues being anchored in the appropriate positions to interact with target substrates. Developing 'wholly synthetic' macromolecular analogues that can mimic this behaviour presents a considerable challenge to chemists, who lack the 'biological machinery' used in nature to assemble polymers with such precision. In addressing this challenge, familiar chemical concepts, such as combinatorial methods and supramolecular interactions, have been adapted for application in the macromolecular arena. Working from a limited set of residues, synthetic macromolecules have been produced that display surprisingly high binding affinities towards target proteins, even possessing useful in vivo activities. These observations are all the more surprising when one considers the heterogeneity inherent within these synthetic macromolecular receptors, and provoke intriguing questions regarding our assumptions about the design of receptors.",2
Reactions of xenon with iron and nickel are predicted in the Earth's inner core.,"Studies of the Earth's atmosphere have shown that more than 90% of the expected amount of Xe is depleted, a finding often referred to as the 'missing Xe paradox'. Although several models for a Xe reservoir have been proposed, whether the missing Xe could be contained in the Earth's inner core has not yet been answered. The key to addressing this issue lies in the reactivity of Xe with Fe/Ni, the main constituents of the Earth's core. Here, we predict, through first-principles calculations and unbiased structure searching techniques, a chemical reaction of Xe with Fe/Ni at the temperatures and pressures found in the Earth's core. We find that, under these conditions, Xe and Fe/Ni can form intermetallic compounds, of which XeFe3 and XeNi3 are energetically the most stable. This shows that the Earth's inner core is a natural reservoir for Xe storage and provides a solution to the missing Xe paradox.",2
Development of a minimal saponin vaccine adjuvant based on QS-21.,"Adjuvants are materials added to vaccines to enhance the immunological response to an antigen. QS-21 is a natural product adjuvant under investigation in numerous vaccine clinical trials, but its use is constrained by scarcity, toxicity, instability and an enigmatic molecular mechanism of action. Herein we describe the development of a minimal QS-21 analogue that decouples adjuvant activity from toxicity and provides a powerful platform for mechanistic investigations. We found that the entire branched trisaccharide domain of QS-21 is dispensable for adjuvant activity and that the C4-aldehyde substituent, previously proposed to bind covalently to an unknown cellular target, is also not required. Biodistribution studies revealed that active adjuvants were retained preferentially at the injection site and the nearest draining lymph nodes compared with the attenuated variants. Overall, these studies have yielded critical insights into saponin structure-function relationships, provided practical synthetic access to non-toxic adjuvants, and established a platform for detailed mechanistic studies.",2
Genetically encoded reporters for hyperpolarized xenon magnetic resonance imaging.,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables high-resolution non-invasive observation of the anatomy and function of intact organisms. However, previous MRI reporters of key biological processes tied to gene expression have been limited by the inherently low molecular sensitivity of conventional (1)H MRI. This limitation could be overcome through the use of hyperpolarized nuclei, such as in the noble gas xenon, but previous reporters acting on such nuclei have been synthetic. Here, we introduce the first genetically encoded reporters for hyperpolarized (129)Xe MRI. These expressible reporters are based on gas vesicles (GVs), gas-binding protein nanostructures expressed by certain buoyant microorganisms. We show that GVs are capable of chemical exchange saturation transfer interactions with xenon, which enables chemically amplified GV detection at picomolar concentrations (a 100- to 10,000-fold improvement over comparable constructs for (1)H MRI). We demonstrate the use of GVs as heterologously expressed indicators of gene expression and chemically targeted exogenous labels in MRI experiments performed on living cells.",2
Mechanically triggered heterolytic unzipping of a low-ceiling-temperature polymer.,"Biological systems rely on recyclable materials resources such as amino acids, carbohydrates and nucleic acids. When biomaterials are damaged as a result of aging or stress, tissues undergo repair by a depolymerization-repolymerization sequence of remodelling. Integration of this concept into synthetic materials systems may lead to devices with extended lifetimes. Here, we show that a metastable polymer, end-capped poly(o-phthalaldehyde), undergoes mechanically initiated depolymerization to revert the material to monomers. Trapping experiments and steered molecular dynamics simulations are consistent with a heterolytic scission mechanism. The obtained monomer was repolymerized by a chemical initiator, effectively completing a depolymerization-repolymerization cycle. By emulating remodelling of biomaterials, this model system suggests the possibility of smart materials where aging or mechanical damage triggers depolymerization, and orthogonal conditions regenerate the polymer when and where necessary.",2
Imaging the intracellular distribution of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in living cells with quantitative hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering.,"ABL1 tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKI) are front-line therapy for chronic myelogenous leukaemia and are among the best-known examples of targeted cancer therapeutics. However, the dynamic uptake into cells of TKIs of low molecular weight and their intracellular behaviour is unknown because of the difficulty of observing non-fluorescent small molecules at subcellular resolution. Here we report the direct label-free visualization and quantification of two TKI drugs (imatinib and nilotinib) inside living cells using hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering imaging. Concentrations of both drugs were enriched over 1,000-fold in lysosomes as a result of their lysosomotropic properties. In addition, low solubility appeared to contribute significantly to the surprisingly large accumulation of nilotinib. We further show that the lysosomal trapping of imatinib was reduced more than tenfold when chloroquine is used simultaneously, which suggests that chloroquine may increase the efficacy of TKIs through lysosome-mediated drug-drug interaction in addition to the commonly proposed autophagy-inhibition mechanism.",2
Design and synthesis of the first triply twisted Mobius annulene.,"As long as 50 years ago theoretical calculations predicted that Mobius annulenes with only one pi surface and one edge would exhibit peculiar electronic properties and violate the Huckel rules. Numerous synthetic attempts notwithstanding, the first singly twisted Mobius annulene was not prepared until 2003. Here we present a general, rational strategy to synthesize triply or even more highly twisted cyclic pi systems. We apply this strategy to the preparation of a triply twisted [24]dehydroannulene, the structure of which was confirmed by X-ray analysis. Our strategy is based on the topological transformation of 'twist' into 'writhe'. The advantage is twofold: the product exhibits a lower degree of strain and precursors can be designed that inherently include the writhe, which, after cyclization, ends up in the Mobius product. With our strategy, triply twisted systems are easier to prepare than their singly twisted counterparts.",2
Single-molecule analysis of chirality in a multicomponent reaction network.,"Single-molecule approaches to chemical reaction analysis can provide information that is not accessible by studying ensemble systems. Changes in the molecular structures of compounds tethered to the inner wall of a protein pore are known to affect the current carried through the pore by aqueous ions under a fixed applied potential. Here, we use this approach to study the substitution reactions of arsenic(III) compounds with thiols, stretching the limits of the protein pore technology to track the interconversion of seven reaction components in a network that comprises interconnected Walden cycles. Single-molecule pathway analysis of 'allowed' and 'forbidden' reactions reveals that sulfur-sulfur substitution occurs with stereochemical inversion at the arsenic centre. Hence, we demonstrate that the nanoreactor approach can be a valuable technique for the analysis of dynamic reaction systems of relevance to biology.",2
Bulk protonic conductivity in a cephalopod structural protein.,"Proton-conducting materials play a central role in many renewable energy and bioelectronics technologies, including fuel cells, batteries and sensors. Thus, much research effort has been expended to develop improved proton-conducting materials, such as ceramic oxides, solid acids, polymers and metal-organic frameworks. Within this context, bulk proton conductors from naturally occurring proteins have received somewhat less attention than other materials, which is surprising given the potential modularity, tunability and processability of protein-based materials. Here, we report proton conductivity for thin films composed of reflectin, a cephalopod structural protein. Bulk reflectin has a proton conductivity of ~2.6 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) at 65 degrees C, a proton transport activation energy of ~0.2 eV and a proton mobility of ~7 x 10(-3) cm(2) V(-1) s(-1). These figures of merit are similar to those reported for state-of-the-art artificial proton conductors and make it possible to use reflectin in protein-based protonic transistors. Our findings may hold implications for the next generation of biocompatible proton-conducting materials and protonic devices.",2
Oxidation of ethane to ethanol by N2O in a metal-organic framework with coordinatively unsaturated iron(II) sites.,"Enzymatic haem and non-haem high-valent iron-oxo species are known to activate strong C-H bonds, yet duplicating this reactivity in a synthetic system remains a formidable challenge. Although instability of the terminal iron-oxo moiety is perhaps the foremost obstacle, steric and electronic factors also limit the activity of previously reported mononuclear iron(IV)-oxo compounds. In particular, although nature's non-haem iron(IV)-oxo compounds possess high-spin S = 2 ground states, this electronic configuration has proved difficult to achieve in a molecular species. These challenges may be mitigated within metal-organic frameworks that feature site-isolated iron centres in a constrained, weak-field ligand environment. Here, we show that the metal-organic framework Fe2(dobdc) (dobdc(4-) = 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate) and its magnesium-diluted analogue, Fe0.1Mg1.9(dobdc), are able to activate the C-H bonds of ethane and convert it into ethanol and acetaldehyde using nitrous oxide as the terminal oxidant. Electronic structure calculations indicate that the active oxidant is likely to be a high-spin S = 2 iron(IV)-oxo species.",2
Enantiospecific sp(2)-sp(3) coupling of secondary and tertiary boronic esters.,"The cross-coupling of boronic acids and related derivatives with sp(2) electrophiles (the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction) is one of the most powerful C-C bond formation reactions in synthesis, with applications that span pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and high-tech materials. Despite the breadth of its utility, the scope of this Nobel prize-winning reaction is rather limited when applied to aliphatic boronic esters. Primary organoboron reagents work well, but secondary and tertiary boronic esters do not (apart from a few specific and isolated examples). Through an alternative strategy, which does not involve using transition metals, we have discovered that enantioenriched secondary and tertiary boronic esters can be coupled to electron-rich aromatics with essentially complete enantiospecificity. As the enantioenriched boronic esters are easily accessible, this reaction should find considerable application, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry where there is growing awareness of the importance of, and greater clinical success in, creating biomolecules with three-dimensional architectures.",2
Incorporation of protein flexibility and conformational energy penalties in docking screens to improve ligand discovery.,"Proteins fluctuate between alternative conformations, which presents a challenge for ligand discovery because such flexibility is difficult to treat computationally owing to problems with conformational sampling and energy weighting. Here we describe a flexible docking method that samples and weights protein conformations using experimentally derived conformations as a guide. The crystallographically refined occupancies of these conformations, which are observable in an apo receptor structure, define energy penalties for docking. In a large prospective library screen, we identified new ligands that target specific receptor conformations of a cavity in cytochrome c peroxidase, and we confirm both ligand pose and associated receptor conformation predictions by crystallography. The inclusion of receptor flexibility led to ligands with new chemotypes and physical properties. By exploiting experimental measures of loop and side-chain flexibility, this method can be extended to the discovery of new ligands for hundreds of targets in the Protein Data Bank for which similar experimental information is available.",2
Chiral encoding may provide a simple solution to the origin of life.,"The route by which the complex and specific molecules of life arose from the 'prebiotic soup' remains an unsolved problem. Evolution provides a large part of the answer, but this requires molecules that can carry information (that is, exist in many variants) and can replicate themselves. The process is commonplace in living organisms, but not so easy to achieve with simple chemical systems. It is especially difficult to contemplate in the chemical chaos of the prebiotic world. Although popular in many quarters, the notion that RNA was the first self-replicator carries many difficulties. Here, we present an alternative view, suggesting that there may be undiscovered self-replication mechanisms possible in much simpler systems. In particular, we highlight the possibility of information coding through stereochemical configurations of substituents in organic polymers. We also show that this coding system leads naturally to enantiopurity, solving the apparent problem of biological homochirality.",2
A mitochondrial pathway for biosynthesis of lipid mediators.,"The central role of mitochondria in metabolic pathways and in cell-death mechanisms requires sophisticated signalling systems. Essential in this signalling process is an array of lipid mediators derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids. However, the molecular machinery for the production of oxygenated polyunsaturated fatty acids is localized in the cytosol and their biosynthesis has not been identified in mitochondria. Here we report that a range of diversified polyunsaturated molecular species derived from a mitochondria-specific phospholipid, cardiolipin (CL), is oxidized by the intermembrane-space haemoprotein, cytochrome c. We show that a number of oxygenated CL species undergo phospholipase A2-catalysed hydrolysis and thus generate multiple oxygenated fatty acids, including well-known lipid mediators. This represents a new biosynthetic pathway for lipid mediators. We demonstrate that this pathway, which includes the oxidation of polyunsaturated CLs and accumulation of their hydrolysis products (oxygenated linoleic, arachidonic acids and monolysocardiolipins), is activated in vivo after acute tissue injury.",2
Colloidal inverse bicontinuous cubic membranes of block copolymers with tunable surface functional groups.,"Analogous to the complex membranes found in cellular organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, the inverse cubic mesophases of lipids and their colloidal forms (cubosomes) possess internal networks of water channels arranged in crystalline order, which provide a unique nanospace for membrane-protein crystallization and guest encapsulation. Polymeric analogues of cubosomes formed by the direct self-assembly of block copolymers in solution could provide new polymeric mesoporous materials with a three-dimensionally organized internal maze of large water channels. Here we report the self-assembly of amphiphilic dendritic-linear block copolymers into polymer cubosomes in aqueous solution. The presence of precisely defined bulky dendritic blocks drives the block copolymers to form spontaneously highly curved bilayers in aqueous solution. This results in the formation of colloidal inverse bicontinuous cubic mesophases. The internal networks of water channels provide a high surface area with tunable surface functional groups that can serve as anchoring points for large guests such as proteins and enzymes.",2
Fatty acid membrane assembly on coacervate microdroplets as a step towards a hybrid protocell model.,"Mechanisms of prebiotic compartmentalization are central to providing insights into how protocellular systems emerged on the early Earth. Protocell models are based predominantly on the membrane self-assembly of fatty-acid vesicles, although membrane-free scenarios that involve liquid-liquid microphase separation (coacervation) have also been considered. Here we integrate these alternative models of prebiotic compartmentalization and develop a hybrid protocell model based on the spontaneous self-assembly of a continuous fatty-acid membrane at the surface of preformed coacervate microdroplets prepared from cationic peptides/polyelectrolytes and adenosine triphosphate or oligo/polyribonucleotides. We show that the coacervate-supported membrane is multilamellar, and mediates the selective uptake or exclusion of small and large molecules. The coacervate interior can be disassembled without loss of membrane integrity, and fusion and growth of the hybrid protocells can be induced under conditions of high ionic strength. Our results highlight how notions of membrane-mediated compartmentalization, chemical enrichment and internalized structuration can be integrated in protocell models via simple chemical and physical processes.",2
Bioorthogonal cyclization-mediated in situ self-assembly of small-molecule probes for imaging caspase activity in vivo.,"Directed self-assembly of small molecules in living systems could enable a myriad of applications in biology and medicine, and already this has been used widely to synthesize supramolecules and nano/microstructures in solution and in living cells. However, controlling the self-assembly of synthetic small molecules in living animals is challenging because of the complex and dynamic in vivo physiological environment. Here we employ an optimized first-order bioorthogonal cyclization reaction to control the self-assembly of a fluorescent small molecule, and demonstrate its in vivo applicability by imaging caspase-3/7 activity in human tumour xenograft mouse models of chemotherapy. The fluorescent nanoparticles assembled in situ were imaged successfully in both apoptotic cells and tumour tissues using three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy. This strategy combines the advantages offered by small molecules with those of nanomaterials and should find widespread use for non-invasive imaging of enzyme activity in vivo.",2
Installing logic-gate responses to a variety of biological substances in supramolecular hydrogel-enzyme hybrids.,"Soft materials that exhibit stimuli-responsive behaviour under aqueous conditions (such as supramolecular hydrogels composed of self-assembled nanofibres) have many potential biological applications. However, designing a macroscopic response to structurally complex biochemical stimuli in these materials still remains a challenge. Here we show that redox-responsive peptide-based hydrogels have the ability to encapsulate enzymes and still retain their activities. Moreover, cooperative coupling of enzymatic reactions with the gel response enables us to construct unique stimuli-responsive soft materials capable of sensing a variety of disease-related biomarkers. The programmable gel-sol response (even to biological samples) is visible to the naked eye. Furthermore, we built Boolean logic gates (OR and AND) into the hydrogel-enzyme hybrid materials, which were able to sense simultaneously plural specific biochemicals and execute a controlled drug release in accordance with the logic operation. The intelligent soft materials that we have developed may prove valuable in future medical diagnostics or treatments.",2
The cytotoxicity of (-)-lomaiviticin A arises from induction of double-strand breaks in DNA.,"The metabolite (-)-lomaiviticin A, which contains two diazotetrahydrobenzo[b]fluorene (diazofluorene) functional groups, inhibits the growth of cultured human cancer cells at nanomolar-picomolar concentrations; however, the mechanism responsible for the potent cytotoxicity of this natural product is not known. Here we report that (-)-lomaiviticin A nicks and cleaves plasmid DNA by a pathway that is independent of reactive oxygen species and iron, and that the potent cytotoxicity of (-)-lomaiviticin A arises from the induction of DNA double-strand breaks (dsbs). In a plasmid cleavage assay, the ratio of single-strand breaks (ssbs) to dsbs is 5.3 +/- 0.6:1. Labelling studies suggest that this cleavage occurs via a radical pathway. The structurally related isolates (-)-lomaiviticin C and (-)-kinamycin C, which contain one diazofluorene, are demonstrated to be much less effective DNA cleavage agents, thereby providing an explanation for the enhanced cytotoxicity of (-)-lomaiviticin A compared to that of other members of this family.",2
A two-coordinate boron cation featuring C-B+-C bonding.,"Two-coordinate boron cations (R2B(+)), referred to as borinium ions, are chemical species in which the boron bears only four valence electrons, and that are isoelectronic with hypothetical carbon dications (R2C(2+)). Although lone-pair-donating substituents such as amino groups have enabled the isolation of several borinium ions, diarylated and dialkylated borinium derivatives remain entirely unexplored. Here, we present the synthesis, structure and reactivity of the dimesitylborinium ion, which displays unexpectedly high thermal stability. X-ray crystallography and (11)B NMR spectroscopy, supported by density functional theory calculations, reveal that the borinium ion adopts a linear two-coordinate structure in both the solid state and in solution. The boron centre is stabilized by ppi bonding from the mesityl groups and is free from coordination by the counterion or solvent molecules. This diarylborinium ion possesses exceptional Lewis acidity, accepting a pair of electrons from CO2 to cause an unusual deoxygenation reaction.",2
A transferable model for singlet-fission kinetics.,"Exciton fission is a process that occurs in certain organic materials whereby one singlet exciton splits into two independent triplets. In photovoltaic devices these two triplet excitons can each generate an electron, producing quantum yields per photon of >100% and potentially enabling single-junction power efficiencies above 40%. Here, we measure fission dynamics using ultrafast photoinduced absorption and present a first-principles expression that successfully reproduces the fission rate in materials with vastly different structures. Fission is non-adiabatic and Marcus-like in weakly interacting systems, becoming adiabatic and coupling-independent at larger interaction strengths. In neat films, we demonstrate fission yields near unity even when monomers are separated by >5 A. For efficient solar cells, however, we show that fission must outcompete charge generation from the singlet exciton. This work lays the foundation for tailoring molecular properties like solubility and energy level alignment while maintaining the high fission yield required for photovoltaic applications.",2
Synthesis of most polyene natural product motifs using just 12 building blocks and one coupling reaction.,"The inherent modularity of polypeptides, oligonucleotides and oligosaccharides has been harnessed to achieve generalized synthesis platforms. Importantly, like these other targets, most small-molecule natural products are biosynthesized via iterative coupling of bifunctional building blocks. This suggests that many small molecules also possess inherent modularity commensurate with systematic building block-based construction. Supporting this hypothesis, here we report that the polyene motifs found in >75% of all known polyene natural products can be synthesized using just 12 building blocks and one coupling reaction. Using the same general retrosynthetic algorithm and reaction conditions, this platform enabled both the synthesis of a wide range of polyene frameworks that covered all of this natural-product chemical space and the first total syntheses of the polyene natural products asnipyrone B, physarigin A and neurosporaxanthin b-D-glucopyranoside. Collectively, these results suggest the potential for a more generalized approach to making small molecules in the laboratory.",2
Extremely rapid self-reaction of the simplest Criegee intermediate CH2OO and its implications in atmospheric chemistry.,"Criegee intermediates, which are carbonyl oxides produced when ozone reacts with unsaturated hydrocarbons, play an important role in the formation of OH and organic acids in the atmosphere, but they have eluded direct detection until recently. Reactions that involve Criegee intermediates are not understood fully because data based on their direct observation are limited. We used transient infrared absorption spectroscopy to probe directly the decay kinetics of formaldehyde oxide (CH2OO) and found that it reacts with itself extremely rapidly. This fast self-reaction is a result of its zwitterionic character. According to our quantum-chemical calculations, a cyclic dimeric intermediate that has the terminal O atom of one CH2OO bonded to the C atom of the other CH2OO is formed with large exothermicity before further decomposition to 2H2CO + O2((1)Deltag). We suggest that the inclusion of this previously overlooked rapid reaction in models may affect the interpretation of previous laboratory experiments that involve Criegee intermediates.",2
Functional carbon nanosheets prepared from hexayne amphiphile monolayers at room temperature.,"Carbon nanostructures that feature two-dimensional extended nanosheets are important components for technological applications such as high-performance composites, lithium-ion storage, photovoltaics and nanoelectronics. Chemical functionalization would render such structures better processable and more suited for tailored applications, but typically this is precluded by the high temperatures needed to prepare the nanosheets. Here, we report direct access to functional carbon nanosheets of uniform thickness at room temperature. We used amphiphiles that contain hexayne segments as metastable carbon precursors and self-assembled these into ordered monolayers at the air/water interface. Subsequent carbonization by ultraviolet irradiation in ambient conditions resulted in the quantitative carbonization of the hexayne sublayer. Carbon nanosheets prepared in this way retained their surface functionalization and featured an sp(2)-rich amorphous carbon structure comparable to that usually obtained on annealing above 800 degrees C. Moreover, they exhibited a molecularly defined thickness of 1.9 nm, were mechanically self-supporting over several micrometres and had macroscopic lateral dimensions on the order of centimetres.",2
"Structural complexity through multicomponent cycloaddition cascades enabled by dual-purpose, reactivity regenerating 1,2,3-triene equivalents.","Multicomponent reactions allow for more bond-forming events per synthetic operation, enabling more step- and time-economical conversion of simple starting materials to complex and thus value-added targets. These processes invariably require that reactivity be relayed from intermediate to intermediate over several mechanistic steps until a termination event produces the final product. Here, we report a multicomponent process in which a novel 1,2,3-butatriene equivalent (TMSBO: TMSCH2C identical withCCH2OH) engages chemospecifically as a two-carbon alkyne component in a metal-catalysed [5 + 2] cycloaddition with a vinylcyclopropane to produce an intermediate cycloadduct. Under the reaction conditions, this intermediate undergoes a remarkably rapid 1,4-Peterson elimination, producing a reactive four-carbon diene intermediate that is readily intercepted in either a metal-catalysed or thermal [4 + 2] cycloaddition. TMSBO thus serves as an yne-to-diene transmissive reagent coupling two powerful and convergent cycloadditions--the homologous Diels-Alder and Diels-Alder cycloadditions--through a vinylogous Peterson elimination, and enabling flexible access to diverse polycycles.",2
Templated assembly of photoswitches significantly increases the energy-storage capacity of solar thermal fuels.,"Large-scale utilization of solar-energy resources will require considerable advances in energy-storage technologies to meet ever-increasing global energy demands. Other than liquid fuels, existing energy-storage materials do not provide the requisite combination of high energy density, high stability, easy handling, transportability and low cost. New hybrid solar thermal fuels, composed of photoswitchable molecules on rigid, low-mass nanostructures, transcend the physical limitations of molecular solar thermal fuels by introducing local sterically constrained environments in which interactions between chromophores can be tuned. We demonstrate this principle of a hybrid solar thermal fuel using azobenzene-functionalized carbon nanotubes. We show that, on composite bundling, the amount of energy stored per azobenzene more than doubles from 58 to 120 kJ mol(-1), and the material also maintains robust cyclability and stability. Our results demonstrate that solar thermal fuels composed of molecule-nanostructure hybrids can exhibit significantly enhanced energy-storage capabilities through the generation of template-enforced steric strain.",2
Quantitative sequencing of 5-formylcytosine in DNA at single-base resolution.,"Recently, the cytosine modifications 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and 5-formylcytosine (5fC) were found to exist in the genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of a wide range of mammalian cell types. It is now important to understand their role in normal biological function and disease. Here we introduce reduced bisulfite sequencing (redBS-Seq), a quantitative method to decode 5fC in DNA at single-base resolution, based on a selective chemical reduction of 5fC to 5hmC followed by bisulfite treatment. After extensive validation on synthetic and genomic DNA, we combined redBS-Seq and oxidative bisulfite sequencing (oxBS-Seq) to generate the first combined genomic map of 5-methylcytosine, 5hmC and 5fC in mouse embryonic stem cells. Our experiments revealed that in certain genomic locations 5fC is present at comparable levels to 5hmC and 5mC. The combination of these chemical methods can quantify and precisely map these three cytosine derivatives in the genome and will help provide insights into their function.",2
Switchable enantioseparation based on macromolecular memory of a helical polyacetylene in the solid state.,"In the chromatographic separation of enantiomers the order of elution is determined by the strength of diasteromeric interactions between the components of the mixture and a chiral stationary phase. For analytical purposes, it is ideal to have the minor component elute first, whereas in the preparative mode a faster elution of the major component is desirable. Here we describe a stationary phase constructed from a polyacetylene that bears 2,2'-bisphenol-derived side chains in which chirality can be switched in the solid state prior to use. Both the macromolecular helicity of the polymer backbone and the axial chirality of the side chains can be switched in the solid state by interaction with a chiral alcohol, but importantly are maintained after removal of the chiral alcohol because of a memory effect. The chiral stationary phase thus prepared was used to separate the enantiomers of trans-stilbene oxide with the enantiomer elution order determined by the preseparation treatment.",2
A bioinspired redox relay that mimics radical interactions of the Tyr-His pairs of photosystem II.,"In water-oxidizing photosynthetic organisms, light absorption generates a powerfully oxidizing chlorophyll complex (P680(*+)) in the photosystem II reaction centre. This is reduced via an electron transfer pathway from the manganese-containing water-oxidizing catalyst, which includes an electron transfer relay comprising a tyrosine (Tyr)-histidine (His) pair that features a hydrogen bond between a phenol group and an imidazole group. By rapidly reducing P680(*+), the relay is thought to mitigate recombination reactions, thereby ensuring a high quantum yield of water oxidation. Here, we show that an artificial reaction centre that features a benzimidazole-phenol model of the Tyr-His pair mimics both the short-internal hydrogen bond in photosystem II and, using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, the thermal relaxation that accompanies proton-coupled electron transfer. Although this artificial system is much less complex than the natural one, theory suggests that it captures the essential features that are important in the function of the relay.",2
Self-powered enzyme micropumps.,"Non-mechanical nano- and microscale pumps that function without the aid of an external power source and provide precise control over the flow rate in response to specific signals are needed for the development of new autonomous nano- and microscale systems. Here we show that surface-immobilized enzymes that are independent of adenosine triphosphate function as self-powered micropumps in the presence of their respective substrates. In the four cases studied (catalase, lipase, urease and glucose oxidase), the flow is driven by a gradient in fluid density generated by the enzymatic reaction. The pumping velocity increases with increasing substrate concentration and reaction rate. These rechargeable pumps can be triggered by the presence of specific analytes, which enables the design of enzyme-based devices that act both as sensor and pump. Finally, we show proof-of-concept enzyme-powered devices that autonomously deliver small molecules and proteins in response to specific chemical stimuli, including the release of insulin in response to glucose.",2
Ultra stable self-assembled monolayers of N-heterocyclic carbenes on gold.,"Since the first report of thiol-based self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) 30 years ago, these structures have been examined in a huge variety of applications. The oxidative and thermal instabilities of these systems are widely known, however, and are an impediment to their widespread commercial use. Here, we describe the generation of N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-based SAMs on gold that demonstrate considerably greater resistance to heat and chemical reagents than the thiol-based counterparts. This increased stability is related to the increased strength of the gold-carbon bond relative to that of a gold-sulfur bond, and to a different mode of bonding in the case of the carbene ligand. Once bound to gold, NHCs are not displaced by thiols or thioethers, and are stable to high temperatures, boiling water, organic solvents, pH extremes, electrochemical cycling above 0 V and 1% hydrogen peroxide. In particular, benzimidazole-derived carbenes provide films with the highest stabilities and evidence of short-range molecular ordering. Chemical derivatization can be employed to adjust the surface properties of NHC-based SAMs.",2
Efficient room-temperature synthesis of a highly strained carbon nanohoop fragment of buckminsterfullerene.,"Warped carbon-rich molecules have captured the imagination of scientists across many disciplines. Owing to their promising materials properties and challenging synthesis, strained hydrocarbons are attractive targets that push the limits of synthetic methods and molecular design. Herein we report the synthesis and characterization of [5]cycloparaphenylene ([5]CPP), a carbon nanohoop that can be envisaged as an open tubular fragment of C60, the equator of C70 fullerene and the unit cycle of a [5,5] armchair carbon nanotube. Given its calculated 119 kcal mol(-1) strain energy and severely distorted benzene rings, this synthesis, which employs a room-temperature macrocyclization of a diboronate precursor, single-electron reduction and elimination, is remarkably mild and high yielding (27% over three steps). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data were obtained to confirm its geometry and previously disputed benzenoid character. First and second pseudoreversible oxidation and reduction events were observed via cyclic voltammetry. The ease of synthesis, high solubility and narrowest optical HOMO/LUMO gap of any para-polyphenylene synthesized make [5]CPP a desirable new material for organic electronics.",2
Optimized orthogonal translation of unnatural amino acids enables spontaneous protein double-labelling and FRET.,"The ability to introduce different biophysical probes into defined positions in target proteins will provide powerful approaches for interrogating protein structure, function and dynamics. However, methods for site-specifically incorporating multiple distinct unnatural amino acids are hampered by their low efficiency. Here we provide a general solution to this challenge by developing an optimized orthogonal translation system that uses amber and evolved quadruplet-decoding transfer RNAs to encode numerous pairs of distinct unnatural amino acids into a single protein expressed in Escherichia coli with a substantial increase in efficiency over previous methods. We also provide a general strategy for labelling pairs of encoded unnatural amino acids with different probes via rapid and spontaneous reactions under physiological conditions. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by genetically directing the labelling of several pairs of sites in calmodulin with fluorophores and probing protein structure and dynamics by Forster resonance energy transfer.",2
"Unusual structure, bonding and properties in a californium borate.","The participation of the valence orbitals of actinides in bonding has been debated for decades. Recent experimental and computational investigations demonstrated the involvement of 6p, 6d and/or 5f orbitals in bonding. However, structural and spectroscopic data, as well as theory, indicate a decrease in covalency across the actinide series, and the evidence points to highly ionic, lanthanide-like bonding for late actinides. Here we show that chemical differentiation between californium and lanthanides can be achieved by using ligands that are both highly polarizable and substantially rearrange on complexation. A ligand that suits both of these desired properties is polyborate. We demonstrate that the 5f, 6d and 7p orbitals are all involved in bonding in a Cf(III) borate, and that large crystal-field effects are present. Synthetic, structural and spectroscopic data are complemented by quantum mechanical calculations to support these observations.",2
Time-resolved observations of water oxidation intermediates on a cobalt oxide nanoparticle catalyst.,"In any artificial photosynthetic system, the oxidation of water to molecular oxygen provides the electrons needed for the reduction of protons or carbon dioxide to a fuel. Understanding how this four-electron reaction works in detail is important for the development of improved robust catalysts made of Earth-abundant materials, like first-row transition-metal oxides. Here, using time-resolved Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and under reaction conditions, we identify intermediates of water oxidation catalysed by an abundant metal-oxide catalyst, cobalt oxide (Co3O4). One intermediate is a surface superoxide (three-electron oxidation intermediate absorbing at 1,013 cm(-1)), whereas a second observed intermediate is attributed to an oxo Co(IV) site (one-electron oxidation intermediate absorbing at 840 cm(-1)). The temporal behaviour of the intermediates reveals that they belong to different catalytic sites. Knowledge of the structure and kinetics of surface intermediates will enable the design of improved metal-oxide materials for more efficient water oxidation catalysis.",2
Palladium-triggered deprotection chemistry for protein activation in living cells.,"Employing small molecules or chemical reagents to modulate the function of an intracellular protein, particularly in a gain-of-function fashion, remains a challenge. In contrast to inhibitor-based loss-of-function approaches, methods based on a gain of function enable specific signalling pathways to be activated inside a cell. Here we report a chemical rescue strategy that uses a palladium-mediated deprotection reaction to activate a protein within living cells. We identify biocompatible and efficient palladium catalysts that cleave the propargyl carbamate group of a protected lysine analogue to generate a free lysine. The lysine analogue can be genetically and site-specifically incorporated into a protein, which enables control over the reaction site. This deprotection strategy is shown to work with a range of different cell lines and proteins. We further applied this biocompatible protection group/catalyst pair for caging and subsequent release of a crucial lysine residue in a bacterial Type III effector protein within host cells, which reveals details of its virulence mechanism.",2
Side-chain control of porosity closure in single- and multiple-peptide-based porous materials by cooperative folding.,"Porous materials are attractive for separation and catalysis-these applications rely on selective interactions between host materials and guests. In metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), these interactions can be controlled through a flexible structural response to the presence of guests. Here we report a MOF that consists of glycyl-serine dipeptides coordinated to metal centres, and has a structure that evolves from a solvated porous state to a desolvated non-porous state as a result of ordered cooperative, displacive and conformational changes of the peptide. This behaviour is driven by hydrogen bonding that involves the side-chain hydroxyl groups of the serine. A similar cooperative closure (reminiscent of the folding of proteins) is also displayed with multipeptide solid solutions. For these, the combination of different sequences of amino acids controls the framework's response to the presence of guests in a nonlinear way. This functional control can be compared to the effect of single-point mutations in proteins, in which exchange of single amino acids can radically alter structure and function.",2
The oxidative inactivation of FeFe hydrogenase reveals the flexibility of the H-cluster.,"Nature is a valuable source of inspiration in the design of catalysts, and various approaches are used to elucidate the mechanism of hydrogenases, the enzymes that oxidize or produce H2. In FeFe hydrogenases, H2 oxidation occurs at the H-cluster, and catalysis involves H2 binding on the vacant coordination site of an iron centre. Here, we show that the reversible oxidative inactivation of this enzyme results from the binding of H2 to coordination positions that are normally blocked by intrinsic CO ligands. This flexibility of the coordination sphere around the reactive iron centre confers on the enzyme the ability to avoid harmful reactions under oxidizing conditions, including exposure to O2. The versatile chemistry of the diiron cluster in the natural system might inspire the design of novel synthetic catalysts for H2 oxidation.",2
Observation of the isotope effect in sub-kelvin reactions.,"Quantum phenomena in the translational motion of reactants, which are usually negligible at room temperature, can dominate reaction dynamics at low temperatures. In such cold conditions, even the weak centrifugal force is enough to create a potential barrier that keeps reactants separated. However, reactions may still proceed through tunnelling because, at low temperatures, wave-like properties become important. At certain de Broglie wavelengths, the colliding particles can become trapped in long-lived metastable scattering states, leading to sharp increases in the total reaction rate. Here, we show that these metastable states are responsible for a dramatic, order-of-magnitude-strong, quantum kinetic isotope effect by measuring the absolute Penning ionization reaction rates between hydrogen isotopologues and metastable helium down to 0.01 K. We demonstrate that measurements of a single isotope are insufficient to constrain ab initio calculations, making the kinetic isotope effect in the cold regime necessary to remove ambiguity among possible potential energy surfaces.",2
Copolymerization of carbon dioxide and butadiene via a lactone intermediate.,"Although carbon dioxide has attracted broad interest as a renewable carbon feedstock, its use as a monomer in copolymerization with olefins has long been an elusive endeavour. A major obstacle for this process is that the propagation step involving carbon dioxide is endothermic; typically, attempted reactions between carbon dioxide and an olefin preferentially yield olefin homopolymerization. Here we report a strategy to circumvent the thermodynamic and kinetic barriers for copolymerizations of carbon dioxide and olefins by using a metastable lactone intermediate, 3-ethylidene-6-vinyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is formed by the palladium-catalysed condensation of carbon dioxide and 1,3-butadiene. Subsequent free-radical polymerization of the lactone intermediate afforded polymers of high molecular weight with a carbon dioxide content of 33 mol% (29 wt%). Furthermore, the protocol was applied successfully to a one-pot copolymerization of carbon dioxide and 1,3-butadiene, and one-pot terpolymerizations of carbon dioxide, butadiene and another 1,3-diene. This copolymerization technique provides access to a new class of polymeric materials made from carbon dioxide.",2
Discovery of a Ni-Ga catalyst for carbon dioxide reduction to methanol.,"The use of methanol as a fuel and chemical feedstock could become very important in the development of a more sustainable society if methanol could be efficiently obtained from the direct reduction of CO2 using solar-generated hydrogen. If hydrogen production is to be decentralized, small-scale CO2 reduction devices are required that operate at low pressures. Here, we report the discovery of a Ni-Ga catalyst that reduces CO2 to methanol at ambient pressure. The catalyst was identified through a descriptor-based analysis of the process and the use of computational methods to identify Ni-Ga intermetallic compounds as stable candidates with good activity. We synthesized and tested a series of catalysts and found that Ni5Ga3 is particularly active and selective. Comparison with conventional Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts revealed the same or better methanol synthesis activity, as well as considerably lower production of CO. We suggest that this is a first step towards the development of small-scale low-pressure devices for CO2 reduction to methanol.",2
"Stable GaX2, InX2 and TlX2 radicals.","The chemistry of the Group 13 metals is dominated by the +1 and +3 oxidation states, and simple monomeric M(II) species are typically short-lived, highly reactive species. Here we report the first thermally robust monomeric MX2 radicals of gallium, indium and thallium. By making use of sterically demanding boryl substituents, compounds of the type M(II)(boryl)2 (M = Ga, In, Tl) can be synthesized. These decompose above 130 degrees C and are amenable to structural characterization in the solid state by X-ray crystallography. Electron paramagnetic resonance and computational studies reveal a dominant metal-centred character for all three radicals (>70% spin density at the metal). M(II) species have been invoked as key short-lived intermediates in well-known electron-transfer processes; consistently, the chemical behaviour of these novel isolated species reveals facile one-electron shuttling processes at the metal centre.",2
SnAP reagents for the one-step synthesis of medium-ring saturated N-heterocycles from aldehydes.,"Interest in saturated N-heterocycles as scaffolds for the synthesis of bioactive molecules is increasing. Reliable and predictable synthetic methods for the preparation of these compounds, especially medium-sized rings, are limited. We describe the development of SnAP (Sn amino protocol) reagents for the transformation of aldehydes into seven-, eight- and nine-membered saturated N-heterocycles. This process occurs under mild, room-temperature conditions and offers exceptional substrate scope and functional-group tolerance. Air- and moisture-stable SnAP reagents are prepared on a multigram scale from inexpensive starting materials by simple reaction sequences. These new reagents and processes allow widely available aryl, heteroaryl and aliphatic aldehydes to be converted into diverse N-heterocycles, including diazepanes, oxazepanes, diazocanes, oxazocanes and hexahydrobenzoxazonines, by a single synthetic operation.",2
Short peptides self-assemble to produce catalytic amyloids.,"Enzymes fold into unique three-dimensional structures, which underlie their remarkable catalytic properties. The requirement to adopt a stable, folded conformation is likely to contribute to their relatively large size (>10,000 Da). However, much shorter peptides can achieve well-defined conformations through the formation of amyloid fibrils. To test whether short amyloid-forming peptides might in fact be capable of enzyme-like catalysis, we designed a series of seven-residue peptides that act as Zn(2+)-dependent esterases. Zn(2+) helps stabilize the fibril formation, while also acting as a cofactor to catalyse acyl ester hydrolysis. These results indicate that prion-like fibrils are able to not only catalyse their own formation, but they can also catalyse chemical reactions. Thus, they might have served as intermediates in the evolution of modern-day enzymes. These results also have implications for the design of self-assembling nanostructured catalysts including ones containing a variety of biological and non-biological metal ions.",2
Diversity in the dynamical behaviour of a compartmentalized programmable biochemical oscillator.,"In vitro compartmentalization of biochemical reaction networks is a crucial step towards engineering artificial cell-scale devices and systems. At this scale the dynamics of molecular systems becomes stochastic, which introduces several engineering challenges and opportunities. Here we study a programmable transcriptional oscillator system that is compartmentalized into microemulsion droplets with volumes between 33 fl and 16 pl. Simultaneous measurement of large populations of droplets reveals major variations in the amplitude, frequency and damping of the oscillations. Variability increases for smaller droplets and depends on the operating point of the oscillator. Rather than reflecting the stochastic kinetics of the chemical reaction network itself, the variability can be attributed to the statistical variation of reactant concentrations created during their partitioning into droplets. We anticipate that robustness to partitioning variability will be a critical challenge for engineering cell-scale systems, and that highly parallel time-series acquisition from microemulsion droplets will become a key tool for characterization of stochastic circuit function.",2
The power of ion mobility-mass spectrometry for structural characterization and the study of conformational dynamics.,"Mass spectrometry is a vital tool for molecular characterization, and the allied technique of ion mobility is enhancing many areas of (bio)chemical analysis. Strong synergy arises between these two techniques because of their ability to ascertain complementary information about gas-phase ions. Ion mobility separates ions (from small molecules up to megadalton protein complexes) based on their differential mobility through a buffer gas. Ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) can thus act as a tool to separate complex mixtures, to resolve ions that may be indistinguishable by mass spectrometry alone, or to determine structural information (for example rotationally averaged cross-sectional area), complementary to more traditional structural approaches. Finally, IM-MS can be used to gain insights into the conformational dynamics of a system, offering a unique means of characterizing flexibility and folding mechanisms. This Review critically describes how IM-MS has been used to enhance various areas of chemical and biophysical analysis.",2
Building an appropriate active-site motif into a hydrogen-evolution catalyst with thiomolybdate [Mo3S13]2- clusters.,"Identifying and understanding the active sites responsible for reaction turnover is critical to developing improved catalysts. For the hydrogen-evolution reaction (HER), MoS2 has been identified as an active non-noble-metal-based catalyst. However, only edge sites turnover the reaction because the basal planes are catalytically inert. In an effort to develop a scalable HER catalyst with an increased number of active sites, herein we report a Mo-S catalyst (supported thiomolybdate [Mo3S13](2-) nanoclusters) in which most sulfur atoms in the structure exhibit a structural motif similar to that observed at MoS2 edges. Supported sub-monolayers of [Mo3S13](2-) nanoclusters exhibited excellent HER activity and stability in acid. Imaging at the atomic scale with scanning tunnelling microscopy allowed for direct characterization of these supported catalysts. The [Mo3S13](2-) nanoclusters reported herein demonstrated excellent turnover frequencies, higher than those observed for other non-precious metal catalysts synthesized by a scalable route.",2
Dye-sensitized solar cells with 13% efficiency achieved through the molecular engineering of porphyrin sensitizers.,"Dye-sensitized solar cells have gained widespread attention in recent years because of their low production costs, ease of fabrication and tunable optical properties, such as colour and transparency. Here, we report a molecularly engineered porphyrin dye, coded SM315, which features the prototypical structure of a donor-pi-bridge-acceptor and both maximizes electrolyte compatibility and improves light-harvesting properties. Linear-response, time-dependent density functional theory was used to investigate the perturbations in the electronic structure that lead to improved light harvesting. Using SM315 with the cobalt(II/III) redox shuttle resulted in dye-sensitized solar cells that exhibit a high open-circuit voltage VOC of 0.91 V, short-circuit current density JSC of 18.1 mA cm(-2), fill factor of 0.78 and a power conversion efficiency of 13%.",2
A protein engineered to bind uranyl selectively and with femtomolar affinity.,"Uranyl (UO2(2+)), the predominant aerobic form of uranium, is present in the ocean at a concentration of ~3.2 parts per 10(9) (13.7 nM); however, the successful enrichment of uranyl from this vast resource has been limited by the high concentrations of metal ions of similar size and charge, which makes it difficult to design a binding motif that is selective for uranyl. Here we report the design and rational development of a uranyl-binding protein using a computational screening process in the initial search for potential uranyl-binding sites. The engineered protein is thermally stable and offers very high affinity and selectivity for uranyl with a Kd of 7.4 femtomolar (fM) and >10,000-fold selectivity over other metal ions. We also demonstrated that the uranyl-binding protein can repeatedly sequester 30-60% of the uranyl in synthetic sea water. The chemical strategy employed here may be applied to engineer other selective metal-binding proteins for biotechnology and remediation applications.",2
Conversion of light into macroscopic helical motion.,"A key goal of nanotechnology is the development of artificial machines capable of converting molecular movement into macroscopic work. Although conversion of light into shape changes has been reported and compared to artificial muscles, real applications require work against an external load. Here, we describe the design, synthesis and operation of spring-like materials capable of converting light energy into mechanical work at the macroscopic scale. These versatile materials consist of molecular switches embedded in liquid-crystalline polymer springs. In these springs, molecular movement is converted and amplified into controlled and reversible twisting motions. The springs display complex motion, which includes winding, unwinding and helix inversion, as dictated by their initial shape. Importantly, they can produce work by moving a macroscopic object and mimicking mechanical movements, such as those used by plant tendrils to help the plant access sunlight. These functional materials have potential applications in micromechanical systems, soft robotics and artificial muscles.",2
Induced-fit catalysis of corannulene bowl-to-bowl inversion.,"Stereoelectronic complementarity between the active site of an enzyme and the transition state of a reaction is one of the tenets of enzyme catalysis. This report illustrates the principles of enzyme catalysis (first proposed by Pauling and Jencks) through a well-defined model system that has been fully characterized crystallographically, computationally and kinetically. Catalysis of the bowl-to-bowl inversion processes that pertain to corannulene is achieved by combining ground-state destabilization and transition-state stabilization within the cavity of an extended tetracationic cyclophane. This synthetic receptor fulfils a role reminiscent of a catalytic antibody by stabilizing the planar transition state for the bowl-to-bowl inversion of (ethyl)corannulene (which accelerates this process by a factor of ten at room temperature) by an induced-fit mechanism first formulated by Koshland.",2
"State-resolved diffraction oscillations imaged for inelastic collisions of NO radicals with He, Ne and Ar.","Just as light scattering from an object results in diffraction patterns, the quantum mechanical nature of molecules can lead to the diffraction of matter waves during molecular collisions. This behaviour manifests itself as rapid oscillatory structures in measured differential cross-sections, and such observable features are sensitive probes of molecular interaction potentials. However, these structures have proved challenging to resolve experimentally. Here, we use a Stark decelerator to form a beam of state-selected and velocity-controlled NO radicals and measure state-to-state differential cross-sections for inelastic collisions of NO with He, Ne and Ar atoms using velocity map imaging. The monochromatic velocity distribution of the NO beam produced scattering images with unprecedented sharpness and angular resolution, thereby fully resolving quantum diffraction oscillations. We found excellent agreement with quantum close-coupling scattering calculations for these benchmark systems.",2
Ion mobility-mass spectrometry of a rotary ATPase reveals ATP-induced reduction in conformational flexibility.,"Rotary ATPases play fundamental roles in energy conversion as their catalytic rotation is associated with interdomain fluctuations and heterogeneity of conformational states. Using ion mobility mass spectrometry we compared the conformational dynamics of the intact ATPase from Thermus thermophilus with those of its membrane and soluble subcomplexes. Our results define regions with enhanced flexibility assigned to distinct subunits within the overall assembly. To provide a structural context for our experimental data we performed molecular dynamics simulations and observed conformational changes of the peripheral stalks that reflect their intrinsic flexibility. By isolating complexes at different phases of cell growth and manipulating nucleotides, metal ions and pH during isolation, we reveal differences that can be related to conformational changes in the Vo complex triggered by ATP binding. Together these results implicate nucleotides in modulating flexibility of the stator components and uncover mechanistic detail that underlies operation and regulation in the context of the holoenzyme.",2
Photocurrent generation based on a light-driven proton pump in an artificial liquid membrane.,"Biological light-driven proton pumps use light to move protons across a cell membrane, creating a proton gradient. Although photochromic compounds such as spiropyrans can reversibly convert between two structures with differing pKa values, spiropyrans have not been used to generate either a light-driven proton pump or an electrical current. Here, we report an artificial light-harvesting system based on a supported liquid membrane doped with a spiropyran. Irradiating the membrane with ultraviolet light induces a ring-opening reaction, converting spiropyran to merocyanine, whereas irradiation with visible light induces the reverse reaction. When the membrane is irradiated with ultraviolet and visible light on opposite sides, H(+) is taken up by merocyanine, carried through the polymeric membrane and released on the other side. We show that this system produces a light-induced proton flux, an electrical current with an efficiency of approximately 0.12%, an open-circuit voltage of approximately 210 mV and a membrane gradient of approximately 3.6 DeltapH units. Alternating the sides illuminated with ultraviolet and visible light generates an alternating current.",2
Two-dimensional spectroscopy of a molecular dimer unveils the effects of vibronic coupling on exciton coherences.,"The observation of persistent oscillatory signals in multidimensional spectra of protein-pigment complexes has spurred a debate on the role of coherence-assisted electronic energy transfer as a key operating principle in photosynthesis. Vibronic coupling has recently been proposed as an explanation for the long lifetime of the observed spectral beatings. However, photosynthetic systems are inherently complicated, and tractable studies on simple molecular compounds are needed to fully understand the underlying physics. In this work, we present measurements and calculations on a solvated molecular homodimer with clearly resolvable oscillations in the corresponding two-dimensional spectra. Through analysis of the various contributions to the nonlinear response, we succeed in isolating the signal due to inter-exciton coherence. We find that although calculations predict a prolongation of this coherence due to vibronic coupling, the combination of dynamic disorder and vibrational relaxation leads to a coherence decay on a timescale comparable to the electronic dephasing time.",2
Living supramolecular polymerization realized through a biomimetic approach.,"Various conventional reactions in polymer chemistry have been translated to the supramolecular domain, yet it has remained challenging to devise living supramolecular polymerization. To achieve this, self-organization occurring far from thermodynamic equilibrium--ubiquitously observed in nature--must take place. Prion infection is one example that can be observed in biological systems. Here, we present an 'artificial infection' process in which porphyrin-based monomers assemble into nanoparticles, and are then converted into nanofibres in the presence of an aliquot of the nanofibre, which acts as a 'pathogen'. We have investigated the assembly phenomenon using isodesmic and cooperative models and found that it occurs through a delicate interplay of these two aggregation pathways. Using this understanding of the mechanism taking place, we have designed a living supramolecular polymerization of the porphyrin-based monomers. Despite the fact that the polymerization is non-covalent, the reaction kinetics are analogous to that of conventional chain growth polymerization, and the supramolecular polymers were synthesized with controlled length and narrow polydispersity.",2
Precision design of ethylene- and polar-monomer-based copolymers by organometallic-mediated radical polymerization.,"The copolymerization of ethylene with polar monomers is a major challenge when it comes to the manufacture of materials with potential for a wide range of commercial applications. In the chemical industry, free-radical polymerization is used to make a large proportion of such copolymers, but the forcing conditions result in a lack of fine control over the architecture of the products. Herein we introduce a synthetic tool, effective under mild experimental conditions, for the precision design of unprecedented ethylene- and polar-monomer-based copolymers. We demonstrate how an organocobalt species can control the growth of the copolymer chains, their composition and the monomer distribution throughout the chain. By fine tuning the ethylene pressure during polymerization and by exploiting a unique reactive mode of the end of the organometallic chain, novel block-like copolymer structures can be prepared. This highly versatile synthetic platform provides access to a diverse range of polymer materials.",2
Exceptionally fast carbon-carbon bond reductive elimination from gold(III).,"Reductive elimination of carbon-carbon bonds occurs in numerous metal-catalysed reactions. This process is well documented for a variety of transition metal complexes. However, carbon-carbon bond reductive elimination from a limited number of Au(III) complexes has been shown to be a slow and prohibitive process that generally requires elevated temperatures. Herein we show that oxidation of a series of mono- and bimetallic Au(I) aryl complexes at low temperature generates observable Au(III) and Au(II) intermediates. We also show that aryl-aryl bond reductive elimination from these oxidized species is not only among the fastest observed for any transition metal, but is also mechanistically distinct from previously studied alkyl-alkyl and aryl-alkyl reductive eliminations from Au(III).",2
Scalable enhancement of graphene oxide properties by thermally driven phase transformation.,"Chemical functionalization of graphene is promising for a variety of next-generation technologies. Although graphene oxide (GO) is a versatile material in this direction, its use is limited by the production of metastable, chemically inhomogeneous and spatially disordered GO structures under current synthetic protocols, which results in poor optoelectronic properties. Here, we present a mild thermal annealing procedure, with no chemical treatments involved, to manipulate as-synthesized GO on a large scale to enhance sheet properties with the oxygen content preserved. Using experiments supported by atomistic calculations, we demonstrate that GO structures undergo a phase transformation into prominent oxidized and graphitic domains by temperature-driven oxygen diffusion. Consequently, as-synthesized GO that absorbs mainly in the ultraviolet region becomes strongly absorbing in the visible region, photoluminescence is blue shifted and electronic conductivity increases by up to four orders of magnitude. Our thermal processing method offers a suitable way to tune and enhance the properties of GO, which creates opportunities for various applications.",2
Ligand-enabled cross-coupling of C(sp3)-H bonds with arylboron reagents via Pd(II)/Pd(0) catalysis.,"There have been numerous developments in C-H activation reactions in the past decade. Attracted by the ability to functionalize molecules directly at ostensibly unreactive C-H bonds, chemists have discovered reaction conditions that enable reactions of C(sp(2))-H and C(sp(3))-H bonds with a variety of coupling partners. Despite these advances, the development of suitable ligands that enable catalytic C(sp(3))-H bond functionalization remains a significant challenge. Herein we report the discovery of a mono-N-protected amino acid ligand that enables Pd(II)-catalysed coupling of gamma-C(sp(3))-H bonds in triflyl-protected amines with arylboron reagents. Remarkably, no background reaction was observed in the absence of ligand. A variety of amine substrates and arylboron reagents were cross-coupled using this method. Arylation of optically active substrates derived from amino acids also provides a potential route for preparing non-proteinogenic amino acids.",2
The rate of the F + H2 reaction at very low temperatures.,"The prototypical F + H2 --> HF + H reaction possesses a substantial energetic barrier (~800 K) and might therefore be expected to slow to a negligible rate at low temperatures. It is, however, the only source of interstellar HF, which has been detected in a wide range of cold (10-100 K) environments. In fact, the reaction does take place efficiently at low temperatures due to quantum-mechanical tunnelling. Rate constant measurements at such temperatures have essentially been limited to fast barrierless reactions, such as those between two radicals. Using uniform supersonic hydrogen flows we can now report direct experimental measurements of the rate of this reaction down to a temperature of 11 K, in remarkable agreement with state-of-the-art quantum reactive scattering calculations. The results will allow a stronger link to be made between observations of interstellar HF and the abundance of the most common interstellar molecule, H2, and hence a more accurate estimation of the total mass of astronomical objects.",2
Probing chemical space with alkaloid-inspired libraries.,"Screening of small-molecule libraries is an important aspect of probe and drug discovery science. Numerous authors have suggested that bioactive natural products are attractive starting points for such libraries because of their structural complexity and sp(3)-rich character. Here, we describe the construction of a screening library based on representative members of four families of biologically active alkaloids (Stemonaceae, the structurally related cyclindricine and lepadiformine families, lupin and Amaryllidaceae). In each case, scaffolds were based on structures of the naturally occurring compounds or a close derivative. Scaffold preparation was pursued following the development of appropriate enabling chemical methods. Diversification provided 686 new compounds suitable for screening. The libraries thus prepared had structural characteristics, including sp(3) content, comparable to a basis set of representative natural products and were highly rule-of-five compliant.",2
Synthesis of structurally well-defined and liquid-phase-processable graphene nanoribbons.,"The properties of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) make them good candidates for next-generation electronic materials. Whereas 'top-down' methods, such as the lithographical patterning of graphene and the unzipping of carbon nanotubes, give mixtures of different GNRs, structurally well-defined GNRs can be made using a 'bottom-up' organic synthesis approach through solution-mediated or surface-assisted cyclodehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, non-planar polyphenylene precursors were first 'built up' from small molecules, and then 'graphitized' and 'planarized' to yield GNRs. However, fabrication of processable and longitudinally well-extended GNRs has remained a major challenge. Here we report a bottom-up solution synthesis of long (>200 nm) liquid-phase-processable GNRs with a well-defined structure and a large optical bandgap of 1.88 eV. Self-assembled monolayers of GNRs can be observed by scanning probe microscopy, and non-contact time-resolved terahertz conductivity measurements reveal excellent charge-carrier mobility within individual GNRs. Such structurally well-defined GNRs may prove useful for fundamental studies of graphene nanostructures, as well as the development of GNR-based nanoelectronics.",2
"Conversion of 1-alkenes into 1,4-diols through an auxiliary-mediated formal homoallylic C-H oxidation.","The ubiquitous nature of C-H bonds in organic molecules makes them attractive as a target for rapid complexity generation, but brings with it the problem of achieving selective reactions. In developing new methodologies for C-H functionalization, alkenes are an attractive starting material because of their abundance and low cost. Here we describe the conversion of 1-alkenes into 1,4-diols. The method involves the installation of a new Si,N-type chelating auxiliary group on the alkene followed by iridium-catalysed C-H silylation of an unactivated delta-C(sp(3))-H bond to produce a silolane intermediate. Oxidation of the C-Si bonds affords a 1,4-diol. The method is demonstrated to have broad scope and good functional group compatibility by application to the selective 1,4-oxygenation of several natural products and derivatives.",2
Validation of N-myristoyltransferase as an antimalarial drug target using an integrated chemical biology approach.,"Malaria is an infectious disease caused by parasites of the genus Plasmodium, which leads to approximately one million deaths per annum worldwide. Chemical validation of new antimalarial targets is urgently required in view of rising resistance to current drugs. One such putative target is the enzyme N-myristoyltransferase, which catalyses the attachment of the fatty acid myristate to protein substrates (N-myristoylation). Here, we report an integrated chemical biology approach to explore protein myristoylation in the major human parasite P. falciparum, combining chemical proteomic tools for identification of the myristoylated and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteome with selective small-molecule N-myristoyltransferase inhibitors. We demonstrate that N-myristoyltransferase is an essential and chemically tractable target in malaria parasites both in vitro and in vivo, and show that selective inhibition of N-myristoylation leads to catastrophic and irreversible failure to assemble the inner membrane complex, a critical subcellular organelle in the parasite life cycle. Our studies provide the basis for the development of new antimalarials targeting N-myristoyltransferase.",2
Biosynthetic consequences of multiple sequential post-transition-state bifurcations.,"Selectivity in chemical reactions that form complex molecular architectures from simpler precursors is usually rationalized by comparing competing transition-state structures that lead to different possible products. Herein we describe a system for which a single transition-state structure leads to the formation of many isomeric products via pathways that feature multiple sequential bifurcations. The reaction network described connects the pimar-15-en-8-yl cation to miltiradiene, a tricyclic diterpene natural product, and isomers via cyclizations and/or rearrangements. The results suggest that the selectivity of the reaction is controlled by (post-transition-state) dynamic effects, that is, how the carbocation structure changes in response to the distribution of energy in its vibrational modes. The inherent dynamical effects revealed herein (characterized through quasiclassical direct dynamics calculations using density functional theory) have implications not only for the general principles of selectivity prediction in systems with complex potential energy surfaces, but also for the mechanisms of terpene synthase enzymes and their evolution. These findings redefine the challenges faced by nature in controlling the biosynthesis of complex natural products.",2
Hollow nanotubular toroidal polymer microrings.,"Despite the remarkable progress made in the self-assembly of nano- and microscale architectures with well-defined sizes and shapes, a self-organization-based synthesis of hollow toroids has, so far, proved to be elusive. Here, we report the synthesis of polymer microrings made from rectangular, flat and rigid-core monomers with anisotropically predisposed alkene groups, which are crosslinked with each other by dithiol linkers using thiol-ene photopolymerization. The resulting hollow toroidal structures are shape-persistent and mechanically robust in solution. In addition, their size can be tuned by controlling the initial monomer concentrations, an observation that is supported by a theoretical analysis. These hollow microrings can encapsulate guest molecules in the intratoroidal nanospace, and their peripheries can act as templates for circular arrays of metal nanoparticles.",2
Visualization and selective chemical targeting of RNA G-quadruplex structures in the cytoplasm of human cells.,"Following extensive evidence for the formation of four-stranded DNA G-quadruplex structures in vitro, DNA G-quadruplexes have been observed within human cells. Although chemically distinct, RNA can also fold in vitro into G-quadruplex structures that are highly stable because of the 2'-hydroxyl group. However, RNA G-quadruplexes have not yet been reported in cells. Here, we demonstrate the visualization of RNA G-quadruplex structures within the cytoplasm of human cells using a G-quadruplex structure-specific antibody. We also demonstrate that small molecules that bind to G-quadruplexes in vitro can trap endogenous RNA G-quadruplexes when applied to cells. Furthermore, a small molecule that exhibits a preference for RNA G-quadruplexes rather than DNA G-quadruplexes in biophysical experiments also shows the same selectivity within a cellular context. Our findings provide substantive evidence for RNA G-quadruplex formation in the human transcriptome, and corroborate the selectivity and application of stabilizing ligands that target G-quadruplexes within a cellular context.",2
Discrimination of epimeric glycans and glycopeptides using IM-MS and its potential for carbohydrate sequencing.,"Mass spectrometry is the primary analytical technique used to characterize the complex oligosaccharides that decorate cell surfaces. Monosaccharide building blocks are often simple epimers, which when combined produce diastereomeric glycoconjugates indistinguishable by mass spectrometry. Structure elucidation frequently relies on assumptions that biosynthetic pathways are highly conserved. Here, we show that biosynthetic enzymes can display unexpected promiscuity, with human glycosyltransferase pp-alpha-GanT2 able to utilize both uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine and uridine diphosphate N-acetylgalactosamine, leading to the synthesis of epimeric glycopeptides in vitro. Ion-mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) was used to separate these structures and, significantly, enabled characterization of the attached glycan based on the drift times of the monosaccharide product ions generated following collision-induced dissociation. Finally, ion-mobility mass spectrometry following fragmentation was used to determine the nature of both the reducing and non-reducing glycans of a series of epimeric disaccharides and the branched pentasaccharide Man3 glycan, demonstrating that this technique may prove useful for the sequencing of complex oligosaccharides.",2
Biogenetically inspired synthesis and skeletal diversification of indole alkaloids.,"To access architecturally complex natural products, chemists usually devise a customized synthetic strategy for constructing a single target skeleton. In contrast, biosynthetic assembly lines often employ divergent intramolecular cyclizations of a polyunsaturated common intermediate to produce diverse arrays of scaffolds. With the aim of integrating such biogenetic strategies, we show the development of an artificial divergent assembly line generating unprecedented numbers of scaffold variations of terpenoid indole alkaloids. This approach not only allows practical access to multipotent intermediates, but also enables systematic diversification of skeletal, stereochemical and functional group properties without structural simplification of naturally occurring alkaloids. Three distinct modes of [4+2] cyclizations and two types of redox-mediated annulations provided divergent access to five skeletally distinct scaffolds involving iboga-, aspidosperma-, andranginine- and ngouniensine-type skeletons and a non-natural variant within six to nine steps from tryptamine. The efficiency of our approach was demonstrated by successful total syntheses of (+/-)-vincadifformine, (+/-)-andranginine and (-)-catharanthine.",2
Calculations predict a stable molecular crystal of N8.,"Nitrogen, one of the most abundant elements in nature, forms the highly stable N2 molecule in its elemental state. In contrast, polynitrogen compounds comprising only nitrogen atoms are rare, and no molecular crystal made of these compounds has been prepared. Here, we predict the existence of such a molecular solid, consisting of N8 molecules, that is metastable even at ambient pressure. In the solid state, the N8 monomers retain the same structure and bonding pattern as those they adopt in the gas phase. The interactions that bind N8 molecules together are weak van der Waals and electrostatic forces. The solid is, according to calculations, more stable than a previously reported polymeric nitrogen solid, including at low pressure (below 20 GPa). The structure and properties of the N8 molecular crystal are discussed and a possible preparation strategy is suggested.",2
Ligand-enabled multiple absolute stereocontrol in metal-catalysed cycloaddition for construction of contiguous all-carbon quaternary stereocentres.,"The development of a general catalytic method for the direct and stereoselective construction of contiguous all-carbon quaternary stereocentres remains a formidable challenge in chemical synthesis. Here, we report a highly enantio- and diastereoselective [3+2] annulation reaction of 5-vinyloxazolidinones and activated trisubstituted alkenes catalysed by a palladium complex bearing a newly devised phosphine ligand with a chiral ammonium salt component, which enables the single-step construction of three contiguous stereocentres, including vicinal all-carbon quaternary stereocentres, in a five-membered heterocyclic framework. This stereoselective cycloaddition protocol relies on the remarkable ability of the chiral ligand to rigorously control the absolute stereochemistry of each chiral centre associated with the multiple bond-forming events, and provides a reliable catalytic process for the asymmetric synthesis of densely functionalized pyrrolidines.",2
Controlling intramolecular hydrogen transfer in a porphycene molecule with single atoms or molecules located nearby.,"Although the local environment of a molecule can play an important role in its chemistry, rarely has it been examined experimentally at the level of individual molecules. Here we report the precise control of intramolecular hydrogen-transfer (tautomerization) reactions in single molecules using scanning tunnelling microscopy. By placing, with atomic precision, a copper adatom close to a porphycene molecule, we found that the tautomerization rates could be tuned up and down in a controlled fashion, surprisingly also at rather large separations. Furthermore, we extended our study to molecular assemblies in which even the arrangement of the pyrrolic hydrogen atoms in the neighbouring molecule influences the tautomerization reaction in a given porphycene, with positive and negative cooperativity effects. Our results highlight the importance of controlling the environment of molecules with atomic precision and demonstrate the potential to regulate processes that occur in a single molecule.",2
The aromatic ene reaction.,"The ene reaction is a pericyclic process in which an alkene with an allylic hydrogen atom (the ene donor) reacts with a second unsaturated species (the enophile) to form a new product with a transposed pi-bond. The aromatic ene reaction, in which the alkene component is embedded in an aromatic ring, has only been reported in a few (four) instances and has proceeded in low yield (</=6%). Here, we show efficient aromatic ene reactions in which a thermally generated aryne intermediate engages a pendant m-alkylarene substituent to produce a dearomatized isotoluene, itself another versatile but rare reactive intermediate. Our experiments were guided by computational studies that revealed structural features conducive to the aromatic ene process. We proceeded to identify a cascade comprising three reactions: (1) hexadehydro-Diels-Alder (for aryne generation), (2) intramolecular aromatic ene and (3) bimolecular Alder ene. The power of this cascade is evident from the structural complexity of the final products, the considerable scope, and the overall efficiency of these multistage, reagent- and by-product-free, single-pot transformations.",2
Oligomerization transforms human APOBEC3G from an efficient enzyme to a slowly dissociating nucleic acid-binding protein.,"The human APOBEC3 proteins are a family of DNA-editing enzymes that play an important role in the innate immune response against retroviruses and retrotransposons. APOBEC3G is a member of this family that inhibits HIV-1 replication in the absence of the viral infectivity factor Vif. Inhibition of HIV replication occurs by both deamination of viral single-stranded DNA and a deamination-independent mechanism. Efficient deamination requires rapid binding to and dissociation from ssDNA. However, a relatively slow dissociation rate is required for the proposed deaminase-independent roadblock mechanism in which APOBEC3G binds the viral template strand and blocks reverse transcriptase-catalysed DNA elongation. Here, we show that APOBEC3G initially binds ssDNA with rapid on-off rates and subsequently converts to a slowly dissociating mode. In contrast, an oligomerization-deficient APOBEC3G mutant did not exhibit a slow off rate. We propose that catalytically active monomers or dimers slowly oligomerize on the viral genome and inhibit reverse transcription.",2
Temporal separation of catalytic activities allows anti-Markovnikov reductive functionalization of terminal alkynes.,"There is currently great interest in the development of multistep catalytic processes in which one or several catalysts act sequentially to rapidly build complex molecular structures. Many enzymes--often the inspiration for new synthetic transformations--are capable of processing a single substrate through a chain of discrete, mechanistically distinct catalytic steps. Here, we describe an approach to emulate the efficiency of these natural reaction cascades within a synthetic catalyst by the temporal separation of catalytic activities. In this approach, a single catalyst exhibits multiple catalytic activities sequentially, allowing for the efficient processing of a substrate through a cascade pathway. Application of this design strategy has led to the development of a method to effect the anti-Markovnikov (linear-selective) reductive functionalization of terminal alkynes. The strategy of temporal separation may facilitate the development of other efficient synthetic reaction cascades.",2
Cloud-based simulations on Google Exacycle reveal ligand modulation of GPCR activation pathways.,"Simulations can provide tremendous insight into the atomistic details of biological mechanisms, but micro- to millisecond timescales are historically only accessible on dedicated supercomputers. We demonstrate that cloud computing is a viable alternative that brings long-timescale processes within reach of a broader community. We used Google's Exacycle cloud-computing platform to simulate two milliseconds of dynamics of a major drug target, the G-protein-coupled receptor beta2AR. Markov state models aggregate independent simulations into a single statistical model that is validated by previous computational and experimental results. Moreover, our models provide an atomistic description of the activation of a G-protein-coupled receptor and reveal multiple activation pathways. Agonists and inverse agonists interact differentially with these pathways, with profound implications for drug design.",2
Bacteria clustering by polymers induces the expression of quorum-sensing-controlled phenotypes.,"Bacteria deploy a range of chemistries to regulate their behaviour and respond to their environment. Quorum sensing is one method by which bacteria use chemical reactions to modulate pre-infection behaviour such as surface attachment. Polymers that can interfere with bacterial adhesion or the chemical reactions used for quorum sensing are therefore a potential means to control bacterial population responses. Here, we report how polymeric 'bacteria sequestrants', designed to bind to bacteria through electrostatic interactions and therefore inhibit bacterial adhesion to surfaces, induce the expression of quorum-sensing-controlled phenotypes as a consequence of cell clustering. A combination of polymer and analytical chemistry, biological assays and computational modelling has been used to characterize the feedback between bacteria clustering and quorum sensing signalling. We have also derived design principles and chemical strategies for controlling bacterial behaviour at the population level.",2
"Rapid assembly of complex cyclopentanes employing chiral, alpha,beta-unsaturated acylammonium intermediates.","With the intention of improving synthetic efficiency, organic chemists have turned to bioinspired organocascade or domino processes that generate multiple bonds and stereocentres in a single operation. However, despite the great importance of substituted cyclopentanes, given their prevalence in complex natural products and pharmaceutical agents, the rapid, enantioselective assembly of these carbocycles lags behind cyclohexanes. Here, we describe a Michael-aldol-beta-lactonization organocascade process for the synthesis of complex cyclopentanes utilizing chiral alpha,beta-unsaturated acylammonium intermediates, readily generated by activation of commodity unsaturated acid chlorides with chiral isothiourea catalysts. This efficient methodology enables the construction of two C-C bonds, one C-O bond, two rings and up to three contiguous stereogenic centres delivering complex cyclopentanes with high levels of relative and absolute stereocontrol. Our results suggest that alpha,beta-unsaturated acylammonium intermediates have broad utility for the design of organocascade and multicomponent processes, with the latter demonstrated by a Michael-Michael-aldol-beta-lactonization.",2
Self-healing chemistry enables the stable operation of silicon microparticle anodes for high-energy lithium-ion batteries.,"The ability to repair damage spontaneously, which is termed self-healing, is an important survival feature in nature because it increases the lifetime of most living creatures. This feature is highly desirable for rechargeable batteries because the lifetime of high-capacity electrodes, such as silicon anodes, is shortened by mechanical fractures generated during the cycling process. Here, inspired by nature, we apply self-healing chemistry to silicon microparticle (SiMP) anodes to overcome their short cycle-life. We show that anodes made from low-cost SiMPs (~3-8 microm), for which stable deep galvanostatic cycling was previously impossible, can now have an excellent cycle life when coated with a self-healing polymer. We attain a cycle life ten times longer than state-of-art anodes made from SiMPs and still retain a high capacity (up to ~3,000 mA h g(-1)). Cracks and damage in the coating during cycling can be healed spontaneously by the randomly branched hydrogen-bonding polymer used.",2
Large negative thermal expansion of a polymer driven by a submolecular conformational change.,"Mechanoresponsive polymers hold great technological potential in drug delivery, 'smart' optical systems and microelectromechanical systems. However, hysteresis and fatigue (associated with large-scale polymer chain rearrangement) are often problematic. Here, we describe a polyarylamide film that contains s-dibenzocyclooctadiene (DBCOD), which can generate unconventional and completely reversible thermal contraction under low-energy stimulation. The films exhibit a giant negative thermal expansion coefficient of approximately -1,200 ppm K(-1) at ambient or near-ambient temperatures, much higher than any known negative-thermal-expansion materials under similar operating conditions. Mechanical characterization, calorimetry, spectroscopic analysis and density-functional theory calculations all point to the conformational change of the DBCOD moiety, from the thermodynamic global energy minimum (twist-boat) to a local minimum (chair), as the origin of this abnormal thermal shrinkage. This newly identified, low-energy-driven, thermally agile molecular subunit opens a new pathway to creating near-infrared-based macromolecular switches and motors, and for ambient thermal energy storage and conversion.",2
A boron-boron coupling reaction between two ethyl cation analogues.,"The design of larger architectures from smaller molecular building blocks by element-element coupling reactions is one of the key concerns of synthetic chemistry, so a number of strategies were developed for this bottom-up approach. A general scheme is the coupling of two elements with opposing polarity or that of two radicals. Here, we show that a B-B coupling reaction is possible between two boron analogues of the ethyl cation, resulting in the formation of an unprecedented dicationic tetraborane. The bonding properties in the rhomboid B(4) core of the product can be described as two B-B units connected by three-centre, two-electron bonds, sharing the short diagonal. Our discovery might lead the way to the long sought-after boron chain polymers with a structure similar to the silicon chains in beta-SiB(3). Moreover, the reaction is a prime textbook example of the influence of multiple-centre bonding on reactivity.",2
Metal-free binding and coupling of carbon monoxide at a boron-boron triple bond.,"Many metal-containing compounds, and some metal-free compounds, will bind carbon monoxide. However, only a handful of metal-containing compounds have been shown to induce the coupling of two or more CO molecules, potentially a method for the use of CO as a one-carbon-atom building block for the synthesis of organic molecules. In this work, CO was added to a boron-boron triple bond at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, resulting in a compound into which four equivalents of CO are incorporated: a flat, bicyclic, bis(boralactone). By the controlled addition of one CO to the diboryne compound, an intermediate in the CO coupling reaction was isolated and structurally characterized. Electrochemical measurements confirm the strongly reducing nature of the diboryne compound.",2
Singlet exciton fission in solution.,"Singlet exciton fission, the spin-conserving process that produces two triplet excited states from one photoexcited singlet state, is a means to circumvent the Shockley-Queisser limit in single-junction solar cells. Although the process through which singlet fission occurs is not well characterized, some local order is thought to be necessary for intermolecular coupling. Here, we report a triplet yield of 200% and triplet formation rates approaching the diffusion limit in solutions of bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl (TIPS)) pentacene. We observe a transient bound excimer intermediate, formed by the collision of one photoexcited and one ground-state TIPS-pentacene molecule. The intermediate breaks up when the two triplets separate to each TIPS-pentacene molecule. This efficient system is a model for future singlet-fission materials and for disordered device components that produce cascades of excited states from sunlight.",2
In-ice evolution of RNA polymerase ribozyme activity.,"Mechanisms of molecular self-replication have the potential to shed light on the origins of life. In particular, self-replication through RNA-catalysed templated RNA synthesis is thought to have supported a primordial 'RNA world'. However, existing polymerase ribozymes lack the capacity to synthesize RNAs approaching their own size. Here, we report the in vitro evolution of such catalysts directly in the RNA-stabilizing medium of water ice, which yielded RNA polymerase ribozymes specifically adapted to sub-zero temperatures and able to synthesize RNA in ices at temperatures as low as -19 degrees C. The combination of cold-adaptive mutations with a previously described 5' extension operating at ambient temperatures enabled the design of a first polymerase ribozyme capable of catalysing the accurate synthesis of an RNA sequence longer than itself (adding up to 206 nucleotides), an important stepping stone towards RNA self-replication.",2
How much do van der Waals dispersion forces contribute to molecular recognition in solution?,"The emergent properties that arise from self-assembly and molecular recognition phenomena are a direct consequence of non-covalent interactions. Gas-phase measurements and computational methods point to the dominance of dispersion forces in molecular association, but solvent effects complicate the unambiguous quantification of these forces in solution. Here, we have used synthetic molecular balances to measure interactions between apolar alkyl chains in 31 organic, fluorous and aqueous solvent environments. The experimental interaction energies are an order of magnitude smaller than estimates of dispersion forces between alkyl chains that have been derived from vaporization enthalpies and dispersion-corrected calculations. Instead, it was found that cohesive solvent-solvent interactions are the major driving force behind apolar association in solution. The results suggest that theoretical models that implicate important roles for dispersion forces in molecular recognition events should be interpreted with caution in solvent-accessible systems.",2
Pattern transformation with DNA circuits.,"Readily programmable chemical networks are important tools as the scope of chemistry expands from individual molecules to larger molecular systems. Although many complex systems are constructed using conventional organic and inorganic chemistry, the programmability of biological molecules such as nucleic acids allows for precise, high-throughput and automated design, as well as simple, rapid and robust implementation. Here we show that systematic and quantitative control over the diffusivity and reactivity of DNA molecules yields highly programmable chemical reaction networks (CRNs) that execute at the macroscale. In particular, we designed and implemented non-enzymatic DNA circuits capable of performing pattern-transformation algorithms such as edge detection. We also showed that it is possible to fine-tune and multiplex such circuits. We believe these strategies will provide programmable platforms on which to prototype CRNs, discover bottom-up construction principles and generate patterns in materials.",2
Opportunities and challenges in single-molecule and single-particle fluorescence microscopy for mechanistic studies of chemical reactions.,"In recent years, single-molecule and single-particle fluorescence microscopy has emerged as a tool to investigate chemical systems. After an initial lag of over a decade with respect to biophysical studies, this powerful imaging technique is now revealing mechanisms of 'classical' organic reactions, spatial distribution of chemical reactivity on surfaces and the phase of active catalysts. The recent advance into commercial imaging systems obviates the need for home-built laser systems and thus opens this technique to traditionally trained synthetic chemists. We discuss the requisite photophysical and chemical properties of fluorescent reporters and highlight the main challenges in applying single-molecule techniques to chemical questions. The goal of this Perspective is to provide a snapshot of an emerging multidisciplinary field and to encourage broader use of this young experimental approach that aids the observation of chemical reactions as depicted in many textbooks: molecule by molecule.",2
Polymer chemistry: Macromolecules made to order.,Mastering how to completely control the exact monomer sequence of synthetic polymers is the ultimate key for establishing true biomimetic macromolecular chemistry. A versatile one-pot approach for the synthesis of well-defined multiblock copolymers with short block lengths offers another approach on the road towards this lofty goal,2
Intermolecular forces: a solution to dispersion interactions.,"London dispersion forces have been cited as an important factor in protein folding, drug-receptor interactions, and catalyst selectivities. However, careful analysis of a model system finds that the dispersion interactions are only minor contributors to the formation of complexes in solution.",2
Origin of life: Cold-hearted RNA heats up life.,"An RNA replicase ribozyme has long been sought by chemists interested in the origin of life. Now, a selection strategy employing a low-temperature water-ice mixture as the medium has led to discovery of a ribozyme that can catalyse polymerization of an RNA chain greater than its own length.",2
Chemical reaction networks: Colour by number.,"Using chemical reactions and diffusion to control pattern formation requires the careful design of reaction networks and a balance of kinetics that is difficult to achieve. Now, it has been shown that DNA-based reaction networks provide a robust method for transforming patterns.",2
A thiamin-utilizing ribozyme decarboxylates a pyruvate-like substrate.,"Vitamins are hypothesized to be relics of an RNA world, and were probably participants in RNA-mediated primordial metabolism. If catalytic RNAs, or ribozymes, could harness vitamin cofactors to aid their function in a manner similar to protein enzymes, it would enable them to catalyse a much larger set of chemical reactions. The cofactor thiamin diphosphate, a derivative of vitamin B1 (thiamin), is used by enzymes to catalyse difficult metabolic reactions, including decarboxylation of stable alpha-keto acids such as pyruvate. Here, we report a ribozyme that uses free thiamin to decarboxylate a pyruvate-based suicide substrate (LnkPB). Thiamin conjugated to biotin was used to isolate catalytic individuals from a pool of random-sequence RNAs attached to LnkPB. Analysis of a stable guanosine adduct obtained via digestion of an RNA sequence (clone dc4) showed the expected decarboxylation product. The discovery of a prototypic thiamin-utilizing ribozyme has implications for the role of RNA in orchestrating early metabolic cycles.",2
Fluctuating exciton localization in giant pi-conjugated spoked-wheel macrocycles.,"Conjugated polymers offer potential for many diverse applications, but we still lack a fundamental microscopic understanding of their electronic structure. Elementary photoexcitations (excitons) span only a few nanometres of a molecule, which itself can extend over microns, and how their behaviour is affected by molecular dimensions is not immediately obvious. For example, where is the exciton formed within a conjugated segment and is it always situated on the same repeat units? Here, we introduce structurally rigid molecular spoked wheels, 6 nm in diameter, as a model of extended pi conjugation. Single-molecule fluorescence reveals random exciton localization, which leads to temporally varying emission polarization. Initially, this random localization arises after every photon absorption event because of temperature-independent spontaneous symmetry breaking. These fast fluctuations are slowed to millisecond timescales after prolonged illumination. Intramolecular heterogeneity is revealed in cryogenic spectroscopy by jumps in transition energy, but emission polarization can also switch without a spectral jump occurring, which implies long-range homogeneity in the local dielectric environment.",2
Layer-by-layer cell membrane assembly.,"Eukaryotic subcellular membrane systems, such as the nuclear envelope or endoplasmic reticulum, present a rich array of architecturally and compositionally complex supramolecular targets that are as yet inaccessible. Here we describe layer-by-layer phospholipid membrane assembly on microfluidic droplets, a route to structures with defined compositional asymmetry and lamellarity. Starting with phospholipid-stabilized water-in-oil droplets trapped in a static droplet array, lipid monolayer deposition proceeds as oil/water-phase boundaries pass over the droplets. Unilamellar vesicles assembled layer-by-layer support functional insertion both of purified and of in situ expressed membrane proteins. Synthesis and chemical probing of asymmetric unilamellar and double-bilayer vesicles demonstrate the programmability of both membrane lamellarity and lipid-leaflet composition during assembly. The immobilized vesicle arrays are a pragmatic experimental platform for biophysical studies of membranes and their associated proteins, particularly complexes that assemble and function in multilamellar contexts in vivo.",2
Computer-aided molecular design of solvents for accelerated reaction kinetics.,"Solvents can significantly alter the rates and selectivity of liquid-phase organic reactions, often hindering the development of new synthetic routes or, if chosen wisely, facilitating routes by improving rates and selectivities. To address this challenge, a systematic methodology is proposed that quickly identifies improved reaction solvents by combining quantum mechanical computations of the reaction rate constant in a few solvents with a computer-aided molecular design (CAMD) procedure. The approach allows the identification of a high-performance solvent within a very large set of possible molecules. The validity of our CAMD approach is demonstrated through application to a classical nucleophilic substitution reaction for the study of solvent effects, the Menschutkin reaction. The results were validated successfully by in situ kinetic experiments. A space of 1,341 solvents was explored in silico, but required quantum-mechanical calculations of the rate constant in only nine solvents, and uncovered a solvent that increases the rate constant by 40%.",2
A clamp-like biohybrid catalyst for DNA oxidation.,"In processive catalysis, a catalyst binds to a substrate and remains bound as it performs several consecutive reactions, as exemplified by DNA polymerases. Processivity is essential in nature and is often mediated by a clamp-like structure that physically tethers the catalyst to its (polymeric) template. In the case of the bacteriophage T4 replisome, a dedicated clamp protein acts as a processivity mediator by encircling DNA and subsequently recruiting its polymerase. Here we use this DNA-binding protein to construct a biohybrid catalyst. Conjugation of the clamp protein to a chemical catalyst with sequence-specific oxidation behaviour formed a catalytic clamp that can be loaded onto a DNA plasmid. The catalytic activity of the biohybrid catalyst was visualized using a procedure based on an atomic force microscopy method that detects and spatially locates oxidized sites in DNA. Varying the experimental conditions enabled switching between processive and distributive catalysis and influencing the sliding direction of this rotaxane-like catalyst.",2
A broadly applicable [18F]trifluoromethylation of aryl and heteroaryl iodides for PET imaging.,"Molecules labelled with the unnatural isotope fluorine-18 are used for positron emission tomography. Currently, this molecular imaging technology is not exploited at its full potential because many (18)F-labelled probes are inaccessible or notoriously difficult to produce. Typical challenges associated with (18)F radiochemistry are the short half-life of (18)F (<2 h), the use of sub-stoichiometric amounts of (18)F, relative to the precursor and other reagents, as well as the limited availability of parent (18)F sources of suitable reactivity ([(18)F]F(-) and [(18)F]F2). There is a high-priority demand for general methods allowing access to [(18)F]CF3-substituted molecules for application in pharmaceutical discovery programmes. We report the development of a process for the late-stage [(18)F]trifluoromethylation of (hetero)arenes from [(18)F]fluoride using commercially available reagents and (hetero)aryl iodides. This [(18)F]CuCF3-based protocol benefits from a large substrate scope and is characterized by its operational simplicity.",2
Water vibrations have strongly mixed intra- and intermolecular character.,"The ability of liquid water to dissipate energy efficiently through ultrafast vibrational relaxation plays a key role in the stabilization of reactive intermediates and the outcome of aqueous chemical reactions. The vibrational couplings that govern energy relaxation in H2O remain difficult to characterize because of the limitations of current methods to visualize inter- and intramolecular motions simultaneously. Using a new sub-70 fs broadband mid-infrared source, we performed two-dimensional infrared, transient absorption and polarization anisotropy spectroscopy of H2O by exciting the OH stretching transition and characterizing the response from 1,350 cm(-1) to 4,000 cm(-1). These spectra reveal vibrational transitions at all frequencies simultaneous to the excitation, including pronounced cross-peaks to the bend vibration and a continuum of induced absorptions to combination bands that are not present in linear spectra. These observations provide evidence for strong mixing of inter- and intramolecular vibrations in liquid H2O, and illustrate the shortcomings of traditional relaxation models.",2
Water lubricates hydrogen-bonded molecular machines.,"The mechanical behaviour of molecular machines differs greatly from that of their macroscopic counterparts. This applies particularly when considering concepts such as friction and lubrication, which are key to optimizing the operation of macroscopic machinery. Here, using time-resolved vibrational spectroscopy and NMR-lineshape analysis, we show that for molecular machinery consisting of hydrogen-bonded components the relative motion of the components is accelerated strongly by adding small amounts of water. The translation of a macrocycle along a thread and the rotation of a molecular wheel around an axle both accelerate significantly on the addition of water, whereas other protic liquids have much weaker or opposite effects. We tentatively assign the superior accelerating effect of water to its ability to form a three-dimensional hydrogen-bond network between the moving parts of the molecular machine. These results may indicate a more general phenomenon that helps explain the function of water as the 'lubricant of life'.",2
Optical control of antibacterial activity.,"Bacterial resistance is a major problem in the modern world, stemming in part from the build-up of antibiotics in the environment. Novel molecular approaches that enable an externally triggered increase in antibiotic activity with high spatiotemporal resolution and auto-inactivation are highly desirable. Here we report a responsive, broad-spectrum, antibacterial agent that can be temporally activated with light, whereupon it auto-inactivates on the scale of hours. The use of such a 'smart' antibiotic might prevent the build-up of active antimicrobial material in the environment. Reversible optical control over active drug concentration enables us to obtain pharmacodynamic information. Precisely localized control of activity is achieved, allowing the growth of bacteria to be confined to defined patterns, which has potential for the development of treatments that avoid interference with the endogenous microbial population in other parts of the organism.",2
In situ growth of nanoparticles through control of non-stoichiometry.,"Surfaces decorated with uniformly dispersed catalytically active nanoparticles play a key role in many fields, including renewable energy and catalysis. Typically, these structures are prepared by deposition techniques, but alternatively they could be made by growing the nanoparticles in situ directly from the (porous) backbone support. Here we demonstrate that growing nano-size phases from perovskites can be controlled through judicious choice of composition, particularly by tuning deviations from the ideal ABO3 stoichiometry. This non-stoichiometry facilitates a change in equilibrium position to make particle exsolution much more dynamic, enabling the preparation of compositionally diverse nanoparticles (that is, metallic, oxides or mixtures) and seems to afford unprecedented control over particle size, distribution and surface anchorage. The phenomenon is also shown to be influenced strongly by surface reorganization characteristics. The concept exemplified here may serve in the design and development of more sophisticated oxide materials with advanced functionality across a range of possible domains of application.",2
"The past, present and potential for microfluidic reactor technology in chemical synthesis.","The past two decades have seen far-reaching progress in the development of microfluidic systems for use in the chemical and biological sciences. Here we assess the utility of microfluidic reactor technology as a tool in chemical synthesis in both academic research and industrial applications. We highlight the successes and failures of past research in the field and provide a catalogue of chemistries performed in a microfluidic reactor. We then assess the current roadblocks hindering the widespread use of microfluidic reactors from the perspectives of both synthetic chemistry and industrial application. Finally, we set out seven challenges that we hope will inspire future research in this field.",2
"Component-based syntheses of trioxacarcin A, DC-45-A1 and structural analogues.","The trioxacarcins are polyoxygenated, structurally complex natural products that potently inhibit the growth of cultured human cancer cells. Here we describe syntheses of trioxacarcin A, DC-45-A1 and structural analogues by late-stage stereoselective glycosylation reactions of fully functionalized, differentially protected aglycon substrates. Key issues addressed in this work include the identification of an appropriate means to activate and protect each of the two 2-deoxysugar components, trioxacarcinose A and trioxacarcinose B, as well as a viable sequencing of the glycosidic couplings. The convergent, component-based sequence we present allows for rapid construction of structurally diverse, synthetic analogues that would be inaccessible by any other means, in amounts required to support biological evaluation. Analogues that arise from the modification of four of five modular components are assembled in 11 steps or fewer. The majority of these are found to be active in antiproliferative assays using cultured human cancer cells.",2
A missing link in the transformation from asymmetric to symmetric metallofullerene cages implies a top-down fullerene formation mechanism.,"Although fullerenes were discovered nearly three decades ago, the mechanism of their formation remains a mystery. Many versions of the classic 'bottom-up' formation mechanism have been advanced, starting with C2 units that build up to form chains and rings of carbon atoms and ultimately form those well-known isolated fullerenes (for example, I(h)-C60). In recent years, evidence from laboratory and interstellar observations has emerged to suggest a 'top-down' mechanism, whereby small isolated fullerenes are formed via shrinkage of giant fullerenes generated from graphene sheets. Here, we present molecular structural evidence for this top-down mechanism based on metal carbide metallofullerenes M2C2@C1(51383)-C84 (M = Y, Gd). We propose that the unique asymmetric C1(51383)-C84 cage with destabilizing fused pentagons is a preserved 'missing link' in the top-down mechanism, and in well-established rearrangement steps can form many well-known, high-symmetry fullerene structures that account for the majority of solvent-extractable metallofullerenes.",2
Equilibrium between a cyclotrisilene and an isolable base adduct of a disilenyl silylene.,"In organic chemistry, compounds with adjacent alkene and carbene functionalities (vinyl carbenes) are studied widely as fleeting intermediates and in the coordination sphere of transition metals. Stable derivatives of vinyl carbenes remain elusive, including the corresponding heavier group 14 homologues. Here we report the isolation and full characterization of a base-stabilized silicon version of a vinyl carbene that features a silicon-silicon double bond as well as a silylene functionality, coordinated by an N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC). In solution, the intensely green disilenyl silylene adduct exists in equilibrium with the corresponding silicon analogue of a cyclopropene and free NHC, which was quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. The reversibility of this process raises exciting possibilities for the preparation of extended conjugated pi systems of silicon.",2
Site-specific positioning of dendritic alkyl chains on DNA cages enables their geometry-dependent self-assembly.,"Nature uses a combination of non-covalent interactions to create a hierarchy of complex systems from simple building blocks. One example is the selective association of the hydrophobic side chains that are a strong determinant of protein organization. Here, we report a parallel mode of assembly in DNA nanotechnology. Dendritic alkyl-DNA conjugates are hybridized to the edges of a DNA cube. When four amphiphiles are on one face, the hydrophobic residues of two neighbouring cubes engage in an intermolecular 'handshake', resulting in a dimer. When there are eight amphiphiles (four on the top and bottom cube faces, respectively), they engage in an intramolecular 'handshake' inside the cube. This forms the first example of a monodisperse micelle within a DNA nanostructure that encapsulates small molecules and releases them by DNA recognition. Creating a three-dimensional pattern of hydrophobic patches, like side chains in proteins, can result in specific, directed association of hydrophobic domains with orthogonal interactions to DNA base-pairing.",2
A strategy for the diversity-oriented synthesis of macrocyclic scaffolds using multidimensional coupling.,"A prerequisite for successful screening campaigns in drug discovery or chemical genetics is the availability of structurally and thus functionally diverse compound libraries. Diversity-oriented synthesis (DOS) provides strategies for the generation of such libraries, of which the build/couple/pair (B/C/P) algorithm is the most frequently used. We have developed an advanced B/C/P strategy that incorporates multidimensional coupling. In this approach, structural diversity is not only defined by the nature of the building blocks employed, but also by the linking motif installed during the coupling reaction. We applied this step-efficient approach in a DOS of a library that consisted of 73 macrocyclic compounds based around 59 discrete scaffolds. The macrocycles prepared cover a broad range of different molecular shapes, as illustrated by principal moment-of-inertia analysis. This demonstrates the capability of the advanced B/C/P strategy using multidimensional coupling for the preparation of structurally diverse compound collections.",2
End-to-end conformational communication through a synthetic purinergic receptor by ligand-induced helicity switching.,"The long-range communication of information, exemplified by signal transduction through membrane-bound receptors, is a central biochemical function. Reversible binding of a messenger ligand induces a local conformational change that is relayed through the receptor, inducing a chemical effect typically several nanometres from the binding site. We report a synthetic receptor mimic that transmits structural information from a boron-based ligand binding site to a spectroscopic reporter located more than 2 nm away. Reversible binding of a diol ligand to the N-terminal binding site induces a screw-sense preference in a helical oligo(aminoisobutyric acid) foldamer, which is relayed to a reporter group at the remote C-terminus, communicating information about the structure and stereochemistry of the ligand. The reversible nature of boronate esterification was exploited to switch the receptor sequentially between left- and right-handed helices, while the exquisite conformational sensitivity of the helical relay allowed the reporter to differentiate even between purine and pyrimidine nucleosides as ligands.",2
Caesium in high oxidation states and as a p-block element.,"The periodicity of the elements and the non-reactivity of the inner-shell electrons are two related principles of chemistry, rooted in the atomic shell structure. Within compounds, Group I elements, for example, invariably assume the +1 oxidation state, and their chemical properties differ completely from those of the p-block elements. These general rules govern our understanding of chemical structures and reactions. Here, first-principles calculations show that, under pressure, caesium atoms can share their 5p electrons to become formally oxidized beyond the +1 state. In the presence of fluorine and under pressure, the formation of CsF(n) (n > 1) compounds containing neutral or ionic molecules is predicted. Their geometry and bonding resemble that of isoelectronic XeF(n) molecules, showing a caesium atom that behaves chemically like a p-block element under these conditions. The calculated stability of the CsF(n) compounds shows that the inner-shell electrons can become the main components of chemical bonds.",2
Brightening of carbon nanotube photoluminescence through the incorporation of sp3 defects.,"Semiconducting carbon nanotubes promise a broad range of potential applications in optoelectronics and imaging, but their photon-conversion efficiency is relatively low. Quantum theory suggests that nanotube photoluminescence is intrinsically inefficient because of low-lying 'dark' exciton states. Here we demonstrate the significant brightening of nanotube photoluminescence (up to 28-fold) through the creation of an optically allowed defect state that resides below the predicted energy level of the dark excitons. Emission from this new state generates a photoluminescence peak that is red-shifted by as much as 254 meV from the nanotube's original excitonic transition. We also found that the attachment of electron-withdrawing substituents to carbon nanotubes systematically drives this defect state further down the energy ladder. Our experiments show that the material's photoluminescence quantum yield increases exponentially as a function of the shifted emission energy. This work lays the foundation for chemical control of defect quantum states in low-dimensional carbon materials.",2
beta-Carbon activation of saturated carboxylic esters through N-heterocyclic carbene organocatalysis.,"The activation of the alpha-carbons of carboxylic esters and related carbonyl compounds to generate enolate equivalents as nucleophiles is one of the most powerful strategies in organic synthesis. We reasoned that the horizons of chemical synthesis could be greatly expanded if the typically inert beta-carbons of saturated esters could be used as nucleophiles. However, despite the rather significant fundamental and practical values, direct use of the beta-carbons of saturated carbonyl compounds as nucleophiles remains elusive. Here we report the catalytic activation of simple saturated ester beta-carbons as nucleophiles (beta-carbon activation) using N-heterocyclic carbene organocatalysts. The catalytically generated nucleophilic beta-carbons undergo enantioselective reactions with electrophiles such as enones and imines. Given the proven rich chemistry of ester alpha-carbons, we expect this catalytic activation mode for saturated ester beta-carbons to open a valuable new arena for new and useful reactions and synthetic strategies.",2
Constructing monocrystalline covalent organic networks by polymerization.,"An emerging strategy for making ordered materials is modular construction, which connects preformed molecular subunits to neighbours through interactions of properly selected reactive sites. This strategy has yielded remarkable materials, including metal-organic frameworks joined by coordinative bonds, supramolecular networks linked by strong non-covalent interactions, and covalent organic frameworks in which atoms of carbon and other light elements are bonded covalently. However, the strategy has not yet produced covalently bonded organic materials in the form of large single crystals. Here we show that such materials can result from reversible self-addition polymerizations of suitably designed monomers. In particular, monomers with four tetrahedrally oriented nitroso groups polymerize to form diamondoid azodioxy networks that can be fully characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. This work forges a strong new link between polymer science and supramolecular chemistry by showing how predictably ordered covalent or non-covalent structures can both be built using a single modular strategy.",2
Catalysis in service of main group chemistry offers a versatile approach to p-block molecules and materials.,"Catalytic reactions that enable the formation of new bonds to carbon centres play a pervasive role in the state-of-the-art synthesis of organic molecules and macromolecules. In contrast, the development of analogous processes as routes to main group compounds and materials has been much slower. Nevertheless, recent advances have led to a broad expansion of this field and now allow access to a wide range of catenated structures based on elements across the p block. These breakthroughs have already impacted areas such as hydrogen storage and transfer, functional inorganic polymers and ceramic thin films. Dehydrogenation and dehydrocoupling processes are particularly well developed and may be mediated by either transition metal or main group catalysts. Such pathways represent an increasingly attractive and convenient alternative to traditional routes, such as salt metathesis and reductive coupling reactions. An overview of this emerging area is presented in this Review with a focus on recent developments and future challenges.",2
On the cooperative formation of non-hydrogen-bonded water at molecular hydrophobic interfaces.,"The unique structural, dynamical and chemical properties of air/water and oil/water interfaces are thought to play a key role in various biological, geological and environmental processes. For example, non-hydrogen-bonded ('dangling') OH groups--which create surface defects in water's hydrogen bonding network and are experimentally detected at both macroscopic (air/water or oil/water) and microscopic (dissolved hydrophobic molecule) interfaces--are thought to catalyse some chemical reactions. However, how the size, curvature or charge of the exposed hydrophobic surface influences water's propensity to form dangling OH defects has not yet been established quantitatively. Here we use Raman multivariate curve resolution to probe spectroscopically the hydrophobic hydration shell and, using a statistical multisite analysis, we show that such interfacial dangling OH structures are entropically stabilized and their formation is cooperative (the probability that a non-hydrogen-bonded OH group will form depends nonlinearly on the hydrophobic surface area). We thus expose an important difference between the chemical properties of molecular and macroscopic oil/water interfaces.",2
"Catalyst recognition of cis-1,2-diols enables site-selective functionalization of complex molecules.","Carbohydrates and natural products serve essential roles in nature, and also provide core scaffolds for pharmaceutical agents and vaccines. However, the inherent complexity of these molecules imposes significant synthetic hurdles for their selective functionalization and derivatization. Nature has, in part, addressed these issues by employing enzymes that are able to orient and activate substrates within a chiral pocket, which increases dramatically both the rate and selectivity of organic transformations. In this article we show that similar proximity effects can be utilized in the context of synthetic catalysts to achieve general and predictable site-selective functionalization of complex molecules. Unlike enzymes, our catalysts apply a single reversible covalent bond to recognize and bind to specific functional group displays within substrates. By combining this unique binding selectivity and asymmetric catalysis, we are able to modify the less reactive axial positions within monosaccharides and natural products.",2
Conditionally fluorescent molecular probes for detecting single base changes in double-stranded DNA.,"Small variations in nucleic acid sequences can have far-reaching phenotypic consequences. Reliably distinguishing closely related sequences is therefore important for research and clinical applications. Here, we demonstrate that conditionally fluorescent DNA probes are capable of distinguishing variations of a single base in a stretch of target DNA. These probes use a novel programmable mechanism in which each single nucleotide polymorphism generates two thermodynamically destabilizing mismatch bubbles rather than the single mismatch formed during typical hybridization-based assays. Up to a 12,000-fold excess of a target that contains a single nucleotide polymorphism is required to generate the same fluorescence as one equivalent of the intended target, and detection works reliably over a wide range of conditions. Using these probes we detected point mutations in a 198 base-pair subsequence of the Escherichia coli rpoB gene. That our probes are constructed from multiple oligonucleotides circumvents synthesis limitations and enables long continuous DNA sequences to be probed.",2
Exceptional oxidation activity with size-controlled supported gold clusters of low atomicity.,"The catalytic activity of gold depends on particle size, with the reactivity increasing as the particle diameter decreases. However, investigations into behaviour in the subnanometre regime (where gold exists as small clusters of a few atoms) began only recently with advances in synthesis and characterization techniques. Here we report an easy method to prepare isolated gold atoms supported on functionalized carbon nanotubes and their performance in the oxidation of thiophenol with O2. We show that single gold atoms are not active, but they aggregate under reaction conditions into gold clusters of low atomicity that exhibit a catalytic activity comparable to that of sulfhydryl oxidase enzymes. When clusters grow into larger nanoparticles, catalyst activity drops to zero. Theoretical calculations show that gold clusters are able to activate thiophenol and O2 simultaneously, and larger nanoparticles are passivated by strongly adsorbed thiolates. The combination of both reactants activation and facile product desorption makes gold clusters excellent catalysts.",2
Enantioselective silyl protection of alcohols promoted by a combination of chiral and achiral Lewis basic catalysts.,"Catalytic enantioselective monosilylations of diols and polyols furnish valuable alcohol-containing molecules in high enantiomeric purity. These transformations, however, require high catalyst loadings (20-30 mol%) and long reaction times (2-5 days). Here, we report that a counterintuitive strategy involving the use of an achiral co-catalyst structurally similar to the chiral catalyst provides an effective solution to this problem. A combination of seemingly competitive Lewis basic molecules can function in concert such that one serves as an achiral nucleophilic promoter and the other performs as a chiral Bronsted base. On the addition of 7.5-20 mol% of a commercially available N-heterocycle (5-ethylthiotetrazole), reactions typically proceed within one hour, and deliver the desired products in high yields and enantiomeric ratios. In some instances, there is no reaction in the absence of the achiral base, yet the presence of the achiral co-catalyst gives rise to facile formation of products in high enantiomeric purity.",2
Sub-angstrom-resolution crystallography reveals physical distortions that enhance reactivity of a covalent enzymatic intermediate.,"It is recognized widely that enzymes promote reactions by providing a pathway that proceeds through a transition state of lower energy. In principle, further rate enhancements could be achieved if intermediates are prevented from relaxing to their lowest energy state, and thereby reduce the barrier to the subsequent transition state. Here, we report sub-angstrom-resolution crystal structures of genuine covalent reaction intermediates of transketolase. These structures reveal a pronounced out-of-plane distortion of over 20 degrees for the covalent bond that links cofactor and substrate, and a specific elongation of the scissile substrate carbon-carbon bond (d > 1.6 A). To achieve these distortions, the protein's conformation appears to prevent relaxation of a substrate-cofactor intermediate. The results implicate a reduced barrier to the subsequent step that is consistent with an intermediate of raised energy and leads to a more efficient overall process.",2
Mechanochemical strengthening of a synthetic polymer in response to typically destructive shear forces.,"High shear stresses are known to trigger destructive bond-scission reactions in polymers. Recent work has shown that the same shear forces can be used to accelerate non-destructive reactions in mechanophores along polymer backbones, and it is demonstrated here that such mechanochemical reactions can be used to strengthen a polymer subjected to otherwise destructive shear forces. Polybutadiene was functionalized with dibromocyclopropane mechanophores, whose mechanical activation generates allylic bromides that are crosslinked in situ by nucleophilic substitution reactions with carboxylates. The crosslinking is activated efficiently by shear forces both in solvated systems and in bulk materials, and the resulting covalent polymer networks possess moduli that are orders-of-magnitude greater than those of the unactivated polymers. These molecular-level responses and their impact on polymer properties have implications for the design of materials that, like biological materials, actively remodel locally as a function of their physical environment.",2
Photochemical activity of a key donor-acceptor complex can drive stereoselective catalytic alpha-alkylation of aldehydes.,"Asymmetric catalytic variants of sunlight-driven photochemical processes hold extraordinary potential for the sustainable preparation of chiral molecules. However, the involvement of short-lived electronically excited states inherent to any photochemical reaction makes it challenging for a chiral catalyst to dictate the stereochemistry of the products. Here, we report that readily available chiral organic catalysts, with well-known utility in thermal asymmetric processes, can also confer a high level of stereocontrol in synthetically relevant intermolecular carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions driven by visible light. A unique mechanism of catalysis is proposed, wherein the catalyst is involved actively in both the photochemical activation of the substrates (by inducing the transient formation of chiral electron donor-acceptor complexes) and the stereoselectivity-defining event. We use this approach to enable transformations that are extremely difficult under thermal conditions, such as the asymmetric alpha-alkylation of aldehydes with alkyl halides, the formation of all-carbon quaternary stereocentres and the control of remote stereochemistry.",2
Accelerated chemistry in the reaction between the hydroxyl radical and methanol at interstellar temperatures facilitated by tunnelling.,"Understanding the abundances of molecules in dense interstellar clouds requires knowledge of the rates of gas-phase reactions between uncharged species. However, because of the low temperatures within these clouds, reactions with an activation barrier were considered too slow to play an important role. Here we show that, despite the presence of a barrier, the rate coefficient for the reaction between the hydroxyl radical (OH) and methanol--one of the most abundant organic molecules in space--is almost two orders of magnitude larger at 63 K than previously measured at approximately 200 K. We also observe the formation of the methoxy radical product, which was recently detected in space. These results are interpreted by the formation of a hydrogen-bonded complex that is sufficiently long-lived to undergo quantum-mechanical tunnelling to form products. We postulate that this tunnelling mechanism for the oxidation of organic molecules by OH is widespread in low-temperature interstellar environments.",2
A grossly warped nanographene and the consequences of multiple odd-membered-ring defects.,"Graphite, the most stable form of elemental carbon, consists of pure carbon sheets stacked upon one another like reams of paper. Individual sheets, known as graphene, prefer planar geometries as a consequence of the hexagonal honeycomb-like arrangements of trigonal carbon atoms that comprise their two-dimensional networks. Defects in the form of non-hexagonal rings in such networks cause distortions away from planarity. Herein we report an extreme example of this phenomenon. A 26-ring C80H30 nanographene that incorporates five seven-membered rings and one five-membered ring embedded in a hexagonal lattice was synthesized by stepwise chemical methods, isolated, purified and fully characterized spectroscopically. Its grossly warped structure was revealed by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. An independent synthetic route to a freely soluble derivative of this new type of 'nanocarbon' is also reported. Experimental data reveal how the properties of such a large graphene subunit are affected by multiple odd-membered-ring defects.",2
A frustrated-Lewis-pair approach to catalytic reduction of alkynes to cis-alkenes.,"Frustrated Lewis pairs are compounds containing both Lewis acidic and Lewis basic moieties, where the formation of an adduct is prevented by steric hindrance. They are therefore highly reactive, and have been shown to be capable of heterolysis of molecular hydrogen, a property that has led to their use in hydrogenation reactions of polarized multiple bonds. Here, we describe a general approach to the hydrogenation of alkynes to cis-alkenes under mild conditions using the unique ansa-aminohydroborane as a catalyst. Our approach combines several reactions as the elementary steps of the catalytic cycle: hydroboration (substrate binding), heterolytic hydrogen splitting (typical frustrated-Lewis-pair reactivity) and facile intramolecular protodeborylation (product release). The mechanism is verified by experimental and computational studies.",2
Ultrafast above-threshold dynamics of the radical anion of a prototypical quinone electron-acceptor.,"Quinones feature prominently as electron acceptors in nature. Their electron-transfer reactions are often highly exergonic, for which Marcus theory predicts reduced electron-transfer rates because of a free-energy barrier that occurs in the inverted region. However, the electron-transfer kinetics that involve quinones can appear barrierless. Here, we consider the intrinsic properties of the para-benzoquinone radical anion, which serves as the prototypical electron-transfer reaction product involving a quinone-based acceptor. Using time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and ab initio calculations, we show that excitation at 400 and 480 nm yields excited states that are unbound with respect to electron loss. These excited states are shown to decay on a sub-40 fs timescale through a series of conical intersections with lower-lying excited states, ultimately to form the ground anionic state and avoid autodetachment. From an isolated electron-acceptor perspective, this ultrafast stabilization mechanism accounts for the ability of para-benzoquinone to capture and retain electrons.",2
A pentagonal cyanostar macrocycle with cyanostilbene CH donors binds anions and forms dialkylphosphate [3]rotaxanes.,"Since the discovery of crown ethers, macrocycles have been recognized as powerful platforms for supramolecular chemistry. Although their numbers and variations are now legion, macrocycles that are simple to make using high-yielding reactions in one pot and on the multigram scale are rare. Here we present such a discovery obtained during the creation of a C5-symmetric cyanostilbene 'campestarene' macrocycle, cyanostar, that employs Knoevenagel condensations in the preparation of its cyanostilbene repeat unit. In the solid state, cyanostars form pi-stacked dimers constituted of chiral P and M enantiomers. The electropositive central cavity stabilizes anions with CH hydrogen-bonding units that are activated by electron-withdrawing cyano groups. In solution, the cyanostar shows high-affinity binding as 2:1 sandwich complexes, log beta2 approximately 12 and DeltaG approximately -70 kJ mol(-1), of large anions (BF4(-), ClO4(-) and PF6(-)) usually considered weakly coordinating. The cyanostar's size preference allowed formation of an unprecedented [3]rotaxane templated around a dialkylphosphate.",2
Stabilization of anti-aromatic and strained five-membered rings with a transition metal.,"Anti-aromatic compounds, as well as small cyclic alkynes or carbynes, are particularly challenging synthetic goals. The combination of their destabilizing features hinders attempts to prepare molecules such as pentalyne, an 8pi-electron anti-aromatic bicycle with extremely high ring strain. Here we describe the facile synthesis of osmapentalyne derivatives that are thermally viable, despite containing the smallest angles observed so far at a carbyne carbon. The compounds are characterized using X-ray crystallography, and their computed energies and magnetic properties reveal aromatic character. Hence, the incorporation of the osmium centre not only reduces the ring strain of the parent pentalyne, but also converts its Huckel anti-aromaticity into Craig-type Mobius aromaticity in the metallapentalynes. The concept of aromaticity is thus extended to five-membered rings containing a metal-carbon triple bond. Moreover, these metal-aromatic compounds exhibit unusual optical effects such as near-infrared photoluminescence with particularly large Stokes shifts, long lifetimes and aggregation enhancement.",2
"A dendritic single-molecule fluorescent probe that is monovalent, photostable and minimally blinking.","Single-molecule fluorescence techniques have emerged as a powerful approach to understanding complex biological systems. However, a challenge researchers still face is the limited photostability of nearly all organic fluorophores, including the cyanine and Alexa dyes. We report a new, monovalent probe that emits in the far-red region of the visible spectrum with properties desirable for single-molecule optical imaging. This probe is based on a ring-fused boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) core that is conjugated to a polyglycerol dendrimer (PGD). The dendrimer makes the hydrophobic fluorophore water-soluble. This probe exhibits excellent brightness, with an emission maximum of 705 nm. We have observed strikingly long and stable emission from individual PGD-BODIPY probes, even in the absence of anti-fading agents such as Trolox, a combined oxidizing-reducing agent often used in single-molecule studies for improving the photostability of common imaging probes. These interesting properties greatly simplify use of the fluorophore.",2
The Janus-faced role of external forces in mechanochemical disulfide bond cleavage.,"Recent force microscopy measurements on the mechanically activated cleavage of a protein disulfide bond through reaction with hydroxide ions revealed that for forces greater than 0.5 nN, the acceleration of the reaction rate is substantially reduced. Here, using ab initio simulations, we trace this 'reactivity switch' back to a dual role played by the mechanical force, which leads to antagonistic effects. On the one hand, the force performs work on the system, and thereby accelerates the reaction. On the other hand, the force also induces a conformational distortion that involves the S-S-C-C dihedral angle, which drives the disulfide into a conformation that is shielded against nucleophilic attack because of steric hindrance. The discovery of force-induced conformational changes that steer chemical reactivity provides a new key concept that is expected to be relevant beyond this specific case, for example in understanding how 'disulfide switches' regulate protein function and for the rational design of mechanoresponsive materials.",2
Total synthesis of the Daphniphyllum alkaloid daphenylline.,"The Daphniphyllum alkaloids are a large class of natural products isolated from a genus of evergreen plants widely used in Chinese herbal medicine. They display a remarkable range of biological activities, including anticancer, antioxidant, and vasorelaxation properties as well as elevation of nerve growth factor. Daphenylline is a structurally unique member among the predominately aliphatic Daphniphyllum alkaloids, and contains a tetrasubstituted arene moiety mounted on a sterically compact hexacyclic scaffold. Herein, we describe the first total synthesis of daphenylline. A gold-catalysed 6-exo-dig cyclization reaction and a subsequent intramolecular Michael addition reaction, inspired by Dixon's seminal work, were exploited to construct the bridged 6,6,5-tricyclic motif of the natural product at an early stage, and the aromatic moiety was forged through a photoinduced olefin isomerization/6pi-electrocyclization cascade followed by an oxidative aromatization process.",2
Magnetic relaxation pathways in lanthanide single-molecule magnets.,"Single-molecule magnets are compounds that exhibit magnetic bistability caused by an energy barrier for the reversal of magnetization (relaxation). Lanthanide compounds are proving promising as single-molecule magnets: recent studies show that terbium phthalocyanine complexes possess large energy barriers, and dysprosium and terbium complexes bridged by an N2(3-) radical ligand exhibit magnetic hysteresis up to 13 K. Magnetic relaxation is typically controlled by single-ion factors rather than magnetic exchange (whether one or more 4f ions are present) and proceeds through thermal relaxation of the lowest excited states. Here we report polylanthanide alkoxide cage complexes, and their doped diamagnetic yttrium analogues, in which competing relaxation pathways are observed and relaxation through the first excited state can be quenched. This leads to energy barriers for relaxation of magnetization that exceed 800 K. We investigated the factors at the lanthanide sites that govern this behaviour.",2
Direct catalytic cross-coupling of organolithium compounds.,"Catalytic carbon-carbon bond formation based on cross-coupling reactions plays a central role in the production of natural products, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and organic materials. Coupling reactions of a variety of organometallic reagents and organic halides have changed the face of modern synthetic chemistry. However, the high reactivity and poor selectivity of common organolithium reagents have largely prohibited their use as a viable partner in direct catalytic cross-coupling. Here we report that in the presence of a Pd-phosphine catalyst, a wide range of alkyl-, aryl- and heteroaryl-lithium reagents undergo selective cross-coupling with aryl- and alkenyl-bromides. The process proceeds quickly under mild conditions (room temperature) and avoids the notorious lithium halogen exchange and homocoupling. The preparation of key alkyl-, aryl- and heterobiaryl intermediates reported here highlights the potential of these cross-coupling reactions for medicinal chemistry and material science.",2
Entangled quantum electronic wavefunctions of the Mn(4)CaO(5) cluster in photosystem II.,"It is a long-standing goal to understand the reaction mechanisms of catalytic metalloenzymes at an entangled many-electron level, but this is hampered by the exponential complexity of quantum mechanics. Here, by exploiting the special structure of physical quantum states and using the density matrix renormalization group, we compute near-exact many-electron wavefunctions of the Mn4CaO5 cluster of photosystem II, with more than 1 x 10(18) quantum degrees of freedom. This is the first treatment of photosystem II beyond the single-electron picture of density functional theory. Our calculations support recent modifications to the structure determined by X-ray crystallography. We further identify multiple low-lying energy surfaces associated with the structural distortion seen using X-ray crystallography, highlighting multistate reactivity in the chemistry of the cluster. Direct determination of Mn spin-projections from our wavefunctions suggests that current candidates that have been recently distinguished using parameterized spin models should be reassessed. Through entanglement maps, we reveal rich information contained in the wavefunctions on bonding changes in the cycle.",2
Single-molecule interrogation of a bacterial sugar transporter allows the discovery of an extracellular inhibitor.,"Capsular polysaccharides form the outermost protective layer around many Gram-negative bacteria. Antibiotics aimed directly at weakening this layer are not yet available. In pathogenic Escherichia coli E69, a protein, Wza, forms a pore in the outer membrane that transports K30 capsular polysaccharide from its site of synthesis to the outside of the cell. This therefore represents a prospective antibiotic target. Here we test a variety of grommet-like mimics of K30 capsular polysaccharide on wild-type Wza and on mutant open forms of the pore by electrical recording in planar lipid bilayers. The most effective glycomimetic was the unnatural cyclic octasaccharide octakis(6-deoxy-6-amino)cyclomaltooctaose (am8gammaCD), which blocks the alpha-helix barrel of Wza, a site that is directly accessible from the external medium. This glycomimetic inhibited K30 polysaccharide transport in live E. coli E69. With the protective outer membrane disrupted, the bacteria can be recognized and killed by the human immune system.",2
A family of zeolites with controlled pore size prepared using a top-down method.,"The properties of zeolites, and thus their suitability for different applications, are intimately connected with their structures. Synthesizing specific architectures is therefore important, but has remained challenging. Here we report a top-down strategy that involves the disassembly of a parent zeolite, UTL, and its reassembly into two zeolites with targeted topologies, IPC-2 and IPC-4. The three zeolites are closely related as they adopt the same layered structure, and they differ only in how the layers are connected. Choosing different linkers gives rise to different pore sizes, enabling the synthesis of materials with predetermined pore architectures. The structures of the resulting zeolites were characterized by interpreting the X-ray powder-diffraction patterns through models using computational methods; IPC-2 exhibits orthogonal 12- and ten-ring channels, and IPC-4 is a more complex zeolite that comprises orthogonal ten- and eight-ring channels. We describe how this method enables the preparation of functional materials and discuss its potential for targeting other new zeolites.",2
Detection of different oxidation states of individual manganese porphyrins during their reaction with oxygen at a solid/liquid interface.,"Manganese porphyrins have been extensively investigated as model systems for the natural enzyme cytochrome P450 and as synthetic oxidation catalysts. Here, we report single-molecule studies of the multistep reaction of manganese porphyrins with molecular oxygen at a solid/liquid interface, using a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) under environmental control. The high lateral resolution of the STM, in combination with its sensitivity to subtle differences in the electronic properties of molecules, allowed the detection of at least four distinct reaction species. Real-space and real-time imaging of reaction dynamics enabled the observation of active sites, immobile on the experimental timescale. Conversions between the different species could be tuned by the composition of the atmosphere (argon, air or oxygen) and the surface bias voltage. By means of extensive comparison of the results to those obtained by analogous solution-based chemistry, we assigned the observed species to the starting compound, reaction intermediates and products.",2
Biomolecular robotics for chemomechanically driven guest delivery fuelled by intracellular ATP.,"The development of nanocarriers that selectively release guest molecules on sensing a particular biological signal is being actively pursued in nanomedicine for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Here we report a protein-based nanocarrier that opens in the presence of intracellular adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP). The nanocarrier consists of multiple barrel-shaped chaperonin units assembled through coordination with Mg(2+) into a tubular structure that protects guest molecules against biological degradation. When its surface is functionalized with a boronic acid derivative, the nanocarrier is able to enter cells. The hydrolysis of intracellular ATP into adenosine-5'-diphosphate (ADP) induces conformational changes of the chaperonin units, which in turns generate a mechanical force that leads to the disassembly of the tube and release of the guests. This scission occurs with a sigmoidal dependence on ATP concentration, which means that the nanocarrier can differentiate biological environments in terms of the concentration of ATP for selective guest release. Furthermore, biodistribution tests reveal preferential accumulation of the nanocarriers in a tumour tissue.",2
Stereoretentive Pd-catalysed Stille cross-coupling reactions of secondary alkyl azastannatranes and aryl halides.,"The development of transition metal-catalysed cross-coupling reactions has greatly influenced the manner in which the synthesis of complex organic molecules is approached. A wide variety of methods are now available for the formation of C(sp(2))-C(sp(2)) bonds, and more recent work has focused on the use of C(sp(3)) electrophiles and nucleophiles. The use of secondary and tertiary alkyl nucleophiles in cross-coupling reactions remains a challenge because of the propensity of these alkyl groups to isomerize under the reaction conditions. Here, we report the development of a general Pd-catalysed process for the stereoretentive cross-coupling of secondary alkyl azastannatrane nucleophiles with aryl chlorides, bromides, iodides and triflates. Coupling partners with a wide range of electronic characteristics are well tolerated. The reaction occurs with minimal isomerization of the secondary alkyltin nucleophile, and with retention of absolute configuration. This process constitutes the first general method to use secondary alkyltin reagents in cross-coupling reactions.",2
Direct probe of spectral inhomogeneity reveals synthetic tunability of single-nanocrystal spectral linewidths.,"The spectral linewidth of an ensemble of fluorescent emitters is dictated by the combination of single-emitter linewidths and sample inhomogeneity. For semiconductor nanocrystals, efforts to tune ensemble linewidths for optical applications have focused primarily on eliminating sample inhomogeneities, because conventional single-molecule methods cannot reliably build accurate ensemble-level statistics for single-particle linewidths. Photon-correlation Fourier spectroscopy in solution (S-PCFS) offers a unique approach to investigating single-nanocrystal spectra with large sample statistics and high signal-to-noise ratios, without user selection bias and at fast timescales. With S-PCFS, we directly and quantitatively deconstruct the ensemble linewidth into contributions from the average single-particle linewidth and from sample inhomogeneity. We demonstrate that single-particle linewidths vary significantly from batch to batch and can be synthetically controlled. These findings delineate the synthetic challenges facing underdeveloped nanomaterials such as InP and InAs core-shell particles and introduce new avenues for the synthetic optimization of fluorescent nanoparticles.",2
A robustness screen for the rapid assessment of chemical reactions.,"In contrast to the rapidity with which scientific information is published, the application of new knowledge often remains slow, and we believe this to be particularly true of newly developed synthetic organic chemistry methodology. Consequently, methods to assess and identify robust chemical reactions are desirable, and would directly facilitate the application of newly reported synthetic methodology to complex synthetic problems. Here, we describe a simple process for assessing the likely scope and limitations of a chemical reaction beyond the idealized reaction conditions initially reported. Using simple methods and common analytical techniques we demonstrate a rapid assessment of an established chemical reaction, and also propose a simplified analysis that may be reported alongside new synthetic methodology.",2
"On the nature and origin of dicationic, charge-separated species formed in liquid water on X-ray irradiation.","To understand the yield and patterns of damage in aqueous condensed matter, including biological systems, it is essential to identify the initial products subsequent to the interaction of high-energy radiation with liquid water. Until now, the observation of several fast reactions induced by energetic particles in water was not possible on their characteristic timescales. Therefore, some of the reaction intermediates involved, particularly those that require nuclear motion, were not considered when describing radiation chemistry. Here, through a combined experimental and theoretical study, we elucidate the ultrafast proton dynamics in the first few femtoseconds after X-ray core-level ionization of liquid water. We show through isotope analysis of the Auger spectra that proton-transfer dynamics occur on the same timescale as electron autoionization. Proton transfer leads to the formation of a Zundel-type intermediate [HO*...H...H2O](+), which further ionizes to form a so-far unnoticed type of dicationic charge-separated species with high internal energy. We call the process proton-transfer mediated charge separation.",2
Sustained gastrointestinal activity of dendronized polymer-enzyme conjugates.,"Methods to stabilize and retain enzyme activity in the gastrointestinal tract are investigated rarely because of the difficulty of protecting proteins from an environment that has evolved to promote their digestion. Preventing the degradation of enzymes under these conditions, however, is critical for the development of new protein-based oral therapies. Here we show that covalent conjugation to polymers can stabilize orally administered therapeutic enzymes at different locations in the gastrointestinal tract. Architecturally and functionally diverse polymers are used to protect enzymes sterically from inactivation and to promote interactions with mucin on the stomach wall. Using this approach the in vivo activity of enzymes can be sustained for several hours in the stomach and/or in the small intestine. These findings provide new insight and a firm basis for the development of new therapeutic and imaging strategies based on orally administered proteins using a simple and accessible technology.",2
Magnetic blocking in a linear iron(I) complex.,"Single-molecule magnets that contain one spin centre may represent the smallest possible unit for spin-based computational devices. Such applications, however, require the realization of molecules with a substantial energy barrier for spin inversion, achieved through a large axial magnetic anisotropy. Recently, significant progress has been made in this regard by using lanthanide centres such as terbium(III) and dysprosium(III), whose anisotropy can lead to extremely high relaxation barriers. We contend that similar effects should be achievable with transition metals by maintaining a low coordination number to restrict the magnitude of the d-orbital ligand-field splitting energy (which tends to hinder the development of large anisotropies). Herein we report the first two-coordinate complex of iron(I), [Fe(C(SiMe3)3)2](-), for which alternating current magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal slow magnetic relaxation below 29 K in a zero applied direct-current field. This S = complex exhibits an effective spin-reversal barrier of Ueff = 226(4) cm(-1), the largest yet observed for a single-molecule magnet based on a transition metal, and displays magnetic blocking below 4.5 K.",2
Initiation of carbon nanotube growth by well-defined carbon nanorings.,"Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), tubular molecular entities that consist of sp(2)-hybridized carbon atoms, are currently produced as mixtures that contain tubes of various diameters and different sidewall structures. The electronic and optical properties of CNTs are determined by their diameters and sidewall structures and so a controlled synthesis of uniform-diameter, single-chirality CNTs-a significant chemical challenge-would provide access to pure samples with predictable properties. Here we report a rational bottom-up approach to synthesize structurally uniform CNTs using carbon nanorings (cycloparaphenylenes) as templates and ethanol as the carbon source. The average diameter of the CNTs formed is close to that of the carbon nanorings used, which supports the operation of a 'growth-from-template' mechanism in CNT formation. This bottom-up organic chemistry approach is intrinsically different from other conventional approaches to making CNTs and, if it can be optimized sufficiently, offers a route to the programmable synthesis of structurally uniform CNTs.",2
Studying the role of protein dynamics in an SN2 enzyme reaction using free-energy surfaces and solvent coordinates.,"Conformational changes are known to be able to drive an enzyme through its catalytic cycle, allowing, for example, substrate binding or product release. However, the influence of protein motions on the chemical step is a controversial issue. One proposal is that the simple equilibrium fluctuations incorporated into transition-state theory are insufficient to account for the catalytic effect of enzymes and that protein motions should be treated dynamically. Here, we propose the use of free-energy surfaces, obtained as a function of both a chemical coordinate and an environmental coordinate, as an efficient way to elucidate the role of protein structure and motions during the reaction. We show that the structure of the protein provides an adequate environment for the progress of the reaction, although a certain degree of flexibility is needed to attain the full catalytic effect. However, these motions do not introduce significant dynamical corrections to the rate constant and can be described as equilibrium fluctuations.",2
Recent developments in the homogeneous reduction of dinitrogen by molybdenum and iron.,"The reduction of gaseous nitrogen is a challenge for industrial, biological and synthetic chemists. Major goals include understanding the formation of ammonia for agriculture, and forming N-C and N-Si bonds for the synthesis of fine chemicals. The iron-molybdenum active site of the enzyme nitrogenase has inspired chemists to explore iron and molybdenum complexes in transformations related to N2 reduction. This area of research has gained significant momentum, and the past two years have witnessed a number of significant advances in synthetic Fe-N2 and Mo-N2 chemistry. Furthermore, the identities of all atoms in the iron-molybdenum cofactor of nitrogenase have finally been elucidated, and the discovery of a carbide has generated new questions and targets for coordination chemists. This Perspective summarizes the recent work on iron and molydenum complexes, and highlights the opportunities for continued research.",2
Heterogenized cobalt oxide catalysts for nitroarene reduction by pyrolysis of molecularly defined complexes.,"Molecularly well-defined homogeneous catalysts are known for a wide variety of chemical transformations. The effect of small changes in molecular structure can be studied in detail and used to optimize many processes. However, many industrial processes require heterogeneous catalysts because of their stability, ease of separation and recyclability, but these are more difficult to control on a molecular level. Here, we describe the conversion of homogeneous cobalt complexes into heterogeneous cobalt oxide catalysts via immobilization and pyrolysis on activated carbon. The catalysts thus produced are useful for the industrially important reduction of nitroarenes to anilines. The ligand indirectly controls the selectivity and activity of the recyclable catalyst and catalyst optimization can be performed at the level of the solution-phase precursor before conversion into the active heterogeneous catalyst.",2
Electrostatically gated membrane permeability in inorganic protocells.,"Although several strategies are now available to produce functional microcompartments analogous to primitive cell-like structures, little progress has been made in generating protocell constructs with self-controlled membrane permeability. Here we describe the preparation of water-dispersible colloidosomes based on silica nanoparticles and delineated by a continuous semipermeable inorganic membrane capable of self-activated, electrostatically gated permeability. We use crosslinking and covalent grafting of a pH-responsive copolymer to generate an ultrathin elastic membrane that exhibits selective release and uptake of small molecules. This behaviour, which depends on the charge of the copolymer coronal layer, serves to trigger enzymatic dephosphorylation reactions specifically within the protocell aqueous interior. This system represents a step towards the design and construction of alternative types of artificial chemical cells and protocell models based on spontaneous processes of inorganic self-organization.",2
RNA with iron(II) as a cofactor catalyses electron transfer.,"Mg(2+) is essential for RNA folding and catalysis. However, for the first 1.5 billion years of life on Earth RNA inhabited an anoxic Earth with abundant and benign Fe(2+). We hypothesize that Fe(2+) was an RNA cofactor when iron was abundant, and was substantially replaced by Mg(2+) during a period known as the 'great oxidation', brought on by photosynthesis. Here, we demonstrate that reversing this putative metal substitution in an anoxic environment, by removing Mg(2+) and replacing it with Fe(2+), expands the catalytic repertoire of RNA. Fe(2+) can confer on some RNAs a previously uncharacterized ability to catalyse single-electron transfer. We propose that RNA function, in analogy with protein function, can be understood fully only in the context of association with a range of possible metals. The catalysis of electron transfer, requisite for metabolic activity, may have been attenuated in RNA by photosynthesis and the rise of O2.",2
The use of elemental sulfur as an alternative feedstock for polymeric materials.,"An excess of elemental sulfur is generated annually from hydrodesulfurization in petroleum refining processes; however, it has a limited number of uses, of which one example is the production of sulfuric acid. Despite this excess, the development of synthetic and processing methods to convert elemental sulfur into useful chemical substances has not been investigated widely. Here we report a facile method (termed 'inverse vulcanization') to prepare chemically stable and processable polymeric materials through the direct copolymerization of elemental sulfur with vinylic monomers. This methodology enabled the modification of sulfur into processable copolymer forms with tunable thermomechanical properties, which leads to well-defined sulfur-rich micropatterned films created by imprint lithography. We also demonstrate that these copolymers exhibit comparable electrochemical properties to elemental sulfur and could serve as the active material in Li-S batteries, exhibiting high specific capacity (823 mA h g(-1) at 100 cycles) and enhanced capacity retention.",2
Simultaneous structure-activity studies and arming of natural products by C-H amination reveal cellular targets of eupalmerin acetate.,"Natural products have a venerable history of, and enduring potential for the discovery of useful biological activity. To fully exploit this, the development of chemical methodology that can functionalize unique sites within these complex structures is highly desirable. Here, we describe the use of rhodium(II)-catalysed C-H amination reactions developed by Du Bois to carry out simultaneous structure-activity relationship studies and arming (alkynylation) of natural products at 'unfunctionalized' positions. Allylic and benzylic C-H bonds in the natural products undergo amination while olefins undergo aziridination, and tertiary amine-containing natural products are converted to amidines by a C-H amination-oxidation sequence or to hydrazine sulfamate zwitterions by an unusual N-amination. The alkynylated derivatives are ready for conversion into cellular probes that can be used for mechanism-of-action studies. Chemo- and site-selectivity was studied with a diverse library of natural products. For one of these-the marine-derived anticancer diterpene, eupalmerin acetate-quantitative proteome profiling led to the identification of several protein targets in HL-60 cells, suggesting a polypharmacological mode of action.",2
Probing the biophysical interplay between a viral genome and its capsid.,"The interaction between a viral capsid and its genome governs crucial steps in the life cycle of a virus, such as assembly and genome uncoating. Tuning cargo-capsid interactions is also essential for successful design and cargo delivery in engineered viral systems. Here we investigate the interplay between cargo and capsid for the picorna-like Triatoma virus using a combined native mass spectrometry and atomic force microscopy approach. We propose a topology and assembly model in which heterotrimeric pentons that consist of five copies of structural proteins VP1, VP2 and VP3 are the free principal units of assembly. The interpenton contacts are established primarily by VP2. The dual role of the genome is first to stabilize the densely packed virion and, second, on an increase in pH to trigger uncoating by relaxing the stabilizing interactions with the capsid. Uncoating occurs through a labile intermediate state of the virion that reversibly disassembles into pentons with the concomitant release of protein VP4.",2
Competition between model protocells driven by an encapsulated catalyst.,"The advent of Darwinian evolution required the emergence of molecular mechanisms for the heritable variation of fitness. One model for such a system involves competing protocell populations, each consisting of a replicating genetic polymer within a replicating vesicle. In this model, each genetic polymer imparts a selective advantage to its protocell by, for example, coding for a catalyst that generates a useful metabolite. Here, we report a partial model of such nascent evolutionary traits in a system that consists of fatty-acid vesicles containing a dipeptide catalyst, which catalyses the formation of a second dipeptide. The newly formed dipeptide binds to vesicle membranes, which imparts enhanced affinity for fatty acids and thus promotes vesicle growth. The catalysed dipeptide synthesis proceeds with higher efficiency in vesicles than in free solution, which further enhances fitness. Our observations suggest that, in a replicating protocell with an RNA genome, ribozyme-catalysed peptide synthesis might have been sufficient to initiate Darwinian evolution.",2
Charging a Li-O(2) battery using a redox mediator.,"The non-aqueous Li-air (O2) battery is receiving intense interest because its theoretical specific energy exceeds that of Li-ion batteries. Recharging the Li-O2 battery depends on oxidizing solid lithium peroxide (Li2O2), which is formed on discharge within the porous cathode. However, transporting charge between Li2O2 particles and the solid electrode surface is at best very difficult and leads to voltage polarization on charging, even at modest rates. This is a significant problem facing the non-aqueous Li-O2 battery. Here we show that incorporation of a redox mediator, tetrathiafulvalene (TTF), enables recharging at rates that are impossible for the cell in the absence of the mediator. On charging, TTF is oxidized to TTF(+) at the cathode surface; TTF(+) in turn oxidizes the solid Li2O2, which results in the regeneration of TTF. The mediator acts as an electron-hole transfer agent that permits efficient oxidation of solid Li2O2. The cell with the mediator demonstrated 100 charge/discharge cycles.",2
Isolation and characterization of a uranium(VI)-nitride triple bond.,"The nature and extent of covalency in uranium bonding is still unclear compared with that of transition metals, and there is great interest in studying uranium-ligand multiple bonds. Although U=O and U=NR double bonds (where R is an alkyl group) are well-known analogues to transition-metal oxo and imido complexes, the uranium(VI)-nitride triple bond has long remained a synthetic target in actinide chemistry. Here, we report the preparation of a uranium(VI)-nitride triple bond. We highlight the importance of (1) ancillary ligand design, (2) employing mild redox reactions instead of harsh photochemical methods that decompose transiently formed uranium(VI) nitrides, (3) an electrostatically stabilizing sodium ion during nitride installation, (4) selecting the right sodium sequestering reagent, (5) inner versus outer sphere oxidation and (6) stability with respect to the uranium oxidation state. Computational analyses suggest covalent contributions to U identical withN triple bonds that are surprisingly comparable to those of their group 6 transition-metal nitride counterparts.",2
Switching radical stability by pH-induced orbital conversion.,"In most radicals the singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) is the highest-energy occupied molecular orbital (HOMO); however, in a small number of reported compounds this is not the case. In the present work we expand significantly the scope of this phenomenon, known as SOMO-HOMO energy-level conversion, by showing that it occurs in virtually any distonic radical anion that contains a sufficiently stabilized radical (aminoxyl, peroxyl, aminyl) non-pi-conjugated with a negative charge (carboxylate, phosphate, sulfate). Moreover, regular orbital order is restored on protonation of the anionic fragment, and hence the orbital configuration can be switched by pH. Most importantly, our theoretical and experimental results reveal a dramatically higher radical stability and proton acidity of such distonic radical anions. Changing radical stability by 3-4 orders of magnitude using pH-induced orbital conversion opens a variety of attractive industrial applications, including pH-switchable nitroxide-mediated polymerization, and it might be exploited in nature.",2
Competition of shape and interaction patchiness for self-assembling nanoplates.,"Progress in nanocrystal synthesis and self-assembly enables the formation of highly ordered superlattices. Recent studies focused on spherical particles with tunable attraction and polyhedral particles with anisotropic shape, and excluded volume repulsion, but the effects of shape on particle interaction are only starting to be exploited. Here we present a joint experimental-computational multiscale investigation of a class of highly faceted planar lanthanide fluoride nanocrystals (nanoplates, nanoplatelets). The nanoplates self-assemble into long-range ordered tilings at the liquid-air interface formed by a hexane wetting layer. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we demonstrate that their assembly can be understood from maximization of packing density only in a first approximation. Explaining the full phase behaviour requires an understanding of nanoplate-edge interactions, which originate from the atomic structure, as confirmed by density functional theory calculations. Despite the apparent simplicity in particle geometry, the combination of shape-induced entropic and edge-specific energetic effects directs the formation and stabilization of unconventional long-range ordered assemblies not attainable otherwise.",2
Rationally synthesized two-dimensional polymers.,"Synthetic polymers exhibit diverse and useful properties and influence most aspects of modern life. Many polymerization methods provide linear or branched macromolecules, frequently with outstanding functional-group tolerance and molecular weight control. In contrast, extending polymerization strategies to two-dimensional periodic structures is in its infancy, and successful examples have emerged only recently through molecular framework, surface science and crystal engineering approaches. In this Review, we describe successful 2D polymerization strategies, as well as seminal research that inspired their development. These methods include the synthesis of 2D covalent organic frameworks as layered crystals and thin films, surface-mediated polymerization of polyfunctional monomers, and solid-state topochemical polymerizations. Early application targets of 2D polymers include gas separation and storage, optoelectronic devices and membranes, each of which might benefit from predictable long-range molecular organization inherent to this macromolecular architecture.",2
Catalytic control over supramolecular gel formation.,"Low-molecular-weight gels show great potential for application in fields ranging from the petrochemical industry to healthcare and tissue engineering. These supramolecular gels are often metastable materials, which implies that their properties are, at least partially, kinetically controlled. Here we show how the mechanical properties and structure of these materials can be controlled directly by catalytic action. We show how in situ catalysis of the formation of gelator molecules can be used to accelerate the formation of supramolecular hydrogels, which drastically enhances their resulting mechanical properties. Using acid or nucleophilic aniline catalysis, it is possible to make supramolecular hydrogels with tunable gel-strength in a matter of minutes, under ambient conditions, starting from simple soluble building blocks. By changing the rate of formation of the gelator molecules using a catalyst, the overall rate of gelation and the resulting gel morphology are affected, which provides access to metastable gel states with improved mechanical strength and appearance despite an identical gelator composition.",2
The hydrodeoxygenation of bioderived furans into alkanes.,"The conversion of biomass into fuels and chemical feedstocks is one part of a drive to reduce the world's dependence on crude oil. For transportation fuels in particular, wholesale replacement of a fuel is logistically problematic, not least because of the infrastructure that is already in place. Here, we describe the catalytic defunctionalization of a series of biomass-derived molecules to provide linear alkanes suitable for use as transportation fuels. These biomass-derived molecules contain a variety of functional groups, including olefins, furan rings and carbonyl groups. We describe the removal of these in either a stepwise process or a one-pot process using common reagents and catalysts under mild reaction conditions to provide n-alkanes in good yields and with high selectivities. Our general synthetic approach is applicable to a range of precursors with different carbon content (chain length). This allows the selective generation of linear alkanes with carbon chain lengths between eight and sixteen carbons.",2
Label-assisted mass spectrometry for the acceleration of reaction discovery and optimization.,"The identification of new reactions expands our knowledge of chemical reactivity and enables new synthetic applications. Accelerating the pace of this discovery process remains challenging. We describe a highly effective and simple platform for screening a large number of potential chemical reactions in order to discover and optimize previously unknown catalytic transformations, thereby revealing new chemical reactivity. Our strategy is based on labelling one of the reactants with a polyaromatic chemical tag, which selectively undergoes a photoionization/desorption process upon laser irradiation, without the assistance of an external matrix, and enables rapid mass spectrometric detection of any products originating from such labelled reactants in complex reaction mixtures without any chromatographic separation. This method was successfully used for high-throughput discovery and subsequent optimization of two previously unknown benzannulation reactions.",2
The essential role of charge-shift bonding in hypervalent prototype XeF(2).,"Hypervalency in XeF(2) and isoelectronic complexes is generally understood in terms of the Rundle-Pimentel model (which invokes a three-centre/four-electron molecular system) or its valence bond version as proposed by Coulson, which replaced the old expanded octet model of Pauling. However, the Rundle-Pimentel model is not always successful in describing such complexes and has been shown to be oversimplified. Here using ab initio valence bond theory coupled to quantum Monte Carlo methods, we show that the Rundle-Pimentel model is insufficient by itself in accounting for the great stability of XeF(2), and that charge-shift bonding, wherein the large covalent-ionic interaction energy has the dominant role, is a major stabilizing factor. The energetic contribution of the old expanded octet model is also quantified and shown to be marginal. Generalizing to isoelectronic systems such as ClF(3), SF(4), PCl(5) and others, it is suggested that charge-shift bonding is necessary, in association with the Rundle-Pimentel model, for hypervalent analogues of XeF(2) to be strongly bonded.",2
Enantioselective synthesis of tatanans A-C and reinvestigation of their glucokinase-activating properties.,"The tatanans are members of a novel class of complex sesquilignan natural products recently isolated from the rhizomes of Acorus tatarinowii Schott plants. Tatanans A, B and C have previously been reported to have potent glucokinase-activating properties that exceed the in vitro activity of known synthetic antidiabetic agents. Here, using a series of sequential [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangements, we report the total synthesis of tatanan A in 13 steps and 13% overall yield. We also complete a concise enantioselective total synthesis of more complex, atropisomeric tatanans B and C via a distinct convergent strategy based on a palladium-catalysed diastereotopic aromatic group differentiation (12 steps, 4% and 8% overall yield, respectively). A plausible biosynthetic relationship between acyclic tatanan A and spirocyclic tatanans B and C is proposed and probed experimentally. With sufficient quantities of the natural products in hand, we undertake a detailed functional characterization of the biological activities of tatanans A-C. Contrary to previous reports, our assays utilizing pure recombinant human enzyme demonstrate that tatanans do not function as allosteric activators of glucokinase.",2
Decoupling hydrogen and oxygen evolution during electrolytic water splitting using an electron-coupled-proton buffer.,"Hydrogen is essential to several key industrial processes and could play a major role as an energy carrier in a future 'hydrogen economy'. Although the majority of the world's hydrogen supply currently comes from the reformation of fossil fuels, its generation from water using renewables-generated power could provide a hydrogen source without increasing atmospheric CO(2) levels. Conventional water electrolysis produces H(2) and O(2) simultaneously, such that these gases must be generated in separate spaces to prevent their mixing. Herein, using the polyoxometalate H(3)PMo(1)(2)O(4)(0), we introduce the concept of the electron-coupled-proton buffer (ECPB), whereby O(2) and H(2) can be produced at separate times during water electrolysis. This could have advantages in preventing gas mixing in the headspaces of high-pressure electrolysis cells, with implications for safety and electrolyser degradation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that temporally separated O(2) and H(2) production allows greater flexibility regarding the membranes and electrodes that can be used in water-splitting cells.",2
Single-nanoparticle phase transitions visualized by four-dimensional electron microscopy.,"The advancement of techniques that can probe the behaviour of individual nanoscopic objects is of paramount importance in various disciplines, including photonics and electronics. As it provides images with a spatiotemporal resolution, four-dimensional electron microscopy, in principle, should enable the visualization of single-nanoparticle structural dynamics in real and reciprocal space. Here, we demonstrate the selectivity and sensitivity of the technique by visualizing the spin crossover dynamics of single, isolated metal-organic framework nanocrystals. By introducing a small aperture in the microscope, it was possible to follow the phase transition and the associated structural dynamics within a single particle. Its behaviour was observed to be distinct from that imaged by averaging over ensembles of heterogeneous nanoparticles. The approach reported here has potential applications in other nanosystems and those that undergo (bio)chemical transformations.",2
Functional RNAs exhibit tolerance for non-heritable 2'-5' versus 3'-5' backbone heterogeneity.,"A plausible process for non-enzymatic RNA replication would greatly simplify models of the transition from prebiotic chemistry to simple biology. However, all known conditions for the chemical copying of an RNA template result in the synthesis of a complementary strand that contains a mixture of 2'-5' and 3'-5' linkages, rather than the selective synthesis of only 3'-5' linkages as found in contemporary RNA. Here we show that such backbone heterogeneity is compatible with RNA folding into defined three-dimensional structures that retain molecular recognition and catalytic properties and, therefore, would not prevent the evolution of functional RNAs such as ribozymes. Moreover, the same backbone heterogeneity lowers the melting temperature of RNA duplexes that would otherwise be too stable for thermal strand separation. By allowing copied strands to dissociate, this heterogeneity may have been one of the essential features that allowed RNA to emerge as the first biopolymer.",2
Prebiotically plausible oligoribonucleotide ligation facilitated by chemoselective acetylation.,"The recent synthesis of pyrimidine ribonucleoside-2',3'-cyclic phosphates under prebiotically plausible conditions has strengthened the case for the involvement of ribonucleic acid (RNA) at an early stage in the origin of life. However, a prebiotic conversion of these weakly activated monomers, and their purine counterparts, to the 3',5'-linked RNA polymers of extant biochemistry has been lacking (previous attempts led only to short oligomers with mixed linkages). Here we show that the 2'-hydroxyl group of oligoribonucleotide-3'-phosphates can be chemoselectively acetylated in water under prebiotically credible conditions, which allows rapid and efficient template-directed ligation. The 2'-O-acetyl group at the ligation junction of the product RNA strand can be removed under conditions that leave the internucleotide bonds intact. Remarkably, acetylation of mixed oligomers that possess either 2'- or 3'-terminal phosphates is selective for the 2'-hydroxyl group of the latter. This newly discovered chemistry thus suggests a prebiotic route from ribonucleoside-2',3'-cyclic phosphates to predominantly 3',5'-linked RNA via partially 2'-O-acetylated RNA.",2
Chemistry inside molecular containers in the gas phase.,"Inner-phase chemical reactions of guest molecules encapsulated in a macromolecular cavity give fundamental insight into the relative stabilization of transition states by the surrounding walls of the host, thereby modelling the situation of substrates in enzymatic binding pockets. Although in solution several examples of inner-phase reactions are known, the use of cucurbiturils as macrocyclic hosts and bicyclic azoalkanes as guests has now enabled a systematic mass spectrometric investigation of inner-phase reactions in the gas phase, where typically the supply of thermal energy results in dissociation of the supramolecular host-guest assembly. The results reveal a sensitive interplay in which attractive and repulsive van der Waals interactions between the differently sized hosts and guests need to be balanced with a constrictive binding to allow thermally activated chemical reactions to compete with dissociation. The results are important for the understanding of supramolecular reactivity and have implications for catalysis.",2
C-H bond activation enables the rapid construction and late-stage diversification of functional molecules.,"The beginning of the twenty-first century has witnessed significant advances in the field of C-H bond activation, and this transformation is now an established piece in the synthetic chemists' toolbox. This methodology has the potential to be used in many different areas of chemistry, for example it provides a perfect opportunity for the late-stage diversification of various kinds of organic scaffolds, ranging from relatively small molecules like drug candidates, to complex polydisperse organic compounds such as polymers. In this way, C-H activation approaches enable relatively straightforward access to a plethora of analogues or can help to streamline the lead-optimization phase. Furthermore, synthetic pathways for the construction of complex organic materials can now be designed that are more atom- and step-economical than previous methods and, in some cases, can be based on synthetic disconnections that are just not possible without C-H activation. This Perspective highlights the potential of metal-catalysed C-H bond activation reactions, which now extend beyond the field of traditional synthetic organic chemistry.",2
A homogeneous transition metal complex for clean hydrogen production from methanol-water mixtures.,"The development of an efficient catalytic process that mimics the enzymatic function of alcohol dehydrogenase is critical for using biomass alcohols for both the production of H2 as a chemical energy carrier and fine chemicals under waste-free conditions. Dehydrogenation of alcohol-water mixtures into their corresponding acids with molecular hydrogen as the sole by-product from the reaction can be catalysed by a ruthenium complex with a chelating bis(olefin) diazadiene ligand. This complex, [K(dme)2][Ru(H)(trop2dad)], stores up to two equivalents of hydrogen intramolecularly, and catalyses the production of H2 from alcohols in the presence of water and a base under homogeneous conditions. The conversion of a MeOH-H2O mixture proceeds selectively to CO2/H2 gas formation under neutral conditions, thereby allowing the use of the entire hydrogen content (12% by weight). Isolation and characterization of the ruthenium complexes from these reactions suggested a mechanistic scenario in which the trop2dad ligand behaves as a chemically 'non-innocent' co-operative ligand.",2
Highly ordered alignment of a vinyl polymer by host-guest cross-polymerization.,"Chain alignment can significantly influence the macroscopic properties of a polymeric material, but no general and versatile methodology has yet been reported to obtain highly ordered crystalline packing of polymer chains, with high stability. Here, we disclose a strategy that relies on 'ordered crosslinks' to produce polymeric materials that exhibit a crystalline arrangement. Divinyl crosslinkers (2,5-divinyl-terephthalate) were first embedded, as substitutional ligands, into the structure of a porous coordination polymer (PCP), [Cu(terephthalate)triethylenediamine0.5]n. A representative vinyl monomer, styrene, was subsequently polymerized inside the channels of the host PCP. The polystyrene chains that form within the PCP channels also crosslink with the divinyl species. This bridges together the polymer chains of adjacent channels and ensures that, on selective removal of the PCP, the polymer chains remain aligned. Indeed, the resulting material exhibits long-range order and is stable to thermal and solvent treatments, as demonstrated by X-ray powder diffraction and transmission electron microscopy.",2
A multistep single-crystal-to-single-crystal bromodiacetylene dimerization.,"Packing constraints and precise placement of functional groups are the reason that organic molecules in the crystalline state often display unusual physical or chemical properties not observed in solution. Here we report a single-crystal-to-single-crystal dimerization of a bromodiacetylene that involves unusually large atom displacements as well as the cleavage and formation of several bonds. Density functional theory computations support a mechanism in which the dimerization is initiated by a [2 + 1] photocycloaddition favoured by the nature of carbon-carbon short contacts in the crystal structure. The reaction proceeded up to the theoretical degree of conversion without loss of crystallinity, and it was also performed on a preparative scale with good yield. Moreover, it represents the first synthetic pathway to (E)-1,2-dibromo-1,2-diethynylethenes, which could serve as synthetic intermediates for the preparation of molecular carbon scaffolds. Our findings both extend the scope of single-crystal-to-single-crystal reactions and highlight their potential as a synthetic tool for complex transformations.",2
Ammonia formation by a thiolate-bridged diiron amide complex as a nitrogenase mimic.,"Although nitrogenase enzymes routinely convert molecular nitrogen into ammonia under ambient temperature and pressure, this reaction is currently carried out industrially using the Haber-Bosch process, which requires extreme temperatures and pressures to activate dinitrogen. Biological fixation occurs through dinitrogen and reduced NxHy species at multi-iron centres of compounds bearing sulfur ligands, but it is difficult to elucidate the mechanistic details and to obtain stable model intermediate complexes for further investigation. Metal-based synthetic models have been applied to reveal partial details, although most models involve a mononuclear system. Here, we report a diiron complex bridged by a bidentate thiolate ligand that can accommodate HN=NH. Following reductions and protonations, HN=NH is converted to NH3 through pivotal intermediate complexes bridged by N2H3(-) and NH2(-) species. Notably, the final ammonia release was effected with water as the proton source. Density functional theory calculations were carried out, and a pathway of biological nitrogen fixation is proposed.",2
"Product-state-resolved dynamics of the elementary reaction of atomic oxygen with molecular hydrogen, O((3)P) + D(2) --> OD(X(2)Pi) + D.","Elementary three-atom systems provide stringent tests of the accuracy of ab initio theory. One such important reaction, O((3)P) + H2 --> OH(X(2)Pi) + H, has eluded detailed experimental study because of its high activation barrier. In this reaction, both the ground-state reactant atom and product diatomic molecule have open-shell character, which introduces the intriguing complication of non-Born-Oppenheimer effects in both the entrance and the exit channels. These effects may be probed experimentally in both the fine-structure and the Lambda-doublet splittings of the OH product. We have used laser-induced fluorescence to measure OD internal product-state distributions from the analogous reaction of O((3)P) with D2, enabled by a unique high-energy O((3)P) source. We find that the OD (nu' = 0) product is rotationally highly excited, in excellent agreement with earlier theoretical predictions. However, the distributions over the OD(X(2)Pi) fine-structure and Lambda-doublet states, diagnostic of electronic non-adiabaticity in the reaction, challenge the prevailing theoretical understanding.",2
Synthesis of 19-substituted geldanamycins with altered conformations and their binding to heat shock protein Hsp90.,"The benzoquinone ansamycin geldanamycin and its derivatives are inhibitors of heat shock protein Hsp90, an emerging target for novel therapeutic agents both in cancer and in neurodegeneration. However, the toxicity of these compounds to normal cells has been ascribed to reaction with thiol nucleophiles at the quinone 19-position. We reasoned that blocking this position would ameliorate toxicity, and that it might also enforce a favourable conformational switch of the trans-amide group into the cis-form required for protein binding. Here, we report an efficient synthesis of such 19-substituted compounds and realization of our hypotheses. Protein crystallography established that the new compounds bind to Hsp90 with, as expected, a cis-amide conformation. Studies on Hsp90 inhibition in cells demonstrated the molecular signature of Hsp90 inhibitors: decreases in client proteins with compensatory increases in other heat shock proteins in both human breast cancer and dopaminergic neural cells, demonstrating their potential for use in the therapy of cancer or neurodegenerative diseases.",2
Improving the hydrogen oxidation reaction rate by promotion of hydroxyl adsorption.,"The development of hydrogen-based energy sources as viable alternatives to fossil-fuel technologies has revolutionized clean energy production using fuel cells. However, to date, the slow rate of the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in alkaline environments has hindered advances in alkaline fuel cell systems. Here, we address this by studying the trends in the activity of the HOR in alkaline environments. We demonstrate that it can be enhanced more than fivefold compared to state-of-the-art platinum catalysts. The maximum activity is found for materials (Ir and Pt(0).(1)Ru(0).(9)) with an optimal balance between the active sites that are required for the adsorption/dissociation of H(2) and for the adsorption of hydroxyl species (OHad). We propose that the more oxophilic sites on Ir (defects) and PtRu material (Ru atoms) electrodes facilitate the adsorption of OHad species. Those then react with the hydrogen intermediates (Had) that are adsorbed on more noble surface sites.",2
Redox-inactive metals modulate the reduction potential in heterometallic manganese-oxido clusters.,"Redox-inactive metals are found in biological and heterogeneous water oxidation catalysts, but, at present, their roles in catalysis are not well understood. Here, we report a series of high-oxidation-state tetranuclear-dioxido clusters comprising three manganese centres and a redox-inactive metal (M). Crystallographic studies show an unprecedented Mn3M(micro4-O)(micro2-O) core that remains intact on changing M or the manganese oxidation state. Electrochemical studies reveal that the reduction potentials span a window of 700 mV and are dependent on the Lewis acidity of the second metal. With the pKa of the redox-inactive metal-aqua complex as a measure of Lewis acidity, these compounds demonstrate a linear dependence between reduction potential and acidity with a slope of approximately 100 mV per pKa unit. The Sr(2+) and Ca(2+) compounds show similar potentials, an observation that correlates with the behaviour of the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II, which is active only if one of these two metals is present.",2
Enzyme-free translation of DNA into sequence-defined synthetic polymers structurally unrelated to nucleic acids.,"The translation of DNA sequences into corresponding biopolymers enables the production, function and evolution of the macromolecules of life. In contrast, methods to generate sequence-defined synthetic polymers with similar levels of control have remained elusive. Here, we report the development of a DNA-templated translation system that enables the enzyme-free translation of DNA templates into sequence-defined synthetic polymers that have no necessary structural relationship with nucleic acids. We demonstrate the efficiency, sequence-specificity and generality of this translation system by oligomerizing building blocks including polyethylene glycol, alpha-(D)-peptides, and beta-peptides in a DNA-programmed manner. Sequence-defined synthetic polymers with molecular weights of 26 kDa containing 16 consecutively coupled building blocks and 90 densely functionalized beta-amino acid residues were translated from DNA templates using this strategy. We integrated the DNA-templated translation system developed here into a complete cycle of translation, coding sequence replication, template regeneration and re-translation suitable for the iterated in vitro selection of functional sequence-defined synthetic polymers unrelated in structure to nucleic acids.",2
Molecular shape sorting using molecular organic cages.,"The energy-efficient separation of chemical feedstocks is a major sustainability challenge. Porous extended frameworks such as zeolites or metal-organic frameworks are one potential solution to this problem. Here, we show that organic molecules, rather than frameworks, can separate other organic molecules by size and shape. A molecular organic cage is shown to separate a common aromatic feedstock (mesitylene) from its structural isomer (4-ethyltoluene) with an unprecedented perfect specificity for the latter. This specificity stems from the structure of the intrinsically porous cage molecule, which is itself synthesized from a derivative of mesitylene. In other words, crystalline organic molecules are used to separate other organic molecules. The specificity is defined by the cage structure alone, so this solid-state 'shape sorting' is, uniquely, mirrored for cage molecules in solution. The behaviour can be understood from a combination of atomistic simulations for individual cage molecules and solid-state molecular dynamics simulations.",2
The chemistry of two-dimensional layered transition metal dichalcogenide nanosheets.,"Ultrathin two-dimensional nanosheets of layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are fundamentally and technologically intriguing. In contrast to the graphene sheet, they are chemically versatile. Mono- or few-layered TMDs - obtained either through exfoliation of bulk materials or bottom-up syntheses - are direct-gap semiconductors whose bandgap energy, as well as carrier type (n- or p-type), varies between compounds depending on their composition, structure and dimensionality. In this Review, we describe how the tunable electronic structure of TMDs makes them attractive for a variety of applications. They have been investigated as chemically active electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution and hydrosulfurization, as well as electrically active materials in opto-electronics. Their morphologies and properties are also useful for energy storage applications such as electrodes for Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors.",2
Phase-transfer-catalysed asymmetric synthesis of tetrasubstituted allenes.,"Allenes are molecules based on three carbons connected by two cumulated carbon-carbon double bonds. Given their axially chiral nature and unique reactivity, substituted allenes have a variety of applications in organic chemistry as key synthetic intermediates and directly as part of biologically active compounds. Although the demands for these motivated many endeavours to make axially chiral, substituted allenes by exercising asymmetric catalysis, the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of fully substituted ones (tetrasubstituted allenes) remained largely an unsolved issue. The fundamental obstacle to solving this conundrum is the lack of a simple synthetic transformation that provides tetrasubstituted allenes in the action of catalysis. We report herein a strategy to overcome this issue by the use of a phase-transfer-catalysed asymmetric functionalization of 1-alkylallene-1,3-dicarboxylates with N-arylsulfonyl imines and benzylic and allylic bromides.",2
Molecular tweezers modulate 14-3-3 protein-protein interactions.,"Supramolecular chemistry has recently emerged as a promising way to modulate protein functions, but devising molecules that will interact with a protein in the desired manner is difficult as many competing interactions exist in a biological environment (with solvents, salts or different sites for the target biomolecule). We now show that lysine-specific molecular tweezers bind to a 14-3-3 adapter protein and modulate its interaction with partner proteins. The tweezers inhibit binding between the 14-3-3 protein and two partner proteins--a phosphorylated (C-Raf) protein and an unphosphorylated one (ExoS)--in a concentration-dependent manner. Protein crystallography shows that this effect arises from the binding of the tweezers to a single surface-exposed lysine (Lys214) of the 14-3-3 protein in the proximity of its central channel, which normally binds the partner proteins. A combination of structural analysis and computer simulations provides rules for the tweezers' binding preferences, thus allowing us to predict their influence on this type of protein-protein interactions.",2
An iron complex with pendent amines as a molecular electrocatalyst for oxidation of hydrogen.,"The increasing energy needs of society have led to a search for technologies that can tap carbon-neutral and sustainable energy sources, such as solar and wind. Using properly designed catalysts, such sources can also be used to create fuels such as hydrogen; however, a significant barrier to the use of hydrogen as an energy carrier is the need for an inexpensive and efficient catalyst for its oxidation. The oxidation of hydrogen is the process by which electricity is produced in low-temperature fuel cells, and the best catalyst for this is platinum-a precious metal of low abundance. Here we report a molecular complex of iron (an abundant and inexpensive metal) as a rationally designed electrocatalyst for the oxidation of H(2) at room temperature, with turnover frequencies of 0.66-2.0 s(-1) and low overpotentials of 160-220 mV. This iron complex, Cp(C(6)F(5))Fe(P((t)Bu)(2)N(Bn)(2))(H), has pendent amines in the diphosphine ligand that function as proton relays.",2
A heparin-mimicking polymer conjugate stabilizes basic fibroblast growth factor.,"Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a protein that plays a crucial role in diverse cellular functions, from wound healing to bone regeneration. However, a major obstacle to the widespread application of bFGF is its inherent instability during storage and delivery. Here, we describe the stabilization of bFGF by covalent conjugation with a heparin-mimicking polymer, a copolymer consisting of styrene sulfonate units and methyl methacrylate units bearing poly(ethylene glycol) side chains. The bFGF conjugate of this polymer retained bioactivity after synthesis and was stable to a variety of environmentally and therapeutically relevant stressors--such as heat, mild and harsh acidic conditions, storage and proteolytic degradation--unlike native bFGF. Following the application of stress, the conjugate was also significantly more active than the control conjugate system in which the styrene sulfonate units were omitted from the polymer structure. This research has important implications for the clinical use of bFGF and for the stabilization of heparin-binding growth factors in general.",2
Volume-conserving trans-cis isomerization pathways in photoactive yellow protein visualized by picosecond X-ray crystallography.,"Trans-to-cis isomerization, the key reaction in photoactive proteins, usually cannot occur through the standard one-bond-flip mechanism. Owing to spatial constraints imposed by a protein environment, isomerization probably proceeds through a volume-conserving mechanism in which highly choreographed atomic motions are expected, the details of which have not yet been observed directly. Here we employ time-resolved X-ray crystallography to visualize structurally the isomerization of the p-coumaric acid chromophore in photoactive yellow protein with a time resolution of 100 ps and a spatial resolution of 1.6 A. The structure of the earliest intermediate (I(T)) resembles a highly strained transition state in which the torsion angle is located halfway between the trans- and cis-isomers. The reaction trajectory of I(T) bifurcates into two structurally distinct cis intermediates via hula-twist and bicycle-pedal pathways. The bifurcating reaction pathways can be controlled by weakening the hydrogen bond between the chromophore and an adjacent residue through E46Q mutation, which switches off the bicycle-pedal pathway.",2
A spray-drying strategy for synthesis of nanoscale metal-organic frameworks and their assembly into hollow superstructures.,"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are among the most attractive porous materials known today. Their miniaturization to the nanoscale--into nanoMOFs--is expected to serve myriad applications from drug delivery to membranes, to open up novel avenues to more traditional storage and catalysis applications, and to enable the creation of sophisticated superstructures. Here, we report the use of spray-drying as a versatile methodology to assemble nanoMOFs, yielding spherical hollow superstructures with diameters smaller than 5 microm. This strategy conceptually mimics the emulsions used by chemists to confine the synthesis of materials, but does not require secondary immiscible solvents or surfactants. We demonstrate that the resulting spherical, hollow superstructures can be processed into stable colloids, whose disassembly by sonication affords discrete, homogeneous nanoMOFs. This spray-drying strategy enables the construction of multicomponent MOF superstructures, and the encapsulation of guest species within these superstructures. We anticipate that this will provide new routes to capsules, reactors and composite materials.",2
A ring-distortion strategy to construct stereochemically complex and structurally diverse compounds from natural products.,"High-throughput screening is the dominant method used to identify lead compounds in drug discovery. As such, the makeup of screening libraries largely dictates the biological targets that can be modulated and the therapeutics that can be developed. Unfortunately, most compound-screening collections consist principally of planar molecules with little structural or stereochemical complexity, compounds that do not offer the arrangement of chemical functionality necessary for the modulation of many drug targets. Here we describe a novel, general and facile strategy for the creation of diverse compounds with high structural and stereochemical complexity using readily available natural products as synthetic starting points. We show through the evaluation of chemical properties (which include fraction of sp(3) carbons, ClogP and the number of stereogenic centres) that these compounds are significantly more complex and diverse than those in standard screening collections, and we give guidelines for the application of this strategy to any suitable natural product.",2
Charged and metallic molecular monolayers through surface-induced aromatic stabilization.,"Large pi-conjugated molecules, when in contact with a metal surface, usually retain a finite electronic gap and, in this sense, stay semiconducting. In some cases, however, the metallic character of the underlying substrate is seen to extend onto the first molecular layer. Here, we develop a chemical rationale for this intriguing phenomenon. In many reported instances, we find that the conjugation length of the organic semiconductors increases significantly through the bonding of specific substituents to the metal surface and through the concomitant rehybridization of the entire backbone structure. The molecules at the interface are thus converted into different chemical species with a strongly reduced electronic gap. This mechanism of surface-induced aromatic stabilization helps molecules to overcome competing phenomena that tend to keep the metal Fermi level between their frontier orbitals. Our findings aid in the design of stable precursors for metallic molecular monolayers, and thus enable new routes for the chemical engineering of metal surfaces.",2
Quantitative visualization of DNA G-quadruplex structures in human cells.,"Four-stranded G-quadruplex nucleic acid structures are of great interest as their high thermodynamic stability under near-physiological conditions suggests that they could form in cells. Here we report the generation and application of an engineered, structure-specific antibody employed to quantitatively visualize DNA G-quadruplex structures in human cells. We show explicitly that G-quadruplex formation in DNA is modulated during cell-cycle progression and that endogenous G-quadruplex DNA structures can be stabilized by a small-molecule ligand. Together these findings provide substantive evidence for the formation of G-quadruplex structures in the genome of mammalian cells and corroborate the application of stabilizing ligands in a cellular context to target G-quadruplexes and intervene with their function.",2
Snapshot of the equilibrium dynamics of a drug bound to HIV-1 reverse transcriptase.,"The anti-AIDS drug rilpivirine undergoes conformational changes to bind HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT), which is an essential enzyme for the replication of HIV. These changes allow it to retain potency against mutations that otherwise would render the enzyme resistant. Here we report that water molecules play an essential role in this binding process. Femtosecond experiments and theory expose the molecular level dynamics of rilpivirine bound to HIV-1 RT. Two nitrile substituents, one on each arm of the drug, are used as vibrational probes of the structural dynamics within the binding pocket. Two-dimensional vibrational echo spectroscopy reveals that one nitrile group is unexpectedly hydrogen-bonded to a mobile water molecule, not identified in previous X-ray structures. Ultrafast nitrile-water dynamics are confirmed by simulations. A higher (1.51 A) resolution X-ray structure also reveals a water-drug interaction network. Maintenance of a crucial anchoring hydrogen bond may help retain the potency of rilpivirine against pocket mutations despite the structural variations they cause.",2
Inhibition of alpha-helix-mediated protein-protein interactions using designed molecules.,"Inhibition of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) represents a significant challenge because it is unclear how they can be effectively and selectively targeted using small molecules. Achieving this goal is critical given the defining role of these interactions in biological processes. A rational approach to inhibitor design based on the secondary structure at the interface is the focus of much research, and different classes of designed ligands have emerged, some of which effectively and selectively disrupt targeted PPIs. This Review discusses the relevance of PPIs and, in particular, the importance of alpha-helix-mediated PPIs to chemical biology and drug discovery with a focus on designing inhibitors, including constrained peptides, foldamers and proteomimetic-derived ligands. In doing so, key challenges and major advances in developing generic approaches for the elaboration of PPI inhibitors are highlighted. The challenges faced in developing such ligands as drug leads--and how criteria applied to these may differ from conventional small-molecule drugs--are summarized.",2
A sustainable catalytic pyrrole synthesis.,"The pyrrole heterocycle is a prominent chemical motif and is found widely in natural products, drugs, catalysts and advanced materials. Here we introduce a sustainable iridium-catalysed pyrrole synthesis in which secondary alcohols and amino alcohols are deoxygenated and linked selectively via the formation of C-N and C-C bonds. Two equivalents of hydrogen gas are eliminated in the course of the reaction, and alcohols based entirely on renewable resources can be used as starting materials. The catalytic synthesis protocol tolerates a large variety of functional groups, which includes olefins, chlorides, bromides, organometallic moieties, amines and hydroxyl groups. We have developed a catalyst that operates efficiently under mild conditions.",2
A near-infrared fluorophore for live-cell super-resolution microscopy of cellular proteins.,"The ideal fluorescent probe for bioimaging is bright, absorbs at long wavelengths and can be implemented flexibly in living cells and in vivo. However, the design of synthetic fluorophores that combine all of these properties has proved to be extremely difficult. Here, we introduce a biocompatible near-infrared silicon-rhodamine probe that can be coupled specifically to proteins using different labelling techniques. Importantly, its high permeability and fluorogenic character permit the imaging of proteins in living cells and tissues, and its brightness and photostability make it ideally suited for live-cell super-resolution microscopy. The excellent spectroscopic properties of the probe combined with its ease of use in live-cell applications make it a powerful new tool for bioimaging.",2
Catalytic transformation of alcohols to carboxylic acid salts and H2 using water as the oxygen atom source.,"The oxidation of alcohols to carboxylic acids is an important industrial reaction used in the synthesis of bulk and fine chemicals. Most current processes are performed by making use of either stoichiometric amounts of toxic oxidizing agents or the use of pressurized dioxygen. Here, we describe an alternative dehydrogenative pathway effected by water and base with the concomitant generation of hydrogen gas. A homogeneous ruthenium complex catalyses the transformation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acid salts at low catalyst loadings (0.2 mol%) in basic aqueous solution. A consequence of this finding could be a safer and cleaner process for the synthesis of carboxylic acids and their derivatives at both laboratory and industrial scales.",2
A supramolecular approach to combining enzymatic and transition metal catalysis.,"The ability of supramolecular host-guest complexes to catalyse organic reactions collaboratively with an enzyme is an important goal in the research and discovery of synthetic enzyme mimics. Herein we present a variety of catalytic tandem reactions that employ esterases, lipases or alcohol dehydrogenases and gold(I) or ruthenium(II) complexes encapsulated in a Ga(4)L(6) tetrahedral supramolecular cluster. The host-guest complexes are tolerated well by the enzymes and, in the case of the gold(I) host-guest complex, show improved reactivity relative to the free cationic guest. We propose that supramolecular encapsulation of organometallic complexes prevents their diffusion into the bulk solution, where they can bind amino-acid residues on the proteins and potentially compromise their activity. Our observations underline the advantages of the supramolecular approach and suggest that encapsulation of reactive complexes may provide a general strategy for carrying out classic organic reactions in the presence of biocatalysts.",2
A divergent approach to the synthesis of the yohimbinoid alkaloids venenatine and alstovenine.,"The yohimbinoid alkaloids continue to receive considerable attention from the synthetic community because of their interesting chemical structures and varied biological activity. Although there are several elegant syntheses of certain members of this group of alkaloids, a truly unified approach has yet to be developed. In short, general approaches to this compound class are hampered by a lack of complete control in setting the C(3) stereocentre at a late stage. Herein, we report that a functionalized hydrindanone enables a divergent strategy that builds on existing precedent to address this long-standing challenge. Utilizing an aminonitrile intermediate, the stereochemistry at C(3) of the yohimbinoid skeleton can be controlled effectively in a Pictet-Spengler reaction. We applied this approach to the first total syntheses of the C(3) epimeric natural products venenatine and alstovenine.",2
Bond-strengthening pi backdonation in a transition-metal pi-diborene complex.,"Transition-metal catalysis is founded on the principle that electron donation from a metal to a ligand is accepted by an antibonding orbital of the ligand, thereby weakening one of the bonds in the ligand. Without this, the initial step of bond activation in many catalytic processes would simply not occur. This concept is enshrined in the well-accepted Dewar-Chatt-Duncanson model of transition-metal bonding. We present herein experimental and computational evidence for the first true violation of the Dewar-Chatt-Duncanson bonding model, found in a pi-diborene complex in which an electron-rich group 10 metal donates electrons into an empty bonding pi orbital on the ligand, and thereby strengthens the bond. The complex is also the first transition-metal complex to contain a bound diborene, a species not isolated before, either in its free form or bound to a metal.",2
A backbone lever-arm effect enhances polymer mechanochemistry.,"Mechanical forces along a polymer backbone can be used to bring about remarkable reactivity in embedded mechanically active functional groups, but little attention has been paid to how a given polymer backbone delivers that force to the reactant. Here, single-molecule force spectroscopy was used to directly quantify and compare the forces associated with the ring opening of gem-dibromo and gem-dichlorocyclopropanes affixed along the backbone of cis-polynorbornene and cis-polybutadiene. The critical force for isomerization drops by about one-third in the polynorbornene scaffold relative to polybutadiene. The root of the effect lies in more efficient chemomechanical coupling through the polynorbornene backbone, which acts as a phenomenological lever with greater mechanical advantage than polybutadiene. The experimental results are supported computationally and provide the foundation for a new strategy by which to engineer mechanochemical reactivity.",2
Sulfur as a selective 'soft' oxidant for catalytic methane conversion probed by experiment and theory.,"Developing efficient catalytic processes to convert methane into useful feedstocks relies critically upon devising new coupling processes that use abundant, thermodynamically 'mild' oxidants together with selective catalysts. We report here on elemental sulfur as a promising 'soft' oxidant for selective methane conversion to ethylene over MoS(2), RuS(2), TiS(2), PdS and Pd/ZrO(2) catalysts. Experiments and density functional theory reveal that methane conversion is directly correlated with surface metal-sulfur bond strengths. Surfaces with weakly bound sulfur are more basic and activate methane C-H bonds more readily. In contrast, experimental and theoretical selectivities scale inversely with surface metal-sulfur bond strengths, and surfaces with the strongest metal-sulfur bonds afford the highest ethylene selectivities. High CH(4)/S ratios, short contact times and the provision of a support maximizes the coupling of CH(x) intermediates and selectivity to ethylene, because these conditions yield surfaces with stronger metal-sulfur bonding (for example, Pd(16)S(7)), which suppresses the over-oxidation of methane.",2
Synthetic cascades are enabled by combining biocatalysts with artificial metalloenzymes.,"Enzymatic catalysis and homogeneous catalysis offer complementary means to address synthetic challenges, both in chemistry and in biology. Despite its attractiveness, the implementation of concurrent cascade reactions that combine an organometallic catalyst with an enzyme has proven challenging because of the mutual inactivation of both catalysts. To address this, we show that incorporation of a d(6)-piano stool complex within a host protein affords an artificial transfer hydrogenase (ATHase) that is fully compatible with and complementary to natural enzymes, thus enabling efficient concurrent tandem catalysis. To illustrate the generality of the approach, the ATHase was combined with various NADH-, FAD- and haem-dependent enzymes, resulting in orthogonal redox cascades. Up to three enzymes were integrated in the cascade and combined with the ATHase with a view to achieving (i) a double stereoselective amine deracemization, (ii) a horseradish peroxidase-coupled readout of the transfer hydrogenase activity towards its genetic optimization, (iii) the formation of L-pipecolic acid from L-lysine and (iv) regeneration of NADH to promote a monooxygenase-catalysed oxyfunctionalization reaction.",2
Real-time and in situ monitoring of mechanochemical milling reactions.,"Chemical and structural transformations have long been carried out by milling. Such mechanochemical steps are now ubiquitous in a number of industries (such as the pharmaceutical, chemical and metallurgical industries), and are emerging as excellent environmentally friendly alternatives to solution-based syntheses. However, mechanochemical transformations are typically difficult to monitor in real time, which leaves a large gap in the mechanistic understanding required for their development. We now report the real-time study of mechanochemical transformations in a ball mill by means of in situ diffraction of high-energy synchrotron X-rays. Focusing on the mechanosynthesis of metal-organic frameworks, we have directly monitored reaction profiles, the formation of intermediates, and interconversions of framework topologies. Our results reveal that mechanochemistry is highly dynamic, with reaction rates comparable to or greater than those in solution. The technique also enabled us to probe directly how catalytic additives recently introduced in the mechanosynthesis of metal-organic frameworks, such as organic liquids or ionic species, change the reactivity pathways and kinetics.",2
Stability of xenon oxides at high pressures.,"Xenon, which is quite inert under ambient conditions, may become reactive under pressure. The possibility of the formation of stable xenon oxides and silicates in the interior of the Earth could explain the atmospheric missing xenon paradox. Using an ab initio evolutionary algorithm, we predict the existence of thermodynamically stable Xe-O compounds at high pressures (XeO, XeO(2) and XeO(3) become stable at pressures above 83, 102 and 114 GPa, respectively). Our calculations indicate large charge transfer in these oxides, suggesting that large electronegativity difference and high pressure are the key factors favouring the formation of xenon compounds. However, xenon compounds cannot exist in the Earth's mantle: xenon oxides are unstable in equilibrium with the metallic iron occurring in the lower mantle, and xenon silicates are predicted to decompose spontaneously at all mantle pressures (<136 GPa). However, it is possible that xenon atoms may be retained at defects in mantle silicates and oxides.",2
"Regioselective reactions of 3,4-pyridynes enabled by the aryne distortion model.","The pyridine heterocycle continues to play a vital role in the development of human medicines. More than 100 currently marketed drugs contain this privileged unit, which remains highly sought after synthetically. We report an efficient means to access di- and trisubstituted pyridines in an efficient and highly controlled manner using transient 3,4-pyridyne intermediates. Previous efforts to employ 3,4-pyridynes for the construction of substituted pyridines were hampered by a lack of regiocontrol or the inability to later manipulate an adjacent directing group. The strategy relies on the use of proximal halide or sulfamate substituents to perturb pyridyne distortion, which in turn governs regioselectivities in nucleophilic addition and cycloaddition reactions. After trapping of the pyridynes generated in situ, the neighbouring directing groups may be removed or exploited using versatile metal-catalysed cross-coupling reactions. This methodology now renders 3,4-pyridynes as useful synthetic building blocks for the creation of highly decorated derivatives of the medicinally privileged pyridine heterocycle.",2
Molecular engineering of a cobalt-based electrocatalytic nanomaterial for H(2) evolution under fully aqueous conditions.,"The viability of a hydrogen economy depends on the design of efficient catalytic systems based on earth-abundant elements. Innovative breakthroughs for hydrogen evolution based on molecular tetraimine cobalt compounds have appeared in the past decade. Here we show that such a diimine-dioxime cobalt catalyst can be grafted to the surface of a carbon nanotube electrode. The resulting electrocatalytic cathode material mediates H(2) generation (55,000 turnovers in seven hours) from fully aqueous solutions at low-to-medium overpotentials. This material is remarkably stable, which allows extensive cycling with preservation of the grafted molecular complex, as shown by electrochemical studies, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. This clearly indicates that grafting provides an increased stability to these cobalt catalysts, and suggests the possible application of these materials in the development of technological devices.",2
Halogen-bonding-triggered supramolecular gel formation.,"Supramolecular gels are topical soft materials involving the reversible formation of fibrous aggregates using non-covalent interactions. There is significant interest in controlling the properties of such materials by the formation of multicomponent systems, which exhibit non-additive properties emerging from interaction of the components. The use of hydrogen bonding to assemble supramolecular gels in organic solvents is well established. In contrast, the use of halogen bonding to trigger supramolecular gel formation in a two-component gel ('co-gel') is essentially unexplored, and forms the basis for this study. Here, we show that halogen bonding between a pyridyl substituent in a bis(pyridyl urea) and 1,4-diiodotetrafluorobenzene brings about gelation, even in polar media such as aqueous methanol and aqueous dimethylsulfoxide. This demonstrates that halogen bonding is sufficiently strong to interfere with competing gel-inhibitory interactions and create a 'tipping point' in gel assembly. Using this concept, we have prepared a halogen bond donor bis(urea) gelator that forms co-gels with halogen bond acceptors.",2
"Submolecular control, spectroscopy and imaging of bond-selective chemistry in single functionalized molecules.","One of the key challenges in chemistry is to break and form bonds selectively in complex organic molecules that possess a range of different functional groups. To do this at the single-molecule level not only provides an opportunity to create custom nanoscale devices, but offers opportunities for the in-depth study of how the molecular electronic structure changes in individual reactions. Here we use a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) to induce a sequence of targeted bond dissociation and formation steps in single thiol-based pi-conjugated molecules adsorbed on a NiAl(110) surface. Furthermore, the electronic resonances of the resulting species were measured by spatially resolved electronic spectroscopy at each reaction step. Specifically, the STM was used to cleave individual acetyl groups and to form Au-S bonds by manipulating single Au atoms. A detailed understanding of the Au-S bond and its non-local influence is fundamentally important for determining the electron transport in thiol-based molecular junction.",2
A 'clusters-in-liquid' method for calculating infrared spectra identifies the proton-transfer mode in acidic aqueous solutions.,"In liquid water the transfer of an excess proton between two water molecules occurs through the Zundel cation, H(2)O...H(+)...OH(2). The proton-transfer mode is the asymmetric stretch of the central O...H(+)...O moiety, but there is no consensus on its identification in the infrared spectra of acidic aqueous solutions. Also, in experiments with protonated gas-phase water clusters, its position shifts with cluster size, which makes its relationship with solution spectra unclear. Here we introduce a 'clusters-in-liquid' approach for calculating the infrared spectrum from any set of charges, even single protons. We apply this procedure to multistate empirical valence-bond trajectories of protonated liquid water and to ab initio molecular dynamics of the protonated water dimer and hexamer in the gas phase. The calculated proton-transfer mode is manifested in both systems as a peak near 1,740 cm(-1), in quantitative agreement with a band of similar frequency in the experimental infrared spectrum of protonated water clusters.",2
Natural-product-derived fragments for fragment-based ligand discovery.,"Fragment-based ligand and drug discovery predominantly employs sp(2)-rich compounds covering well-explored regions of chemical space. Despite the ease with which such fragments can be coupled, this focus on flat compounds is widely cited as contributing to the attrition rate of the drug discovery process. In contrast, biologically validated natural products are rich in stereogenic centres and populate areas of chemical space not occupied by average synthetic molecules. Here, we have analysed more than 180,000 natural product structures to arrive at 2,000 clusters of natural-product-derived fragments with high structural diversity, which resemble natural scaffolds and are rich in sp(3)-configured centres. The structures of the cluster centres differ from previously explored fragment libraries, but for nearly half of the clusters representative members are commercially available. We validate their usefulness for the discovery of novel ligand and inhibitor types by means of protein X-ray crystallography and the identification of novel stabilizers of inactive conformations of p38alpha MAP kinase and of inhibitors of several phosphatases.",2
Protonation-coupled redox reactions in planar antiaromatic meso-pentafluorophenyl-substituted o-phenylene-bridged annulated rosarins.,"Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes are among the most important phenomena that control a variety of chemical and biological transformations. Although extensively studied in a variety of natural systems and discrete metal complexes, PCET mechanisms are less well codified in the case of purely organic compounds. Here we report that a planar beta,beta'-phenylene-bridged hexaphyrin (1.0.1.0.1.0), a 24 pi-electron antiaromatic species termed rosarin, displays unique redox reactivity on protonation. Specifically, treatment with acid (for example, HI) yields a 26 pi-electron aromatic triprotonated monocationic species that is produced spontaneously via an intermediate-but stable-25 pi-electron non-aromatic triprotonated monoradical dication. This latter species is also produced on treatment of the original 24 pi-electron antiaromatic starting material with HCl or HBr. The stepwise nature of the proton-coupled reduction observed in the planar rosarin stands in marked contrast to that seen for non-annulated rosarins and other ostensibly antiaromatic expanded porphyrinoids.",2
Twin disulfides for orthogonal disulfide pairing and the directed folding of multicyclic peptides.,"Multicyclic peptides are emerging as an exciting platform for drug and targeted ligand discovery owing to their expected greater target affinity/selectivity/stability versus linear or monocyclic peptides. However, although the precise pairing of cysteine residues in proteins is routinely achieved in nature, the rational pairing of cysteine residues within polypeptides is a long-standing challenge for the preparation of multicyclic species containing several disulfide bridges. Here, we present an efficient and straightforward approach for directing the intermolecular and intramolecular pairing of cysteine residues within peptides using a minimal CXC motif. Orthogonal disulfide pairing can be exploited in complex redox media to rationally produce dimeric peptides and bi/tricyclic peptides from fully reduced peptides containing 1-6 cysteine residues. This strategy, which does not rely on extensive manipulation of the primary sequence, post-translational modification or protecting groups, should greatly benefit the development of multicyclic peptide therapeutics and targeting ligands.",2
A flow-system array for the discovery and scale up of inorganic clusters.,"The batch synthesis of inorganic clusters can be both time consuming and limited by a lack of reproducibility. Flow-system approaches, now common in organic synthesis, have not been utilized widely for the synthesis of clusters. Herein we combine an automated flow process with multiple batch crystallizations for the screening and scale up of syntheses of polyoxometalates and manganese-based single-molecule magnets. Scale up of the synthesis of these architectures was achieved by programming a multiple-pump reactor system to vary reaction conditions sequentially, and thus explore a larger parameter space in a shorter time than conventionally possible. Also, the potential for using the array as a discovery tool is demonstrated. Successful conditions for product isolation were identified easily from the array of reactions, and a direct route to 'scale up' was then immediately available simply by continuous application of these flow conditions. In all cases, large quantities of phase-pure material were obtained and the time taken for the discovery, repetition and scale up decreased.",2
Shape-selective sieving layers on an oxide catalyst surface.,"New porous materials such as zeolites, metal-organic frameworks and mesostructured oxides are of immense practical utility for gas storage, separations and heterogeneous catalysis. Their extended pore structures enable selective uptake of molecules or can modify the product selectivity (regioselectivity or enantioselectivity) of catalyst sites contained within. However, diffusion within pores can be problematic for biomass and fine chemicals, and not all catalyst classes can be readily synthesized with pores of the correct dimensions. Here, we present a novel approach that adds reactant selectivity to existing, non-porous oxide catalysts by first grafting the catalyst particles with single-molecule sacrificial templates, then partially overcoating the catalyst with a second oxide through atomic layer deposition. This technique is used to create sieving layers of Al(2)O(3) (thickness, 0.4-0.7 nm) with 'nanocavities' (<2 nm in diameter) on a TiO(2) photocatalyst. The additional layers result in selectivity (up to 9:1) towards less hindered reactants in otherwise unselective, competitive photocatalytic oxidations and transfer hydrogenations.",2
An N-bridged high-valent diiron-oxo species on a porphyrin platform that can oxidize methane.,"High-valent oxo-metal complexes are involved in key biochemical processes of selective oxidation and removal of xenobiotics. The catalytic properties of cytochrome P-450 and soluble methane monooxygenase enzymes are associated with oxo species on mononuclear iron haem and diiron non-haem platforms, respectively. Bio-inspired chemical systems that can reproduce the fascinating ability of these enzymes to oxidize the strongest C-H bonds are the focus of intense scrutiny. In this context, the development of highly oxidizing diiron macrocyclic catalysts requires a structural determination of the elusive active species and elucidation of the reaction mechanism. Here we report the preparation of an Fe(IV)(micro-nitrido)Fe(IV) = O tetraphenylporphyrin cation radical species at -90 degrees C, characterized by ultraviolet-visible, electron paramagnetic resonance and Mossbauer spectroscopies and by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. This species exhibits a very high activity for oxygen-atom transfer towards alkanes, including methane. These findings provide a foundation on which to develop efficient and clean oxidation processes, in particular transformations of the strongest C-H bonds.",2
Extreme oxatriquinanes and a record C-O bond length.,"Oxatriquinanes are fused, tricyclic oxonium ions that are known to have exceptional stability compared to simple alkyl oxonium salts. C-O bonds in ethers are generally approximately 1.43 A in length, but oxatriquinane has been found to have C-O bond lengths of 1.54 A. A search of the Cambridge Structural Database turned up no bona fide C-O bond length exceeding this value. Computational modelling of oxatriquinane alongside other alkyl oxonium ions indicated that the electronic consequences of molecular strain were primarily responsible for the observed bond elongation. We also show that substitution of the oxatriquinane ring system with alkyl groups of increasing steric demand pushes the C-O bond to unheard of distances, culminating in a tert-butyl derivative at a predicted 1.60 A. Chemical synthesis and an X-ray crystallographic study of these compounds validated the results of the modelling work and, finally, an extraordinary 1.622 A C-O bond was observed in 1,4,7-tri-tert-butyloxatriquinane.",2
Uranium and manganese assembled in a wheel-shaped nanoscale single-molecule magnet with high spin-reversal barrier.,"Discrete molecular compounds that exhibit both magnetization hysteresis and slow magnetic relaxation below a characteristic 'blocking' temperature are known as single-molecule magnets. These are promising for applications including memory devices and quantum computing, but require higher spin-inversion barriers and hysteresis temperatures than currently achieved. After twenty years of research confined to the d-block transition metals, scientists are moving to the f-block to generate these properties. We have now prepared, by cation-promoted self-assembly, a large 5f-3d U(12)Mn(6) cluster that adopts a wheel topology and exhibits single-molecule magnet behaviour. This uranium-based molecular wheel shows an open magnetic hysteresis loop at low temperature, with a non-zero coercive field (below 4 K) and quantum tunnelling steps (below 2.5 K), which suggests that uranium might indeed provide a route to magnetic storage devices. This molecule also represents an interesting model for actinide nanoparticles occurring in the environment and in spent fuel separation cycles.",2
Synthesis of a metallic mesoporous pyrochlore as a catalyst for lithium-O2 batteries.,"The lithium-O2 'semi-fuel' cell based on the reversible reaction of Li and O2 to form Li2O2 can theoretically provide energy densities that exceed those of Li-ion cells by up to a factor of five. A key limitation that differentiates it from other lithium batteries is that it requires effective catalysts (or 'promoters') to enable oxygen reduction and evolution. Here, we report the synthesis of a novel metallic mesoporous oxide using surfactant templating that shows promising catalytic activity and results in a cathode with a high reversible capacity of 10,000 mAh g(-1) ( approximately 1,000 mAh g(-1) with respect to the total electrode weight including the peroxide product). This oxide also has a lower charge potential for oxygen evolution from Li2O2 than pure carbon. The properties are explained by the high fraction of surface defect active sites in the metallic oxide, and its unique morphology and variable oxygen stoichiometry. This strategy for creating porous metallic oxides may pave the way to new cathode architectures for the Li-O2 cell.",2
Electronic tuning of site-selectivity.,"Site-selective functionalizations of complex small molecules can generate targeted derivatives with exceptional step efficiency, but general strategies for maximizing selectivity in this context are rare. Here, we report that site-selectivity can be tuned by simply modifying the electronic nature of the reagents. A Hammett analysis is consistent with linking this phenomenon to the Hammond postulate: electronic tuning to a more product-like transition state amplifies site-discriminating interactions between a reagent and its substrate. This strategy transformed a minimally site-selective acylation reaction into a highly selective and thus preparatively useful one. Electronic tuning of both an acylpyridinium donor and its carboxylate counterion further promoted site-divergent functionalizations. With these advances, we achieve a range of modifications to just one of the many hydroxyl groups appended to the ion channel-forming natural product amphotericin B. Thus, electronic tuning of reagents represents an effective strategy for discovering and optimizing site-selective functionalization reactions.",2
Combinatorial evolution of site- and enantioselective catalysts for polyene epoxidation.,"Selectivity in the catalytic functionalization of complex molecules is a major challenge in chemical synthesis. The problem is magnified when there are several possible stereochemical outcomes and when similar functional groups occur repeatedly within the same molecule. Selective polyene oxidation provides an archetypical example of this challenge. Historically, enzymatic catalysis has provided the only precedents. Although non-enzymatic catalysts that meet some of these challenges became known, a comprehensive solution has remained elusive. Here, we describe low molecular weight peptide-based catalysts, discovered through a combinatorial synthesis and screening protocol, that exhibit site- and enantioselective oxidation of certain positions of various isoprenols. This diversity-based approach, which exhibits features reminiscent of the directed evolution of enzymes, delivers catalysts that compare favourably to the state-of-the-art for the asymmetric oxidation of these compounds. Moreover, the approach culminated in catalysts that exhibit alternative-site selectivity in comparison to oxidation catalysts previously described.",2
Inelastic scattering of hydroxyl radicals with helium and argon by velocity-map imaging.,"The hydroxyl radical (OH) is one of the most interesting molecules in molecular dynamics. In particular, inelastic collisions of free radicals such as OH are profoundly important in environments ranging from combustion to astrochemistry. However, measuring the velocities of OH molecules in specific internal quantum states has proven to be very difficult. A method that can provide this important information is velocity-map imaging. Although this technique is very widely applicable in principle, it does require a sensitive and selective laser-ionization scheme. Here we show that, under the right conditions, velocity-map imaging can be applied to the study of the inelastic scattering of OH using crossed-molecular-beam methods. We measure fully quantum-state-specified product angular distributions for OH collisions with helium and argon. The agreement between exact close-coupling quantum scattering calculations on ab initio potential energy surfaces and experimental data is generally very satisfactory, except for scattering in the most forward directions.",2
Reaction-based small-molecule fluorescent probes for chemoselective bioimaging.,"The dynamic chemical diversity of elements, ions and molecules that form the basis of life offers both a challenge and an opportunity for study. Small-molecule fluorescent probes can make use of selective, bioorthogonal chemistries to report on specific analytes in cells and in more complex biological specimens. These probes offer powerful reagents to interrogate the physiology and pathology of reactive chemical species in their native environments with minimal perturbation to living systems. This Review presents a survey of tools and tactics for using such probes to detect biologically important chemical analytes. We highlight design criteria for effective chemical tools for use in biological applications as well as gaps for future exploration.",2
Control of selectivity in heterogeneous catalysis by tuning nanoparticle properties and reactor residence time.,"A combination of the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis could enable the development of sustainable catalysts with novel reactivity and selectivity. Although heterogeneous catalysts are often recycled more easily than their homogeneous counterparts, they can be difficult to apply in traditional organic reactions and modification of their properties towards a desired reactivity is, at best, complex. In contrast, tuning the properties of homogeneous catalysts by, for example, modifying the ligands that coordinate a metal centre is better understood. Here, using olefin cyclopropanation reactions catalysed by dendrimer-encapsulated Au nanoclusters as examples, we demonstrate that changing the dendrimer properties allows the catalytic reactivity to be tuned in a similar fashion to ligand modification in a homogeneous catalyst. Furthermore, we show that these heterogeneous catalysts employed in a fixed-bed flow reactor allow fine control over the residence time of the reactants and thus enables the control over product distribution in a way that is not easily available for homogeneous catalysts.",2
RNA catalysis through compartmentalization.,"RNA performs important cellular functions in contemporary life forms. Its ability to act both as a catalyst and a storage mechanism for genetic information is also an important part of the RNA world hypothesis. Compartmentalization within modern cells allows the local concentration of RNA to be controlled and it has been suggested that this was also important in early life forms. Here, we mimic intracellular compartmentalization and macromolecular crowding by partitioning RNA in an aqueous two-phase system (ATPS). We show that the concentration of RNA is enriched by up to 3,000-fold in the dextran-rich phase of a polyethylene glycol/dextran ATPS and demonstrate that this can lead to approximately 70-fold increase in the rate of ribozyme cleavage. This rate enhancement can be tuned by the relative volumes of the two phases in the ATPS. Our observations support the importance of compartmentalization in the attainment of function in an RNA World as well as in modern biology.",2
Ammonia synthesis using a stable electride as an electron donor and reversible hydrogen store.,"Industrially, the artificial fixation of atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia is carried out using the Haber-Bosch process, but this process requires high temperatures and pressures, and consumes more than 1% of the world's power production. Therefore the search is on for a more environmentally benign process that occurs under milder conditions. Here, we report that a Ru-loaded electride [Ca(24)Al(28)O(64)](4+)(e(-))(4) (Ru/C12A7:e(-)), which has high electron-donating power and chemical stability, works as an efficient catalyst for ammonia synthesis. Highly efficient ammonia synthesis is achieved with a catalytic activity that is an order of magnitude greater than those of other previously reported Ru-loaded catalysts and with almost half the reaction activation energy. Kinetic analysis with infrared spectroscopy reveals that C12A7:e(-) markedly enhances N(2) dissociation on Ru by the back donation of electrons and that the poisoning of ruthenium surfaces by hydrogen adatoms can be suppressed effectively because of the ability of C12A7:e(-) to store hydrogen reversibly.",2
Amyloid beta-sheet mimics that antagonize protein aggregation and reduce amyloid toxicity.,"The amyloid protein aggregation associated with diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and type II diabetes (among many others) features a bewildering variety of beta-sheet-rich structures in transition from native proteins to ordered oligomers and fibres. The variation in the amino-acid sequences of the beta-structures presents a challenge to developing a model system of beta-sheets for the study of various amyloid aggregates. Here, we introduce a family of robust beta-sheet macrocycles that can serve as a platform to display a variety of heptapeptide sequences from different amyloid proteins. We have tailored these amyloid beta-sheet mimics (ABSMs) to antagonize the aggregation of various amyloid proteins, thereby reducing the toxicity of amyloid aggregates. We describe the structures and inhibitory properties of ABSMs containing amyloidogenic peptides from the amyloid-beta peptide associated with Alzheimer's disease, beta(2)-microglobulin associated with dialysis-related amyloidosis, alpha-synuclein associated with Parkinson's disease, islet amyloid polypeptide associated with type II diabetes, human and yeast prion proteins, and Tau, which forms neurofibrillary tangles.",2
Three-way switching in a cyanide-bridged [CoFe] chain.,"Bistable compounds that exist in two interchangeable phases under identical conditions can act as switches under external stimuli. Among such switchable materials, coordination complexes have energy levels (or phases) that are determined by the electronic states of their constituent metal ions and ligands. They can exhibit multiple bistabilities and hold promise in the search for multifaceted materials that display different properties in different phases, accessible through the application of contrasting external stimuli. Molecular systems that exhibit both thermo- and photoinduced magnetic bistabilities are excellent candidates for such systems. Here we describe a cyanide-bridged [CoFe] one-dimensional chiral coordination polymer that displays both magnetic and electric bistabilities in the same temperature range. Both the electric and magnetic switching probably arise from the same electron-transfer coupled spin-transition phenomenon, which enables the reversible conversion between an insulating diamagnetic phase and either a semiconducting paramagnetic (thermoinduced) or a type of ferromagnetic single-chain magnet (photoinduced) state.",2
Synthesis of highly strained terpenes by non-stop tail-to-head polycyclization.,"Non-stop carbocationic polycyclizations of isoprenoids have been called the most complex chemical reactions occurring in nature. We describe a strategy for the initiation of tail-to-head polycyclization that relies on the sequestration of the counteranion away from the carbocation, which allows full propagation of the cationic charge. If the anion is mobile, Coulombic forces hold this species in close proximity to the carbocation and cause preemptive termination through elimination. Anion sequestration is crucial for effecting the biomimetic synthesis of complex and unstable terpenes, including the highly strained funebrenes. This study illustrates the deleterious role of the counterion in tail-to-head carbocationic polycyclization reactions, which to the best of our knowledge has not been rigorously explored. These observations are also expected to find use in the design and control of cationic polycyclization along biosynthetic pathways that have previously been inaccessible in bulk solvent.",2
Hidden complexity in the isomerization dynamics of Holliday junctions.,"A plausible consequence of the rugged folding energy landscapes inherent to biomolecules is that there may be more than one functionally competent folded state. Indeed, molecule-to-molecule variations in the folding dynamics of enzymes and ribozymes have recently been identified in single-molecule experiments, but without systematic quantification or an understanding of their structural origin. Here, using concepts from glass physics and complementary clustering analysis, we provide a quantitative method to analyse single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) data, thereby probing the isomerization dynamics of Holliday junctions, which display such heterogeneous dynamics over a long observation time (T(obs) approximately 40 s). We show that the ergodicity of Holliday junction dynamics is effectively broken and that their conformational space is partitioned into a folding network of kinetically disconnected clusters. Theory suggests that the persistent heterogeneity of Holliday junction dynamics is a consequence of internal multiloops with varying sizes and flexibilities frozen by Mg(2+) ions. An annealing experiment using Mg(2+) pulses lends support to this idea by explicitly showing that interconversions between trajectories with different patterns can be induced.",2
Alteration of the oxygen-dependent reactivity of de novo Due Ferri proteins.,"De novo proteins provide a unique opportunity to investigate the structure-function relationships of metalloproteins in a minimal, well-defined and controlled scaffold. Here, we describe the rational programming of function in a de novo designed di-iron carboxylate protein from the Due Ferri family. Originally created to catalyse the O(2)-dependent, two-electron oxidation of hydroquinones, the protein was reprogrammed to catalyse the selective N-hydroxylation of arylamines by remodelling the substrate access cavity and introducing a critical third His ligand to the metal-binding cavity. Additional second- and third-shell modifications were required to stabilize the His ligand in the core of the protein. These structural changes resulted in at least a 10(6)-fold increase in the relative rate between the arylamine N-hydroxylation and hydroquinone oxidation reactions. This result highlights the potential for using de novo proteins as scaffolds for future investigations of the geometric and electronic factors that influence the catalytic tuning of di-iron active sites.",2
Prebiotic synthesis of simple sugars by photoredox systems chemistry.,"A recent synthesis of activated pyrimidine ribonucleotides under prebiotically plausible conditions relied on mixed oxygenous and nitrogenous systems chemistry. As it stands, this synthesis provides support for the involvement of RNA in the origin of life, but such support would be considerably strengthened if the sugar building blocks for the synthesis--glycolaldehyde and glyceraldehyde--could be shown to derive from one carbon feedstock molecules using similarly mixed oxygenous and nitrogenous systems chemistry. Here, we show that these sugars can be formed from hydrogen cyanide by ultraviolet irradiation in the presence of cyanometallates in a remarkable systems chemistry process. Using copper cyanide complexes, the process operates catalytically to disproportionate hydrogen cyanide, first generating the sugars and then sequestering them as simple derivatives.",2
Selectivity and direct visualization of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide in a decorated porous host.,"Understanding the mechanism by which porous solids trap harmful gases such as CO(2) and SO(2) is essential for the design of new materials for their selective removal. Materials functionalized with amine groups dominate this field, largely because of their potential to form carbamates through H(2)N(delta(-))...C(delta(+))O(2) interactions, thereby trapping CO(2) covalently. However, the use of these materials is energy-intensive, with significant environmental impact. Here, we report a non-amine-containing porous solid (NOTT-300) in which hydroxyl groups within pores bind CO(2) and SO(2) selectively. In situ powder X-ray diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering studies, combined with modelling, reveal that hydroxyl groups bind CO(2) and SO(2) through the formation of O=C(S)=O(delta(-))...H(delta(+))-O hydrogen bonds, which are reinforced by weak supramolecular interactions with C-H atoms on the aromatic rings of the framework. This offers the potential for the application of new 'easy-on/easy-off' capture systems for CO(2) and SO(2) that carry fewer economic and environmental penalties.",2
Heterogeneities of individual catalyst particles in space and time as monitored by spectroscopy.,"Recent years have witnessed the introduction of spatiotemporal spectroscopy for the characterization of catalysts at work at previously unattainable resolution and sensitivity. They have revealed that heterogeneous catalysts are more heterogeneous than often expected. Dynamic changes in the nature of active sites, such as their distribution and accessibility, occur both between and within particles. Scientists now have micro- and nanospectroscopic methods at hand to improve the understanding of catalyst heterogeneities and exploit them in catalyst design. Here we review the latest developments within this lively field. The trends include detection of single particles or molecules, super-resolution imaging, the transition from two- to three-dimensional imaging, selective staining, integration of spectroscopy with electron microscopy or scanning probe methods, and measuring under realistic reaction conditions. Such experimental approaches change the hitherto somewhat static picture of heterogeneous catalysis into one that acknowledges that catalysts behave almost like living objects--explaining why many characterization methods from the life sciences are being incorporated into catalysis research.",2
"Engaging unactivated alkyl, alkenyl and aryl iodides in visible-light-mediated free radical reactions.","Radical reactions are a powerful class of chemical transformations. However, the formation of radical species to initiate these reactions has often required the use of stoichiometric amounts of toxic reagents, such as tributyltin hydride. Recently, the use of visible-light-mediated photoredox catalysis to generate radical species has become popular, but the scope of these radical precursors has been limited. Here, we describe the identification of reaction conditions under which photocatalysts such as fac-Ir(ppy)3 can be utilized to form radicals from unactivated alkyl, alkenyl and aryl iodides. The generated radicals undergo reduction via hydrogen atom abstraction or reductive cyclization. The reaction protocol utilizes only inexpensive reagents, occurs under mild reaction conditions, and shows exceptional functional group tolerance. Reaction efficiency is maintained upon scale-up and decreased catalyst loading, and the reaction time can be significantly shortened when the reaction is performed in a flow reactor.",2
Label-free measuring and mapping of binding kinetics of membrane proteins in single living cells.,"Membrane proteins mediate a variety of cellular responses to extracellular signals. Although membrane proteins are studied intensively for their values as disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets, in situ investigation of the binding kinetics of membrane proteins with their ligands has been a challenge. Traditional approaches isolate membrane proteins and then study them ex situ, which does not reflect accurately their native structures and functions. We present a label-free plasmonic microscopy method to map the local binding kinetics of membrane proteins in their native environment. This analytical method can perform simultaneous plasmonic and fluorescence imaging, and thus make it possible to combine the strengths of both label-based and label-free techniques in one system. Using this method, we determined the distribution of membrane proteins on the surface of single cells and the local binding kinetic constants of different membrane proteins. Furthermore, we studied the polarization of the membrane proteins on the cell surface during chemotaxis.",2
The energy barrier in singlet fission can be overcome through coherent coupling and entropic gain.,"One strategy to improve solar-cell efficiency is to generate two excited electrons from just one photon through singlet fission, which is the conversion of a singlet (S(1)) into two triplet (T(1)) excitons. For efficient singlet fission it is believed that the cumulative energy of the triplet states should be no more than that of S(1). However, molecular analogues that satisfy this energetic requirement do not show appreciable singlet fission, whereas crystalline tetracene displays endothermic singlet fission with near-unity quantum yield. Here we probe singlet fission in tetracene by directly following the intermediate multiexciton (ME) state. The ME state is isoenergetic with 2 x T(1), but fission is not activated thermally. Rather, an S(1) <--> ME superposition formed through a quantum-coherent process allows access to the higher-energy ME. We attribute entropic gain in crystalline tetracene as the driving force for the subsequent decay of S(1) <--> ME into 2 x T(1), which leads to a high singlet-fission yield.",2
Submicrometre geometrically encoded fluorescent barcodes self-assembled from DNA.,"The identification and differentiation of a large number of distinct molecular species with high temporal and spatial resolution is a major challenge in biomedical science. Fluorescence microscopy is a powerful tool, but its multiplexing ability is limited by the number of spectrally distinguishable fluorophores. Here, we used (deoxy)ribonucleic acid (DNA)-origami technology to construct submicrometre nanorods that act as fluorescent barcodes. We demonstrate that spatial control over the positioning of fluorophores on the surface of a stiff DNA nanorod can produce 216 distinct barcodes that can be decoded unambiguously using epifluorescence or total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Barcodes with higher spatial information density were demonstrated via the construction of super-resolution barcodes with features spaced by approximately 40 nm. One species of the barcodes was used to tag yeast surface receptors, which suggests their potential applications as in situ imaging probes for diverse biomolecular and cellular entities in their native environments.",2
Visualization of hierarchically structured zeolite bodies from macro to nano length scales.,"A major challenge in the implementation of laboratory-designed catalysts is the scale-up into technically relevant forms. Advanced characterization is essential to understand and optimize catalyst assembly and function in industrial reactors. This Article presents an integrated approach to visualizing millimetre-sized extrudates and granules of a hierarchical MFI-type zeolite, displaying trimodal networks of micropores (0.56 nm), intracrystalline mesopores ( approximately 10 nm) and macropores ( approximately 200-300 nm). As exemplified for the conversion of methanol to olefins, the hierarchical zeolite yields a superior performance compared to its conventional analogue. The combination of dedicated specimen preparation with state-of-the-art optical, X-ray and electron-based microscopic and tomographic techniques proves a powerful methodology to reveal otherwise inaccessible information regarding structural organization over the whole range of length scales. It is expected that these tools will play a crucial role in the rationalization of scale-up principles in catalyst development.",2
Thiourea-catalysed ring opening of episulfonium ions with indole derivatives by means of stabilizing non-covalent interactions.,"Small organic and metal-containing molecules (molecular mass <1,000) can catalyse synthetically useful reactions with the high levels of stereoselectivity typically associated with macromolecular enzymatic catalysts. Whereas enzymes are generally understood to accelerate reactions and impart selectivity as they stabilize specific transition structures through networks of cooperative interactions, enantioselectivity with chiral, small-molecule catalysts is rationalized typically by the steric destabilization of all but one dominant pathway. However, it is increasingly apparent that stabilizing effects also play an important role in small-molecule catalysis, although the mechanistic characterization of such systems is rare. Here, we show that arylpyrrolidino amido thiourea catalysts catalyse the enantioselective nucleophilic ring opening of episulfonium ions by indoles. Evidence is provided for the selective transition-state stabilization of the major pathway by the thiourea catalyst in the rate- and selectivity-determining step. Enantioselectivity is achieved through a network of attractive anion binding, cation-pi and hydrogen-bond interactions between the catalyst and the reacting components in the transition-structure assembly.",2
Ab initio carbon capture in open-site metal-organic frameworks.,"During the formation of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), metal centres can coordinate with the intended organic linkers, but also with solvent molecules. In this case, subsequent activation by removal of the solvent molecules creates unsaturated 'open' metal sites known to have a strong affinity for CO(2) molecules, but their interactions are still poorly understood. Common force fields typically underestimate by as much as two orders of magnitude the adsorption of CO(2) in open-site Mg-MOF-74, which has emerged as a promising MOF for CO(2) capture. Here we present a systematic procedure to generate force fields using high-level quantum chemical calculations. Monte Carlo simulations based on an ab initio force field generated for CO(2) in Mg-MOF-74 shed some light on the interpretation of thermodynamic data from flue gas in this material. The force field describes accurately the chemistry of the open metal sites, and is transferable to other structures. This approach may serve in molecular simulations in general and in the study of fluid-solid interactions.",2
Rapid point-of-care detection of the tuberculosis pathogen using a BlaC-specific fluorogenic probe.,"Early diagnosis of tuberculosis can dramatically reduce both its transmission and the associated death rate. The extremely slow growth rate of the causative pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), however, makes this challenging at the point of care, particularly in resource-limited settings. Here we report the use of BlaC (an enzyme naturally expressed/secreted by tubercle bacilli) as a marker and the design of BlaC-specific fluorogenic substrates as probes for Mtb detection. These probes showed an enhancement by 100-200 times in fluorescence emission on BlaC activation and a greater than 1,000-fold selectivity for BlaC over TEM-1 beta-lactamase, an important factor in reducing false-positive diagnoses. Insight into the BlaC specificity was revealed by successful co-crystallization of the probe/enzyme mutant complex. A refined green fluorescent probe (CDG-OMe) enabled the successful detection of live pathogen in less than ten minutes, even in unprocessed human sputum. This system offers the opportunity for the rapid, accurate detection of very low numbers of Mtb for the clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis in sputum and other specimens.",2
Electrode-assisted catalytic water oxidation by a flavin derivative.,"The success of solar fuel technology relies on the development of efficient catalysts that can oxidize or reduce water. All molecular water-oxidation catalysts reported thus far are transition-metal complexes, however, here we report catalytic water oxidation to give oxygen by a fully organic compound, the N(5)-ethylflavinium ion, Et-Fl(+). Evolution of oxygen was detected during bulk electrolysis of aqueous Et-Fl(+) solutions at several potentials above +1.9 V versus normal hydrogen electrode. The catalysis was found to occur on glassy carbon and platinum working electrodes, but no catalysis was observed on fluoride-doped tin-oxide electrodes. Based on spectroelectrochemical results and preliminary calculations with density functional theory, one possible mechanistic route is proposed in which the oxygen evolution occurs from a peroxide intermediate formed between the oxidized flavin pseudobase and the oxidized carbon electrode. These findings offer an organic alternative to the traditional water-oxidation catalysts based on transition metals.",2
Selective transformations of complex molecules are enabled by aptameric protective groups.,"Emerging trends in drug discovery are prompting a renewed interest in natural products as a source of chemical diversity and lead structures. However, owing to the structural complexity of many natural compounds, the synthesis of derivatives is not easily realized. Here, we demonstrate a conceptually new approach using oligonucleotides as aptameric protective groups. These block several functionalities by non-covalent interactions in a complex molecule and enable the highly chemo- and regioselective derivatization (>99%) of natural antibiotics in a single synthetic step with excellent conversions of up to 83%. This technique reveals an important structure-activity relationship in neamine-based antibiotics and should help both to accelerate the discovery of new biologically active structures and to avoid potentially costly and cumbersome synthetic routes.",2
Use of the interior cavity of the P22 capsid for site-specific initiation of atom-transfer radical polymerization with high-density cargo loading.,"Virus-like particles (VLPs) have emerged as important and versatile architectures for chemical manipulation in the development of functional hybrid nanostructures. Here we demonstrate a successful site-selective initiation of atom-transfer radical polymerization reactions to form an addressable polymer constrained within the interior cavity of a VLP. Potentially, this protein-polymer hybrid of P22 and cross-linked poly(2-aminoethyl methacrylate) could be useful as a new high-density delivery vehicle for the encapsulation and delivery of small-molecule cargos. In particular, the encapsulated polymer can act as a scaffold for the attachment of small functional molecules, such as fluorescein dye or the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent Gd-diethylenetriaminepentacetate, through reactions with its pendant primary amine groups. Using this approach, a significant increase in the labelling density of the VLP, compared to that of previous modifications of VLPs, can be achieved. These results highlight the use of multimeric protein-polymer conjugates for their potential utility in the development of VLP-based MRI contrast agents with the possibility of loading other cargos.",2
A switching cascade of hydrazone-based rotary switches through coordination-coupled proton relays.,"Imidazole, a subunit of histidine, plays a crucial role in proton-relay processes that are important for various biological activities, such as metal efflux, viral replication and photosynthesis. We show here how an imidazolyl ring incorporated into a rotary switch based on a hydrazone enables a switching cascade that involves proton relay between two different switches. The switching process starts with a single input, zinc(II), that initiates an E/Z isomerization in the hydrazone system through a coordination-coupled proton transfer. The resulting imidazolium ring is unusually acidic and, through proton relay, activates the E/Z isomerization of a non-coordinating pyridine-containing hydrazone switch. We hypothesize that the reduction in the acid dissociation constant of the imidazolium ring results from a combination of electrostatic and conformational effects, the study of which might help elucidate the proton-coupled electron-transfer mechanism in photosynthetic bacteria.",2
Anion-induced reconstitution of a self-assembling system to express a chloride-binding Co10L15 pentagonal prism.,"Biochemical systems are adaptable, capable of reconstitution at all levels to achieve the functions associated with life. Synthetic chemical systems are more limited in their ability to reorganize to achieve new functions; they can reconfigure to bind an added substrate (template effect) or one binding event may modulate a receptor's affinity for a second substrate (allosteric effect). Here we describe a synthetic chemical system that is capable of structural reconstitution on receipt of one anionic signal (perchlorate) to create a tight binding pocket for another anion (chloride). The complex, barrel-like structure of the chloride receptor is templated by five perchlorate anions. This second-order templation phenomenon allows chemical networks to be envisaged that express more complex responses to chemical signals than is currently feasible.",2
A quantitative model for the transcription of 2D patterns into functional 3D architectures.,"Self-sorting on surfaces is one of the big challenges that must be addressed in preparing the organic materials of the future. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework for templated self-sorting on surfaces, and validate it experimentally. In our approach, the transcription of two-dimensional information encoded in a monolayer on the surface into three-dimensional supramolecular architectures is quantified by the intrinsic templation efficiency, a thickness-independent value describing the fidelity of transcription per layer. The theoretical prediction that exceedingly high intrinsic efficiencies will be needed to experimentally observe templated self-sorting is then confirmed experimentally. Intrinsic templation efficiencies of up to 97%, achieved with a newly introduced templated synthesis strategy, result in maximal 47% effective templation efficiency at a thickness of 70 layers. The functional relevance of surface-templated self-sorting and meaningful dependences of templation efficiencies on structural modifications are demonstrated.",2
In situ surface coverage analysis of RuO2-catalysed HCl oxidation reveals the entropic origin of compensation in heterogeneous catalysis.,"In heterogeneous catalysis, rates with Arrhenius-like temperature dependence are ubiquitous. Compensation phenomena, which arise from the linear correlation between the apparent activation energy and the logarithm of the apparent pre-exponential factor, are also common. Here, we study the origin of compensation and find a similar dependence on the rate-limiting surface coverage term for each Arrhenius parameter. This result is derived from an experimental determination of the surface coverage of oxygen and chlorine species using temporal analysis of products and prompt gamma activation analysis during HCl oxidation to Cl(2) on a RuO(2) catalyst. It is also substantiated by theory. We find that compensation phenomena appear when the effect on the apparent activation energy caused by changes in surface coverage is balanced out by the entropic configuration contributions of the surface. This result sets a new paradigm in understanding the interplay of compensation effects with the kinetics of heterogeneously catalysed processes.",2
Highly enantioselective trapping of zwitterionic intermediates by imines.,"Reactions with the unstable and highly reactive zwitterionic intermediates generated in processes catalysed by transition metals are providing new opportunities for molecular constructions. Insertion reactions involve the collapse of zwitterionic intermediates, but trapping them would allow structural elaborations that are not currently available. To synthesize complex molecules in this manner, reactive electrophiles can be used to trap the zwitterionic intermediates. Here, we describe the use of imines, activated by chiral organocatalysts, and a highly efficient integrated rhodium and chiral Bronsted acid co-catalysed process to trap zwitterionic intermediates that have been proposed previously to undergo a formal C-H insertion reaction, allowing us to obtain polyfunctionalized indole and oxindole derivatives in a single step with excellent diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity.",2
Understanding and controlling the substrate effect on graphene electron-transfer chemistry via reactivity imprint lithography.,"Graphene has exceptional electronic, optical, mechanical and thermal properties, which provide it with great potential for use in electronic, optoelectronic and sensing applications. The chemical functionalization of graphene has been investigated with a view to controlling its electronic properties and interactions with other materials. Covalent modification of graphene by organic diazonium salts has been used to achieve these goals, but because graphene comprises only a single atomic layer, it is strongly influenced by the underlying substrate. Here, we show a stark difference in the rate of electron-transfer reactions with organic diazonium salts for monolayer graphene supported on a variety of substrates. Reactions proceed rapidly for graphene supported on SiO(2) and Al(2)O(3) (sapphire), but negligibly on alkyl-terminated and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) surfaces, as shown by Raman spectroscopy. We also develop a model of reactivity based on substrate-induced electron-hole puddles in graphene, and achieve spatial patterning of chemical reactions in graphene by patterning the substrate.",2
A simple and accessible synthetic lectin for glucose recognition and sensing.,"Binding carbohydrates from water is a difficult task, even for the natural carbohydrate-binding proteins known as lectins. The design of synthetic lectin mimics is correspondingly challenging, especially if good selectivities are required. In previous work we showed that success is possible, but only for complex polycyclic architectures that require lengthy and low-yielding syntheses; for example, one glucose-selective system was made in 21 steps and only 0.1% overall yield. Here we report the discovery of a simple monocyclic host that matches the earlier designs, but is far more accessible as it is prepared in just five steps and 23% overall yield. The new synthetic lectin binds glucose with excellent selectivity versus other common monosaccharides (for example, ~50:1 versus galactose) and sufficient affinity for glucose sensing at the concentrations found in blood. It also features a built-in signalling system in the form of strong and guest-dependent fluorescence emission. The effectiveness and simplicity of this molecule suggests the potential for development into a new methodology for practical glucose monitoring.",2
Key stabilizing elements of protein structure identified through pressure and temperature perturbation of its hydrogen bond network.,"Hydrogen bonds are key constituents of biomolecular structures, and their response to external perturbations may reveal important insights about the most stable components of a structure. NMR spectroscopy can probe hydrogen bond deformations at very high resolution through hydrogen bond scalar couplings (HBCs). However, the small size of HBCs has so far prevented a comprehensive quantitative characterization of protein hydrogen bonds as a function of the basic thermodynamic parameters of pressure and temperature. Using a newly developed pressure cell, we have now mapped pressure- and temperature-dependent changes of 31 hydrogen bonds in ubiquitin by measuring HBCs with very high precision. Short-range hydrogen bonds are only moderately perturbed, but many hydrogen bonds with large sequence separations (high contact order) show greater changes. In contrast, other high-contact-order hydrogen bonds remain virtually unaffected. The specific stabilization of such topologically important connections may present a general principle with which to achieve protein stability and to preserve structural integrity during protein function.",2
"Designed, synthetically accessible bryostatin analogues potently induce activation of latent HIV reservoirs in vitro.","Bryostatin is a unique lead in the development of potentially transformative therapies for cancer, Alzheimer's disease and the eradication of HIV/AIDS. However, the clinical use of bryostatin has been hampered by its limited supply, difficulties in accessing clinically relevant derivatives, and side effects. Here, we address these problems through the step-economical syntheses of seven members of a new family of designed bryostatin analogues using a highly convergent Prins-macrocyclization strategy. We also demonstrate for the first time that such analogues effectively induce latent HIV activation in vitro with potencies similar to or better than bryostatin. Significantly, these analogues are up to 1,000-fold more potent in inducing latent HIV expression than prostratin, the current clinical candidate for latent virus induction. This study provides the first demonstration that designed, synthetically accessible bryostatin analogues could serve as superior candidates for the eradication of HIV/AIDS through induction of latent viral reservoirs in conjunction with current antiretroviral therapy.",2
Design strategies for organic semiconductors beyond the molecular formula.,"Organic semiconducting materials based on polymers and molecular systems containing an electronically delocalized structure are the basis of emerging optoelectronic technologies such as plastic solar cells and flexible transistors. For isolated molecules, guidelines exist that rely on the molecular formula to tailor the frontier (highest occupied or lowest unoccupied) molecular orbital energy levels and optical absorption profiles. Much less control can be achieved over relevant properties, however, as one makes the transition to the ensemble behaviour characteristic of the solid state. Polymeric materials are also challenging owing to the statistical description of the average number of repeat units. Here we draw attention to the limitations of molecular formulae as predictive tools for achieving properties relevant to device performances. Illustrative examples highlight the relevance of organization across multiple length scales, and how device performances--although relevant for practical applications--poorly reflect the success of molecular design.",2
Total synthesis of marinomycin A using salicylate as a molecular switch to mediate dimerization.,"Antibiotics play a significant role in human health because of their ability to treat life-threatening bacterial infections. The growing problems with antibiotic resistance have made the development of new antibiotics a World Health Organization priority. Marinomycin A is a member of a new class of bis-salicylate-containing polyene macrodiolides, which have potent antibiotic activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. Herein, we describe a triply convergent synthesis of this agent using the salicylate as a novel molecular switch for the chemoselective construction of the macrodiolide. This strategy raises new questions regarding the biosynthetic role of the salicylate and its potential impact on the mechanism of action of these types of agents. For instance, in contrast to penicillin, which enhances the electrophilicity of the cyclic amide through ring strain, salicylates reduce the electrophilicity of the aryl ester through an intramolecular resonance-assisted hydrogen bond to provide an amide surrogate.",2
Optically switchable transistor via energy-level phototuning in a bicomponent organic semiconductor.,"Organic semiconductors are suitable candidates for printable, flexible and large-area electronics. Alongside attaining an improved device performance, to confer a multifunctional nature to the employed materials is key for organic-based logic applications. Here we report on the engineering of an electronic structure in a semiconducting film by blending two molecular components, a photochromic diarylethene derivative and a poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) matrix, to attain phototunable and bistable energy levels for the P3HT's hole transport. As a proof-of-concept we exploited this blend as a semiconducting material in organic thin-film transistors. The device illumination at defined wavelengths enabled reversible tuning of the diarylethene's electronic states in the blend, which resulted in modulation of the output current. The device photoresponse was found to be in the microsecond range, and thus on a technologically relevant timescale. This modular blending approach allows for the convenient incorporation of various molecular components, which opens up perspectives on multifunctional devices and logic circuits.",2
Spontaneous reduction and C-H borylation of arenes mediated by uranium(III) disproportionation.,"Transition-metal-arene complexes such as bis(benzene)chromium Cr(eta(6)-C(6)H(6))(2) are historically important to d-orbital bonding theory and have modern importance in organic synthesis, catalysis and organic spintronics. In investigations of f-block chemistry, however, arenes are invariably used as solvents rather than ligands. Here, we show that simple uranium complexes UX(3) (X = aryloxide, amide) spontaneously disproportionate, transferring an electron and X-ligand, allowing the resulting UX(2) to bind and reduce arenes, forming inverse sandwich molecules [X(2)U(micro-eta(6):eta(6)-arene)UX(2)] and a UX(4) by-product. Calculations and kinetic studies suggest a 'cooperative small-molecule activation' mechanism involving spontaneous arene reduction as an X-ligand is transferred. These mild reaction conditions allow functionalized arenes such as arylsilanes to be incorporated. The bulky UX(3) are also inert to reagents such as boranes that would react with the traditional harsh reaction conditions, allowing the development of a new in situ arene C-H bond functionalization methodology converting C-H to C-B bonds.",2
Dissecting the mechanisms of a class of chemical glycosylation using primary (1)(3)C kinetic isotope effects.,"Although arguably the most important reaction in glycoscience, chemical glycosylations are among the least well understood of organic chemical reactions, resulting in an unnecessarily high degree of empiricism and a brake on rational development in this critical area. To address this problem, primary (13)C kinetic isotope effects have now been determined for the formation of beta- and alpha-manno- and glucopyranosides using a natural abundance NMR method. In contrast to the common current assumption, for three of the four cases studied the experimental and computed values are indicative of associative displacement of the intermediate covalent glycosyl trifluoromethanesulfonates. For the formation of the alpha-mannopyranosides, the experimentally determined KIE differs significantly from that computed for an associative displacement, which is strongly suggestive of a dissociative mechanism that approaches the intermediacy of a glycosyl oxocarbenium ion. The application of analogous experiments to other glycosylation systems should shed further light on their mechanisms and thus assist in the design of better reactions conditions with improved stereoselectivity.",2
Utilizing redox-chemistry to elucidate the nature of exciton transitions in supramolecular dye nanotubes.,"Supramolecular assemblies that interact with light have recently garnered much interest as well-defined nanoscale materials for electronic excitation energy collection and transport. However, to control such complex systems it is essential to understand how their various parts interact and whether these interactions result in coherently shared excited states (excitons) or in diffusive energy transport between them. Here, we address this by studying a model system consisting of two concentric cylindrical dye aggregates in a light-harvesting nanotube. Through selective chemistry we are able to unambiguously determine the supramolecular origin of the observed excitonic transitions. These results required the development of a new theoretical model of the supramolecular structure of the assembly. Our results demonstrate that the two cylinders of the nanotube have distinct spectral responses and are best described as two separate, weakly coupled excitonic systems. Understanding such interactions is critical to the control of energy transfer on a molecular scale, a goal in various applications ranging from artificial photosynthesis to molecular electronics.",2
Catalytic asymmetric carbon-carbon bond formation using alkenes as alkylmetal equivalents.,"Catalytic asymmetric conjugate addition reactions with organometallic reagents are powerful reactions in synthetic chemistry. Procedures that use non-stabilized carbanions have been developed extensively, but these suffer from a number of limitations that prevent their use in many situations. Here, we report that alkylmetal species generated in situ from alkenes can be used in highly enantioselective 1,4-addition initiated by a copper catalyst. Using alkenes as starting materials is desirable because they are readily available and have favourable properties when compared to pre-made organometallics. High levels of enantioselectivity are observed at room temperature in a range of solvents, and the reaction tolerates functional groups that are not compatible with comparable methods-a necessary prerequisite for efficient and protecting-group-free strategies for synthesis.",2
An ultrasensitive universal detector based on neutralizer displacement.,"Diagnostic technologies that can provide the simultaneous detection of nucleic acids for gene expression, proteins for host response and small molecules for profiling the human metabolome will have a significant advantage in providing comprehensive patient monitoring. Molecular sensors that report changes in the electrostatics of a sensor's surface on analyte binding have shown unprecedented sensitivity in the detection of charged biomolecules, but do not lend themselves to the detection of small molecules, which do not carry significant charge. Here, we introduce the neutralizer displacement assay that allows charge-based sensing to be applied to any class of molecule irrespective of the analyte charge. The neutralizer displacement assay starts with an aptamer probe bound to a neutralizer. When analyte binding occurs the neutralizer is displaced, which results in a dramatic change in the surface charge for all types of analytes. We have tested the sensitivity, speed and specificity of this system in the detection of a panel of molecules: (deoxy)ribonucleic acid, ribonucleic acid, cocaine, adenosine triphosphate and thrombin.",2
Revealing the stereospecific chemistry of the reaction of Cl with aligned CHD(3)(nu(1) = 1).,"The concept of geometrical constraints and steric hindrance in reactions is implanted deeply in a chemist's 'chemical intuition'. However, until now a true three-dimensional view of these steric effects has not been realized experimentally for any chemical reaction in full. Here we report the complete three-dimensional characterization of the sterics of a benchmark polyatomic reaction by measuring the dependence of the product state-resolved angular distributions on the spatial alignment of the reactive bond in a crossed molecular beam experiment. The results prove the existence of two distinct microscopic reaction mechanisms. Detailed analysis reveals that the origin of the stereodynamics in the HCl(nu = 0) + CD(3)(0(0)) product channel can be captured by a textbook line-of-centres collision model. In contrast, a time-delay pathway, which includes a sharp switch from in-plane to out-of-plane scattering in the forwards direction, appears to be operative in forming the excited HCl(nu = 1) + CD(3)(0(0)) product pair.",2
Guided desaturation of unactivated aliphatics.,"The excision of hydrogen from an aliphatic carbon chain to produce an isolated olefin (desaturation) without overoxidation is one of the most impressive and powerful biosynthetic transformations for which there are no simple and mild laboratory substitutes. The versatility of olefins and the range of reactions they undergo are unsurpassed in functional group space. Thus, the conversion of a relatively inert aliphatic system into its unsaturated counterpart could open new possibilities in retrosynthesis. In this article, the invention of a directing group to achieve such a transformation under mild, operationally simple, metal-free conditions is outlined. This 'portable desaturase' (Tz(o)Cl) is a bench-stable, commercial entity (Aldrich, catalogue number L510092) that is facile to install on alcohol and amine functionalities to ultimately effect remote desaturation, while leaving behind a synthetically useful tosyl group.",2
Crystal structures of Lambda-[Ru(phen)(2)dppz](2)(+) with oligonucleotides containing TA/TA and AT/AT steps show two intercalation modes.,"The ruthenium complex [Ru(phen)(2)(dppz)](2+) (where phen is phenanthroline and dppz dipyridophenazine is known as a 'light switch' complex because its luminescence in solution is significantly enhanced in the presence of DNA. This property is poised to serve in diagnostic and therapeutic applications, but its binding mode with DNA needs to be elucidated further. Here, we describe the crystal structures of the Lambda enantiomer bound to two oligonucleotide duplexes. The dppz ligand intercalates symmetrically and perpendicularly from the minor groove of the d(CCGGTACCGG)(2) duplex at the central TA/TA step, but not at the central AT/AT step of d(CCGGATCCGG)(2). In both structures, however, a second ruthenium complex links the duplexes through the combination of a shallower angled intercalation into the C(1)C(2)/G(9)G(10) step at the end of the duplex, and semi-intercalation into the G(3)G(4) step of an adjacent duplex. The TA/TA specificity of the perpendicular intercalation arises from the packing of phenanthroline ligands against the adenosine residue.",2
Crystal structure of Delta-[Ru(bpy)(2)dppz](2)(+) bound to mismatched DNA reveals side-by-side metalloinsertion and intercalation.,"DNA mismatches represent a novel target in the development of diagnostics and therapeutics for cancer, because deficiencies in DNA mismatch repair are implicated in cancers, and cells that are repair-deficient show a high frequency of mismatches. Metal complexes with bulky intercalating ligands serve as probes for DNA mismatches. Here, we report the high-resolution (0.92 A) crystal structure of the ruthenium 'light switch' complex Delta-[Ru(bpy)(2)dppz](2+) (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine and dppz = dipyridophenazine), which is known to show luminescence on binding to duplex DNA, bound to both mismatched and well-matched sites in the oligonucleotide 5'-(dCGGAAATTACCG)(2)-3' (underline denotes AA mismatches). Two crystallographically independent views reveal that the complex binds mismatches through metalloinsertion, ejecting both mispaired adenosines. Additional ruthenium complexes are intercalated at well-matched sites, creating an array of complexes in the minor groove stabilized by stacking interactions between bpy ligands and extruded adenosines. This structure attests to the generality of metalloinsertion and metallointercalation as DNA binding modes.",2
The progression of chiral anions from concepts to applications in asymmetric catalysis.,"Despite the tremendous advances of the past four decades, chemists are far from being able to use chiral catalysts to control the stereoselectivity of any desired reaction. New concepts for the construction and mode of operation of chiral catalysts have the potential to open up previously inaccessible reaction space. The recognition and categorization of distinct approaches seems to play a role in triggering rapid exploration of new territory. This Review both reflects on the origins as well as details a selection of the latest examples of an area that has advanced considerably within the past five years or so: the use of chiral anions in asymmetric catalysis. Defining reactions as involving chiral anions is a difficult task owing to uncertainties over the exact catalytic mechanisms. Nevertheless, we attempt to provide an overview of the breadth of reactions that could reasonably fall under this umbrella.",2
An improved high-performance lithium-air battery.,"Although dominating the consumer electronics markets as the power source of choice for popular portable devices, the common lithium battery is not yet suited for use in sustainable electrified road transport. The development of advanced, higher-energy lithium batteries is essential in the rapid establishment of the electric car market. Owing to its exceptionally high energy potentiality, the lithium-air battery is a very appealing candidate for fulfilling this role. However, the performance of such batteries has been limited to only a few charge-discharge cycles with low rate capability. Here, by choosing a suitable stable electrolyte and appropriate cell design, we demonstrate a lithium-air battery capable of operating over many cycles with capacity and rate values as high as 5,000 mAh g(carbon)(-1) and 3 A g(carbon)(-1), respectively. For this battery we estimate an energy density value that is much higher than those offered by the currently available lithium-ion battery technology.",2
"The synthesis, crystal structure and charge-transport properties of hexacene.","Acenes can be thought of as one-dimensional strips of graphene and they have the potential to be used in the next generation of electronic devices. However, because acenes larger than pentacene have been found to be unstable, it was generally accepted that they would not be particularly useful materials under normal conditions. Here, we show that, by using a physical vapour-transport method, platelet-shaped crystals of hexacene can be prepared from a monoketone precursor. These crystals are stable in the dark for a long period of time under ambient conditions. In the crystal, the molecules are arranged in herringbone arrays, quite similar to that observed for pentacene. A field-effect transistor made using a single crystal of hexacene displayed a hole mobility significantly higher than that of pentacene. This result suggests that it might be instructive to further explore the potential of other higher acenes.",2
Non-Markovian polymer reaction kinetics.,"Describing the kinetics of polymer reactions, such as the formation of loops and hairpins in nucleic acids or polypeptides, is complicated by the structural dynamics of their chains. Although both intramolecular reactions, such as cyclization, and intermolecular reactions have been studied extensively, both experimentally and theoretically, there is to date no exact explicit analytical treatment of transport-limited polymer reaction kinetics, even in the case of the simplest (Rouse) model of monomers connected by linear springs. We introduce a new analytical approach to calculate the mean reaction time of polymer reactions that encompasses the non-Markovian dynamics of monomer motion. This requires that the conformational statistics of the polymer at the very instant of reaction be determined, which provides, as a by-product, new information on the reaction path. We show that the typical reactive conformation of the polymer is more extended than the equilibrium conformation, which leads to reaction times significantly shorter than predicted by the existing classical Markovian theory.",2
Controlled homocatenation of boron on a transition metal.,"Only a handful of elements are able to be controllably homocatenated (that is, to be formed into one- or two-dimensional chains or rings of the element), because most have weak element-element bonds. Boron forms strong B-B bonds, but its favourable cluster formation makes homocatenation very difficult. Recently, the coupling of borylene (:BR) ligands on a metal was predicted computationally. We have brought this prediction to fruition experimentally, and extended it by adding two further borylene units, stepwise forming a B(4) chain bound to a metal under mild conditions. This complex is a useful model for understanding the metal-boron interactions required to promote transition of the boron atoms from borylene ligands to oligoborane networks bound side-on. The concept shows great promise for the controlled construction of one-dimensional boron chains.",2
"Mechanically induced chemiluminescence from polymers incorporating a 1,2-dioxetane unit in the main chain.","Nature uses mechanochemical transduction processes to achieve diverse and vital functions, such as hearing, cellular adhesion and gating of ion channels. One fascinating example of biological mechanotransduction is the emission of light on mechanical stimulation. However, molecular-level transduction of force into luminescence in a synthetic system remains a challenge. Here, we show that bis(adamantyl)-1,2-dioxetane emits visible light when force is applied to a polymer chain or network in which this unit is incorporated. Bright-blue luminescence was observed on sonication of solutions of dioxetane-containing linear polymers and on the straining of polymer networks with dioxetane crosslinkers. Light is emitted from the adamantanone-excited state that forms on opening of the four-membered dioxetane ring. Increased sensitivity and colour tuning were achieved by energy transfer to suitable acceptors. High spatial and temporal resolutions highlight the potential to study the failure of polymeric materials in unprecedented detail.",2
Closed-shell and open-shell square-planar iridium nitrido complexes.,"Coupling reactions of nitrogen atoms represent elementary steps to many important heterogeneously catalysed reactions, such as the Haber-Bosch process or the selective catalytic reduction of NO(x) to give N(2). For molecular nitrido (and related oxo) complexes, it is well established that the intrinsic reactivity, for example nucleophilicity or electrophilicity of the nitrido (or oxo) ligand, can be attributed to M-N (M-O) ground-state bonding. In recent years, nitrogen (oxygen)-centred radical reactivity was ascribed to the possible redox non-innocence of nitrido (oxo) ligands. However, unequivocal spectroscopic characterization of such transient nitridyl {M=N(*)} (or oxyl {M-O(*)}) complexes remained elusive. Here we describe the synthesis and characterization of the novel, closed-shell and open-shell square-planar iridium nitrido complexes [IrN(L(t-Bu))](+) and [IrN(L(t-Bu))] (L(t-Bu)=N(CHCHP-t-Bu(2))(2)). Spectroscopic characterization and quantum chemical calculations for [IrN(L(t-Bu))] indicate a considerable nitridyl, {Ir=N(*)}, radical character. The clean formation of Ir(I)-N(2) complexes via binuclear coupling is rationalized in terms of nitrido redox non-innocence in [IrN(L(t-Bu))].",2
Ultrafast dynamics in the power stroke of a molecular rotary motor.,"Light-driven molecular motors convert light into mechanical energy through excited-state reactions. Unidirectional rotary molecular motors based on chiral overcrowded alkenes operate through consecutive photochemical and thermal steps. The thermal (helix inverting) step has been optimized successfully through variations in molecular structure, but much less is known about the photochemical step, which provides power to the motor. Ultimately, controlling the efficiency of molecular motors requires a detailed picture of the molecular dynamics on the excited-state potential energy surface. Here, we characterize the primary events that follow photon absorption by a unidirectional molecular motor using ultrafast fluorescence up-conversion measurements with sub 50 fs time resolution. We observe an extraordinarily fast initial relaxation out of the Franck-Condon region that suggests a barrierless reaction coordinate. This fast molecular motion is shown to be accompanied by the excitation of coherent excited-state structural motion. The implications of these observations for manipulating motor efficiency are discussed.",2
Biosynthesis of the tunicamycin antibiotics proceeds via unique exo-glycal intermediates.,"The tunicamycins are archetypal nucleoside antibiotics targeting bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis and eukaryotic protein N-glycosylation. Understanding the biosynthesis of their unusual carbon framework may lead to variants with improved selectivity. Here, we demonstrate in vitro recapitulation of key sugar-manipulating enzymes from this pathway. TunA is found to exhibit unusual regioselectivity in the reduction of a key alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. The product of this reaction is shown to be the preferred substrate for TunF--an epimerase that converts the glucose derivative to a galactose. In Streptomyces strains in which another gene (tunB) is deleted, the biosynthesis is shown to stall at this exo-glycal product. These investigations confirm the combined TunA/F activity and delineate the ordering of events in the metabolic pathway. This is the first time these surprising exo-glycal intermediates have been seen in biology. They suggest that construction of the aminodialdose core of tunicamycin exploits their enol ether motif in a mode of C-C bond formation not previously observed in nature, to create an 11-carbon chain.",2
Single solvent molecules can affect the dynamics of substitution reactions.,"Solvents have a profound influence on chemical reactions in solution and have long been used to control their outcome. Such effects are generally considered to be governed by thermodynamics; however, little is known about the steric effects of solvent molecules. Here, we probe the influence of individual solvent molecules on reaction dynamics and present results on the atomistic dynamics of a microsolvated chemical reaction--the fundamentally important nucleophilic substitution reaction. We study the reaction of OH(-) with CH(3)I using a technique that combines crossed-beam imaging with a cold source of microsolvated reactants. Our results reveal several distinct reaction mechanisms for different degrees of solvation; surprisingly, the classical co-linear substitution mechanism only dominates the dynamics for mono-solvated reactants. We analyse the relative importance of the different mechanisms using ab initio calculations and show that the steric characteristics are at least as relevant as the energetics in understanding the influence of solvent molecules in such microsolvated reactions.",2
Protein camouflage in cytochrome c-calixarene complexes.,"Small molecules that recognize protein surfaces are important tools for modifying protein interaction properties. Since the 1980s, several thousand studies concerning calixarenes and host-guest interactions have been published. Although there is growing interest in protein-calixarene interactions, only limited structural information has been available to date. We now report the crystal structure of a protein-calixarene complex. The water-soluble p-sulfonatocalix[4]arene is shown to bind the lysine-rich cytochrome c at three different sites. Binding curves obtained from NMR titrations reveal an interaction process that involves two or more binding sites. Together, the data indicate a dynamic complex in which the calixarene explores the surface of cytochrome c. In addition to providing valuable information on protein recognition, the data also indicate that the calixarene is a mediator of protein-protein interactions, with potential applications in generating assemblies and promoting crystallization.",2
Acyclic cucurbit[n]uril molecular containers enhance the solubility and bioactivity of poorly soluble pharmaceuticals.,"The solubility characteristics of 40-70% of new drug candidates are so poor that they cannot be formulated on their own, so new methods for increasing drug solubility are highly prized. Here, we describe a new class of general-purpose solubilizing agents-acyclic cucurbituril-type containers-which increase the solubility of ten insoluble drugs by a factor of between 23 and 2,750 by forming container-drug complexes. The containers exhibit low in vitro toxicity in human liver, kidney and monocyte cell lines, and outbred Swiss Webster mice tolerate high doses of the container without sickness or weight loss. Paclitaxel solubilized by the acyclic cucurbituril-type containers kills cervical and ovarian cancer cells more efficiently than paclitaxel alone. The acyclic cucurbituril-type containers preferentially bind cationic and aromatic drugs, but also solubilize neutral drugs such as paclitaxel, and represent an attractive extension of cyclodextrin-based technology for drug solubilization and delivery.",2
A soluble copper-bipyridine water-oxidation electrocatalyst.,"The oxidation of water to O(2) is a key challenge in the production of chemical fuels from electricity. Although several catalysts have been developed for this reaction, substantial challenges remain towards the ultimate goal of an efficient, inexpensive and robust electrocatalyst. Reported here is the first copper-based catalyst for electrolytic water oxidation. Copper-bipyridine-hydroxo complexes rapidly form in situ from simple commercially available copper salts and bipyridine at high pH. Cyclic voltammetry of these solutions at pH 11.8-13.3 shows large, irreversible currents, indicative of catalysis. The production of O(2) is demonstrated both electrochemically and with a fluorescence probe. Catalysis occurs at about 750 mV overpotential. Electrochemical, electron paramagnetic resonance and other studies indicate that the catalyst is a soluble molecular species, that the dominant species in the catalytically active solutions is (2,2'-bipyridine)Cu(OH)(2) and that this is among the most rapid homogeneous water-oxidation catalysts, with a turnover frequency of ~100 s(-1).",2
Biomimetic radical polymerization via cooperative assembly of segregating templates.,"Segregation and templating approaches have been honed by billions of years of evolution to direct many complex biological processes. Nature uses segregation to improve biochemical control by organizing reactants into defined, well-regulated environments, and the transfer of genetic information is a primary function of templating. The ribosome, wherein messenger RNA is translated into polypeptides, combines both techniques to allow for ideal biopolymer syntheses. Herein is presented a biomimetic segregation/templating approach to synthetic radical polymerization. Polymerization of a nucleobase-containing vinyl monomer in the presence of a complementary block copolymer template of low molecular weight yields high molecular weight (M(w) up to ~400,000 g mol(-1)), extremely low polydispersity (</=1.08) daughter polymers. Control is attained by segregation of propagating radicals in discrete micelle cores (via cooperative assembly of dynamic template polymers). Significantly reduced bimolecular termination, combined with controlled propagation along a defined number of templates, ensures unprecedented control to afford well-defined high molecular weight polymers.",2
Light-triggered self-construction of supramolecular organic nanowires as metallic interconnects.,"The construction of soft and processable organic material able to display metallic conduction properties-a large density of freely moving charges-is a major challenge for electronics. Films of doped conjugated polymers are widely used as semiconductor devices, but metallic-type transport in the bulk of such materials remains extremely rare. On the other hand, single-walled carbon nanotubes can exhibit remarkably low contact resistances with related large currents, but are intrinsically very difficult to isolate and process. Here, we describe the self-assembly of supramolecular organic nanowires between two metallic electrodes, from a solution of triarylamine derivative, under the simultaneous action of light and electric field triggers. They exhibit a combination of large conductivity values (>5 x 10(3) S m(-1)) and a low interface resistance (<2 x 10(-4) Omega m). Moreover, the resistance of nanowires in series with metal interfaces systematically decreases when the temperature is lowered to 1.5 K, revealing an intrinsic metallic behaviour.",2
Engineering methylaspartate ammonia lyase for the asymmetric synthesis of unnatural amino acids.,"The redesign of enzymes to produce catalysts for a predefined transformation remains a major challenge in protein engineering. Here, we describe the structure-based engineering of methylaspartate ammonia lyase (which in nature catalyses the conversion of 3-methylaspartate to ammonia and 2-methylfumarate) to accept a variety of substituted amines and fumarates and catalyse the asymmetric synthesis of aspartic acid derivatives. We obtained two single-active-site mutants, one exhibiting a wide nucleophile scope including structurally diverse linear and cyclic alkylamines and one with broad electrophile scope including fumarate derivatives with alkyl, aryl, alkoxy, aryloxy, alkylthio and arylthio substituents at the C2 position. Both mutants have an enlarged active site that accommodates the new substrates while retaining the high stereo- and regioselectivity of the wild-type enzyme. As an example, we demonstrate a highly enantio- and diastereoselective synthesis of threo-3-benzyloxyaspartate (an important inhibitor of neuronal excitatory glutamate transporters in the brain).",2
Ion-paired chiral ligands for asymmetric palladium catalysis.,"Conventional chiral ligands rely on the use of a covalently constructed, single chiral molecule embedded with coordinative functional groups. Here, we report a new strategy for the design of a chiral ligand for asymmetric transition-metal catalysis; our approach is based on the development of an achiral cationic ammonium-phosphine hybrid ligand paired with a chiral binaphtholate anion. This ion-paired chiral ligand imparts a remarkable stereocontrolling ability to its palladium complex, which catalyses a highly enantioselective allylic alkylation of alpha-nitrocarboxylates. By exploiting the possible combinations of the achiral onium entities with suitable coordinative functionalities and readily available chiral acids, this approach should contribute to the development of a broad range of metal-catalysed, stereoselective chemical transformations.",2
Multiphase design of autonomic self-healing thermoplastic elastomers.,"The development of polymers that can spontaneously repair themselves after mechanical damage would significantly improve the safety, lifetime, energy efficiency and environmental impact of man-made materials. Most approaches to self-healing materials require the input of external energy, healing agents, solvent or plasticizer. Despite intense research in this area, the synthesis of a stiff material with intrinsic self-healing ability remains a key challenge. Here, we show a design of multiphase supramolecular thermoplastic elastomers that combine high modulus and toughness with spontaneous healing capability. The designed hydrogen-bonding brush polymers self-assemble into a hard-soft microphase-separated system, combining the enhanced stiffness and toughness of nanocomposites with the self-healing capability of dynamic supramolecular assemblies. In contrast to previous self-healing polymers, this new system spontaneously self-heals as a single-component solid material at ambient conditions, without the need for any external stimulus, healing agent, plasticizer or solvent.",2
The mechanism of proton conduction in phosphoric acid.,"Neat liquid phosphoric acid (H(3)PO(4)) has the highest intrinsic proton conductivity of any known substance and is a useful model for understanding proton transport in other phosphate-based systems in biology and clean energy technologies. Here, we present an ab initio molecular dynamics study that reveals, for the first time, the microscopic mechanism of this high proton conductivity. Anomalously fast proton transport in hydrogen-bonded systems involves a structural diffusion mechanism in which intramolecular proton transfer is driven by specific hydrogen bond rearrangements in the surrounding environment. Aqueous media transport excess charge defects through local hydrogen bond rearrangements that drive individual proton transfer reactions. In contrast, strong, polarizable hydrogen bonds in phosphoric acid produce coupled proton motion and a pronounced protic dielectric response of the medium, leading to the formation of extended, polarized hydrogen-bonded chains. The interplay between these chains and a frustrated hydrogen-bond network gives rise to the high proton conductivity.",2
Metal-organic frameworks with dynamic interlocked components.,"The dynamics of mechanically interlocked molecules such as rotaxanes and catenanes have been studied in solution as examples of rudimentary molecular switches and machines, but in this medium, the molecules are randomly dispersed and their motion incoherent. As a strategy for achieving a higher level of molecular organization, we have constructed a metal-organic framework material using a [2]rotaxane as the organic linker and binuclear Cu(II) units as the nodes. Activation of the as-synthesized material creates a void space inside the rigid framework that allows the soft macrocyclic ring of the [2]rotaxane to rotate rapidly, unimpeded by neighbouring molecular components. Variable-temperature (13)C and (2)H solid-state NMR experiments are used to characterize the nature and rate of the dynamic processes occurring inside this unique material. These results provide a blueprint for the future creation of solid-state molecular switches and molecular machines based on mechanically interlocked molecules.",2
The gold-sulfur interface at the nanoscale.,"Thiolate-protected gold surfaces and interfaces, relevant for self-assembled monolayers of organic molecules on gold, for passivated gold nanoclusters and for molecule-gold junctions, are archetypal systems in various fields of current nanoscience research, materials science, inorganic chemistry and surface science. Understanding this interface at the nanometre scale is essential for a wide range of potential applications for site-specific bioconjugate labelling and sensing, drug delivery and medical therapy, functionalization of gold surfaces for sensing, molecular recognition and molecular electronics, and gold nanoparticle catalysis. During the past five years, considerable experimental and theoretical advances have furthered our understanding of the molecular structure of the gold-sulfur interface in these systems. This Review discusses the recent progress from the viewpoint of theory and computations, with connections to relevant experiments.",2
A molecular ruthenium catalyst with water-oxidation activity comparable to that of photosystem II.,"Across chemical disciplines, an interest in developing artificial water splitting to O(2) and H(2), driven by sunlight, has been motivated by the need for practical and environmentally friendly power generation without the consumption of fossil fuels. The central issue in light-driven water splitting is the efficiency of the water oxidation, which in the best-known catalysts falls short of the desired level by approximately two orders of magnitude. Here, we show that it is possible to close that 'two orders of magnitude' gap with a rationally designed molecular catalyst [Ru(bda)(isoq)(2)] (H(2)bda = 2,2'-bipyridine-6,6'-dicarboxylic acid; isoq = isoquinoline). This speeds up the water oxidation to an unprecedentedly high reaction rate with a turnover frequency of >300 s(-1). This value is, for the first time, moderately comparable with the reaction rate of 100-400 s(-1) of the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II in vivo.",2
Protein fold determined by paramagnetic magic-angle spinning solid-state NMR spectroscopy.,"Biomacromolecules that are challenging for the usual structural techniques can be studied with atomic resolution by solid-state NMR spectroscopy. However, the paucity of distance restraints >5 A, traditionally derived from measurements of magnetic dipole-dipole couplings between protein nuclei, is a major bottleneck that hampers such structure elucidation efforts. Here, we describe a general approach that enables the rapid determination of global protein fold in the solid phase via measurements of nuclear paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PREs) in several analogues of the protein of interest containing covalently attached paramagnetic tags, without the use of conventional internuclear distance restraints. The method is demonstrated using six cysteine-EDTA-Cu(2+) mutants of the 56-residue B1 immunoglobulin-binding domain of protein G, for which ~230 longitudinal backbone (15)N PREs corresponding to distances of ~10-20 A were obtained. The mean protein fold determined in this manner agrees with the X-ray structure with a backbone atom root-mean-square deviation of 1.8 A.",2
"A gold-catalysed enantioselective Cope rearrangement of achiral 1,5-dienes.","Since the discovery of the Cope rearrangement in the 1940s, no asymmetric variant of the rearrangement of achiral 1,5-dienes has emerged, despite the successes that have been achieved with its heteroatom variants (Claisen, aza-Cope, and so on). This article reports the first example of an enantioselective Cope reaction that starts from an achiral diene. The new gold(I) catalyst derived from double Cl(-)-abstraction of ((S)-3,5-xylyl-PHANEPHOS(AuCl)(2)), has been developed for the sigmatropic rearrangement of alkenyl-methylenecyclopropanes. The reaction proceeds at low temperature and the synthetically useful vinylcyclopropane products are obtained in high yield and enantioselectivity. Density functional theory calculations predict that: (1) the reaction proceeds via a cyclic carbenium ion intermediate, (2) the relief of strain in the methylenecyclopropane moiety provides the thermodynamic driving force for the rearrangement and (3) metal complexation of the transition-state structure lowers the rearrangement barriers.",2
Electronic coherence lineshapes reveal hidden excitonic correlations in photosynthetic light harvesting.,"The effective absorption cross-section of a molecule (acceptor) can be greatly increased by associating it with a cluster of molecules that absorb light and transfer the excitation energy to the acceptor molecule. The basic mechanism of such light harvesting by Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is well established, but recent experiments have revealed a new feature whereby excitation is coherently shared among donor and acceptor molecules during FRET. In the present study, two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy was used to examine energy transfer at ambient temperature in a naturally occurring light-harvesting protein (PE545 of the marine cryptophyte alga Rhodomonas sp. strain CS24). Quantum beating was observed across a range of excitation frequencies. The shapes of those features in the two-dimensional spectra were examined. Through simulations, we show that two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy provides a probe of the adiabaticity of the free energy landscape underlying light harvesting.",2
Elucidation of the timescales and origins of quantum electronic coherence in LHCII.,"Photosynthetic organisms harvest sunlight with near unity quantum efficiency. The complexity of the electronic structure and energy transfer pathways within networks of photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes often obscures the mechanisms behind the efficient light-absorption-to-charge conversion process. Recent experiments, particularly using two-dimensional spectroscopy, have detected long-lived quantum coherence, which theory suggests may contribute to the effectiveness of photosynthetic energy transfer. Here, we present a new, direct method to access coherence signals: a coherence-specific polarization sequence, which isolates the excitonic coherence features from the population signals that usually dominate two-dimensional spectra. With this polarization sequence, we elucidate coherent dynamics and determine the overall measurable lifetime of excitonic coherence in the major light-harvesting complex of photosystem II. Coherence decays on two distinct timescales of 47 fs and ~800 fs. We present theoretical calculations to show that these two timescales are from weakly and moderately strongly coupled pigments, respectively.",2
Reversible hydrogen storage using CO2 and a proton-switchable iridium catalyst in aqueous media under mild temperatures and pressures.,"Green plants convert CO(2) to sugar for energy storage via photosynthesis. We report a novel catalyst that uses CO(2) and hydrogen to store energy in formic acid. Using a homogeneous iridium catalyst with a proton-responsive ligand, we show the first reversible and recyclable hydrogen storage system that operates under mild conditions using CO(2), formate and formic acid. This system is energy-efficient and green because it operates near ambient conditions, uses water as a solvent, produces high-pressure CO-free hydrogen, and uses pH to control hydrogen production or consumption. The extraordinary and switchable catalytic activity is attributed to the multifunctional ligand, which acts as a proton-relay and strong pi-donor, and is rationalized by theoretical and experimental studies.",2
"Metal-directed, chemically tunable assembly of one-, two- and three-dimensional crystalline protein arrays.","Proteins represent the most sophisticated building blocks available to an organism and to the laboratory chemist. Yet, in contrast to nearly all other types of molecular building blocks, the designed self-assembly of proteins has largely been inaccessible because of the chemical and structural heterogeneity of protein surfaces. To circumvent the challenge of programming extensive non-covalent interactions to control protein self-assembly, we have previously exploited the directionality and strength of metal coordination interactions to guide the formation of closed, homoligomeric protein assemblies. Here, we extend this strategy to the generation of periodic protein arrays. We show that a monomeric protein with properly oriented coordination motifs on its surface can arrange, on metal binding, into one-dimensional nanotubes and two- or three-dimensional crystalline arrays with dimensions that collectively span nearly the entire nano- and micrometre scale. The assembly of these arrays is tuned predictably by external stimuli, such as metal concentration and pH.",2
Multidimensional steric parameters in the analysis of asymmetric catalytic reactions.,"Although asymmetric catalysis is universally dependent on spatial interactions to impart specific chirality on a given substrate, examination of steric effects in these catalytic systems remains empirical. Previous efforts by our group and others have seen correlation between steric parameters developed by Charton and simple substituents in both substrate and ligand; however, more complex substituents were not found to be correlative. Here, we review and compare the steric parameters common in quantitative structure activity relationships (QSAR), a common method for pharmaceutical function optimization, and how they might be applied in asymmetric catalysis, as the two fields are undeniably similar. We re-evaluate steric/enantioselection relationships, which we previously analysed with Charton steric parameters, using the more sophisticated Sterimol parameters developed by Verloop and co-workers in a QSAR context. Use of these Sterimol parameters led to strong correlations in numerous processes where Charton parameters had previously failed. Sterimol parameterization also allows for greater mechanistic insight into the key elements of asymmetric induction within these systems.",2
A stable germanone as the first isolated heavy ketone with a terminal oxygen atom.,"The carbon-oxygen double bond of ketones (R(2)C=O) makes them among the most important organic compounds, but their homologues, heavy ketones with an E=O double bond (E = Si, Ge, Sn or Pb), had not been isolated as stable compounds. Their unavailability as monomeric molecules is ascribed to their high tendency for intermolecular oligomerization or polymerization via opening of the E=O double bond. Can such an intermolecular process be inhibited by bulky protecting groups? We now report that it can, with the first isolation of a monomeric germanium ketone analogue (Eind)(2)Ge=O (Eind = 1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7-octaethyl-s-hydrindacen-4-yl), stabilized by appropriately designed bulky Eind groups, with a planar tricoordinate germanium atom. Computational studies and chemical reactions suggest the Ge=O double bond is highly polarized with a contribution of a charge-separated form (Eind)(2)Ge(+)-O(-). The germanone thus exhibits unique reactivities that are not observed with ordinary ketones, including the spontaneous trapping of CO(2) gas to provide a cyclic addition product.",2
Two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy reveals the complex behaviour of an amyloid fibril inhibitor.,"Amyloid formation has been implicated in the pathology of over 20 human diseases, but the rational design of amyloid inhibitors is hampered by a lack of structural information about amyloid-inhibitor complexes. We use isotope labelling and two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy to obtain a residue-specific structure for the complex of human amylin (the peptide responsible for islet amyloid formation in type 2 diabetes) with a known inhibitor (rat amylin). Based on its sequence, rat amylin should block formation of the C-terminal beta-sheet, but at 8 h after mixing, rat amylin blocks the N-terminal beta-sheet instead. At 24 h after mixing, rat amylin blocks neither beta-sheet and forms its own beta-sheet, most probably on the outside of the human fibrils. This is striking, because rat amylin is natively disordered and not previously known to form amyloid beta-sheets. The results show that even seemingly intuitive inhibitors may function by unforeseen and complex structural processes.",2
Integrated 3D-printed reactionware for chemical synthesis and analysis.,"Three-dimensional (3D) printing has the potential to transform science and technology by creating bespoke, low-cost appliances that previously required dedicated facilities to make. An attractive, but unexplored, application is to use a 3D printer to initiate chemical reactions by printing the reagents directly into a 3D reactionware matrix, and so put reactionware design, construction and operation under digital control. Here, using a low-cost 3D printer and open-source design software we produced reactionware for organic and inorganic synthesis, which included printed-in catalysts and other architectures with printed-in components for electrochemical and spectroscopic analysis. This enabled reactions to be monitored in situ so that different reactionware architectures could be screened for their efficacy for a given process, with a digital feedback mechanism for device optimization. Furthermore, solely by modifying reactionware architecture, reaction outcomes can be altered. Taken together, this approach constitutes a relatively cheap, automated and reconfigurable chemical discovery platform that makes techniques from chemical engineering accessible to typical synthetic laboratories.",2
An M(1)(8)L(2)(4) stellated cuboctahedron through post-stellation of an M(1)(2)L(2)(4) core.,"Platonic and Archimedean polyhedra, well-known to mathematicians, have been recently constructed by chemists at a molecular scale by defining the vertices and the edges with metal ions (M) and organic ligands (L), respectively. Here, we report the first synthesis of a concave-surface 'stellated polyhedron', constructed by extending the faces of its precursor polyhedron until they intersect, forming additional nodes. Our approach involves the formation of an M(12)L(24) cuboctahedron core, the linkers of which each bear a pendant ligand site that is subsequently able to bind an additional metal centre to form the stellated M(18)L(24) cuboctahedron. During this post-stellation process, the square faces of the M(12)L(24) core are closed by coordination of the pendant moieties to the additional metal centres, but they are re-opened on removing these metals ions from the vertices. This behaviour is reminiscent of the analogous metal-triggered gate opening-closing switches found in spherical virus capsids.",2
Ionization of dimethyluracil dimers leads to facile proton transfer in the absence of hydrogen bonds.,"Proton transfer is ubiquitous in chemistry and biology, occurring, for example, in proteins, enzyme reactions and across proton channels and pumps. However, it has always been described in the context of hydrogen-bonding networks ('proton wires') acting as proton conduits. Here, we report efficient intramolecular ionization-induced proton transfer across a 1,3-dimethyluracil dimer, a model pi-stacked system with no hydrogen bonds. Upon photoionization by tunable vacuum ultraviolet synchrotron radiation, the dimethyluracil dimer undergoes proton transfer and dissociates to produce a protonated monomer. Deuterated dimethyluracil experiments confirm that proton transfer occurs from the methyl groups and not from the aromatic C-H sites. Calculations reveal qualitative differences between the proton transfer reaction coordinate in the pi-stacked and hydrogen-bonded base pairs, and that proton transfer in methylated dimers involves significant rearrangements of the two fragments, facilitating a relatively low potential energy barrier of only 0.6 eV in the ionized dimer.",2
Self-assembly of the oxy-tyrosinase core and the fundamental components of phenolic hydroxylation.,"The enzyme tyrosinase contains two Cu(I) centres, trigonally coordinated by imidazole nitrogens of six conserved histidine residues. The enzyme activates O(2) to form a micro-eta(2):eta(2)-peroxo-dicopper(II) core, which hydroxylates tyrosine to a catechol in the first committed step of melanin biosynthesis. Here, we report a family of synthetic peroxo complexes, with spectroscopic and chemical features consistent with those of oxygenated tyrosinase, formed through the self-assembly of monodentate imidazole ligands, Cu(I) and O(2) at -125 degrees C. An extensively studied complex reproduces the enzymatic electrophilic oxidation of exogenous phenolic substrates to catechols in good stoichiometric yields. The self-assembly and subsequent reactivity support the intrinsic stability of the Cu(2)O(2) core with imidazole ligation, in the absence of a polypeptide framework, and the innate capacity to effect hydroxylation of phenolic substrates. These observations suggest that a foundational role of the protein matrix is to facilitate expression of properties native to the core by bearing the entropic costs of assembly and precluding undesired oxidative degradation pathways.",2
Imparting functionality to a metal-organic framework material by controlled nanoparticle encapsulation.,"Microporous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) that display permanent porosity show great promise for a myriad of purposes. The potential applications of MOFs can be developed further and extended by encapsulating various functional species (for example, nanoparticles) within the frameworks. However, despite increasing numbers of reports of nanoparticle/MOF composites, simultaneously to control the size, composition, dispersed nature, spatial distribution and confinement of the incorporated nanoparticles within MOF matrices remains a significant challenge. Here, we report a controlled encapsulation strategy that enables surfactant-capped nanostructured objects of various sizes, shapes and compositions to be enshrouded by a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8). The incorporated nanoparticles are well dispersed and fully confined within the ZIF-8 crystals. This strategy also allows the controlled incorporation of multiple nanoparticles within each ZIF-8 crystallite. The as-prepared nanoparticle/ZIF-8 composites exhibit active (catalytic, magnetic and optical) properties that derive from the nanoparticles as well as molecular sieving and orientation effects that originate from the framework material.",2
Chemically homogeneous and thermally reversible oxidation of epitaxial graphene.,"With its exceptional charge mobility, graphene holds great promise for applications in next-generation electronics. In an effort to tailor its properties and interfacial characteristics, the chemical functionalization of graphene is being actively pursued. The oxidation of graphene via the Hummers method is most widely used in current studies, although the chemical inhomogeneity and irreversibility of the resulting graphene oxide compromises its use in high-performance devices. Here, we present an alternative approach for oxidizing epitaxial graphene using atomic oxygen in ultrahigh vacuum. Atomic-resolution characterization with scanning tunnelling microscopy is quantitatively compared to density functional theory, showing that ultrahigh-vacuum oxidization results in uniform epoxy functionalization. Furthermore, this oxidation is shown to be fully reversible at temperatures as low as 260 degrees C using scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopic techniques. In this manner, ultrahigh-vacuum oxidation overcomes the limitations of Hummers-method graphene oxide, thus creating new opportunities for the study and application of chemically functionalized graphene.",2
Genetically encoded norbornene directs site-specific cellular protein labelling via a rapid bioorthogonal reaction.,"The site-specific incorporation of bioorthogonal groups via genetic code expansion provides a powerful general strategy for site-specifically labelling proteins with any probe. However, the slow reactivity of the bioorthogonal functional groups that can be encoded genetically limits the utility of this strategy. We demonstrate the genetic encoding of a norbornene amino acid using the pyrrolysyl tRNA synthetase/tRNA(CUA) pair in Escherichia coli and mammalian cells. We developed a series of tetrazine-based probes that exhibit 'turn-on' fluorescence on their rapid reaction with norbornenes. We demonstrate that the labelling of an encoded norbornene is specific with respect to the entire soluble E. coli proteome and thousands of times faster than established encodable bioorthogonal reactions. We show explicitly the advantages of this approach over state-of-the-art bioorthogonal reactions for protein labelling in vitro and on mammalian cells, and demonstrate the rapid bioorthogonal site-specific labelling of a protein on the mammalian cell surface.",2
Evidence that a 'dynamic knockout' in Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase does not affect the chemical step of catalysis.,"The question of whether protein motions play a role in the chemical step of enzymatic catalysis has generated much controversy in recent years. Debate has recently reignited over possible dynamic contributions to catalysis in dihydrofolate reductase, following conflicting conclusions from studies of the N23PP/S148A variant of the Escherichia coli enzyme. By investigating the temperature dependence of kinetic isotope effects, we present evidence that the reduction in the hydride transfer rate constants in this variant is not a direct result of impairment of conformational fluctuations. Instead, the conformational state of the enzyme immediately before hydride transfer, which determines the electrostatic environment of the active site, affects the rate constant for the reaction. Although protein motions are clearly important for binding and release of substrates and products, there appears to be no detectable dynamic coupling of protein motions to the hydride transfer step itself.",2
A two-dimensional polymer prepared by organic synthesis.,"Synthetic polymers are widely used materials, as attested by a production of more than 200 millions of tons per year, and are typically composed of linear repeat units. They may also be branched or irregularly crosslinked. Here, we introduce a two-dimensional polymer with internal periodicity composed of areal repeat units. This is an extension of Staudinger's polymerization concept (to form macromolecules by covalently linking repeat units together), but in two dimensions. A well-known example of such a two-dimensional polymer is graphene, but its thermolytic synthesis precludes molecular design on demand. Here, we have rationally synthesized an ordered, non-equilibrium two-dimensional polymer far beyond molecular dimensions. The procedure includes the crystallization of a specifically designed photoreactive monomer into a layered structure, a photo-polymerization step within the crystal and a solvent-induced delamination step that isolates individual two-dimensional polymers as free-standing, monolayered molecular sheets.",2
Topological insulator nanostructures for near-infrared transparent flexible electrodes.,"Topological insulators are an intriguing class of materials with an insulating bulk state and gapless Dirac-type edge/surface states. Recent theoretical work predicts that few-layer topological insulators are promising candidates for broadband and high-performance optoelectronic devices due to their spin-momentum-locked massless Dirac edge/surface states, which are topologically protected against all time-reversal-invariant perturbations. Here, we present the first experimental demonstration of near-infrared transparent flexible electrodes based on few-layer topological-insulator Bi(2)Se(3) nanostructures epitaxially grown on mica substrates by means of van der Waals epitaxy. The large, continuous, Bi(2)Se(3)-nanosheet transparent electrodes have single Dirac cone surface states, and exhibit sheet resistances as low as ~330 Omega per square, with a transparency of more than 70% over a wide range of wavelengths. Furthermore, Bi(2)Se(3)-nanosheet transparent electrodes show high chemical and thermal stabilities as well as excellent mechanical durability, which may lead to novel optoelectronic devices with unique properties.",2
Diamidocarbenes as versatile and reversible [2 + 1] cycloaddition reagents.,"We describe the synthesis of a variety of cyclopropanes and epoxides by combining a readily accessible and isolable N,N'-diamidocarbene with a range of structurally and electronically diverse olefins and aldehydes, including electron-rich derivatives. Surprisingly, the cyclopropanation and epoxidation reactions were discovered to be rapid and thermally reversible at relatively low temperatures, two features often desired for applications that utilize dynamic covalent chemistry. In addition, a diamidocyclopropane derivative prepared via this method was hydrolysed successfully to form the corresponding linear carboxylic acid in a metal- and carbon monoxide-free hydrocarboxylation reaction. As such, diamidocarbenes are expected to find utility in the synthesis of cyclopropanes, epoxides and their derivatives, as well as in dynamic covalent chemistry applications.",2
Autonomous movement of platinum-loaded stomatocytes.,"Polymer stomatocytes are bowl-shaped structures of nanosize dimensions formed by the controlled deformation of polymer vesicles. The stable nanocavity and strict control of the opening are ideal for the physical entrapment of nanoparticles which, when catalytically active, can turn the stomatocyte morphology into a nanoreactor. Herein we report an approach to generate autonomous movement of the polymer stomatocytes by selectively entrapping catalytically active platinum nanoparticles within their nanocavities and subsequently using catalysis as a driving force for movement. Hydrogen peroxide is free to access the inner stomatocyte cavity, where it is decomposed by the active catalyst (the entrapped platinum nanoparticles) into oxygen and water. This generates a rapid discharge, which induces thrust and directional movement. The design of the platinum-loaded stomatocytes resembles a miniature monopropellant rocket engine, in which the controlled opening of the stomatocytes directs the expulsion of the decomposition products away from the reaction chamber (inner stomatocyte cavity).",2
"Electron-transfer processes in dendrimers and their implication in biology, catalysis, sensing and nanotechnology.","The extraordinary development of the design and synthesis of dendrimers has allowed scientists to locate redox sites at precise positions (core, focal points, branching points, termini, cavities) of these perfectly defined macromolecules, which have generation-controlled sizes and topologies matching those of biomolecules. Redox-dendrimer engineering has led to fine modelling studies of electron-transfer metalloproteins, in which the branches of the dendrimers hinder access to the active site in a manner reminiscent of that of the protein. It has also enabled the construction of remarkable catalysts, sensors and printboards, including by sophisticated design of the interface between redox dendrimers and solid-state devices - for example by functionalizing electrodes and other surfaces. Electron-transfer processes between dendrimers and a variety of other molecules hold promising applications in diverse areas that range from bio-engineering to sensing, catalysis and energy materials.",2
Chemoselective synthesis of ketones and ketimines by addition of organometallic reagents to secondary amides.,"The development of efficient and selective transformations is crucial in synthetic chemistry as it opens new possibilities in the total synthesis of complex molecules. Applying such reactions to the synthesis of ketones is of great importance, as this motif serves as a synthetic handle for the elaboration of numerous organic functionalities. In this context, we report a general and chemoselective method based on an activation/addition sequence on secondary amides allowing the controlled isolation of structurally diverse ketones and ketimines. The generation of a highly electrophilic imidoyl triflate intermediate was found to be pivotal in the observed exceptional functional group tolerance, allowing the facile addition of readily available Grignard and diorganozinc reagents to amides, and avoiding commonly observed over-addition or reduction side reactions. The methodology has been applied to the formal synthesis of analogues of the antineoplastic agent Bexarotene and to the rapid and efficient synthesis of unsymmetrical diketones in a one-pot procedure.",2
Strongly coupled binuclear uranium-oxo complexes from uranyl oxo rearrangement and reductive silylation.,"The most common motif in uranium chemistry is the d(0)f(0) uranyl ion [UO(2)](2+) in which the oxo groups are rigorously linear and inert. Alternative geometries, such as the cis-uranyl, have been identified theoretically and implicated in oxo-atom transfer reactions that are relevant to environmental speciation and nuclear waste remediation. Single electron reduction is now known to impart greater oxo-group reactivity, but with retention of the linear OUO motif, and reactions of the oxo groups to form new covalent bonds remain rare. Here, we describe the synthesis, structure, reactivity and magnetic properties of a binuclear uranium-oxo complex. Formed through a combination of reduction and oxo-silylation and migration from a trans to a cis position, the new butterfly-shaped Si-OUO(2)UO-Si molecule shows remarkably strong U(V)-U(V) coupling and chemical inertness, suggesting that this rearranged uranium oxo motif might exist for other actinide species in the environment, and have relevance to the aggregation of actinide oxide clusters.",2
Controlling on-surface polymerization by hierarchical and substrate-directed growth.,"A key challenge in the field of nanotechnology, in particular in the design of molecular machines, novel materials or molecular electronics, is the bottom-up construction of covalently bound molecular architectures in a well-defined arrangement. To date, only rather simple structures have been obtained because of the limitation of one-step connection processes. Indeed, for the formation of sophisticated structures, step-by-step connection of molecules is required. Here, we present a strategy for the covalent connection of molecules in a hierarchical manner by the selective and sequential activation of specific sites, thereby generating species with a programmed reactivity. This approach leads to improved network quality and enables the fabrication of heterogeneous architectures with high selectivity. Furthermore, substrate-directed growth and a preferred orientation of the molecular nanostructures are achieved on an anisotropic surface. The demonstrated control over reactivity and diffusion during covalent bond formation constitutes a promising route towards the creation of sophisticated multi-component molecular nanostructures.",2
Optimizing the specificity of nucleic acid hybridization.,"The specific hybridization of complementary sequences is an essential property of nucleic acids, enabling diverse biological and biotechnological reactions and functions. However, the specificity of nucleic acid hybridization is compromised for long strands, except near the melting temperature. Here, we analytically derived the thermodynamic properties of a hybridization probe that would enable near-optimal single-base discrimination and perform robustly across diverse temperature, salt and concentration conditions. We rationally designed 'toehold exchange' probes that approximate these properties, and comprehensively tested them against five different DNA targets and 55 spurious analogues with energetically representative single-base changes (replacements, deletions and insertions). These probes produced discrimination factors between 3 and 100+ (median, 26). Without retuning, our probes function robustly from 10 degrees C to 37 degrees C, from 1 mM Mg(2+) to 47 mM Mg(2+), and with nucleic acid concentrations from 1 nM to 5 microM. Experiments with RNA also showed effective single-base change discrimination.",2
Selection of supramolecular chirality by application of rotational and magnetic forces.,"Many essential biological molecules exist only in one of two possible mirror-image structures, either because they possess a chiral unit or through their structure (helices, for example, are intrinsically chiral), but so far the origin of this homochirality has not been unraveled. Here we demonstrate that the handedness of helical supramolecular aggregates formed by achiral molecules can be directed by applying rotational, gravitational and orienting forces during the self-assembly process. In this system, supramolecular chirality is determined by the relative directions of rotation and magnetically tuned effective gravity, but the magnetic orientation of the aggregates is also essential. Applying these external forces only during the nucleation step of the aggregation is sufficient to achieve chiral selection. This result shows that an almost instantaneous chiral perturbation can be transferred and amplified in growing supramolecular self-assemblies, and provides evidence that a falsely chiral influence is able to induce absolute enantioselection.",2
Quadruple bonding in C2 and analogous eight-valence electron species.,"Triple bonding is conventionally considered to be the limit for multiply bonded main group elements, despite higher metal-metal bond orders being frequently observed for transition metals and lanthanides/actinides. Here, using high-level theoretical methods, we show that C(2) and its isoelectronic molecules CN(+), BN and CB(-) (each having eight valence electrons) are bound by a quadruple bond. The bonding comprises not only one sigma- and two pi-bonds, but also one weak 'inverted' bond, which can be characterized by the interaction of electrons in two outwardly pointing sp hybrid orbitals. A simple way of assessing the energy of the fourth bond is proposed and is found to be ~12-17 kcal mol(-1) for the isoelectronic species studied, and thus stronger than a hydrogen bond. In contrast, the analogues of C(2) that contain higher-row elements, such as Si(2) and Ge(2), exhibit only double bonding.",2
Structure and catalytic properties of the most complex intergrown zeolite ITQ-39 determined by electron crystallography.,"Porous materials such as zeolites contain well-defined pores in molecular dimensions and have important industrial applications in catalysis, sorption and separation. Aluminosilicates with intersecting 10- and 12-ring channels are particularly interesting as selective catalysts. Many porous materials, especially zeolites, form only nanosized powders and some are intergrowths of different structures, making structure determination very challenging. Here, we report the atomic structures of an aluminosilicate zeolite family, ITQ-39, solved from nanocrystals only a few unit cells in size by electron crystallography. ITQ-39 is an intergrowth of three different polymorphs, built from the same layer but with different stacking sequences. ITQ-39 contains stacking faults and twinning with nano-sized domains, being the most complex zeolite ever solved. The unique structure of ITQ-39, with a three-dimensional intersecting pairwise 12-ring and 10-ring pore system, makes it a promising catalyst for converting naphtha into diesel fuel, a process of emerging interest for the petrochemical industry.",2
Darwinian evolution of an alternative genetic system provides support for TNA as an RNA progenitor.,"The pre-RNA world hypothesis postulates that RNA was preceded in the evolution of life by a simpler genetic material, but it is not known if such systems can fold into structures capable of eliciting a desired function. Presumably, whatever chemistry gave rise to RNA would have produced other RNA analogues, some of which may have preceded or competed directly with RNA. Threose nucleic acid (TNA), a potentially natural derivative of RNA, has received considerable interest as a possible RNA progenitor due to its chemical simplicity and ability to exchange genetic information with itself and RNA. Here, we have applied Darwinian evolution methods to evolve, in vitro, a TNA receptor that binds to an arbitrary target with high affinity and specificity. This demonstration shows that TNA has the ability to fold into tertiary structures with sophisticated chemical functions, which provides evidence that TNA could have served as an ancestral genetic system during an early stage of life.",2
Taking Ockham's razor to enzyme dynamics and catalysis.,"The role of protein dynamics in enzyme catalysis is a matter of intense current debate. Enzyme-catalysed reactions that involve significant quantum tunnelling can give rise to experimental kinetic isotope effects with complex temperature dependences, and it has been suggested that standard statistical rate theories, such as transition-state theory, are inadequate for their explanation. Here we introduce aspects of transition-state theory relevant to the study of enzyme reactivity, taking cues from chemical kinetics and dynamics studies of small molecules in the gas phase and in solution--where breakdowns of statistical theories have received significant attention and their origins are relatively better understood. We discuss recent theoretical approaches to understanding enzyme activity and then show how experimental observations for a number of enzymes may be reproduced using a transition-state-theory framework with physically reasonable parameters. Essential to this simple model is the inclusion of multiple conformations with different reactivity.",2
Good vibrations in enzyme-catalysed reactions.,"Fast motions (femtosecond to picosecond) and their potential involvement during enzyme-catalysed reactions have ignited considerable interest in recent years. Their influence on reaction chemistry has been inferred indirectly from studies of the anomalous temperature dependence of kinetic isotope effects and computational simulations. But can such motion reduce the width and height of energy barriers along the reaction coordinate, and contribute to quantum mechanical and/or classical nuclear-transfer chemistry? Here we discuss contemporary ideas for enzymatic reactions invoking a role for fast 'promoting' (or 'compressive') motions that, in principle, can aid hydrogen-transfer reactions. Of key importance is the direct demonstration of a role for compressive motions and the ability to understand in atomic detail the structural origin of these fast motions, but so far this has not been achieved. Here we discuss both indirect experimental evidence that supports a role for compressive motion and the additional insight gained from computational simulations.",2
The promoting effect of adsorbed carbon monoxide on the oxidation of alcohols on a gold catalyst.,"In heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis, adsorbed carbon monoxide typically acts as a poison or poisoning intermediate in the oxidation of alcohols. However, gold as an (electro)catalyst often exhibits unexpected properties. Here we show that carbon monoxide irreversibly adsorbed on a Au(111) surface in aqueous alkaline media can act as a promoter for the electrocatalytic oxidation of certain alcohols, in particular methanol. In comparison with bare Au(111), the onset potential for methanol oxidation is significantly lower in the presence of adsorbed CO, and formation of the main methanol oxidation products--formaldehyde and formic acid--is enhanced. By studying the effect of adsorbed CO on the oxidation of other alcohols on gold, we conclude that the presence of adsorbed CO promotes beta-hydrogen elimination, that is, C-H bond breaking. Apart from its importance to gold catalysis, this is an unanticipated example of promotion effects by co-adsorbed small molecules in electrocatalysis.",2
Non-lattice surface oxygen species implicated in the catalytic partial oxidation of decane to oxygenated aromatics.,"The one-step transformation of C(7)-C(12) linear alkanes into more valuable oxygenates provides heterogeneous catalysis with a major challenge. In evaluating the potential of a classic mixed-metal-oxide catalyst, we demonstrate new insights into the reactivity of adsorbed oxygen species. During the aerobic gas-phase conversion of n-decane over iron molybdate, the product distribution correlates with the condition of the catalyst. Selectivity to oxygenated aromatics peaks at 350 degrees C while the catalyst is in a fully oxidized state, whereas decene and aromatic hydrocarbons dominate at higher temperatures. The high-temperature performance is consistent with an underlying redox mechanism in which lattice oxide ions abstract hydrogen from decane. At lower temperatures, the formation of oxygenated aromatics competes with the formation of CO(2), implying that electrophilic adsorbed oxygen is involved in both reactions. We suggest, therefore, that so-called non-selective oxygen is capable of insertion into carbon-rich surface intermediates to generate aromatic partial oxidation products.",2
Binary fluorous tagging enables the synthesis and separation of a 16-stereoisomer library of macrosphelides.,"Fluorous mixture synthesis minimizes the effort to synthesize small-molecule libraries by labelling the molecules rather than the reaction vessels. Reactants are labelled with fluorinated tags and products can later be demixed based on the fluorine content. A limit in the number of available tags can be overcome by using binary encoding so that a total of four tags can label uniquely a library of 16 compounds. This strategy, however, means that separation based on fluorine content alone is not possible. Here, we solve this problem by selectively removing one tag after an initial demixing step; a second demixing provides each individual compound. The usefulness of this strategy is demonstrated by the synthesis of a library that contains all 16 diastereomers of the natural products macrosphelides A and E. Macrosphelide D was not in this library, and so its assigned structure was incorrect. We determined its constitution by using NMR spectroscopy and its configuration by synthesizing four candidate stereoisomers.",2
Optochemical control of genetically engineered neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.,"Advances in synthetic chemistry, structural biology, molecular modelling and molecular cloning have enabled the systematic functional manipulation of transmembrane proteins. By combining genetically manipulated proteins with light-sensitive ligands, innately 'blind' neurobiological receptors can be converted into photoreceptors, which allows them to be photoregulated with high spatiotemporal precision. Here, we present the optochemical control of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) with photoswitchable tethered agonists and antagonists. Using structure-based design, we produced heteromeric alpha3beta4 and alpha4beta2 nAChRs that can be activated or inhibited with deep-violet light, but respond normally to acetylcholine in the dark. The generation of these engineered receptors should facilitate investigation of the physiological and pathological functions of neuronal nAChRs and open a general pathway to photosensitizing pentameric ligand-gated ion channels.",2
Quantifying the chemical beauty of drugs.,"Drug-likeness is a key consideration when selecting compounds during the early stages of drug discovery. However, evaluation of drug-likeness in absolute terms does not reflect adequately the whole spectrum of compound quality. More worryingly, widely used rules may inadvertently foster undesirable molecular property inflation as they permit the encroachment of rule-compliant compounds towards their boundaries. We propose a measure of drug-likeness based on the concept of desirability called the quantitative estimate of drug-likeness (QED). The empirical rationale of QED reflects the underlying distribution of molecular properties. QED is intuitive, transparent, straightforward to implement in many practical settings and allows compounds to be ranked by their relative merit. We extended the utility of QED by applying it to the problem of molecular target druggability assessment by prioritizing a large set of published bioactive compounds. The measure may also capture the abstract notion of aesthetics in medicinal chemistry.",2
Enantioselective construction of quaternary N-heterocycles by palladium-catalysed decarboxylative allylic alkylation of lactams.,"The enantioselective synthesis of nitrogen-containing heterocycles (N-heterocycles) represents a substantial chemical research effort and resonates across numerous disciplines, including the total synthesis of natural products and medicinal chemistry. In this Article, we describe the highly enantioselective palladium-catalysed decarboxylative allylic alkylation of readily available lactams to form 3,3-disubstituted pyrrolidinones, piperidinones, caprolactams and structurally related lactams. Given the prevalence of quaternary N-heterocycles in biologically active alkaloids and pharmaceutical agents, we envisage that our method will provide a synthetic entry into the de novo asymmetric synthesis of such structures. As an entry for these investigations we demonstrate how the described catalysis affords enantiopure quaternary lactams that intercept synthetic intermediates previously used in the synthesis of the Aspidosperma alkaloids quebrachamine and rhazinilam, but that were previously only available by chiral auxiliary approaches or as racemic mixtures.",2
Hydrolytic catalysis and structural stabilization in a designed metalloprotein.,"Metal ions are an important part of many natural proteins, providing structural, catalytic and electron transfer functions. Reproducing these functions in a designed protein is the ultimate challenge to our understanding of them. Here, we present an artificial metallohydrolase, which has been shown by X-ray crystallography to contain two different metal ions-a Zn(II) ion, which is important for catalytic activity, and a Hg(II) ion, which provides structural stability. This metallohydrolase displays catalytic activity that compares well with several characteristic reactions of natural enzymes. It catalyses p-nitrophenyl acetate (pNPA) hydrolysis with an efficiency only ~100-fold less than that of human carbonic anhydrase (CA)II and at least 550-fold better than comparable synthetic complexes. Similarly, CO(2) hydration occurs with an efficiency within ~500-fold of CAII. Although histidine residues in the absence of Zn(II) exhibit pNPA hydrolysis, miniscule apopeptide activity is observed for CO(2) hydration. The kinetic and structural analysis of this first de novo designed hydrolytic metalloenzyme reveals necessary design features for future metalloenzymes containing one or more metals.",2
Broken symmetry and the variation of critical properties in the phase behaviour of supramolecular rhombus tilings.,"The tiling of surfaces has long attracted the attention of scientists, not only because it is intriguing intrinsically, but also as a way to control the properties of surfaces. However, although random tiling networks are studied increasingly, their degree of randomness (or partial order) has remained notoriously difficult to control, in common with other supramolecular systems. Here we show that the random organization of a two-dimensional supramolecular array of isophthalate tetracarboxylic acids varies with subtle chemical changes in the system. We quantify this variation using an order parameter and reveal a phase behaviour that is consistent with long-standing theoretical studies on random tiling. The balance between order and randomness is driven by small differences in intermolecular interaction energies, which can be related by numerical simulations to the experimentally measured order parameter. Significant variations occur with very small energy differences, which highlights the delicate balance between entropic and energetic effects in complex self-assembly processes.",2
A biomimetic polyketide-inspired approach to small-molecule ligand discovery.,"The discovery of new compounds for the pharmacological manipulation of protein function often embraces the screening of compound collections, and it is widely recognized that natural products offer beneficial characteristics as protein ligands. Much effort has therefore been focused on 'natural product-like' libraries, yet the synthesis and screening of such libraries is often limited by one or more of the following: modest library sizes and structural diversity, conformational heterogeneity and the costs associated with the substantial infrastructure of modern high-throughput screening centres. Here, we describe the design and execution of an approach to this broad problem by merging principles associated with biologically inspired oligomerization and the structure of polyketide-derived natural products. A novel class of chiral and conformationally constrained oligomers is described (termed 'chiral oligomers of pentenoic amides', COPA), which offers compatibility with split-and-pool methods and can be screened en masse in a batch mode. We demonstrate that a COPA library containing 160,000 compounds is a useful source of novel protein ligands by identifying a non-covalent synthetic ligand to the DNA-binding domain of the p53 transcription factor.",2
Large-scale screening of hypothetical metal-organic frameworks.,"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous materials constructed from modular molecular building blocks, typically metal clusters and organic linkers. These can, in principle, be assembled to form an almost unlimited number of MOFs, yet materials reported to date represent only a tiny fraction of the possible combinations. Here, we demonstrate a computational approach to generate all conceivable MOFs from a given chemical library of building blocks (based on the structures of known MOFs) and rapidly screen them to find the best candidates for a specific application. From a library of 102 building blocks we generated 137,953 hypothetical MOFs and for each one calculated the pore-size distribution, surface area and methane-storage capacity. We identified over 300 MOFs with a predicted methane-storage capacity better than that of any known material, and this approach also revealed structure-property relationships. Methyl-functionalized MOFs were frequently top performers, so we selected one such promising MOF and experimentally confirmed its predicted capacity.",2
Remodelling of the natural product fumagillol employing a reaction discovery approach.,"In the search for new biologically active molecules, diversity-oriented synthetic strategies break through the limitation of traditional library synthesis by sampling new chemical space. Many natural products can be regarded as intriguing starting points for diversity-oriented synthesis, wherein stereochemically rich core structures may be reorganized into chemotypes that are distinctly different from the parent structure. Ideally, to be suited to library applications, such transformations should be general and involve few steps. With this objective in mind, the highly oxygenated natural product fumagillol has been successfully remodelled in several ways using a reaction-discovery-based approach. In reactions with amines, excellent regiocontrol in a bis-epoxide opening/cyclization sequence can be obtained by size-dependent interaction of an appropriate catalyst with the parent molecule, forming either perhydroisoindole or perhydroisoquinoline products. Perhydroisoindoles can be further remodelled by cascade processes to afford either morpholinone or bridged 4,1-benzoxazepine-containing structures.",2
Poly(zwitterionic)protein conjugates offer increased stability without sacrificing binding affinity or bioactivity.,"Treatment with therapeutic proteins is an attractive approach to targeting a number of challenging diseases. Unfortunately, the native proteins themselves are often unstable in physiological conditions, reducing bioavailability and therefore increasing the dose that is required. Conjugation with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is often used to increase stability, but this has a detrimental effect on bioactivity. Here, we introduce conjugation with zwitterionic polymers such as poly(carboxybetaine). We show that poly(carboxybetaine) conjugation improves stability in a manner similar to PEGylation, but that the new conjugates retain or even improve the binding affinity as a result of enhanced protein-substrate hydrophobic interactions. This chemistry opens a new avenue for the development of protein therapeutics by avoiding the need to compromise between stability and affinity.",2
Redox-induced reversible metal assembly through translocation and reversible ligand coupling in tetranuclear metal sandwich frameworks.,"Sandwich structures formed by metal atoms intercalated between sp(2)-carbon planes can be found either in metal-graphite-based materials or discrete multinuclear sandwich complexes. Their reactivity, and in particular their dynamic behaviour, has recently attracted interest both from a structural and a practical aspect, for example in catalysis. However, progress in this area has been rather slow, and it remains difficult to elucidate their structure and behaviour at the molecular level. Here, we report two sandwich complexes--in which four palladium centres are incorporated between two pi-conjugated ligands--which exhibit two modes of redox-switchable structural changes. In the first complex, the tetrapalladium chain is split by oxidation into two well-separated dipalladium units. This motion is reversed on reduction. In the second complex, reversible carbon-carbon coupling occurs between the ligands during the redox process.",2
Three-component reaction discovery enabled by mass spectrometry of self-assembled monolayers.,"Multicomponent reactions are employed extensively in many areas of organic chemistry. Despite significant progress, the discovery of such enabling transformations remains challenging. Here, we present the development of a parallel, label-free reaction-discovery platform that can be used in the identification of new multicomponent transformations. Our approach is based on parallel mass spectrometric screening of interfacial chemical reactions on arrays of self-assembled monolayers. This strategy enabled the identification of a simple organic phosphine that can catalyse a previously unknown condensation of siloxyalkynes, aldehydes and amines to produce 3-hydroxyamides with high efficiency and diastereoselectivity. The reaction was further optimized using solution-phase methods.",2
A total-synthesis framework for the construction of high-order colloidal hybrid nanoparticles.,"Colloidal hybrid nanoparticles contain multiple nanoscale domains fused together by solid-state interfaces. They represent an emerging class of multifunctional lab-on-a-particle architectures that underpin future advances in solar energy conversion, fuel-cell catalysis, medical imaging and therapy, and electronics. The complexity of these 'artificial molecules' is limited ultimately by the lack of a mechanism-driven design framework. Here, we show that known chemical reactions can be applied in a predictable and stepwise manner to build complex hybrid nanoparticle architectures that include M-Pt-Fe(3)O(4) (M = Au, Ag, Ni, Pd) heterotrimers, M(x)S-Au-Pt-Fe(3)O(4) (M = Pb, Cu) heterotetramers and higher-order oligomers based on the heterotrimeric Au-Pt-Fe(3)O(4) building block. This synthetic framework conceptually mimics the total-synthesis approach used by chemists to construct complex organic molecules. The reaction toolkit applies solid-state nanoparticle analogues of chemoselective reactions, regiospecificity, coupling reactions and molecular substituent effects to the construction of exceptionally complex hybrid nanoparticle oligomers.",2
"Optically pure, water-stable metallo-helical 'flexicate' assemblies with antibiotic activity.","The helicates--chiral assemblies of two or more metal atoms linked by short or relatively rigid multidentate organic ligands--may be regarded as non-peptide mimetics of alpha-helices because they are of comparable size and have shown some relevant biological activity. Unfortunately, these beautiful helical compounds have remained difficult to use in the medicinal arena because they contain mixtures of isomers, cannot be optimized for specific purposes, are insoluble, or are too difficult to synthesize. Instead, we have now prepared thermodynamically stable single enantiomers of monometallic units connected by organic linkers. Our highly adaptable self-assembly approach enables the rapid preparation of ranges of water-stable, helicate-like compounds with high stereochemical purity. One such iron(II) 'flexicate' system exhibits specific interactions with DNA, promising antimicrobial activity against a Gram-positive bacterium (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA252), but also, unusually, a Gram-negative bacterium (Escherichia coli, MC4100), as well as low toxicity towards a non-mammalian model organism (Caenorhabditis elegans).",2
"Combining acid-base, redox and substrate binding functionalities to give a complete model for the [FeFe]-hydrogenase.","Some enzymes function by coupling substrate turnover with electron transfer from a redox cofactor such as ferredoxin. In the [FeFe]-hydrogenases, nature's fastest catalysts for the production and oxidation of H(2), the one-electron redox by a ferredoxin complements the one-electron redox by the diiron active site. In this Article, we replicate the function of the ferredoxins with the redox-active ligand Cp*Fe(C(5)Me(4)CH(2)PEt(2)) (FcP*). FcP* oxidizes at mild potentials, in contrast to most ferrocene-based ligands, which suggests that it might be a useful mimic of ferredoxin cofactors. The specific model is Fe(2)[(SCH(2))(2)NBn](CO)(3)(FcP*)(dppv) (1), which contains the three functional components of the active site: a reactive diiron centre, an amine as a proton relay and, for the first time, a one-electron redox module. By virtue of the synthetic redox cofactor, [1](2+) exhibits unique reactivity towards hydrogen and CO. In the presence of excess oxidant and base, H(2) oxidation by [1](2+) is catalytic.",2
Scalable enantioselective total synthesis of taxanes.,"Taxanes form a large family of terpenes comprising over 350 members, the most famous of which is Taxol (paclitaxel), a billion-dollar anticancer drug. Here, we describe the first practical and scalable synthetic entry to these natural products via a concise preparation of (+)-taxa-4(5),11(12)-dien-2-one, which has a suitable functional handle with which to access more oxidized members of its family. This route enables a gram-scale preparation of the 'parent' taxane--taxadiene--which is the largest quantity of this naturally occurring terpene ever isolated or prepared in pure form. The characteristic 6-8-6 tricyclic system of the taxane family, containing a bridgehead alkene, is forged via a vicinal difunctionalization/Diels-Alder strategy. Asymmetry is introduced by means of an enantioselective conjugate addition that forms an all-carbon quaternary centre, from which all other stereocentres are fixed through substrate control. This study lays a critical foundation for a planned access to minimally oxidized taxane analogues and a scalable laboratory preparation of Taxol itself.",2
A synthetic molecular pentafoil knot.,"Knots are being discovered with increasing frequency in both biological and synthetic macromolecules and have been fundamental topological targets for chemical synthesis for the past two decades. Here, we report on the synthesis of the most complex non-DNA molecular knot prepared to date: the self-assembly of five bis-aldehyde and five bis-amine building blocks about five metal cations and one chloride anion to form a 160-atom-loop molecular pentafoil knot (five crossing points). The structure and topology of the knot is established by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and X-ray crystallography, revealing a symmetrical closed-loop double helicate with the chloride anion held at the centre of the pentafoil knot by ten CH...Cl(-) hydrogen bonds. The one-pot self-assembly reaction features an exceptional number of different design elements-some well precedented and others less well known within the context of directing the formation of (supra)molecular species. We anticipate that the strategies and tactics used here can be applied to the rational synthesis of other higher-order interlocked molecular architectures.",2
Stability of quantum dots in live cells.,"Quantum dots are highly fluorescent and photostable, making them excellent tools for imaging. When using these quantum dots in cells and animals, however, intracellular biothiols (such as glutathione and cysteine) can degrade the quantum dot monolayer, compromising function. Here, we describe a label-free method to quantify the intracellular stability of monolayers on quantum dot surfaces that couples laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Using this new approach we have demonstrated that quantum dot monolayer stability is correlated with both quantum dot particle size and monolayer structure, with appropriate choice of both particle size and ligand structure required for intracellular stability.",2
A two-dimensional mutate-and-map strategy for non-coding RNA structure.,"Non-coding RNAs fold into precise base-pairing patterns to carry out critical roles in genetic regulation and protein synthesis, but determining RNA structure remains difficult. Here, we show that coupling systematic mutagenesis with high-throughput chemical mapping enables accurate base-pair inference of domains from ribosomal RNA, ribozymes and riboswitches. For a six-RNA benchmark that has challenged previous chemical/computational methods, this 'mutate-and-map' strategy gives secondary structures that are in agreement with crystallography (helix error rates, 2%), including a blind test on a double-glycine riboswitch. Through modelling of partially ordered states, the method enables the first test of an interdomain helix-swap hypothesis for ligand-binding cooperativity in a glycine riboswitch. Finally, the data report on tertiary contacts within non-coding RNAs, and coupling to the Rosetta/FARFAR algorithm gives nucleotide-resolution three-dimensional models (helix root-mean-squared deviation, 5.7 A) of an adenine riboswitch. These results establish a promising two-dimensional chemical strategy for inferring the secondary and tertiary structures that underlie non-coding RNA behaviour.",2
Synthesis and structure of solution-stable one-dimensional palladium wires.,"One-dimensional metal wires are valuable materials because of their optical and electronic anisotropy, and they have potential utility in devices such as photovoltaic cells and molecular sensors. However, despite more than a century of research, only a few examples exist of well-defined one-dimensional (1D) metal wires that allow for the rational variation of conductivity. Herein we describe the first examples of 1D molecular wires supported by Pd-Pd bonds, the thin-film conductive properties of which can be altered by controlled molecular changes. Wires based on Pd(III) give semiconducting films with a modifiable bandgap, whereas wires based on Pd(2.5) give films that display metallic conductivity above 200 K: a metallic state has not been reported previously for any polymer composed of 1D metal wires. The wires are infinite in the solid state and maintain 1D structures in solution with lengths of up to 750 nm. Solution stability enables thin film coating, a requisite for device fabrication using molecular wires.",2
Dynamic multi-component covalent assembly for the reversible binding of secondary alcohols and chirality sensing.,"Reversible covalent bonding is often used for the creation of novel supramolecular structures, multi-component assemblies and sensing ensembles. Despite the remarkable success of dynamic covalent systems, the reversible binding of a mono-alcohol with high strength is challenging. Here, we show that a strategy of carbonyl activation and hemiaminal ether stabilization can be embodied in a four-component reversible assembly that creates a tetradentate ligand and incorporates secondary alcohols with exceptionally high affinity. Evidence is presented that the intermediate leading to binding and exchange of alcohols is an iminium ion. To demonstrate the use of this assembly process we also explored chirality sensing and enantiomeric excess determinations. An induced twist in the ligand by a chiral mono-ol results in large Cotton effects in the circular dichroism spectra indicative of the handedness of the alcohol. The strategy revealed in this study should prove broadly applicable for the incorporation of alcohols into supramolecular architecture construction.",2
"The total synthesis of hyperpapuanone, hyperibone L, epi-clusianone and oblongifolin A.","Polyprenylated polycyclic acylphloroglucines (PPAPs) are a family of natural products that possess a wide range of different important biological activities because of the relative position and configuration of four substituents that decorate one common central bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,4,9-trione core. The rigid bicyclic framework with its lipophilic side chains and its hydrophilic trione moiety represents a nature-derived lead structure that arranges the substituents (R(1) to R(4)) into a defined topographical orientation. As the substituents are responsible for the biological activities, the seven-step synthetic approach presented here sets the stage for an iterative introduction of R(1) to R(4) and thus generates structurally diverse trans-type B PPAPs. Four natural and one non-natural trans-type B PPAPs were prepared starting from acetylacetone with overall yields that ranged from 6 to 22%. The concept of separating framework construction from decorating transformations plus the minimization of protecting-group operations are the key issues for the realization of our synthetic approach.",2
Roaming-mediated isomerization in the photodissociation of nitrobenzene.,"Roaming reactions comprise a new class of reaction in which a molecule undergoes frustrated dissociation to radicals, followed by an intramolecular abstraction reaction. Nitro compounds have long been known to dissociate to give NO as a major product. However, rates based upon isomerization via calculated tight transition states are implausibly slow, so the key dissociation pathway for this important class of molecules remains obscure. Here, we present an imaging study of the photodissociation of nitrobenzene with state-specific detection of the resulting NO products. We observe a bimodal translational energy distribution in which the slow products are formed with low NO rotational excitation, and the fast component is associated with high rotational excitation. High-level ab initio calculations identified a 'roaming-type' saddle point on the ground state. Branching ratio calculations then show that thermal dissociation of nitrobenzene is dominated by 'roaming-mediated isomerization' to phenyl nitrite, which subsequently decomposes to give C(6)H(5)O + NO.",2
Cytocompatible click-based hydrogels with dynamically tunable properties through orthogonal photoconjugation and photocleavage reactions.,"To provide insight into how cells receive information from their external surroundings, synthetic hydrogels have emerged as systems for assaying cell function in well-defined microenvironments where single cues can be introduced and subsequent effects individually elucidated. However, as answers to more complex biological questions continue to be sought, advanced material systems are needed that allow dynamic alteration of the three-dimensional cellular environment with orthogonal reactions that enable multiple levels of control of biochemical and biomechanical signals. Here, we seek to synthesize one such three-dimensional culture system using cytocompatible and wavelength-specific photochemical reactions to create hydrogels that allow orthogonal and dynamic control of material properties through independent spatiotemporally regulated photocleavage of crosslinks and photoconjugation of pendant functionalities. The results demonstrate the versatile nature of the chemistry to create programmable niches to study and direct cell function by modifying the local hydrogel environment.",2
Single-chain technology using discrete synthetic macromolecules.,"Fundamental polymer science is undergoing a profound transformation. As a result of recent progress in macromolecular chemistry and physics, synthetic polymer chains are becoming much more than just the modest building blocks of traditional 'plastics'. Promising options for controlling the primary and secondary structures of synthetic polymers have been proposed and, therefore, similarly to biopolymers, synthetic macromolecules may now be exploited as discrete objects with carefully engineered structures and functions. Although it is not possible today to reach the high level of complexity found in biomaterials, these new chemical possibilities open interesting avenues for applications in microelectronics, photovoltaics, catalysis and biotechnology. Here, we describe in detail these recent advances in macromolecular science and emphasize the possible emergence of technologies based on single-chain devices.",2
"Enantioselective preparation and chemoselective cross-coupling of 1,1-diboron compounds.","The simplicity, efficiency and generality of the transition-metal-catalysed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction has led to its application in the preparation of a wide variety of organic compounds. Cross-coupling of alkylboron derivatives, however, remains a major challenge, in particular with regard to stereochemical control. Here, we describe the preparation and reaction of highly optically enriched 1,1-diboron compounds. A catalytic asymmetric conjugate borylation of beta-boronylacrylates provided geminal diboronate products that feature two distinct boronyl units, in 99% enantiomeric excess. Chemoselective cross-coupling of one-boronyl unit, a trifluoroborate salt, occurred stereospecifically via inversion of its configuration to generate enantioenriched benzylic or allylic boronates. The difficult transmetallation in the Suzuki-Miyaura catalytic reaction cycle is believed to be facilitated by a stabilization effect from the second boronyl unit, and internal coordination by the oxygen of the proximal carboxyester. We also explored subsequent functionalization of the second boronyl unit.",2
Ultrafast vibrational energy transfer at the water/air interface revealed by two-dimensional surface vibrational spectroscopy.,"Water is very different from liquids of similar molecular weight, and one of its unique properties is the very efficient transfer of vibrational energy between molecules, which arises as a result of strong dipole-dipole interactions between the O-H oscillators. Although we have a sound understanding of such energy transfer in bulk water, we know less about how, and how quickly, transfer occurs at its interface with a hydrophobic phase, because specifically addressing the outermost monolayer is difficult. Here, we use ultrafast two-dimensional surface-specific vibrational spectroscopy to probe the interfacial energy dynamics of heavy water (D(2)O) at the water/air interface. The measurements reveal the presence of surprisingly rapid energy transfer, both between hydrogen-bonded interfacial water molecules (intermolecular), and between O-D groups sticking out from the water surface and those located on the same molecule and pointing towards the water bulk (intramolecular). Vibrational energy transfer occurs on sub-picosecond timescales, and its rates and pathways can be quantified directly.",2
Direct observation of disulfide isomerization in a single protein.,"Photochemical uncaging techniques use light to release active molecules from otherwise inert compounds. Here we expand this class of techniques by demonstrating the mechanical uncaging of a reactive species within a single protein. We proved this novel technique by capturing the regiospecific reaction between a thiol and a vicinal disulfide bond. We designed a protein that includes a caged cysteine and a buried disulfide. The mechanical unfolding of this protein in the presence of an external nucleophile frees the single reactive cysteine residue, which now can cleave the target disulfide via a nucleophilic attack on either one of its two sulfur atoms. This produces two different and competing reaction pathways. We used single-molecule force spectroscopy to monitor the cleavage of the disulfides, which extends the polypeptide by a magnitude unambiguously associated with each reaction pathway. This allowed us to measure, for the first time, the kinetics of disulfide-bond isomerization in a protein.",2
A sequence-specific threading tetra-intercalator with an extremely slow dissociation rate constant.,"A long-lived and sequence-specific ligand-DNA complex would make possible the modulation of biological processes for extended periods. For this purpose, we are investigating a polyintercalation approach to DNA recognition in which flexible chains of aromatic units thread back and forth repeatedly through the double helix. Here we describe the DNA-binding behaviour of a threading tetra-intercalator. Specific binding was observed on a relatively long DNA strand that strongly favoured a predicted 14 base-pair sequence. Kinetic studies revealed a multistep association process, with sequence specificity that primarily derives from large differences in dissociation rates. The rate-limiting dissociation rate constant of the tetra-intercalator complex dissociating from its preferred binding site was extremely slow, corresponding to a half-life of 16 days. This is one of the longest non-covalent complex half-lives yet reported and, to the best of our knowledge, the longest for a DNA-binding molecule.",2
In situ quantitative imaging of cellular lipids using molecular sensors.,"Membrane lipids are dynamic molecules that play important roles in cell signalling and regulation, but an in situ imaging method for quantitatively tracking lipids in living cells is lacking at present. Here, we report a new chemical method of quantitative lipid imaging using sensors engineered by labelling proteins with an environmentally sensitive fluorophore. A prototype sensor for phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P(2))--a key signalling lipid in diverse cellular processes--was generated by covalently attaching a single 2-dimethylamino-6-acyl-naphthalene group to the N-terminal alpha-helix of the engineered epsin1 ENTH domain, a protein that selectively binds PtdIns(4,5)P(2). The sensor allows robust and sensitive in situ quantitative imaging in mammalian cells, providing new insight into the spatiotemporal dynamics and fluctuation of this key signalling lipid. Application of the sensor to immune cells reveals the presence of a local threshold PtdIns(4,5)P(2) concentration required for triggering phagocytosis. This sensor strategy is generally applicable to in situ quantification of other cellular lipids.",2
Catalytic activity in individual cracking catalyst particles imaged throughout different life stages by selective staining.,"Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) is the major conversion process used in oil refineries to produce valuable hydrocarbons from crude oil fractions. Because the demand for oil-based products is ever increasing, research has been ongoing to improve the performance of FCC catalyst particles, which are complex mixtures of zeolite and binder materials. Unfortunately, there is limited insight into the distribution and activity of individual zeolitic domains at different life stages. Here we introduce a staining method to visualize the structure of zeolite particulates and other FCC components. Bronsted acidity maps have been constructed at the single particle level from fluorescence microscopy images. By applying a statistical methodology to a series of catalysts deactivated via industrial protocols, a correlation is established between Bronsted acidity and cracking activity. The generally applicable method has clear potential for catalyst diagnostics, as it determines intra- and interparticle Bronsted acidity distributions for industrial FCC materials.",2
Chiral information harvesting in dendritic metallopeptides.,"Long-range communication of stereochemical information is common in biological systems, particularly in enzyme-catalysed reactions. Here, we report the remote control of the dynamic chirality of metal centres, coordinated by 2,2'-bipyridine ligands bearing dynamic helical oligopeptides. The helical chirality of the oligopeptides is controlled by a stereocentre remote from the metal. We show that when a mixture of chiral and achiral peptide ligands is used, both the chirality of the metal centre and that of the achiral oligopeptide helices are significantly amplified. The amplification mechanism relies on several steps of chirality induction, first from a single chiral peptide to the helicity of an oligopeptide through the induction of propeller chirality at the metal centre, then on to induction of helical chirality in an achiral oligopeptide.",2
Ultrafast energy flow in the wake of solution-phase bimolecular reactions.,"Vibrational energy flow into reactants, and out of products, plays a key role in chemical reactivity, so understanding the microscopic detail of the pathways and rates associated with this phenomenon is of considerable interest. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to model the vibrational relaxation that occurs during the reaction CN + c-C(6)H(12) --> HCN + c-C(6)H(11) in CH(2)Cl(2), which produces vibrationally hot HCN. The calculations reproduce the observed energy distribution, and show that HCN relaxation follows multiple timescales. Initial rapid decay occurs through energy transfer to the cyclohexyl co-product within the solvent cage, and slower relaxation follows once the products diffuse apart. Re-analysis of the ultrafast experimental data also provides evidence for the dual timescales. These results, which represent a formal violation of conventional linear response theory, provide a detailed picture of the interplay between fluctuations in organic solvent structure and thermal solution-phase chemistry.",2
Opportunities in chemistry and materials science for topological insulators and their nanostructures.,"Electrical charges on the boundaries of topological insulators favour forward motion over back-scattering at impurities, producing low-dissipation, metallic states that exist up to room temperature in ambient conditions. These states have the promise to impact a broad range of applications from electronics to the production of energy, which is one reason why topological insulators have become the rising star in condensed-matter physics. There are many challenges in the processing of these exotic materials to use the metallic states in functional devices, and they present great opportunities for the chemistry and materials science research communities.",2
Multi-hierarchical self-assembly of a collagen mimetic peptide from triple helix to nanofibre and hydrogel.,"Replicating the multi-hierarchical self-assembly of collagen has long-attracted scientists, from both the perspective of the fundamental science of supramolecular chemistry and that of potential biomedical applications in tissue engineering. Many approaches to drive the self-assembly of synthetic systems through the same steps as those of natural collagen (peptide chain to triple helix to nanofibres and, finally, to a hydrogel) are partially successful, but none simultaneously demonstrate all the levels of structural assembly. Here we describe a peptide that replicates the self-assembly of collagen through each of these steps. The peptide features collagen's characteristic proline-hydroxyproline-glycine repeating unit, complemented by designed salt-bridged hydrogen bonds between lysine and aspartate to stabilize the triple helix in a sticky-ended assembly. This assembly is propagated into nanofibres with characteristic triple helical packing and lengths with a lower bound of several hundred nanometres. These nanofibres form a hydrogel that is degraded by collagenase at a similar rate to that of natural collagen.",2
Molecular heterometallic hydride clusters composed of rare-earth and d-transition metals.,"Heteromultimetallic hydride clusters containing both rare-earth and d-transition metals are of interest in terms of both their structure and reactivity. However, such heterometallic complexes have not yet been investigated to a great extent because of difficulties in their synthesis and structural characterization. Here, we report the synthesis, X-ray and neutron diffraction studies, and hydrogen addition and release properties of a family of rare-earth/d-transition-metal heteromultimetallic polyhydride complexes of the core structure type 'Ln(4)MH(n)' (Ln = Y, Dy, Ho; M = Mo, W; n = 9, 11, 13). Monitoring of hydrogen addition to a hydride cluster such as [{(C(5)Me(4)SiMe(3))Y}(4)(mu-H)(9)Mo(C(5)Me(5))] in a single-crystal to single-crystal process by X-ray diffraction has been achieved for the first time. Density functional theory studies reveal that the hydrogen addition process is cooperatively assisted by the Y/Mo heteromultimetallic sites, thus offering unprecedented insight into the hydrogen addition and release process of a metal hydride cluster.",2
Efficient water oxidation catalysts based on readily available iron coordination complexes.,"Water oxidation catalysis constitutes the bottleneck for the development of energy-conversion schemes based on sunlight. To date, state-of-the-art homogeneous water oxidation catalysis is performed efficiently with expensive, toxic and earth-scarce transition metals, but 3d metal-based catalysts are much less established. Here we show that readily available, environmentally benign iron coordination complexes catalyse homogeneous water oxidation to give O(2), with high efficiency during a period of hours. Turnover numbers >350 and >1,000 were obtained using cerium ammonium nitrate at pH 1 and sodium periodate at pH 2, respectively. Spectroscopic monitoring of the catalytic reactions, in combination with kinetic studies, show that high valent oxo-iron species are responsible for the O-O forming event. A systematic study of iron complexes that contain a broad family of neutral tetradentate organic ligands identifies first-principle structural features to sustain water oxidation catalysis. Iron-based catalysts described herein open a novel strategy that could eventually enable sustainable artificial photosynthetic schemes.",2
An ionothermally prepared S = 1/2 vanadium oxyfluoride kagome lattice.,"Frustrated magnetic lattices offer the possibility of many exotic ground states that are of great fundamental importance. Of particular significance is the hunt for frustrated spin-1/2 networks as candidates for quantum spin liquids, which would have exciting and unusual magnetic properties at low temperatures. The few reported candidate materials have all been based on d(9) ions. Here, we report the ionothermal synthesis of [NH(4)](2)[C(7)H(14)N][V(7)O(6)F(18)], an inorganic-organic hybrid solid that contains a S = 1/2 kagome network of d(1) V(4+) ions. The compound exhibits a high degree of magnetic frustration, with significant antiferromagnetic interactions but no long-range magnetic order or spin-freezing above 2 K, and appears to be an excellent candidate for realizing a quantum spin liquid ground state in a spin-1/2 kagome network.",2
Reversible bond formation enables the replication and amplification of a crosslinking salen complex as an orthogonal base pair.,"The universal genetic code relies on two hydrogen-bonded Watson-Crick base pairs that can form 64 triplet codons. This places a limit on the number of amino acids that can be encoded, which has motivated efforts to create synthetic base pairs that are orthogonal to the natural ones. An additional base pair would result in another 61 triplet codons. Artificial organic base pairs have been described in enzymatic incorporation studies, and inorganic T-Hg-T and C-Ag-C base pairs have been reported to form in primer extension studies. Here, we demonstrate a metal base pair that is fully orthogonal and can be replicated, and can even be amplified by polymerase chain reaction in the presence of the canonical pairs dA:dT and dG:dC. Crystal structures of a dS-Cu-dS base pair inside a polymerase show that reversible chemistry is possible directly inside the polymerase, which enables the efficient copying of the inorganic crosslink. The results open up the possibility of replicating and amplifying artificial inorganic DNA nanostructures by extending the genetic alphabet.",2
Observation of Fe(V)=O using variable-temperature mass spectrometry and its enzyme-like C-H and C=C oxidation reactions.,"Oxo-transfer chemistry mediated by iron underpins many biological processes and today is emerging as synthetically very important for the catalytic oxidation of C-H and C=C moieties that are hard to activate conventionally. Despite the vast amount of research in this area, experimental characterization of the reactive species under catalytic conditions is very limited, although a Fe(V)=O moiety was postulated. Here we show, using variable-temperature mass spectrometry, the generation of a Fe(V)=O species within a synthetic non-haem complex at -40 degrees C and its reaction with an olefin. Also, with isotopic labelling we were able both to follow oxygen-atom transfer from H(2)O(2)/H(2)O through Fe(V)=O to the products and to probe the reactivity as a function of temperature. This study pioneers the implementation of variable-temperature mass spectrometry to investigate reactive intermediates.",2
A single-molecule platform for investigation of interactions between G-quadruplexes and small-molecule ligands.,"Ligands that stabilize the formation of telomeric DNA G-quadruplexes have potential as cancer treatments, because the G-quadruplex structure cannot be extended by telomerase, an enzyme over-expressed in many cancer cells. Understanding the kinetic, thermodynamic and mechanical properties of small-molecule binding to these structures is therefore important, but classical ensemble assays are unable to measure these simultaneously. Here, we have used a laser tweezers method to investigate such interactions. With a force jump approach, we observe that pyridostatin promotes the folding of telomeric G-quadruplexes. The increased mechanical stability of pyridostatin-bound G-quadruplex permits the determination of a dissociation constant K(d) of 490 +/- 80 nM. The free-energy change of binding obtained from a Hess-like process provides an identical K(d) for pyridostatin and a K(d) of 42 +/- 3 microM for a weaker ligand RR110. We anticipate that this single-molecule platform can provide detailed insights into the mechanical, kinetic and thermodynamic properties of liganded bio-macromolecules, which have biological relevance.",2
Self-reproduction of supramolecular giant vesicles combined with the amplification of encapsulated DNA.,"The construction of a protocell from a materials point of view is important in understanding the origin of life. Both self-reproduction of a compartment and self-replication of an informational substance have been studied extensively, but these processes have typically been carried out independently, rather than linked to one another. Here, we demonstrate the amplification of DNA (encapsulated guest) within a self-reproducible cationic giant vesicle (host). With the addition of a vesicular membrane precursor, we observe the growth and spontaneous division of the giant vesicles, accompanied by distribution of the DNA to the daughter giant vesicles. In particular, amplification of the DNA accelerated the division of the giant vesicles. This means that self-replication of an informational substance has been linked to self-reproduction of a compartment through the interplay between polyanionic DNA and the cationic vesicular membrane. Our self-reproducing giant vesicle system therefore represents a step forward in the construction of an advanced model protocell.",2
Lessons from nature about solar light harvesting.,"Solar fuel production often starts with the energy from light being absorbed by an assembly of molecules; this electronic excitation is subsequently transferred to a suitable acceptor. For example, in photosynthesis, antenna complexes capture sunlight and direct the energy to reaction centres that then carry out the associated chemistry. In this Review, we describe the principles learned from studies of various natural antenna complexes and suggest how to elucidate strategies for designing light-harvesting systems. We envisage that such systems will be used for solar fuel production, to direct and regulate excitation energy flow using molecular organizations that facilitate feedback and control, or to transfer excitons over long distances. Also described are the notable properties of light-harvesting chromophores, spatial-energetic landscapes, the roles of excitonic states and quantum coherence, as well as how antennas are regulated and photoprotected.",2
All about arsenic.,"If ever there was an element that epitomizes the notion that chemicals might be good or bad depending on their use, arsenic must be it. Katherine Haxton explains why.",2
Regio- and stereoselectivity of P450-catalysed hydroxylation of steroids controlled by laboratory evolution.,"A current challenge in synthetic organic chemistry is the development of methods that allow the regio- and stereoselective oxidative C-H activation of natural or synthetic compounds with formation of the corresponding alcohols. Cytochrome P450 enzymes enable C-H activation at non-activated positions, but the simultaneous control of both regio- and stereoselectivity is problematic. Here, we demonstrate that directed evolution using iterative saturation mutagenesis provides a means to solve synthetic problems of this kind. Using P450 BM3(F87A) as the starting enzyme and testosterone as the substrate, which results in a 1:1 mixture of the 2beta- and 15beta-alcohols, mutants were obtained that are 96-97% selective for either of the two regioisomers, each with complete diastereoselectivity. The mutants can be used for selective oxidative hydroxylation of other steroids without performing additional mutagenesis experiments. Molecular dynamics simulations and docking experiments shed light on the origin of regio- and stereoselectivity.",2
Reactions of the inner surface of carbon nanotubes and nanoprotrusion processes imaged at the atomic scale.,"Although the outer surface of single-walled carbon nanotubes (atomically thin cylinders of carbon) can be involved in a wide range of chemical reactions, it is generally thought that the interior surface of nanotubes is unreactive. In this study, we show that in the presence of catalytically active atoms of rhenium inserted into nanotubes, the nanotube sidewall can be engaged in chemical reactions from the inside. Aberration-corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscopy operated at 80 keV allows visualization of the formation of nanometre-sized hollow protrusions on the nanotube sidewall at the atomic level in real time at ambient temperature. Our direct observations and theoretical modelling demonstrate that the nanoprotrusions are formed in three stages: (i) metal-assisted deformation and rupture of the nanotube sidewall, (ii) the fast formation of a metastable asymmetric nanoprotrusion with an open edge and (iii) a slow symmetrization process that leads to a stable closed nanoprotrusion.",2
The transcription factor FOXM1 is a cellular target of the natural product thiostrepton.,"Transcription factors are proteins that bind specifically to defined DNA sequences to promote gene expression. Targeting transcription factors with small molecules to modulate the expression of certain genes has been notoriously difficult to achieve. The natural product thiostrepton is known to reduce the transcriptional activity of FOXM1, a transcription factor involved in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Herein we demonstrate that thiostrepton interacts directly with FOXM1 protein in the human breast cancer cells MCF-7. Biophysical analyses of the thiostrepton-FOXM1 interaction provide additional insights on the molecular mode of action of thiostrepton. In cellular experiments, we show that thiostrepton can inhibit the binding of FOXM1 to genomic target sites. These findings illustrate the potential druggability of transcription factors and provide a molecular basis for targeting the FOXM1 family with small molecules.",2
Peptide-nucleotide microdroplets as a step towards a membrane-free protocell model.,"Although phospholipid bilayers are ubiquitous in modern cells, their impermeability, lack of dynamic properties, and synthetic complexity are difficult to reconcile with plausible pathways of proto-metabolism, growth and division. Here, we present an alternative membrane-free model, which demonstrates that low-molecular-weight mononucleotides and simple cationic peptides spontaneously accumulate in water into microdroplets that are stable to changes in temperature and salt concentration, undergo pH-induced cycles of growth and decay, and promote alpha-helical peptide secondary structure. Moreover, the microdroplets selectively sequester porphyrins, inorganic nanoparticles and enzymes to generate supramolecular stacked arrays of light-harvesting molecules, nanoparticle-mediated oxidase activity, and enhanced rates of glucose phosphorylation, respectively. Taken together, our results suggest that peptide-nucleotide microdroplets can be considered as a new type of protocell model that could be used to develop novel bioreactors, primitive artificial cells and plausible pathways to prebiotic organization before the emergence of lipid-based compartmentalization on the early Earth.",2
Control and induction of surface-confined homochiral porous molecular networks.,"Homochirality is essential to many biological systems, and plays a pivotal role in various technological applications. The generation of homochirality and an understanding of its mechanism from the single-molecule to supramolecular level have received much attention. Two-dimensional chirality is a subject of intense interest due to the unique possibilities and consequences of confining molecular self-assembly to surfaces or interfaces. Here, we report the perfect generation of two-dimensional homochirality of porous molecular networks at the liquid-solid interface in two different ways: (i) by self-assembly of homochiral building blocks and (ii) by self-assembly of achiral building blocks in the presence of a chiral modifier via a hierarchical structural recognition process, as revealed by scanning tunnelling microscopy. The present results provide important impetus for the development of two-dimensional crystal engineering and may afford opportunities for the utilization of chiral nanowells in chiral recognition processes, as nanoreactors and as data storage systems.",2
Measuring oxygen reduction/evolution reactions on the nanoscale.,"The efficiency of fuel cells and metal-air batteries is significantly limited by the activation of oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. Despite the well-recognized role of oxygen reaction kinetics on the viability of energy technologies, the governing mechanisms remain elusive and until now have been addressable only by macroscopic studies. This lack of nanoscale understanding precludes optimization of material architecture. Here, we report direct measurements of oxygen reduction/evolution reactions and oxygen vacancy diffusion on oxygen-ion conductive solid surfaces with sub-10 nm resolution. In electrochemical strain microscopy, the biased scanning probe microscopy tip acts as a moving, electrocatalytically active probe exploring local electrochemical activity. The probe concentrates an electric field in a nanometre-scale volume of material, and bias-induced, picometre-level surface displacements provide information on local electrochemical processes. Systematic mapping of oxygen activity on bare and platinum-functionalized yttria-stabilized zirconia surfaces is demonstrated. This approach allows direct visualization of the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction activation process at the triple-phase boundary, and can be extended to a broad spectrum of oxygen-conductive and electrocatalytic materials.",2
A route to enantiopure RNA precursors from nearly racemic starting materials.,"The single-handedness of biological molecules is critical for molecular recognition and replication processes and would seem to be a prerequisite for the origin of life. A drawback of recently reported synthetic routes to RNA is the requirement for enantioenriched reactants, which fails to address the puzzle of how the single chirality of biological molecules arose. Here, we report the synthesis of highly enantioenriched RNA precursor molecules from racemic starting materials, with the molecular asymmetry derived solely from a small initial imbalance of the amino-acid enantiomers present in the reaction mixture. Acting as spectators to the main reaction chemistry, the amino acids orchestrate a sequence of physical and chemical amplification processes. The emergence of molecules of single chirality from complex, multi-component mixtures supports the robustness of this synthesis process under potential prebiotic conditions and provides a plausible explanation for the single-handedness of biological molecules before the emergence of self-replicating informational polymers.",2
Using personal glucose meters and functional DNA sensors to quantify a variety of analytical targets.,"Portable, low-cost and quantitative detection of a broad range of targets at home and in the field has the potential to revolutionize medical diagnostics and environmental monitoring. Despite many years of research, very few such devices are commercially available. Taking advantage of the wide availability and low cost of the pocket-sized personal glucose meter-used worldwide by diabetes sufferers-we demonstrate a method to use such meters to quantify non-glucose targets, ranging from a recreational drug (cocaine, 3.4 microM detection limit) to an important biological cofactor (adenosine, 18 microM detection limit), to a disease marker (interferon-gamma of tuberculosis, 2.6 nM detection limit) and a toxic metal ion (uranium, 9.1 nM detection limit). The method is based on the target-induced release of invertase from a functional-DNA-invertase conjugate. The released invertase converts sucrose into glucose, which is detectable using the meter. The approach should be easily applicable to the detection of many other targets through the use of suitable functional-DNA partners (aptamers, DNAzymes or aptazymes).",2

From crazy chemists to engaged learners through education.,"As well as teaching students what we know, it is becoming increasingly important to teach them how we think.

Sex and the citadel of science.,"One hundred years on from Marie Curie being awarded her second Nobel Prize there has been only a handful of female scientists who have received the call from Stockholm. Why are women still under-represented? A lack of ability or passion, or could it be that we create labs into which women don't quite fit?",2

Generation and exploitation of acyclic azomethine imines in chiral Bronsted acid catalysis.,"Successful implementation of a catalytic asymmetric synthesis strategy to produce enantiomerically enriched compounds requires the adoption of suitable prochiral substrates. The combination of an azomethine imine electrophile with various nucleophiles could give straightforward access to a number of synthetically useful chiral hydrazines, but is used rarely. Here we report the exploitation of acyclic azomethine imines as a new type of prochiral electrophile. They can be generated in situ by the condensation of N'-benzylbenzoylhydrazide with a variety of aldehydes in the presence of a catalytic amount of an axially chiral dicarboxylic acid. By trapping these electrophiles with alkyl diazoacetate or (diazomethyl)phosphonate nucleophiles, we produced a diverse array of chiral alpha-diazo-beta-hydrazino esters and phosphonates with excellent enantioselectivities.",2
Single-atom catalysis of CO oxidation using Pt1/FeOx.,"Platinum-based heterogeneous catalysts are critical to many important commercial chemical processes, but their efficiency is extremely low on a per metal atom basis, because only the surface active-site atoms are used. Catalysts with single-atom dispersions are thus highly desirable to maximize atom efficiency, but making them is challenging. Here we report the synthesis of a single-atom catalyst that consists of only isolated single Pt atoms anchored to the surfaces of iron oxide nanocrystallites. This single-atom catalyst has extremely high atom efficiency and shows excellent stability and high activity for both CO oxidation and preferential oxidation of CO in H2. Density functional theory calculations show that the high catalytic activity correlates with the partially vacant 5d orbitals of the positively charged, high-valent Pt atoms, which help to reduce both the CO adsorption energy and the activation barriers for CO oxidation.",2
Tirandamycin biosynthesis is mediated by co-dependent oxidative enzymes.,"Elucidation of natural product biosynthetic pathways provides important insights into the assembly of potent bioactive molecules, and expands access to unique enzymes able to selectively modify complex substrates. Here, we show full reconstitution, in vitro, of an unusual multi-step oxidative cascade for post-assembly-line tailoring of tirandamycin antibiotics. This pathway involves a remarkably versatile and iterative cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (TamI) and a flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent oxidase (TamL), which act co-dependently through the repeated exchange of substrates. TamI hydroxylates tirandamycin C (TirC) to generate tirandamycin E (TirE), a previously unidentified tirandamycin intermediate. TirE is subsequently oxidized by TamL, giving rise to the ketone of tirandamycin D (TirD), after which a unique exchange back to TamI enables successive epoxidation and hydroxylation to afford, respectively, the final products tirandamycin A (TirA) and tirandamycin B (TirB). Ligand-free, substrate- and product-bound crystal structures of bicovalently flavinylated TamL oxidase reveal a likely mechanism for the C10 oxidation of TirE.",2
Programmable molecular recognition based on the geometry of DNA nanostructures.,"From ligand-receptor binding to DNA hybridization, molecular recognition plays a central role in biology. Over the past several decades, chemists have successfully reproduced the exquisite specificity of biomolecular interactions. However, engineering multiple specific interactions in synthetic systems remains difficult. DNA retains its position as the best medium with which to create orthogonal, isoenergetic interactions, based on the complementarity of Watson-Crick binding. Here we show that DNA can be used to create diverse bonds using an entirely different principle: the geometric arrangement of blunt-end stacking interactions. We show that both binary codes and shape complementarity can serve as a basis for such stacking bonds, and explore their specificity, thermodynamics and binding rules. Orthogonal stacking bonds were used to connect five distinct DNA origami. This work, which demonstrates how a single attractive interaction can be developed to create diverse bonds, may guide strategies for molecular recognition in systems beyond DNA nanostructures.",2
Gateway synthesis of daphnane congeners and their protein kinase C affinities and cell-growth activities.,"The daphnane diterpene orthoesters constitute a structurally fascinating family of natural products that exhibit a remarkable range of potent biological activities. Although partial activity information is available for some natural daphnanes, little information exists for non-natural congeners or on how changes in structure affect mode of action, function, potency or selectivity. A gateway strategy designed to provide general synthetic access to natural and non-natural daphnanes is described and utilized in the synthesis of two novel members of this class. In this study, a commercially available tartrate derivative was elaborated through a key late-stage diversification intermediate into B-ring yuanhuapin analogues to initiate exploration of the structure-function relationships of this class. Protein kinase C was identified as a cellular target for these agents, and their activity against human lung and leukaemia cell lines was evaluated. The natural product and a novel non-natural analogue exhibited significant potency, but the epimeric epoxide was essentially inactive.",2
"Efficient hydrogenation of organic carbonates, carbamates and formates indicates alternative routes to methanol based on CO2 and CO.","Catalytic hydrogenation of organic carbonates, carbamates and formates is of significant interest both conceptually and practically, because these compounds can be produced from CO2 and CO, and their mild hydrogenation can provide alternative, mild approaches to the indirect hydrogenation of CO2 and CO to methanol, an important fuel and synthetic building block. Here, we report for the first time catalytic hydrogenation of organic carbonates to alcohols, and carbamates to alcohols and amines. Unprecedented homogeneously catalysed hydrogenation of organic formates to methanol has also been accomplished. The reactions are efficiently catalysed by dearomatized PNN Ru(II) pincer complexes derived from pyridine- and bipyridine-based tridentate ligands. These atom-economical reactions proceed under neutral, homogeneous conditions, at mild temperatures and under mild hydrogen pressures, and can operate in the absence of solvent with no generation of waste, representing the ultimate 'green' reactions. A possible mechanism involves metal-ligand cooperation by aromatization-dearomatization of the heteroaromatic pincer core.",2
Efficient enzyme-free copying of all four nucleobases templated by immobilized RNA.,"The transition from inanimate materials to the earliest forms of life must have involved multiplication of a catalytically active polymer that is able to replicate. The semiconservative replication that is characteristic of genetic information transfer requires strands that contain more than one type of nucleobase. Short strands of RNA can act as catalysts, but attempts to induce efficient self-copying of mixed sequences (containing four different nucleobases) have been unsuccessful with ribonucleotides. Here we show that inhibition by spent monomers, formed by the hydrolysis of the activated nucleotides, is the cause for incomplete extension of growing daughter strands on RNA templates. Immobilization of strands and periodic displacement of the solution containing the activated monomers overcome this inhibition. Any of the four nucleobases (A/C/G/U) is successfully copied in the absence of enzymes. We conclude therefore that in a prebiotic world, oligoribonucleotides may have formed and undergone self-copying on surfaces.",2
Interference structures in the differential cross-sections for inelastic scattering of NO by Ar.,"Inelastic scattering is a fundamental collisional process that plays an important role in many areas of chemistry, and its detailed study can provide valuable insight into more complex chemical systems. Here, we report the measurement of differential cross-sections for the rotationally inelastic scattering of NO(X2Pi1/2, v=0, j=0.5, f) by Ar at a collision energy of 530 cm(-1) in unprecedented detail, with full Lambda-doublet (hence total NO parity) resolution in both the initial and final rotational quantum states. The observed differential cross-sections depend sensitively on the change in total NO parity on collision. Differential cross-sections for total parity-conserving and changing collisions have distinct, novel quantum-mechanical interference structures, reflecting different sensitivities to specific homonuclear and heteronuclear terms in the interaction potential. The experimental data agree remarkably well with rigorous quantum-mechanical scattering calculations, and reveal the role played by total parity in acting as a potential energy landscape filter.",2
A coordination chemistry dichotomy for icosahedral carborane-based ligands.,"Although the majority of ligands in modern chemistry take advantage of carbon-based substituent effects to tune the sterics and electronics of coordinating moieties, we describe here how icosahedral carboranes-boron-rich clusters-can influence metal-ligand interactions. Using a series of phosphine-thioether chelating ligands featuring meta- or ortho-carboranes grafted on the sulfur atom, we were able to tune the lability of the platinum-sulfur interaction of platinum(II)-thioether complexes. Experimental observations, supported by computational work, show that icosahedral carboranes can act either as strong electron-withdrawing ligands or electron-donating moieties (similar to aryl- or alkyl-based groups, respectively), depending on which atom of the carborane cage is attached to the thioether moiety. These and similar results with carborane-selenol derivatives suggest that, in contrast to carbon-based ligands, icosahedral carboranes exhibit a significant dichotomy in their coordination chemistry, and can be used as a versatile class of electronically tunable building blocks for various ligand platforms.",2
Exploring and exploiting chemistry at the cell surface.,"Engineering the surface chemistry of a material so that it can interface with cells is an extraordinarily demanding task. The surface of a cell is composed of thousands of different lipids, proteins and carbohydrates, all intricately (and dynamically) arranged in three dimensions on multiple length scales. This complexity presents both a challenge and an opportunity to chemists working on bioactive interfaces. Here we discuss how some of these challenges can be met with interdisciplinary material synthesis. We also review the most popular classes of functional molecules grafted on engineered surfaces and explore some alternatives that may offer greater flexibility and specificity. Finally, we discuss the emerging field of dynamic surfaces capable of stimulating and responding to cellular activity in real time.",2
Light-induced spin-crossover magnet.,"The light-induced phase transition between the low-spin (LS) and high-spin (HS) states of some transition-metal ions has been extensively studied in the fields of chemistry and materials science. In a crystalline extended system, magnetically ordering the HS sites of such transition-metal ions by irradiation should lead to spontaneous magnetization. Previous examples of light-induced ordering have typically occurred by means of an intermetallic charge transfer mechanism, inducing a change of valence of the metal centres. Here, we describe the long-range magnetic ordering of the extended Fe(II)(HS) sites in a metal-organic framework caused instead by a light-induced excited spin-state trapping effect. The Fe-Nb-based material behaves as a spin-crossover magnet, in which a strong superexchange interaction (magnetic coupling through non-magnetic elements) between photo-produced Fe(II)(HS) and neighbouring Nb(IV) atoms operates through CN bridges. The magnetic phase transition is observed at 20 K with a coercive field of 240 Oe.",2
Synthesis of 3-O-sulfonated heparan sulfate octasaccharides that inhibit the herpes simplex virus type 1 host-cell interaction.,"Cell surface carbohydrates play significant roles in a number of biologically important processes. Heparan sulfate, for instance, is a ubiquitously distributed polysulfated polysaccharide that is involved, among other things, in the initial step of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection. The virus interacts with cell-surface heparan sulfate to facilitate host-cell attachment and entry. 3-O-Sulfonated heparan sulfate has been found to function as an HSV-1 entry receptor. Achieving a complete understanding of these interactions requires the chemical synthesis of such oligosaccharides, but this remains challenging. Here, we present a convenient approach for the synthesis of two irregular 3-O-sulfonated heparan sulfate octasaccharides, making use of a key disaccharide intermediate to acquire different building blocks for the oligosaccharide chain assembly. Despite substantial structural differences, the prepared 3-O-sulfonated sugars blocked viral infection in a dosage-dependent manner with remarkable similarity to one another.",2
Facile removal of stabilizer-ligands from supported gold nanoparticles.,"Metal nanoparticles that comprise a few hundred to several thousand atoms have many applications in areas such as photonics, sensing, medicine and catalysis. Colloidal methods have proven particularly suitable for producing small nanoparticles with controlled morphologies and excellent catalytic properties. Ligands are necessary to stabilize nanoparticles during synthesis, but once the particles have been deposited on a substrate the presence of the ligands is detrimental for catalytic activity. Previous methods for ligand removal have typically involved thermal and oxidative treatments, which can affect the size or morphology of the particles, in turn altering their catalytic activity. Here, we report a procedure to effectively remove the ligands without affecting particle morphology, which enhances the surface exposure of the nanoparticles and their catalytic activity over a range of reactions. This may lead to developments of nanoparticles prepared by colloidal methods for applications in fields such as environmental protection and energy production.",2
Design principles for oxygen-reduction activity on perovskite oxide catalysts for fuel cells and metal-air batteries.,"The prohibitive cost and scarcity of the noble-metal catalysts needed for catalysing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells and metal-air batteries limit the commercialization of these clean-energy technologies. Identifying a catalyst design principle that links material properties to the catalytic activity can accelerate the search for highly active and abundant transition-metal-oxide catalysts to replace platinum. Here, we demonstrate that the ORR activity for oxide catalysts primarily correlates to sigma-orbital (e(g)) occupation and the extent of B-site transition-metal-oxygen covalency, which serves as a secondary activity descriptor. Our findings reflect the critical influences of the sigma orbital and metal-oxygen covalency on the competition between O(2)(2-)/OH(-) displacement and OH(-) regeneration on surface transition-metal ions as the rate-limiting steps of the ORR, and thus highlight the importance of electronic structure in controlling oxide catalytic activity.",2
An efficient synthesis of loline alkaloids.,"Loline (1) is a small alkaloid that, in spite of its simple-looking structure, has posed surprising challenges to synthetic chemists. It has been known for more than a century and has been the subject of extensive biological investigations, but only two total syntheses have been achieved to date. Here, we report an asymmetric total synthesis of loline that, with less then ten steps, is remarkably short. Our synthesis incorporates a Sharpless epoxidation, a Grubbs olefin metathesis and an unprecedented transannular aminobromination, which converts an eight-membered cyclic carbamate into a bromopyrrolizidine. The synthesis is marked by a high degree of chemo- and stereoselectivity and gives access to several members of the loline alkaloid family. It delivers sufficient material to support a programme aimed at studying the complex interactions between plants, fungi, insects and bacteria brokered by loline alkaloids.",2
Strong exchange and magnetic blocking in N(2)(3)(-)-radical-bridged lanthanide complexes.,"Single-molecule magnets approach the ultimate size limit for spin-based devices. These complexes can retain spin information over long periods of time at low temperature, suggesting possible applications in high-density information storage, quantum computing and spintronics. Notably, the success of most such applications hinges upon raising the inherent molecular spin-inversion barrier. Although recent advances have shown the viability of lanthanide-containing complexes in generating large barriers, weak or non-existent magnetic exchange coupling allows fast relaxation pathways that mitigate the full potential of these species. Here, we show that the diffuse spin of an N(2)(3-) radical bridge can lead to exceptionally strong magnetic exchange in dinuclear Ln(III) (Ln = Gd, Dy) complexes. The Gd(III) congener exhibits the strongest magnetic coupling yet observed for that ion, while incorporation of the high-anisotropy Dy(III) ion gives rise to a molecule with a record magnetic blocking temperature of 8.3 K at a sweep rate of 0.08 T s(-1).",2
Ammonia formation by metal-ligand cooperative hydrogenolysis of a nitrido ligand.,"Bioinspired hydrogenation of N(2) to ammonia at ambient conditions by stepwise nitrogen protonation/reduction with metal complexes in solution has experienced remarkable progress. In contrast, the highly desirable direct hydrogenation with H(2) remains difficult. In analogy to the heterogeneously catalysed Haber-Bosch process, such a reaction is conceivable via metal-centred N(2) splitting and unprecedented hydrogenolysis of the nitrido ligands to ammonia. We report the synthesis of a ruthenium(IV) nitrido complex. The high nucleophilicity of the nitrido ligand is demonstrated by unusual N-C coupling with pi-acidic CO. Furthermore, the terminal nitrido ligand undergoes facile hydrogenolysis with H(2) at ambient conditions to produce ammonia in high yield. Kinetic and quantum chemical examinations of this reaction suggest cooperative behaviour of a phosphorus-nitrogen-phosphorus pincer ligand in rate-determining heterolytic hydrogen splitting.",2
Nitrenium ions as ligands for transition metals.,"Unlike N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), which are now used ubiquitously in metal-based chemistry, the nitrogen-derived analogue (in which a carbon is replaced with the isoelectronic nitrogen cation, a nitrenium ion) has remained elusive as a ligand for metals. This is especially intriguing, because several other main-group analogues of NHCs have been prepared, and have been shown to coordinate with transition-metal complexes. Here, we describe the preparation of several N-heterocyclic nitrenium ions that are isoelectronic and isostructural to NHCs, and study their ligand properties. The formation of relatively strong nitrenium-metal bonds is unambiguously confirmed, in solution by selective (15)N-labelling experiments, and in the solid state by X-ray crystallography. Experimental and computational studies of the electronic properties of this novel type of ligand suggest that they are poor sigma-donors and good pi-acceptors.",2
Contemporary strategies for peptide macrocyclization.,"Peptide macrocycles have found applications that range from drug discovery to nanomaterials. These ring-shaped molecules have shown remarkable capacity for functional fine-tuning. Such capacity is enabled by the possibility of adjusting the peptide conformation using the techniques of chemical synthesis. Cyclic peptides have been difficult, and often impossible, to prepare using traditional synthetic methods. For macrocyclization to occur, the activated peptide must adopt an entropically disfavoured pre-cyclization conformation before forming the desired product. Here, we review recent solutions to some of the major challenges in this important area of contemporary synthesis.",2
The effect of gold loading and particle size on photocatalytic hydrogen production from ethanol over Au/TiO(2) nanoparticles.,"Catalytic hydrogen production from renewables is a promising method for providing energy carriers in the near future. Photocatalysts capable of promoting this reaction are often composed of noble metal nanoparticles deposited on a semiconductor. The most promising semiconductor at present is TiO(2). The successful design of these catalysts relies on a thorough understanding of the role of the noble metal particle size and the TiO(2) polymorph. Here we demonstrate that Au particles in the size range 3-30 nm on TiO(2) are very active in hydrogen production from ethanol. It was found that Au particles of similar size on anatase nanoparticles delivered a rate two orders of magnitude higher than that recorded for Au on rutile nanoparticles. Surprisingly, it was also found that Au particle size does not affect the photoreaction rate over the 3-12 nm range. The high hydrogen yield observed makes these catalysts promising materials for solar conversion.",2
Total synthesis of solanoeclepin A.,"Cyst nematodes are troublesome parasites that live on, and destroy, a range of important host vegetable plants. Damage caused by the potato cyst nematode has now been reported in over 50 countries. One approach to eliminating the problem is to stimulate early hatching of the nematodes, but key hatching stimuli are not naturally available in sufficient quantities to do so. Here, we report the first chemical synthesis of solanoeclepin A, the key hatch-stimulating substance for potato cyst nematode. The crucial steps in our synthesis are an intramolecular cyclization reaction for construction of the highly strained tricyclo[5.2.1.0(1)'(6)]decane skeleton (DEF ring system) and an intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction of a furan derivative for the synthesis of the ABC carbon framework. The present synthesis has the potential to contribute to addressing one of the critical food issues of the twenty-first century.",2
Core@shell bimetallic nanoparticle synthesis via anion coordination.,"Core@shell structured bimetallic nanoparticles are currently of immense interest due to their unique electronic, optical and catalytic properties. However, their synthesis is non-trivial. We report a new supramolecular route for the synthesis of core@shell nanoparticles, based on an anion coordination protocol--the first to function by binding the shell metal to the surface of the pre-formed primary metal core before reduction. The resultant gold/palladium and platinum/palladium core@shell nanoparticles have been characterized by aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (as well as other techniques), giving striking atomic-resolution images of the core@shell architecture, and the unique catalytic properties of the structured nanoparticles have been demonstrated in a remarkable improvement of the selective production of industrially valuable chloroaniline from chloronitrobenzene.",2
Construction of bispirooxindoles containing three quaternary stereocentres in a cascade using a single multifunctional organocatalyst.,"Single-step constructions of molecules with multiple quaternary carbon stereocentres are rare. The spirooxindole structural motif is common to a range of bioactive compounds; however, asymmetric synthesis of this motif is complicated due to the presence of multiple chiral centres. The development of organocatalytic cascade reactions has proven to be valuable for the construction of several chiral centres in one step. Here, we describe a newly designed organocatalytic asymmetric domino Michael-aldol reaction between 3-substituted oxindoles and methyleneindolinones that affords complex bispirooxindoles. This reaction was catalysed by a novel multifunctional organocatalyst that contains tertiary and primary amines and thiourea moieties to activate substrates simultaneously, providing extraordinary levels of stereocontrol over four stereocentres, three of which are quaternary carbon stereocentres. This new methodology provides facile access to a range of multisubstituted bispirocyclooxindole derivatives, and should be useful in medicinal chemistry and diversity-oriented syntheses of this intriguing class of compounds.",2
Visible-light-enhanced catalytic oxidation reactions on plasmonic silver nanostructures.,"Catalysis plays a critical role in chemical conversion, energy production and pollution mitigation. High activation barriers associated with rate-limiting elementary steps require most commercial heterogeneous catalytic reactions to be run at relatively high temperatures, which compromises energy efficiency and the long-term stability of the catalyst. Here we show that plasmonic nanostructures of silver can concurrently use low-intensity visible light (on the order of solar intensity) and thermal energy to drive catalytic oxidation reactions--such as ethylene epoxidation, CO oxidation, and NH(3) oxidation--at lower temperatures than their conventional counterparts that use only thermal stimulus. Based on kinetic isotope experiments and density functional calculations, we postulate that excited plasmons on the silver surface act to populate O(2) antibonding orbitals and so form a transient negative-ion state, which thereby facilitates the rate-limiting O(2)-dissociation reaction. The results could assist the design of catalytic processes that are more energy efficient and robust than current processes.",2
Water-oxidation catalysis by manganese in a geochemical-like cycle.,"Water oxidation in all oxygenic photosynthetic organisms is catalysed by the Mn(4)CaO(4) cluster of Photosystem II. This cluster has inspired the development of synthetic manganese catalysts for solar energy production. A photoelectrochemical device, made by impregnating a synthetic tetranuclear-manganese cluster into a Nafion matrix, has been shown to achieve efficient water oxidation catalysis. We report here in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy studies that demonstrate that this cluster dissociates into Mn(II) compounds in the Nafion, which are then reoxidized to form dispersed nanoparticles of a disordered Mn(III/IV)-oxide phase. Cycling between the photoreduced product and this mineral-like solid is responsible for the observed photochemical water-oxidation catalysis. The original manganese cluster serves only as a precursor to the catalytically active material. The behaviour of Mn in Nafion therefore parallels its broader biogeochemistry, which is also dominated by cycles of oxidation into solid Mn(III/IV) oxides followed by photoreduction to Mn(2)(+).",2
A delocalized arene-bridged diuranium single-molecule magnet.,"Single-molecule magnets (SMMs) are compounds that, below a blocking temperature, exhibit stable magnetization purely of molecular origin, and not caused by long-range ordering of magnetic moments in the bulk. They thus show promise for applications such as data storage of ultra-high density. The stability of the magnetization increases with increasing ground-state spin and magnetic anisotropy. Transition-metal SMMs typically possess high-spin ground states, but insufficient magnetic anisotropies. Lanthanide SMMs exhibit large magnetic anisotropies, but building high-spin ground states is difficult because they tend to form ionic bonds that limit magnetic exchange coupling. In contrast, the significant covalent bonding and large spin-orbit contributions associated with uranium are particularly attractive for the development of improved SMMs. Here we report a delocalized arene-bridged diuranium SMM. This study demonstrates that arene-bridged polyuranium clusters can exhibit SMM behaviour without relying on the superexchange coupling of spins. This approach may lead to increased blocking temperatures.",2
"Synthesis of conolidine, a potent non-opioid analgesic for tonic and persistent pain.","Management of chronic pain continues to represent an area of great unmet biomedical need. Although opioid analgesics are typically embraced as the mainstay of pharmaceutical interventions in this area, they suffer from substantial liabilities that include addiction and tolerance, as well as depression of breathing, nausea and chronic constipation. Because of their suboptimal therapeutic profile, the search for non-opioid analgesics to replace these well-established therapeutics is an important pursuit. Conolidine is a rare C5-nor stemmadenine natural product recently isolated from the stem bark of Tabernaemontana divaricata (a tropical flowering plant used in traditional Chinese, Ayurvedic and Thai medicine). Although structurally related alkaloids have been described as opioid analgesics, no therapeutically relevant properties of conolidine have previously been reported. Here, we describe the first de novo synthetic pathway to this exceptionally rare C5-nor stemmadenine natural product, the first asymmetric synthesis of any member of this natural product class, and the discovery that (+/-)-, (+)- and (-)-conolidine are potent and efficacious non-opioid analgesics in an in vivo model of tonic and persistent pain.",2
Near-threshold H/D exchange in CD(3)CHO photodissociation.,"Measuring the isotopic abundance of hydrogen versus deuterium atoms is a key method for interrogating reaction pathways in chemistry. H/D 'scrambling' is the intramolecular rearrangement of labile isotopes of hydrogen atoms and when it occurs through unanticipated pathways can complicate the interpretation of such experiments. Here, we investigate H/D scrambling in acetaldehyde at the energetic threshold for breaking the formyl C-H bond and reveal an unexpected unimolecular mechanism. Laser photolysis experiments of CD(3)CHO show that up to 17% of the products have undergone H/D exchange to give CD(2)H + DCO. Transition-state theory calculations reveal that the dominant mechanism involves four sequential H- or D-shifts to form CD(2)HCDO, which then undergoes conventional C-C bond cleavage. At the lowest energy the molecule undergoes an average of 20 H- or D-shifts before products are formed, evincing significant scrambling of H and D atoms. Analogous photochemically induced isomerizations and isotope scrambling are probably important in both atmospheric chemistry and combustion reactions.",2
A microdroplet dilutor for high-throughput screening.,"Pipetting and dilution are universal processes used in chemical and biological laboratories to assay and experiment. In microfluidics such operations are equally in demand, but difficult to implement. Recently, droplet-based microfluidics has emerged as an exciting new platform for high-throughput experimentation. However, it is challenging to vary the concentration of droplets rapidly and controllably. To this end, we developed a dilution module for high-throughput screening using droplet-based microfluidics. Briefly, a nanolitre-sized sample droplet of defined concentration is trapped within a microfluidic chamber. Through a process of droplet merging, mixing and re-splitting, this droplet is combined with a series of smaller buffer droplets to generate a sequence of output droplets that define a digital concentration gradient. Importantly, the formed droplets can be merged with other reagent droplets to enable rapid chemical and biological screens. As a proof of concept, we used the dilutor to perform a high-throughput homogeneous DNA-binding assay using only nanolitres of sample.",2
Blueprinting macromolecular electronics.,"Recently, by mastering either top-down or bottom-up approaches, tailor-made macromolecular nano-objects with semiconducting properties have been fabricated. These engineered nanostructures for organic electronics are based on conjugated systems predominantly made up of sp(2)-hybridized carbon, such as graphene nanoribbons. Here, we describe developments in a selection of these nanofabrication techniques, which include graphene carving, stimulus-induced synthesis of conjugated polymers and surface-assisted synthesis. We also assess their potential to reproduce chemically and spatially precise molecular arrangements, that is, molecular blueprints. In a broad context, the engineering of a molecular blueprint represents the fabrication of an integrated all-organic macromolecular electronic circuit. In this Perspective, we suggest chemical routes, as well as convergent on-surface synthesis and microfabrication approaches, for the ultimate goal of bringing the field closer to technology.",2
Biodegradable nanostructures with selective lysis of microbial membranes.,"Macromolecular antimicrobial agents such as cationic polymers and peptides have recently been under an increased level of scrutiny because they can combat multi-drug-resistant microbes. Most of these polymers are non-biodegradable and are designed to mimic the facially amphiphilic structure of peptides so that they may form a secondary structure on interaction with negatively charged microbial membranes. The resulting secondary structure can insert into and disintegrate the cell membrane after recruiting additional polymer molecules. Here, we report the first biodegradable and in vivo applicable antimicrobial polymer nanoparticles synthesized by metal-free organocatalytic ring-opening polymerization of functional cyclic carbonate. We demonstrate that the nanoparticles disrupt microbial walls/membranes selectively and efficiently, thus inhibiting the growth of Gram-positive bacteria, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and fungi, without inducing significant haemolysis over a wide range of concentrations. These biodegradable nanoparticles, which can be synthesized in large quantities and at low cost, are promising as antimicrobial drugs, and can be used to treat various infectious diseases such as MRSA-associated infections, which are often linked with high mortality.",2
Directed long-range molecular migration energized by surface reaction.,"The recoil of adsorbates away (desorption) and towards (reaction) surfaces is well known. Here, we describe the long-range recoil of adsorbates in the plane of a surface, and accordingly the novel phenomenon of reactions occurring at a substantial distance from the originating event. Three thermal and three electron-induced surface reactions are shown by scanning tunnelling microscopy to propel their physisorbed ethylenic products across the rough surface of Si(100) over a distance of up to 200 A before an attachment reaction. The recoil energy in the ethylenic products comes from thermal exoergicity or from electronic excitation of chemisorbed alkenes. We propose that the mechanism of migration is a rolling motion, because the recoiling molecule overcomes raised surface obstacles. Electronic excitation of propene causes directional recoil and often end-to-end inversion, suggesting cartwheeling. Ab initio calculations of the halogenation and electron-induced reactions support a model in which asymmetric forces between the molecule and the surface induce rotation and therefore migration.",2
Platinum nanocrystals selectively shaped using facet-specific peptide sequences.,"The properties of a nanocrystal are heavily influenced by its shape. Shape control of a colloidal nanocrystal is believed to be a kinetic process, with high-energy facets growing faster then vanishing, leading to nanocrystals enclosed by low-energy facets. Identifying a surfactant that can specifically bind to a particular crystal facet is critical, but has proved challenging to date. Biomolecules have exquisite specific molecular recognition properties that can be explored for the precise engineering of nanostructured materials. Here, we report the use of facet-specific peptide sequences as regulating agents for the predictable synthesis of platinum nanocrystals with selectively exposed crystal surfaces and particular shapes. The formation of platinum nanocubes and nanotetrahedrons are demonstrated with Pt-{100} and Pt-{111} binding peptides, respectively. Our studies unambiguously demonstrate the abilities of facet-selective binding peptides in determining nanocrystal shape, representing a critical step forward in the use of biomolecules for programmable synthesis of nanostructures.",2
Regio- and stereodivergent antibiotic oxidative carbocyclizations catalysed by Rieske oxygenase-like enzymes.,"Oxidative cyclizations, exemplified by the biosynthetic assembly of the penicillin nucleus from a tripeptide precursor, are arguably the most synthetically powerful implementation of C-H activation reactions in nature. Here, we show that Rieske oxygenase-like enzymes mediate regio- and stereodivergent oxidative cyclizations to form 10- and 12-membered carbocyclic rings in the key steps of the biosynthesis of the antibiotics streptorubin B and metacycloprodigiosin, respectively. These reactions represent the first examples of oxidative carbocyclizations catalysed by non-haem iron-dependent oxidases and define a novel type of catalytic activity for Rieske enzymes. A better understanding of how these enzymes achieve such remarkable regio- and stereocontrol in the functionalization of unactivated hydrocarbon chains will greatly facilitate the development of selective man-made C-H activation catalysts.",2
Interfacial synthesis of hollow metal-organic framework capsules demonstrating selective permeability.,"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of crystalline materials that consist of metal ions and organic ligands linked together by coordination bonds. Because of their porosity and the possibility of combining large surface areas with pore characteristics that can be tailored, these solids show great promise for a wide range of applications. Although most applications currently under investigation are based on powdered solids, developing synthetic methods to prepare defect-free MOF layers will also enable applications based on selective permeation. Here, we demonstrate how the intrinsically hybrid nature of MOFs enables the self-completing growth of thin MOF layers. Moreover, these layers can be shaped as hollow capsules that demonstrate selective permeability directly related to the micropore size of the MOF crystallites forming the capsule wall. Such capsules effectively entrap guest species, and, in the future, could be applied in the development of selective microreactors containing molecular catalysts.",2
Catalytic asymmetric carbon-carbon bond formation via allylic alkylations with organolithium compounds.,"Carbon-carbon bond formation is the basis for the biogenesis of nature's essential molecules. Consequently, it lies at the heart of the chemical sciences. Chiral catalysts have been developed for asymmetric C-C bond formation to yield single enantiomers from several organometallic reagents. Remarkably, for extremely reactive organolithium compounds, which are among the most broadly used reagents in chemical synthesis, a general catalytic methodology for enantioselective C-C formation has proven elusive, until now. Here, we report a copper-based chiral catalytic system that allows carbon-carbon bond formation via allylic alkylation with alkyllithium reagents, with extremely high enantioselectivities and able to tolerate several functional groups. We have found that both the solvent used and the structure of the active chiral catalyst are the most critical factors in achieving successful asymmetric catalysis with alkyllithium reagents. The active form of the chiral catalyst has been identified through spectroscopic studies as a diphosphine copper monoalkyl species.",2
Nanocrystal bilayer for tandem catalysis.,"Supported catalysts are widely used in industry and can be optimized by tuning the composition and interface of the metal nanoparticles and oxide supports. Rational design of metal-metal oxide interfaces in nanostructured catalysts is critical to achieve better reaction activities and selectivities. We introduce here a new class of nanocrystal tandem catalysts that have multiple metal-metal oxide interfaces for the catalysis of sequential reactions. We utilized a nanocrystal bilayer structure formed by assembling platinum and cerium oxide nanocube monolayers of less than 10 nm on a silica substrate. The two distinct metal-metal oxide interfaces, CeO(2)-Pt and Pt-SiO(2), can be used to catalyse two distinct sequential reactions. The CeO(2)-Pt interface catalysed methanol decomposition to produce CO and H(2), which were subsequently used for ethylene hydroformylation catalysed by the nearby Pt-SiO(2) interface. Consequently, propanal was produced selectively from methanol and ethylene on the nanocrystal bilayer tandem catalyst. This new concept of nanocrystal tandem catalysis represents a powerful approach towards designing high-performance, multifunctional nanostructured catalysts.",2
Stereoselective C-C bond formation catalysed by engineered carboxymethylproline synthases.,"The reaction of enol(ate)s with electrophiles is used extensively in organic synthesis for stereoselective C-C bond formation. Protein-based catalysts have had comparatively limited application for the stereoselective formation of C-C bonds of choice via enolate chemistry. We describe protein engineering studies on 5-carboxymethylproline synthases, members of the crotonase superfamily, aimed at enabling stereoselective C-C bond formation leading to N-heterocycles via control of trisubstituted enolate intermediates. Active site substitutions, including at the oxyanion binding site, enable the production of substituted N-heterocycles in high diastereomeric excesses via stereocontrolled enolate formation and reaction. The results reveal the potential of the ubiquitous crotonase superfamily as adaptable catalysts for the control of enolate chemistry.",2
A robust molecular platform for non-volatile memory devices with optical and magnetic responses.,"Bistable molecules that behave as switches in solution have long been known. Systems that can be reversibly converted between two stable states that differ in their physical properties are particularly attractive in the development of memory devices when immobilized in substrates. Here, we report a highly robust surface-confined switch based on an electroactive, persistent organic radical immobilized on indium tin oxide substrates that can be electrochemically and reversibly converted to the anion form. This molecular bistable system behaves as an extremely robust redox switch in which an electrical input is transduced into optical as well as magnetic outputs under ambient conditions. The fact that this molecular surface switch, operating at very low voltages, can be patterned and addressed locally, and also has exceptionally high long-term stability and excellent reversibility and reproducibility, makes it a very promising platform for non-volatile memory devices.",2
Crystalline molecular flasks.,"A variety of host compounds have been used as molecular-scale reaction vessels, protecting guests from their environment or restricting the space available around them, thus favouring particular reactions. Such molecular 'flasks' can endow guest molecules with reactivities that differ from those in bulk solvents. Here, we extend this concept to crystalline molecular flasks, solid-state crystalline networks with pores within which pseudo-solution-state reactions can take place. As the guest molecules can spontaneously align along the walls and channels of the hosts, structural changes in the substrates can be directly observed by in situ X-ray crystallography during reaction. Recently, this has enabled observation of the molecular structures of transient intermediates and other labile species, in the form of sequential structural snapshots of the chemical transformation. Here, we describe the principles, development and applications of crystalline molecular flasks.",2
The Jekyll-and-Hyde chemistry of Phaeobacter gallaeciensis.,"Emiliania huxleyi, an environmentally important marine microalga, has a bloom-and-bust lifestyle in which massive algal blooms appear and fade. Phaeobacter gallaeciensis belongs to the roseobacter clade of alpha-Proteobacteria, the populations of which wax and wane with that of E. huxleyi. Roseobacter are thought to promote algal growth by biosynthesizing and secreting antibiotics and growth stimulants (auxins). Here we show that P. gallaeciensis switches its secreted small molecule metabolism to the production of potent and selective algaecides, the roseobacticides, in response to p-coumaric acid, an algal lignin breakdown product that is symptomatic of aging algae. This switch converts P. gallaeciensis into an opportunistic pathogen of its algal host.",2
Dihydrogen contacts in alkanes are subtle but not faint.,"Alkane molecules are held together in the crystal state by purportedly weak homonuclear R-H...H-R dihydrogen interactions. In an apparent contradiction, the high melting points and vaporization enthalpies of polyhedranes in condensed phases require quite strong intermolecular interactions. Two questions arise: 'How strong can a weak C-H...H-C bond be?' and 'How do the size and topology of the carbon skeleton affect these bonding interactions?' A systematic computational study of intermolecular interactions in dimers of n-alkanes and polyhedranes, such as tetrahedrane, cubane, octahedrane or dodecahedrane, showed that attractive C-H...H-C interactions are stronger than usually thought. We identified factors that account for the strength of these interactions, including the tertiary nature of the carbon atoms and their low pyramidality. An alkane with a bowl shape was designed in the search for stronger dihydrogen intermolecular bonding, and a dissociation energy as high as 12 kJ mol(-)(1) is predicted by our calculations.",2
Gradient-driven motion of multivalent ligand molecules along a surface functionalized with multiple receptors.,"The kinetics of multivalent (multisite) interactions at interfaces is poorly understood, despite its fundamental importance for molecular or biomolecular motion and molecular recognition events at biological interfaces. Here, we use fluorescence microscopy to monitor the spreading of mono-, di- and trivalent ligand molecules on a receptor-functionalized surface, and perform multiscale computer simulations to understand the surface diffusion mechanisms. Analogous to chemotaxis, we found that the spreading is directional (along a developing gradient of vacant receptor sites) and is strongly dependent on ligand valency and concentration of a competing monovalent receptor in solution. We identify multiple surface diffusion mechanisms, which we call walking, hopping and flying. The study shows that the interfacial behaviour of multivalent systems is much more complex than that of monovalent ones.",2
Distortion-triggered loss of long-range order in solids with bonding energy hierarchy.,"An amorphous-to-crystal transition in phase-change materials like Ge-Sb-Te is widely used for data storage. The basic principle is to take advantage of the property contrast between the crystalline and amorphous states to encode information; amorphization is believed to be caused by melting the materials with an intense laser or electrical pulse and subsequently quenching the melt. Here, we demonstrate that distortions in the crystalline phase may trigger a collapse of long-range order, generating the amorphous phase without going through the liquid state. We further show that the principal change in optical properties occurs during the distortion of the still crystalline structure, upsetting yet another commonly held belief that attributes the change in properties to the loss of long-range order. Furthermore, our results suggest a way to lower energy consumption by condensing phase change inducing energy into shorter pulses or through the use of coherent phonon excitation.",2
Protecting group and switchable pore-discriminating adsorption properties of a hydrophilic-hydrophobic metal-organic framework.,"Formed by linking metals or metal clusters through organic linkers, metal-organic frameworks are a class of solids with structural and chemical properties that mark them out as candidates for many emerging gas storage, separation, catalysis and biomedical applications. Important features of these materials include their high porosity and their flexibility in response to chemical or physical stimuli. Here, a copper-based metal-organic framework has been prepared in which the starting linker (benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid) undergoes selective monoesterification during synthesis to produce a solid with two different channel systems, lined by hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces, respectively. The material reacts differently to gases or vapours of dissimilar chemistry, some stimulating subtle framework flexibility or showing kinetic adsorption effects. Adsorption can be switched between the two channels by judicious choice of the conditions. The monoesterified linker is recoverable in quantitative yield, demonstrating possible uses of metal-organic frameworks in molecular synthetic chemistry as 'protecting groups' to accomplish selective transformations that are difficult using standard chemistry techniques.",2
A renewable amine for photochemical reduction of CO(2).,"Photochemical reduction of CO(2) (to produce formic acid) can be seen both as a method to produce a transportable hydrogen-based fuel and also to reduce levels of CO(2) in the atmosphere. However, an often overlooked necessity for photochemical CO(2) reduction is the need for a sacrificial electron donor, usually a tertiary amine. Here, we describe a new strategy for coupling the photochemical reduction of CO(2) to photochemical water splitting, and illustrate this with a prototype example. Instead of seeking to eliminate the use of an external reducing agent altogether, our alternative strategy makes the reducing agent recyclable. This has two potential advantages over the direct coupling of CO(2) reduction and water oxidation. First, it allows the two redox reactions to be carried out with existing chemistry, and second, it permits these reactions to be conducted under mutually incompatible conditions.",2
A two-dimensional phase of TiO(2) with a reduced bandgap.,"Titanium dioxide is the prototypical transition metal oxide photocatalyst. However, the larger than 3 eV bandgap of common bulk phases of TiO(2) limits its light absorption to UV light, making it inefficient for solar energy conversion. Attempts at increasing visible light activity by narrowing the bandgap of TiO(2) through doping have proven difficult, because of defect-induced charge trapping and recombination sites of photo-excited charge carriers. Here, we report the existence of a dopant-free, pure TiO(2) phase with a narrow bandgap. This new pure TiO(2) phase forms on the surface of rutile TiO(2)(011) by oxidation of bulk titanium interstitials. We measure a bandgap of only ~2.1 eV for this new phase, matching it closely with the energy of visible light.",2
The role of long-lived reactive oxygen intermediates in the reaction of ozone with aerosol particles.,"The heterogeneous reactions of O(3) with aerosol particles are of central importance to air quality. They are studied extensively, but the molecular mechanisms and kinetics remain unresolved. Based on new experimental data and calculations, we show that long-lived reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) are formed. The chemical lifetime of these intermediates exceeds 100 seconds, which is much longer than the surface residence time of molecular O(3) (~10(-)(9) s). The ROIs explain and resolve apparent discrepancies between earlier quantum mechanical calculations and kinetic experiments. They play a key role in the chemical transformation and adverse health effects of toxic and allergenic air-particulate matter, such as soot, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and proteins. ROIs may also be involved in the decomposition of O(3) on mineral dust and in the formation and growth of secondary organic aerosols. Moreover, ROIs may contribute to the coupling of atmospheric and biospheric multiphase processes.",2
Iridium-catalysed direct C-C coupling of methanol and allenes.,"Methanol is an abundant (35 million metric tons per year), renewable chemical feedstock, yet its use as a one-carbon building block in fine chemical synthesis is highly underdeveloped. Using a homogeneous iridium catalyst developed in our laboratory, methanol engages in a direct C-C coupling with allenes to furnish higher alcohols that incorporate all-carbon quaternary centres, free of stoichiometric by-products. A catalytic mechanism that involves turnover-limiting methanol oxidation, a consequence of the high energetic demand of methanol dehydrogenation, is corroborated through a series of competition kinetics experiments. This process represents the first catalytic C-C coupling of methanol to provide discrete products of hydroxymethylation.",2
Covalent bulk functionalization of graphene.,"Graphene, a truly two-dimensional and fully pi-conjugated honeycomb carbon network, is currently evolving into the most promising successor to silicon in micro- and nanoelectronic applications. However, its wider application is impeded by the difficulties in opening a bandgap in its gapless band-structure, as well as the lack of processability in the resultant intrinscially insoluble material. Covalent chemical modification of the pi-electron system is capable of addressing both of these issues through the introduction of variable chemical decoration. Although there has been significant research activity in the field of functionalized graphene, most work to date has focused on the use of graphene oxide. In this Article, we report on the first wet chemical bulk functionalization route beginning with pristine graphite that does not require initial oxidative damage of the graphene basal planes. Through effective reductive activation, covalent functionalization of the charged graphene is achieved by organic diazonium salts. Functionalization was observed spectroscopically, and successfully prevents reaggregation while providing solubility in common organic media.",2
Recent advances in submolecular resolution with scanning probe microscopy.,"Recently scanning probe microscopy has made tremendous progress in imaging organic molecules with high lateral resolution. Atoms and bonds within individual molecules have been clearly resolved, indicating the exciting potential of this technique for studying molecular structures, bonding within and between molecules, molecular conformational changes and chemical reactions at the single-molecule level. It turns out that the key step enabling such studies is an atomically controlled functionalization of the microscope tip. In this Perspective, the different techniques used for high-resolution molecular imaging, their implementations, advantages and limitations are described, and possible scientific areas of applications are discussed.",2
Spatial and temporal control of the alkyne-azide cycloaddition by photoinitiated Cu(II) reduction.,"The click reaction paradigm is focused on the development and implementation of reactions that are simple to perform while being robust and providing exquisite control of the reaction and its products. Arguably the most prolific and powerful of these reactions, the copper-catalysed alkyne-azide reaction (CuAAC) is highly efficient and ubiquitous in an ever increasing number of synthetic methodologies and applications, including bioconjugation, labelling, surface functionalization, dendrimer synthesis, polymer synthesis and polymer modification. Unfortunately, as the Cu(I) catalyst is typically generated by the chemical reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I), or added as a Cu(I) salt, temporal and spatial control of the CuAAC reaction is not readily achieved. Here, we demonstrate catalysis of the CuAAC reaction via the photochemical reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I), affording comprehensive spatial and temporal control of the CuAAC reaction using standard photolithographic techniques. Results reveal the diverse capability of this technique in small molecule synthesis, patterned material fabrication and patterned chemical modification.",2
Single cells and intracellular processes studied by a plasmonic-based electrochemical impedance microscopy.,"Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is a crucial tool for the detection and study of various biological substances, from DNA and proteins to viruses and bacteria. It does not require any labelling species, and methods based on it have been developed to study cellular processes (such as cell spreading, adhesion, invasion, toxicology and mobility). However, data have so far lacked spatial information, which is essential for investigating heterogeneous processes and imaging high-throughput microarrays. Here, we report an electrochemical impedance microscope based on surface plasmon resonance that resolves local impedance with submicrometre spatial resolution. We have used an electrochemical impedance microscope to monitor the dynamics of cellular processes (apoptosis and electroporation of individual cells) with millisecond time resolution. The high spatial and temporal resolution makes it possible to study individual cells, but also resolve subcellular structures and processes without labels, and with excellent detection sensitivity (~2 pS). We also describe a model that simulates cellular and electrochemical impedance microscope images based on local dielectric constant and conductivity.",2
An AAAA-DDDD quadruple hydrogen-bond array.,"Secondary electrostatic interactions between adjacent hydrogen bonds can have a significant effect on the stability of a supramolecular complex. In theory, the binding strength should be maximized if all the hydrogen-bond donors (D) are on one component and all the hydrogen-bond acceptors (A) are on the other. Here, we describe a readily accessible AAAA-DDDD quadruple hydrogen-bonding array that exhibits exceptionally strong binding for a small-molecule hydrogen-bonded complex in a range of different solvents (K(a) > 3 x 10(12) M(-1) in CH2Cl2, 1.5 x 10(6) M(-1) in CH3CN and 3.4 x 10(5) M(-1) in 10% v/v DMSO/CHCl3). The association constant in CH2Cl2 corresponds to a binding free energy (DeltaG) in excess of -71 kJ mol(-1) (more than 20% of the thermodynamic stability of a carbon-carbon covalent bond), which is remarkable for a supramolecular complex held together by just four intercomponent hydrogen bonds.",2
Palladium-mediated intracellular chemistry.,"Many important intracellular biochemical reactions are modulated by transition metals, typically in the form of metalloproteins. The ability to carry out selective transformations inside a cell would allow researchers to manipulate or interrogate innumerable biological processes. Here, we show that palladium nanoparticles trapped within polystyrene microspheres can enter cells and mediate a variety of Pd(0)-catalysed reactions, such as allylcarbamate cleavage and Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling. The work provides the basis for the customization of heterogeneous unnatural catalysts as tools to carry out artificial chemistries within cells. Such in cellulo synthesis has potential for a plethora of applications ranging from cellular labelling to synthesis of modulators or inhibitors of cell function.",2
Controlled folding of synthetic polymer chains through the formation of positionable covalent bridges.,"Covalent bridges play a crucial role in the folding process of sequence-defined biopolymers. This feature, however, has not been recreated in synthetic polymers because, apart from some simple regular arrangements (such as block co-polymers), these macromolecules generally do not exhibit a controlled primary structure--that is, it is difficult to predetermine precisely the sequence of their monomers. Herein, we introduce a versatile strategy for preparing foldable linear polymer chains. Well-defined polymers were synthesized by the atom transfer radical polymerization of styrene. The controlled addition of discrete amounts of protected maleimide at precise times during the synthesis enabled the formation of polystyrene chains that contained positionable reactive alkyne functions. Intramolecular reactions between these functions subsequently led to the formation of different types of covalently folded polymer chains. For example, tadpole (P-shaped), pseudocyclic (Q-shaped), bicyclic (8-shaped) and knotted (alpha-shaped) macromolecular origamis were prepared in a relatively straightforward manner.",2
DNA charge transport over 34 nm.,"Molecular wires show promise in nanoscale electronics, but the synthesis of uniform, long conductive molecules is a significant challenge. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of precise length, by contrast, is synthesized easily, but its conductivity over the distances required for nanoscale devices has not been explored. Here we demonstrate DNA charge transport (CT) over 34 nm in 100-mer monolayers on gold. Multiplexed gold electrodes modified with 100-mer DNA yield sizable electrochemical signals from a distal, covalent Nile Blue redox probe. Significant signal attenuation upon incorporation of a single base-pair mismatch demonstrates that CT is DNA-mediated. Efficient cleavage of these 100-mers by a restriction enzyme indicates that the DNA adopts a native conformation accessible to protein binding. Similar electron-transfer rates measured through 100-mer and 17-mer monolayers are consistent with rate-limiting electron tunnelling through the saturated carbon linker. This DNA-mediated CT distance of 34 nm surpasses that of most reports of molecular wires.",2
Multiphoton photoresists giving nanoscale resolution that is inversely dependent on exposure time.,"Recent advances in materials science have made it possible to perform photolithography at the nanoscale using visible light. One approach to visible-light nanolithography (resolution augmentation through photo-induced deactivation) uses a negative-tone photoresist incorporating a radical photoinitiator that can be excited by two-photon absorption. With subsequent absorption of light, the photoinitiator can also be deactivated before polymerization occurs. This deactivation step can therefore be used for spatial limitation of photopatterning. In previous work, continuous-wave light was used for the deactivation step in such photoresists. Here we identify three broad classes of photoinitiators for which deactivation is efficient enough to be accomplished by the ultrafast excitation pulses themselves. The remarkable properties of these initiators result in the inverse scaling of lithographic feature size with exposure time. By combining different photoinitiators it is further possible to create a photoresist for which the resolution is independent of exposure over a broad range of fabrication speeds.",2
Diverting non-haem iron catalysed aliphatic C-H hydroxylations towards desaturations.,"Carboxylate-ligated, non-haem iron enzymes demonstrate the capacity for catalysing such remarkable processes as hydroxylations, chlorinations and desaturations of inert, aliphatic C-H bonds. A key to functional diversity is the enzymes' ability to divert fleeting radicals towards different types of functionalization using active site and/or substrate modifications. We report that a non-haem iron hydroxylase catalyst [Fe(PDP)] can also be diverted to catalytic, mixed hydroxylase/desaturase activity with aliphatic C-H bonds. Using a taxane-based radical trap that rearranges under Fe(PDP) oxidation to furnish a nortaxane skeleton, we provide the first direct evidence for a substrate radical using this class of stereoretentive hydroxylation catalysts. Hydroxylation and desaturation proceed by means of a short-lived radical that diverges in a substrate-dependent manner in the presence of carboxylic acids. The novel biomimetic reactivity displayed by this small molecule catalyst is harnessed to diversify natural product derivatives as well as interrogate their biosynthetic pathways.",2
High-efficiency dye-sensitized solar cells with ferrocene-based electrolytes.,"Dye-sensitized solar cells based on iodide/triiodide (I(-)/I(3)(-)) electrolytes are viable low-cost alternatives to conventional silicon solar cells. However, as well as providing record efficiencies of up to 12.0%, the use of I(-)/I(3)(-) in such solar cells also brings about certain limitations that stem from its corrosive nature and complex two-electron redox chemistry. Alternative redox mediators have been investigated, but these generally fall well short of matching the performance of conventional I(-)/I(3)(-) electrolytes. Here, we report energy conversion efficiencies of 7.5% (simulated sunlight, AM1.5, 1,000 W m(-2)) for dye-sensitized solar cells combining the archetypal ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc(+)) single-electron redox couple with a novel metal-free organic donor-acceptor sensitizer (Carbz-PAHTDTT). These Fc/Fc(+)-based devices exceed the efficiency achieved for devices prepared using I(-)/I(3)(-) electrolytes under comparable conditions, revealing the great potential of ferrocene-based electrolytes in future dye-sensitized solar cells applications. This improvement results from a more favourable matching of the redox potential of the ferrocene couple with that of the new donor-acceptor sensitizer.",2
Activating efficient phosphorescence from purely organic materials by crystal design.,"Phosphorescence is among the many functional features that, in practice, divide pure organic compounds from organometallics and inorganics. Considered to be practically non-phosphorescent, purely organic compounds (metal-free) are very rarely explored as emitters in phosphor applications, despite the emerging demand in this field. To defy this paradigm, we describe novel design principles to create purely organic materials demonstrating phosphorescence that can be turned on by incorporating halogen bonding into their crystals. By designing chromophores to contain triplet-producing aromatic aldehydes and triplet-promoting bromine, crystal-state halogen bonding can be made to direct the heavy atom effect to produce surprisingly efficient solid-state phosphorescence. When this chromophore is diluted into the crystal of a bi-halogenated, non-carbonyl analogue, ambient phosphorescent quantum yields reach 55%. Here, using this design, a series of pure organic phosphors are colour-tuned to emit blue, green, yellow and orange. From this initial discovery, a directed heavy atom design principle is demonstrated that will allow for the development of bright and practical purely organic phosphors.",2
Synthetic organic spin chemistry for structurally well-defined open-shell graphene fragments.,"Graphene, a two-dimensional layer of sp(2)-hybridized carbon atoms, can be viewed as a sheet of benzene rings fused together. Three benzene rings can be combined in three different ways, to yield linear anthracene and angular phenanthrene, where the rings share two C-C bonds, and the phenalenyl structure where three C-C bonds are shared between the rings. This third structure contains an uneven number of carbon atoms and, hence, in its neutral state, an uneven number of electrons--that is, it is a radical. All three structures may be viewed as being sections of graphene. Extension of this concept leads to an entire family of phenalenyl derivatives--'open-shell graphene fragments'--that are of substantial interest from the standpoint of fundamental science as well as in view of their potential applications in materials chemistry, in particular quantum electronic devices. Here we discuss current trends and challenges in this field.",2
Give silver a shine.,"Katharina M. Fromm explains how, as well as catalysis and jewellery, silver serves a myriad of medicinal applications--some of which are even behind poetic traditions such as throwing coins in wishing wells.",2
Ion mobility-mass spectrometry reveals a conformational conversion from random assembly to beta-sheet in amyloid fibril formation.,"Amyloid cascades that lead to peptide beta-sheet fibrils and plaques are central to many important diseases. Recently, intermediate assemblies of these cascades were identified as the toxic agents that interact with cellular machinery. The location and cause of the transformation from a natively unstructured assembly to the beta-sheet oligomers found in all fibrils is important in understanding disease onset and the development of therapeutic agents. Largely, research on this early oligomeric region was unsuccessful because all the traditional techniques measure only the average oligomer properties of the ensemble. We utilized ion-mobility methods to deduce the peptide self-assembly mechanism and examined a series of amyloid-forming peptides clipped from larger peptides or proteins associated with disease. We provide unambiguous evidence for structural transitions in each of these fibril-forming peptide systems and establish the potential of this method for the development of therapeutic agents and drug evaluation.",2
Catalytic dehydroaromatization of n-alkanes by pincer-ligated iridium complexes.,"Aromatic hydrocarbons are among the most important building blocks in the chemical industry. Benzene, toluene and xylenes are obtained from the high temperature thermolysis of alkanes. Higher alkylaromatics are generally derived from arene-olefin coupling, which gives branched products--that is, secondary alkyl arenes--with olefins higher than ethylene. The dehydrogenation of acyclic alkanes to give alkylaromatics can be achieved using heterogeneous catalysts at high temperatures, but with low yields and low selectivity. We present here the first catalytic conversion of n-alkanes to alkylaromatics using homogeneous or molecular catalysts--specifically 'pincer'-ligated iridium complexes--and olefinic hydrogen acceptors. For example, the reaction of n-octane affords up to 86% yield of aromatic product, primarily o-xylene and secondarily ethylbenzene. In the case of n-decane and n-dodecane, the resulting alkylarenes are exclusively unbranched (that is, n-alkyl-substituted), with selectivity for the corresponding o-(n-alkyl)toluene.",2
Strained endotaxial nanostructures with high thermoelectric figure of merit.,"Thermoelectric materials can directly generate electrical power from waste heat but the challenge is in designing efficient, stable and inexpensive systems. Nanostructuring in bulk materials dramatically reduces the thermal conductivity but simultaneously increases the charge carrier scattering, which has a detrimental effect on the carrier mobility. We have experimentally achieved concurrent phonon blocking and charge transmitting via the endotaxial placement of nanocrystals in a thermoelectric material host. Endotaxially arranged SrTe nanocrystals at concentrations as low as 2% were incorporated in a PbTe matrix doped with Na(2)Te. This effectively inhibits the heat flow in the system but does not affect the hole mobility, allowing a large power factor to be achieved. The crystallographic alignment of SrTe and PbTe lattices decouples phonon and electron transport and this allows the system to reach a thermoelectric figure of merit of 1.7 at ~800 K.",2
Supramolecular fishing for plasma membrane proteins using an ultrastable synthetic host-guest binding pair.,"Membrane proteomics, the large-scale global analysis of membrane proteins, is often constrained by the efficiency of separating and extracting membrane proteins. Recent approaches involve conjugating membrane proteins with the small molecule biotin and using the receptor streptavidin to extract the labelled proteins. Despite the many advantages of this method, several shortcomings remain, including potential contamination by endogenously biotinylated molecules and interference by streptavidin during analytical stages. Here, we report a supramolecular fishing method for membrane proteins using the synthetic receptor-ligand pair cucurbit[7]uril-1-trimethylammoniomethylferrocene (CB[7]-AFc). CB[7]-conjugated beads selectively capture AFc-labelled proteins from heterogeneous protein mixtures, and AFc-labelling of cells results in the efficient capture of membrane proteins by these beads. The captured proteins can be recovered easily at room temperature by treatment with a strong competitor such as 1,1'-bis(trimethylammoniomethyl)ferrocene. This synthetic but biocompatible host-guest system may be a useful alternative to streptavidin-biotin for membrane proteomics as well as other biological and biotechnological applications.",2
